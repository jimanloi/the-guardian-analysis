Residents of the home were startled by a loud crash at about 8.30pm Thursday night and saw the bears coming in through the sliding door which had been left ajar. The 74-year-old man tried to shoo the adult female bear out with a kitchen chair, but it knocked him into a wall and clawed at him, the wildlife agency said. The bear charged and swiped at the man, injured the man\u2019s head, neck, arms, shoulder, abdomen and calf before he and the other residents escaped to a bedroom and locked themselves in. A sheriff\u2019s deputy for Lake City, a south-western Colorado town of 400 people, chased the bears out, and medical responders treated the man at his house.

The man\u2019s injuries were significant, but he didn\u2019t need to go to a hospital, Colorado parks and wildlife said in a statement Saturday. State wildlife managers found the four bears in trees near the man\u2019s house and killed them, a standard practice to stop problem bears that associate people with food. \u201cIt creates a very complex situation to mitigate,\u201d Martin said. \u201cUnfortunately cub bears that are taught these behaviors by their mother may result in generations of conflict between bears and people.\u201d Bears are common in and around Lake City and the wildlife agency had been made aware of other reports of bears breaking into unoccupied homes and garages in the area throughout the summer and early fall.

      "bodyText": "Baby boomers and people in their 50s are living longer but are in worse health than previous generations were at the same age, despite advances in medicine and greater awareness of healthy lifestyles, a global study shows. Researchers found people in their 50s, 60s and 70s were more likely to have serious health problems than people who were born before or during the second world war when they reached that age. The results cannot be explained by people living longer, experts at the University of Oxford and University College London (UCL) said. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease and other diseases were all affecting people at younger ages. Rates of illness and disability increased across successive generations during the last century, according to the findings published in the Journals of Gerontology. The lead author, Laura Gimeno, of UCL, said there was a \u201cgenerational health drift\u201d, with younger generations tending to have worse health than previous generations at the same age. \u201cEven with advances in medicine and greater public awareness about healthy living, people born since 1945 are at greater risk of chronic illness and disability than their predecessors. \u201cWith up to a fifth of the population in high-income western nations now over 65, increasing demands for health and social care will have huge implications on government spending.\u201d Researchers analysed health data for more than 100,000 people between 2004 and 2018, covering several generations of people aged 50 and above across England, the US and Europe. They found increasing rates of chronic disease, especially when comparing people born between 1936 and 1945 and those born from 1955 to 1959. Rates of chronic disease rose across successive generations in all regions, with more recently born adults more likely to have cancer, lung disease, heart issues, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol than their predecessors at the same age. Although prevalence of type 2 diabetes rose at the same rate across all regions, diagnoses of cancer, heart problems and high cholesterol increased the most in England and Europe, with baby boomers and people in their 50s being 1.5 times more likely to have these issues than their predecessors at the same age. Levels of grip strength, a good measure of overall muscle strength and healthy ageing, decreased across generations in England and the US, but either increased or remained constant in Europe. Most people in postwar generations were just as likely or more likely than their predecessors to struggle with tasks such as bathing, eating, walking short distances and shopping for groceries. \u201cOur study finds concerning new evidence that more recently born generations are experiencing worsening health as they enter their later years,\u201d Gimeno said. \u201cDespite declining rates of disability for the prewar generations, chronic disease and increasing obesity may be spilling over into severe disability for the baby boomers. \u201cIf life expectancy remains stable or continues to increase, these worrying trends may see younger generations spending more years in poor health and living with disability.\u201d",

Their son Johnny (Eimhin Fitzgerald Doherty) watches on twitchily until the plotline involving republican vengeance snaps into play.</p> <p>Director Matthew Warchus has gathered a talented cast, from Smith-Cameron as a formidably watchable presence to Rylance as her peacocking husband. They are never less than entertaining but the show does not stretch them, and the drama of the first two acts is a little too ambling and creaky, with the broad Irish accents and comic dissolution.</p> <p>Jack, who proclaims to have been a sea captain, is as much a fantasist and self-mythologiser as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/26/jerusalem-review-jez-butterworth-rooster-byron-watermill-newbury\">Jerusalem\u2019s Rooster</a>, it seems, and Rylance is delightfully Chaplinesque in the comic physicality of his drunkenness. He makes an entertaining double-act with Paul Hilton as Jack\u2019s wastrel friend Joxer, but even when the latter is not around, he seems like a comic duo in one, staggering more than walking and playing glintingly to the audience for laughs.</p>    <p>O\u2019Casey\u2019s trilogy contains strong women and Juno is one of them, although she is not romanticised. Smith-Cameron really is the heart and soul of this production, for all of Rylance\u2019s charisma. Juno is the foil to Jack\u2019s clownishness and when the tone flips to tragedy, Smith-Cameron is tremendous. Kearns does wonders with her part as Mary too, although Johnny feels rather insignificant.</p> <p>There are songs and music when the Boyles begin their carousing after the promise of money from a relative\u2019s will. Beneath the bonhomie are O\u2019Casey\u2019s poetry, and the family\u2019s craving to be somewhere they are not known, but this production does not dwell too long on these.</p> <p>The war outside enters the home through Rob Howell\u2019s set, which looks as if a strip has been torn out of it, and has blood-soaked red light above a sketched house below. The family\u2019s poverty is conveyed through the sparseness of their furnishing at the start, with a table, fire grate and, importantly, a dangling crucifix to which characters speak beseechingly or in accusation over their terrible losses.</p> <p>When the plot turns dark, the stage cracks open to an expressionistic setting and it is a magnificent moment. The tragedy feels late but it is impressive in the impact of its turning point. \u201cTake away this murdering hate,\u201d Juno says in front of the crucifix when the war reaches her home, and her prayer sounds all the more tragic for the decades of Ireland\u2019s sectarian hate yet to come.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://junoandthepaycock.com/\">Gielgud theatre, London</a>, until 23 November</p>",

Director Matthew Warchus has gathered a talented cast, from Smith-Cameron as a formidably watchable presence to Rylance as her peacocking husband. They are never less than entertaining but the show does not stretch them, and the drama of the first two acts is a little too ambling and creaky, with the broad Irish accents and comic dissolution. Jack, who proclaims to have been a sea captain, is as much a fantasist and self-mythologiser as Jerusalem\u2019s Rooster, it seems, and Rylance is delightfully Chaplinesque in the comic physicality of his drunkenness. He makes an entertaining double-act with Paul Hilton as Jack\u2019s wastrel friend Joxer, but even when the latter is not around, he seems like a comic duo in one, staggering more than walking and playing glintingly to the audience for laughs. O\u2019Casey\u2019s trilogy contains strong women and Juno is one of them, although she is not romanticised. Smith-Cameron really is the heart and soul of this production, for all of Rylance\u2019s charisma. Juno is the foil to Jack\u2019s clownishness and when the tone flips to tragedy, Smith-Cameron is tremendous. Kearns does wonders with her part as Mary too, although Johnny feels rather insignificant. There are songs and music when the Boyles begin their carousing after the promise of money from a relative\u2019s will. Beneath the bonhomie are O\u2019Casey\u2019s poetry, and the family\u2019s craving to be somewhere they are not known, but this production does not dwell too long on these. The war outside enters the home through Rob Howell\u2019s set, which looks as if a strip has been torn out of it, and has blood-soaked red light above a sketched house below. The family\u2019s poverty is conveyed through the sparseness of their furnishing at the start, with a table, fire grate and, importantly, a dangling crucifix to which characters speak beseechingly or in accusation over their terrible losses. When the plot turns dark, the stage cracks open to an expressionistic setting and it is a magnificent moment. The tragedy feels late but it is impressive in the impact of its turning point. \u201cTake away this murdering hate,\u201d Juno says in front of the crucifix when the war reaches her home, and her prayer sounds all the more tragic for the decades of Ireland\u2019s sectarian hate yet to come. \u2022 At Gielgud theatre, London, until 23 November",

      "bodyText": "The number of irregular migrants living in the UK and other large European countries has not changed for years despite hostile political discourse about migrants overwhelming the continent, according to researchers. Migration researchers from 18 of the world\u2019s leading universities and research organisations including the University of Oxford have released the public database as part of the MIrreM project, which measures irregular migration. They said it is impossible to produce completely accurate data due to some people living below the radar for fear of immigration enforcement, but the methodology used is likely to produce more accurate estimates than previous research has done. The researchers found there were between 2.6 and 3.2 million irregular migrants living in 12 European countries, including the UK, between 2016 and 2023, representing less than 1% of the total population of these countries. Overall, the irregular migrant population across the European countries does not appear to have definitively changed since 2008. The estimated number of irregular migrants in the UK including trafficking victims and undocumented migrants, is between 594,000 and 745,000, according to the report. The database significantly updates previous assessments of the irregular migrant population in Europe, such as the estimates by the Clandestino research project dating back to 2008 and a study by Pew Research Centre in 2019 and offers new information at a time when there have been fundamental changes in the European migration landscape. Irregular migration has been a key issue in successive elections in the UK and other European countries in recent years with politicians pledging to clamp down on immigration. This tends to be in response to a belief among many voters that too many migrants are arriving via clandestine means such as dinghies or concealing themselves in the backs of lorries. The new data challenges those perceptions. In 2008, Clandestino estimated the irregular migrant population of 12 European countries at 1.8m to 3.8m. The MIrreM project increases the low estimate by 780,000 and decreases the high estimate by 460,000, creating a clearer picture of the total irregular migrant population in the countries studied. The United States, which the new research used as a comparator, has the largest estimated irregular migrant population in terms of absolute numbers. Finland has the smallest estimated irregular migrant population in terms of its size. Compared with 2008 estimates, research from MIrreM indicates that in three countries, the new estimates suggest greater numbers \u2013 Austria, Germany and Spain. In five countries, the estimated irregular migrant population remained the same \u2013 Belgium, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. In five countries, it declined \u2013 Finland, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands and Poland. Michele LeVoy, director of the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants, said the new data could help design policies for this often hard-to-reach group. \u201cEstimating how many people are living in an irregular situation in Europe must be used to design inclusive policies that grant access to public services for this marginalised population, and that offer them pathways out of irregularity. Undocumented people are already part and parcel of our societies and it\u2019s high time that Europe recognised this.\u201d Louise Calvey, director of the charity Asylum Matters, welcomed the report. \u201cThe \u2018migration crisis\u2019 has been manufactured by failed governments and political leaders,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve used this narrative to justify the most pernicious anti-migrant policies our country has ever seen, closing safe routes, closing the asylum system and leaving people stuck in an unending legal purgatory. \u201cThis report should be foundational to the Labour government\u2019s approach to asylum and migration; work globally to build a fair and safe system of migration, treat people with dignity and respect, stop punishing people for needing to be here.\u201d The report comes as Home Office figures showed a total of 973 migrants in 17 small boats crossed the Channel to the UK on Saturday \u2013 the same day four people died \u2013 making it the busiest day of the year so far. The arrivals brings the total for the year to 26,612 compared with 25,330 by the same date last year and 33,611 in 2022, with 1,368 having made the journey on Friday and Saturday combined, according to Home Office figures. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 October 2024. The research does not include asylum seekers among irregular migrants as stated in an earlier version.",

The policy, which was introduced by George Osborne when he was chancellor, means low-income parents are denied key benefits, including universal credit, for their third and any subsequent children born from April 2017. The Labour government has so far resisted pressure to scrap the policy, with the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, reluctant to take on the \u201cunfunded pledge\u201d without citing where the \u00a33bn annual cost would come from. However, the data from the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) lays bare the significant impact of the cap, showing \u201c10,000 children have been pulled into poverty by the two-child limit since the government took office\u201d in early July.

A leading rightwing thinktank, Onward, had called for an end to the two-child limit on benefits, noting the wider two-child limit and the higher earner threshold applying specifically to child benefit should be abandoned in order to support parents. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said this would come at an initial cost of \u00a31.7bn a year to the government, rising to \u00a32.5bn a year. The IFS said: \u201cAmong the options available to the government on benefits policy, removing the two-child limit would be the single most cost-effective policy at reducing the number of children classified as in poverty.\u201d But it warned that any gains from scrapping that policy would be partly or fully wiped out for 70,000 of the poorest households who would be subject to the household benefit cap. The household benefit cap, introduced in 2013 under the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government as a way of \u201crestoring fairness to the welfare state\u201d reduces the amount of benefits some households receive to ensure claimants do not receive more than the cap limit.

But on Sunday, Israel issued a new blanket evacuation order for all of the northern Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands of civilians remain, as a military spokesperson declared a \u201cnew phase of the war\u201d against Hamas. Local aid workers said the mosque, which was near al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, had housed people who had been displaced in earlier bombing raids. The Israeli military claimed that the mosque had been a \u201cHamas command post\u201d. Netanyahu visited troops near the Lebanese border on Sunday for the first time and declared that Israel would \u201cemerge victorious\u201d in the conflict, as European leaders including Keir Starmer issued renewed calls for a ceasefire to halt the simultaneous wars in Lebanon and Gaza that have killed more than 42,000 people in the last year. Late on Sunday night, Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs came under renewed Israeli bombing with large fireballs and loud booms over the darkened skyline. Israeli attacks in the area, which is a stronghold for the Shia militia Hezbollah, have continued at such a high pace that rescue workers have been unable to access the area for days. Earlier on Sunday, an IDF spokesperson issued an \u201curgent warning to the residents of the southern suburbs to leave these areas. In the early hours of Monday, Hezbollah said it had targeted an Israeli military base near the northern city of Haifa. Israeli media reported 10 people were injured, while police said that some buildings and properties were damaged. Elsewhere in Israel, one woman was killed and 10 people were wounded in the suspected terror attack at the central bus station in Be\u2019er Sheva, a city in the Negev desert in southern Israel. The assailant, identified as Ahmad al-Uqbi, 29, was killed by police. Photos and video posted on social media showed images of at least one person lying on the ground in a pool of blood next to a McDonald\u2019s close to the bus station. In another video, gunshots could be heard as law enforcement officers ran through the station toward the shooting. After the attack, Miri Regev, Israel\u2019s transportation minister, wrote that the family of the suspected attacker should be deported from the country. \u201cThe time has come for a deterrent punishment that prevents attacks on Israeli territory,\u201d she wrote on X. As part of Monday\u2019s commemorations for the Hamas attack, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and about 250 taken hostage, the president, Isaac Herzog, said he would conduct a three-day tour of the border communities along Gaza, beginning at the site of the Nova music festival near the Re\u2019im kibbutz, where 364 people were killed. Israel\u2019s ensuing invasion of Gaza has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, including at least 16,000 children. As the anniversary of 7 October neared, Hamas on Sunday praised the attack as \u201cglorious\u201d. \u201cThe crossing of the glorious 7 October shattered the illusions the enemy had created for itself, convincing the world and the region of its supposed superiority and capabilities,\u201d Qatar-based Hamas member Khalil al-Hayya said in a video statement. The anticipated retaliation against Iran follows a strike by Tehran that included more than 180 missiles, according to Israel, and managed to hit a crucial airbase more than 30 times. Speaking on Sunday, Yoav Gallant, the Israeli minister of defence, said the bombing had not affected the air force\u2019s ability to operate, and vowed that Israel would strike back against Iran at a time of its choosing. \u201cThe Iranians did not touch the air force\u2019s capabilities \u2013 no aircraft was damaged, no squadron was taken out of order,\u201d Gallant said during a visit to the Nevatim airbase. He added: \u201cWhoever thinks that a mere attempt to harm us will deter us from taking action should take a look at [Israel\u2019s campaigns] in Gaza and Beirut.\u201d Meanwhile, Netanyahu visited troops from the 36th division, one of two divisions sent there for combat operations, along the Lebanese border. In remarks, the prime minister said he wished to \u201cextend my deepest condolences to the families of our heroes who fell today in Lebanon\u201d. Israel has said dozens of its soldiers have been injured in Lebanon in the last week of combat, while Hezbollah claimed to have killed 20 soldiers over this weekend. \u201cWe\u2019re in the heat of a gruelling war against Iran\u2019s axis of evil, aimed at destroying us,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cThat will not happen, because we shall stand together, and with God\u2019s help, we shall emerge victorious together.\u201d Iran\u2019s foreign minister on Saturday warned that Tehran would retaliate if attacked by Israel. \u201cOur reaction to any attack by the Zionist regime is completely clear,\u201d Abbas Araghchi told reporters during a trip to Syria. \u201cFor every action, there will be a proportional and similar reaction from Iran, and even stronger.\u201d",

Here is a summary of today\u2019s key developments: Kamala Harris\u2019s interview on Call Her Daddy with Alex Cooper aired on Sunday. The host, whose podcast targets a diverse set of audiences, and the vice-president discussed issues revolving around abortion, reproductive healthcare, housing and student debt relief. Donald Trump delivered his roughly two-hour speech at a rally in Juneau, Wisconsin. The former president was standing behind barriers of bulletproof glass, which is now a standard US Secret Service practice at outdoor rallies. Arizona senator Mark Kelly criticized Elon Musk during an interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union for supporting Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania this weekend. President Joe Biden ordered 500 more troops to assist with Hurricane Helene relief efforts. The troops will move into western North Carolina and assist with the response and recovery efforts after the deadly and devastating Hurricane Helene. Tim Walz said during his appearance on Fox News this morning that Donald Trump\u2019s agenda would destroy the US economy, while he supported Kamala Harris\u2019s plan to lower costs and stimulate job growth. Kamala Harris finished her interview with Call Her Daddy\u2019s Alex Cooper by pledging to fight for student debt relief and listing key issues she hopes to address if she\u2019s elected president. \u201cI care about making sure that people are entitled to and receive the freedoms that they are due,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI care about lifting people up and making sure that you are protected from harm. I care about tapping into the ambitions and the aspirations of people knowing that we are capable of so much.\u201d Alex Cooper and Kamala Harris discussed JD Vance\u2019s age-old sexist \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d trope, but Harris was asked what she would do as president to help generations who feel that the economy hinders them from having children. \u201cHousing is too expensive and we need to increase the housing supply,\u201d Harris said. \u201cPart of my plan is to work with home builders in the private sector to create tax incentives to build by the end of my first term, 3,000,000 more housing units.\u201d \u201cPart of my plan is to give 100 million more people who basically are middle class working people, tax cuts, including for young parents, a $6,000 tax cut for the first year of their child\u2019s life, which helps them buy a crib or a car seat or clothing and just get through that first year,\u2019\u201d she added. During an episode of the podcast Call Her Daddy, Kamala Harris condemned Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders after Sanders said that the presidential candidate \u201cdoesn\u2019t have anything keeping her humble\u201d because she doesn\u2019t have children. \u201cI don\u2019t think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble,\u201d Harris said during the podcast. The vice-president discussed her relationship with her stepchildren, Cole and Ella Emhoff, who are the biological children from her husband\u2019s, Doug Emhoff, first marriage. \u201cWe have our family by blood and then we have our family by love. And I have both,\u201d Harris said. Kamala Harris was asked by Alex Cooper if she could think about any law that \u201cgives the government the power to make a decision about a man\u2019s body\u201d. Harris laughed and said: \u201cWe are a work in progress.\u201d \u201cPart of the strength of our country and our evolution as a country has been through the fight for the expansion of rights. Not the restriction of rights,\u201d she added. Alex Cooper asked Kamala Harris to clarify a claim former president Donald Trump made during last month\u2019s presidential debate, where he falsely claimed that Democrats support abortions \u201cafter birth\u201d and \u201cexecuting\u201d babies. \u201cThat is not happening anywhere in the United States,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt is not happening and it\u2019s a lie.\u201d She also labeled as \u201cinsulting\u201d his claim that women in their ninth month of pregnancy are electing to have an abortion. Kamala Harris and Alex Cooper continued to discuss abortion rights and reproductive healthcare during a Call Her Daddy episode aired on Sunday. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to abandon your faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn\u2019t be telling her what to do,\u201d Harris said in the podcast. Harris added: \u201cWhat\u2019s so outrageous about it is a bunch of these guys up in these state capitals are writing these decisions because they somehow have decided that they\u2019re in a better position to tell you what\u2019s in your best interest than you are to know what\u2019s in your own best interest.\u201d Kamala Harris condemned former president Donald Trump for calling himself the \u201cprotector\u201d of women at a rally in Pennsylvania. \u201cThis is the same guy who said that women should be punished for having abortions,\u201d Harris said on Alex Cooper\u2019s podcast Call Her Daddy. Harris went on to talk about the state of abortion access currently in the country. \u201cThe majority of women who receive abortion care are mothers,\u201d Harris said. \u201cEvery state in the South except for Virginia has an abortion ban.\u201d Kamala Harris responded to questions from Call Her Daddy\u2019s Alex Cooper, elaborating on why she decided to become a prosecutor, the guidelines for reporting sexual assault, and the need to talk about the issue more. In her interview with Kamala Harris, Alex Cooper asked the vice-president about the lessons she learned from her mother regarding mental health, the ways she has taken accountability during her vice-presidency, and what she thinks her mother would say if she became the next president of the United States. Later on, Cooper referenced some of the harsh descriptions former president Donald Trump has used against Harris during the race, including questioning her mental health. She asked Harris how this affected her. Harris said: I think it\u2019s really important not to let other people define you, and usually those people who will attempt to do it don\u2019t know you. Donald Trump finished his remarks in Juneau, Wisconsin, which ran for about two hours. During her interview with Kamala Harris, Call Her Daddy host Alex Cooper quickly touched on a soft spot for the Harris campaign, which is the vice-president\u2019s lack of interviews with the media. She asked Harris why she decided to come on the podcast. \u201cI think you and your listeners have really got this thing, right, which is one of the best ways to communicate with people is to be real, you know, and to talk about the things that people really care about,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhat I love about what you do is that your voice in your show is really about your listeners,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think especially now, this is a moment in the country and in life where people really want to know they\u2019re seen and heard and that they\u2019re part of a community, that they\u2019re not out there alone.\u201d The host of the comedy and advice podcast Call Her Daddy, Alex Cooper, said at the start of her episode with Kamala Harris that she invited former president Donald Trump to come on the show. \u201cIf he also wants to have a meaningful, in-depth conversation about women\u2019s rights in this country, then he is welcome on Call Her Daddy anytime,\u201d Cooper said. Kamala Harris\u2019s interview on Call Her Daddy with Alex Cooper just dropped. The host, who targets a diverse set of audiences, begins the episode by explaining to her listeners why she decided to interview the vice-president. \u201cAs you guys know, I do not usually discuss politics or have politicians on the show,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I couldn\u2019t see a world in which one of the main conversations in this election is women, and I\u2019m not a part of it.\u201d Trump brought Dodge county sheriff Dale Schmidt to the stage, along with a group of other Wisconsin sheriffs. \u201cI am proud to announce that all of these sheriffs are among a very small amount of sheriffs and law enforcement across our country that support you,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cIn Dodge county, in this 2024 election, there are zero drop boxes for the election,\u201d the sheriff said proudly. Eric Hovde, Republican Senate candidate in Wisconsin took the stage during Trump\u2019s rally. Hovde attacked his rival Tammy Baldwin and said: \u201cAll of you go work hard, go grab every friend, colleague, neighbor, and let\u2019s restore this great country and get President Trump and me to Washington.\u201d Trump also invited Republican senator Ron Johnson to the stage. He congratulated Trump for his alliance with the ex-independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr. \u201cWe are actually going through a huge problem with chronic health and children\u2019s health, but you are right about the enemy within. They are dividing us. They are destroying this nation. And by aligning with Bobby Kennedy, you are setting the example,\u201d Johnson said. Kennedy has been campaigning for Trump since he ended his own independent presidential bid to support the Republican nominee. Donald Trump baselessly linked inflation and the country\u2019s economic woes to the influx of migrants in the US. He falsely claimed leaders in other countries are emptying their jails and sending inmates to the US. He later presented a chart that shows the rate of migrant entries in the US, suggesting a decline during his presidency. \u201cI kiss it every night,\u201d Trump said about his chart. \u201cI take it to bed with me every single night.\u201d Donald Trump called Wisconsin governor Tony Evers a \u201clousy governor\u201d. \u201cI hate to say it with your Democrat governor, you have some of the highest electricity prices, and highest energy costs is just about at the top in Wisconsin,\u201d Trump said. He then said he plans to double the electricity production for the development of artificial intelligence. \u201cWe need tremendous electric here so that other people that are into this whole world of this, it\u2019s a new world, but it\u2019s going to be a very big world, a very fascinating world,\u201d he said about the field of AI. Donald Trump attacked Kamala Harris\u2019s tax policy, calling her a \u201ctax queen\u201d and misleading attendees with a claim that Harris plans to raise taxes on US families. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen somebody that openly campaigns on the fact that they\u2019re going to raise taxes,\u201d Trump said. He then showed a campaign ad, composed of a compilation of clips of Harris saying wants to raise taxes. In reality, Harris has said she plans to cut corporate tax rates. Donald Trump said rifle owners and the Christian community don\u2019t vote \u201cas much as they should\u201d. \u201cEvangelicals don\u2019t vote that much, and if they did vote, we could never lose an election,\u201d he said. Donald Trump claimed that the media favors Kamala Harris in their coverage and they \u201chate our country\u201d. He continued to make anti-immigrant and transphobic comments. \u201cI can\u2019t understand. Why do they want open borders? Why do they want sex change operations for people that are too young to even think about it? Why do they want men playing in women\u2019s sports?\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe actually are now the party of common sense,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what I like calling us now, party of common sense.\u201d The former president called Elon Musk a \u201cgood guy\u201d a day after the SpaceX founder made an appearance at Trump\u2019s rally on Saturday. He also attacked his rival Kamala Harris, calling her \u201cgrossly incompetent\u201d. \u201cKamala is not wonderful,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWith four more years of Kamala Harris, your long nightmare is just beginning.\u201d Donald Trump said the response to Hurricane Helene in the south-eastern US was \u201cprobably worse than Katrina\u201d, referring to the devastating storm in 2005. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to beat, right? Worse than Katrina. They didn\u2019t do too good a job, either,\u201d he said. Donald Trump called the Biden administration \u201cthe most corrupt people\u201d during his rally in Wisconsin. \u201cFrom the very beginning of this journey, I\u2019ve been on a mission to rescue our nation from a failed and corrupt political establishment and corrupt people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis country is in big trouble. We\u2019re a failing nation. We are a failing nation. We\u2019re a nation in decline. We\u2019re a nation in distress, and we\u2019re going to get it fixed very quickly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cJust 30 days from now, we\u2019re going to win the state of Wisconsin, we\u2019re going to defeat Kamala Harris,\u201d Trump said. He called his rally on Saturday an \u201cunbelievable evening\u201d, when he returned to Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of his assassination attempt. \u201cWe had 100,000 people, and there was love, and I had a fantastic\u2026 opera singer, and he went up and he sang \u2018Ave Maria\u2019,\u201d he said. Donald Trump started his speech on time in Juneau, Wisconsin. The former president is standing behind barriers of bulletproof glass, which is now a standard US Secret Service practice at outdoor rallies. We\u2019ll be following his remarks. Arkansas senator Tom Cotton dodged questions regarding the results of the 2020 elections during an interview with NBC News\u2019s Meet the Press, where he struggled to admit that Donald Trump lost the race. \u201cJoe Biden was elected president in 2020. It was an unfair election in many ways,\u201d Cotton said on Sunday. \u201cYou had states that were changing their election practices or election laws, sometimes in violation of their constitution.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden was elected president. Everything has gone to hell in a handbasket as a result,\u201d he added. Kamala Harris has embarked on a week-long media blitz, hurtling from TV studios and late-night shows to podcast interviews as she seeks to gain an edge over Donald Trump in the US election\u2019s key battleground states that remain nail-bitingly close. The vice-president\u2019s decision to face a raft of largely friendly media outlets came as the campaigns entered the final 30 days. More than 1.4 million Americans have already cast their ballots in early voting across 30 states. The Democratic nominee\u2019s whirlwind media tour has been carefully crafted for maximum reach and minimum risk. Harris has talked to the CBS News show 60 Minutes, along with the popular podcast Call Her Daddy. On Tuesday she hits the media capital, New York, for appearances on ABC News\u2019s daytime behemoth The View and the Howard Stern Show, followed by a recording with late-night host Stephen Colbert. The first of a flurry of comments from Harris was put out by 60 Minutes on Sunday before a full broadcast on Monday. Harris will appear alone, after Trump declined to be interviewed by the election special which has been a staple of US election coverage for more than half a century. In a short clip released by 60 Minutes, Harris was asked whether the Biden-Harris administration had any sway over the actions of Benjamin Netanyahu, the hardline prime minister of Israel who appears not to listen to Washington. Asked whether the US had a \u201creal close ally\u201d in Netanyahu, she replied: \u201cWith all due respect, the better question is: do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.\u201d Since Harris\u2019s meteoric propulsion as Democratic presidential nominee after Joe Biden stepped aside, her relative avoidance of press or TV interviews has become a point of contention on the campaign trail. Republican leaders and pundits on Fox News routinely accuse her of being media-shy. Here\u2019s more on Harris\u2019s media blitz: President Joe Biden said on Sunday he ordered another 500 active-duty troops to move into western North Carolina and assist with the response and recovery efforts after the deadly and devastating Hurricane Helene. \u201cWith a total of 1,500 troops now supplementing a robust on-the-ground effort - including more than 6,100 National Guardsmen and more than 7,000 Federal personnel - my administration is sparing no resource to support families as they begin their road to rebuilding,\u201d Biden said in a statement. He also said he was being briefed on tropical storm Milton as it strengthened across the Gulf of Mexico. Milton, which strengthened into a category one hurricane on Sunday, is expected to make landfall on Florida on Tuesday or Wednesday. California representative Adam Schiff said during an interview with NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that Donald Trump \u201cwill contest\u201d the election results if he loses. \u201cIf it is close, if Donald Trump loses again, as I expect that he will, he will contest it,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cHe has more reason to contest it than he did before, not because of any flaw in the election, but because Donald Trump believes, and perhaps with reason, that if he doesn\u2019t succeed at the ballot box, he may be going to jail. So he\u2019s going to challenge the results.\u201d Republican Senate candidate and former Maryland mayor Larry Hogan said during an interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union that if he\u2019s elected, he will not support cabinet or supreme court nominees who do not garner bipartisan support in the Senate. \u201cI would make that pledge. If we can\u2019t get any bipartisan buy-in, then I\u2019m not going to vote for that person,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Washington, we can\u2019t even seem to get one vote,\u201d Hogan added. \u201cIt\u2019s like Democrats will only vote for Democrats and Republicans will only vote for Republicans. If there\u2019s one place that we should not be playing politics, it\u2019s on appointments to the supreme court.\u201d The Charlotte Observer\u2019s editorial board published an op-ed titled: Shame on Donald Trump for worsening NC\u2019s Helene tragedy with political lies. On Monday, Trump accused the federal government and Democratic governor Roy Cooper of \u201cgoing out of their way to not help people in Republican areas. MAGA!\u201d Trump also said that the Biden administration has \u201cleft Americans to drown\u201d in North Carolina and other states. \u201cThis is not a situation to capitalize on for political gain,\u201d reads the op-ed. \u201cBut former President Donald Trump has politicized the situation at every turn, spreading falsehoods and conspiracies that fracture the community instead of bringing it together.\u201d Here\u2019s more context on some of the false claims made by Trump: Ahead of a rally by the Republic presidential nominee, Donald Trump, in Juneau, Wisconsin, a line began forming near the event venue at the Dodge county airport. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that attendees were greeted by a \u201clarger-than-life Trump inflatable with which some were taking photos\u201d. The former president\u2019s speech is scheduled for 2pm CT, buthe usually starts his speeches at least half an hour after the slated time. During an interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Arizona senator Mark Kelly criticized Elon Musk for supporting Donald Trump. On Saturday, Musk joined Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and made the baseless claim that if Trump\u2019s supporters fail to turn out, \u201cthis will be the last election\u201d. Kelly said that Musk was \u201chypocritically standing next to the guy that tried to overturn the last \u2013 the 2020 election on January 6, saying that this is somehow going to be the last election and they\u2019re going to take away your vote.\u201d \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t pass the logic test,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me, and it shouldn\u2019t be lost on the American people that Donald Trump, when he was president, gave a giant tax cut to billionaires,\u201d Kelly said during the interview. \u201cElon Musk is the richest person in the world. He\u2019s got a tremendous amount of interest in Donald Trump being elected president.\u201d Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has spent years saying the unsayable to entertain, goad and grab attention. But his pronouncements over the past few weeks have plumbed new depths of absurdity and incoherence. Trump, 78, increasingly slurs or stumbles over his words, raising fears over cognitive decline. He is slipping in polls against Kamala Harris and knows that defeat could lead to criminal trials and even prison. After a decade of dominating American politics, critics say, Trump could be in the throes of a final meltdown. His verbal output now is \u201cabsolute batshittery\u201d, according to Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill. \u201cThese are not the musings of a well-adjusted adult. He demonstrates daily how unfit he is to have the most powerful position in the world.\u201d Trump was mostly given a pass by the mainstream media, Setmayer added, because of the intense focus on Joe Biden\u2019s age and mental acuity when he was still running. \u201cNow the focus is solely on him because he is the oldest candidate in this race. His kookery is even more highlighted now than before because he is alone on an island with his deterioration.\u201d Trump has always thrown dead cats on tables, as the metaphor goes, offering his fans the thrill of transgression and watching with glee as liberals howl with outrage. His run for president in 2016 was characterised by racially divisive rhetoric and a constant stream of controversies that dominated news cycles and forced rival Hillary Clinton into reactive mode. Here\u2019s more on Trump\u2019s recent pronouncements: Speaker Mike Johnson sidestepped questions on the results of the 2020 race during an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos. \u201cIt\u2019s a gotcha game. You want us to litigate things that happened four years ago when we\u2019re talking about the future,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cJoe Biden has been the president for almost four years. Everybody needs to get over this and move forward,\u201d he added. Governor Tim Walz is expected to arrive at Santa Barbara, California, on Sunday to kick off a West Coast fundraising blitz on behalf of the Harris Victory Fund. The Democratic vice-presidential pick will make his way through California and Washington, delivering campaign remarks in cities along the coast. Walz is scheduled to deliver remarks at receptions in San Diego, Montecito, Los Angeles, and Sacramento before heading up to Washington. CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes will air an interview with Kamala Harris on Monday. The network released a sneak peek into the interview, where Bill Whitaker asked Harris if the US lacks influence over Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cThe aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhen we think about the threat that Hamas Hezbollah presents [and] Iran, I think that it is, without any question, our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks.\u201d During his appearance on Fox News this morning, Tim Walz said Donald Trump\u2019s agenda would destroy the American economy, while he supported Kamala Harris\u2019s plan to lower costs and stimulate job growth. \u201cWell, we saw a blockbuster jobs report this week,\u201d Walz said. \u201cWe saw interest rates come down, and we\u2019ve also seen that Vice-President Harris is laying out a middle-class agenda.\u201d He added: \u201cI was in Ohio yesterday, in Cleveland, in Cincinnati, and talking about this. Folks in Ohio know that Donald Trump\u2019s policies led to 180,000 manufacturing jobs leaving.\u201d Melania Trump was asked whether Donald Trump knew she would express strong support for abortion rights in her upcoming memoir, where she emphasized that women should have the autonomy to decide whether to have children based on their own convictions, without government interference or pressure. \u201cYes, he knew my position and my beliefs since the day we met, and I believe in individual freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to decide what I wanted to do with my body. I think I don\u2019t want government in my personal business,\u201d she added. Former first lady Melania Trump sat down with Fox News\u2019s Maria Bartiromo this morning, where she showed her unwavering support for her husband, Donald Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in polls. I never did,\u201d she said. \u201cI think in the end, people really see it, what\u2019s going on in the country and how this leadership is performing.\u201d The Democratic vice-presidential pick, Tim Walz, sat down with Fox News Sunday\u2019s Shannon Bream, where he discussed how the overturning of Roe v. Wade has affected women. \u201cThe real issue here is women being forced into miscarriages, women being forced to go back home, get sepsis and potentially die,\u201d Walz said. Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at an event in Juneau, Wisconsin, on Sunday, his fourth scheduled stop in eight days in the state. Republicans are trying to rack up support in Wisconsin, which has only flipped red once in the past 40 years, when Trump won the state in 2016. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz are slated to sit down with major TV personalities this week. Walz is slated to sit down with Fox News\u2019s Shannon Bream on Sunday for his first solo interview. On Monday, he\u2019ll join Jimmy Kimmel Live. On Tuesday, Harris will be in New York for appearances on The View, The Howard Stern Show, and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Here\u2019s what else is happening: After the US supreme court granted Donald Trump significant immunity from prosecution for actions during his presidency, the court is set to embark on its next nine-month term on Monday with public confidence in the court still reeling following the ruling compounded by the ethically dubious conduct of some justices. The White House moved Saturday to quash claims that government officials control the weather, including a far-fetched rumor circulating on social media that Hurricane Helene was an engineered storm to allow corporations to mine regional lithium deposits. Republican fearmongering about crime in major cities like Atlanta is serving to stoke racial tensions and suppress the growing political power of Black Democrats, despite a decline in crime rates, writes The Guardian\u2019s George Chidi.",

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong>Keir Starmer has called for unity in Britain and urged the nation to \u201cunequivocally stand with the Jewish community\u201d, as he reiterated calls for immediate ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon on the anniversary of the 7 October attacks.</p> <p>The prime minister described it as \u201cthe darkest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust\u201d, reflecting on the deaths of more than 1,000 people who were murdered by Hamas, including the young people massacred at a music festival, raped and brutally tortured in the aftermath.</p> <p>While he stood firm in his commitment to help \u201cbring the hostages home\u201d, he said \u201cwe must not look the other way as civilians bear the ongoing dire consequences of this conflict in the Middle East\u201d.</p> <p>He continued: \u201cWe will not falter in our pursuit of peace and on this day of pain and sorrow, we honour those we lost, and continue in our determination to return those still held hostage, help those who are suffering, and secure a better future for the Middle East.\u201d</p> <p>His comments come as the government earlier advised Israel to show \u201crestraint\u201d, while the prime minister had warned that \u201csparks\u201d from the Middle East conflict could \u201clight touchpapers in our communities at home\u201d.</p> <p>A series of rallies and demonstrations took place over the weekend, with more expected to take place around the country on Monday.</p> <p>In London, the Met police said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/05/tens-of-thousands-join-pro-palestinian-protest-in-london\">17 people had been arrested</a> after Saturday\u2019s pro-Palestinian march in central London, as part of a \u201csignificant\u201d policing operation in response to planned protest and memorial events.</p> <p>On Sunday afternoon, thousands of people arrived at a memorial event being held in London\u2019s Hyde Park, organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Jewish Leadership Council and other groups. Supporters waved Israeli flags and placards with the faces of the hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza as they chanted \u201cbring them home\u201d.</p> <p>The mother of the sole British hostage still in Gaza a year after she was taken by Hamas said her daughter has been \u201cstripped of every human right\u201d and remains \u201cin hell\u201d, as she called for her safe return.</p> <p>Mandy Damari spoke about her daughter Emily publicly for the first time, through tears, and called for the release of the 101 hostages who remained in Gaza, saying each one was someone\u2019s child, grandchild, parent or grandparent.</p> <p>\u201cHow is it that she [Emily] is still imprisoned there after one year?\u201d Damari said.</p> <p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t the whole world, especially Britain, fighting every moment to secure her release?\u201d</p> <p>Also at the event was Tracy-Ann Oberman, the actor and playwright, who said \u201cwe must not forget our humanity\u201d, adding it was \u201cheartening\u201d to see so many people in attendance.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here today because it\u2019s about memorial and remembrance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about remembering the terrorist attack on 7 October.

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer has called for unity in Britain and urged the nation to \u201cunequivocally stand with the Jewish community\u201d, as he reiterated calls for immediate ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon on the anniversary of the 7 October attacks. The prime minister described it as \u201cthe darkest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust\u201d, reflecting on the deaths of more than 1,000 people who were murdered by Hamas, including the young people massacred at a music festival, raped and brutally tortured in the aftermath. While he stood firm in his commitment to help \u201cbring the hostages home\u201d, he said \u201cwe must not look the other way as civilians bear the ongoing dire consequences of this conflict in the Middle East\u201d. He continued: \u201cWe will not falter in our pursuit of peace and on this day of pain and sorrow, we honour those we lost, and continue in our determination to return those still held hostage, help those who are suffering, and secure a better future for the Middle East.\u201d His comments come as the government earlier advised Israel to show \u201crestraint\u201d, while the prime minister had warned that \u201csparks\u201d from the Middle East conflict could \u201clight touchpapers in our communities at home\u201d. A series of rallies and demonstrations took place over the weekend, with more expected to take place around the country on Monday. In London, the Met police said 17 people had been arrested after Saturday\u2019s pro-Palestinian march in central London, as part of a \u201csignificant\u201d policing operation in response to planned protest and memorial events. On Sunday afternoon, thousands of people arrived at a memorial event being held in London\u2019s Hyde Park, organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Jewish Leadership Council and other groups. Supporters waved Israeli flags and placards with the faces of the hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza as they chanted \u201cbring them home\u201d. The mother of the sole British hostage still in Gaza a year after she was taken by Hamas said her daughter has been \u201cstripped of every human right\u201d and remains \u201cin hell\u201d, as she called for her safe return. Mandy Damari spoke about her daughter Emily publicly for the first time, through tears, and called for the release of the 101 hostages who remained in Gaza, saying each one was someone\u2019s child, grandchild, parent or grandparent. \u201cHow is it that she [Emily] is still imprisoned there after one year?\u201d Damari said. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t the whole world, especially Britain, fighting every moment to secure her release?\u201d Also at the event was Tracy-Ann Oberman, the actor and playwright, who said \u201cwe must not forget our humanity\u201d, adding it was \u201cheartening\u201d to see so many people in attendance. \u201cI\u2019m here today because it\u2019s about memorial and remembrance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about remembering the terrorist attack on 7 October. It\u2019s about remembering our dead and it\u2019s about remembering our hostages, some of whom are still alive and who we desperately want to bring home.\u201d The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said in a statement: \u201cI know, like me, Jewish and Muslim Londoners \u2013 and Londoners of every religion and of no organised faith \u2013 have been left distressed and utterly heartbroken by the cycle of terror, bloodshed and suffering that has engulfed the region. Many of us have seen images, or read news reports, of the horrors on 7 October and in Palestine that will haunt us for the rest of our lives.\u201d He repeated his call for a ceasefire and acknowledged the impact of the violence abroad has had on London\u2019s communities. \u201cWe cannot allow conflict overseas to divide us here at home,\u201d he said. In Waterloo a group of Jewish and Muslim women came together to mark the anniversary and to help \u201cstop the hate on [Britain\u2019s] streets\u201d. Dubbed a \u201csafe space\u201d by organisers, the group of six Jewish women and six Muslim women shared their feelings of \u201cexhaustion\u201d, \u201cpain\u201d and \u201csuffering\u201d, often through tears, but were also keen to express their \u201chope\u201d and \u201cgratitude\u201d that they felt had come from similar acts of unity. Organisers Julie Siddiqi, a Muslim, and Laura Marks, who is Jewish, are co-founders of the Nisa-Nashim Jewish and Muslim Women\u2019s Network. They told the PA news agency the meeting was a symbol of cross-faith unity against hatred and \u201cnot being made to feel we have to pick sides\u201d. Thousands also gathered in Manchester city centre for a pro-Israel march and rally, including Greater Manchester MPs Josh Simons and Christian Wakeford. The Met said it was likely that events and gatherings of various sizes would take place across London on Monday. Peter Kyle, a UK cabinet minister, speaking on the BBC One\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, said: \u201cWe do understand deeply what Israel has suffered in this year, but the only way forward is restraint, a ceasefire to create the space for a political solution, because this is getting more complicated. The war is deepening and it is not moving towards the peace that we need, so we are urging the steps that will take us towards that peaceful settlement\u201d. The prime minister, in an article for the Sunday Times, called out the \u201cvile hatred\u201d that had been directed towards Jews and Muslims since the 7 October attacks. He urged all parties involved in the conflict to \u201cact with restraint and return to political, not military solutions\u201d, having previously expressed his concern that the \u201cregion is on the brink\u201d after Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel.

Viewers liked it, too: it was brash, popular Sunday night fare, an airport novel of a TV series that pirouetted around credibility yet dragged you in with its relentless twists.

It may leave the impression that it is spinning too many plates, but the plot is captivating and once again touches on the class tensions within British society. Moving from Bristol to Brighton, it examines the legal process behind a newsworthy murder charge, this time thrown at a serving police officer, dragging the audience into yet another us-and-them, upstairs-downstairs scenario.</p> <p>Marcus Calderwood (Barney Fishwick) is the wealthy founder of the activist group Stop Climate Genocide, which has made many enemies with its road-blocking protests. Calderwood is knocked off his bicycle and left to die in a ditch; as he breathes his last, he manages to issue a dying statement to a paramedic, naming a police officer as the man who deliberately ran him off the road. Michael Socha plays a blinder as PC Justin Mitchell, the man known initially as Officer X, who denies playing any part in Calderwood\u2019s death, but he sure has done a lot of things that suggest he has something to hide. Mitchell is arrogant, charismatic and, crucially, an insider who understands the system, having experienced it on the frontline. He runs rings around the superior officers who question him and is surprisingly chipper, considering the enormous amount of circumstantial evidence pointing a finger in his direction.</p> <p>But the important detail here is that it is all circumstantial evidence, at least in the early stages of the investigation. Unlike straight police procedurals or legal dramas, Showtrial likes to dig into the complex details of the case. Mitchell requests the services of the defence solicitor Sam Malik (Adeel Akhtar, turning up his cerebral Eeyore routine to impeccable effect), who is known for getting unpalatable clients off on seemingly unbeatable charges. Mitchell, who is carried by a strong sense of right and wrong even though he feels that the system is not fit for purpose, recognises that he needs to be defended by \u201cthe most annoyingly persistent little twat you\u2019ll ever meet\u201d. The question of due process is examined repeatedly, as Malik argues that everyone, even the most odious of criminals, is entitled to a defence. He upholds the values of \u201creason, logic and basic morality\u201d, he tells his son, who&nbsp;in return suggests that, in the age of outrage, his&nbsp;values are relics of a bygone era.</p> <p>The performances are strong \u2013 often stronger than the script. The need for each character to come with a truckload of personal trauma, in addition to their professional woes, compounds the sense that it could do with trimming the fat. Malik is an insomniac with serious mental health issues, while his counterpart at the Crown Prosecution Service, Leila Hassoun-Kenny (Nathalie Armin), has a demanding half-sister and a mother who is a semi-famous academic and French Marxist philosopher. Who, among us, cannot relate to that? There are a few holes, too, in its ambitious patchwork of problems.</p> <p>It can feel like having a series of opinion pieces quoted at you.

Anthony Albanese is marking the anniversary of the 7 October attacks in Israel by condemning \u201call prejudice and hatred\u201d \u2013 and acknowledging the terrible pain that the anniversary brings. Violence in the Middle East is showing no signs of easing as Israel makes heavy bombing raids on Lebanon and Gaza, and says \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d for a strike on Iran. Back home, the NSW government is investigating a feared \u201csecond Juukan Gorge\u201d, after rock falls at a site bearing culturally significant Indigenous artwork near the Dendrobium coalmine. Australia \u2018Where\u2019s the accountability?\u2019 | A mine excavating coal beneath greater Sydney\u2019s water catchment has damaged a site of \u201csignificant\u201d cultural heritage, prompting warnings about \u201ca second Juukan Gorge\u201d. 7 October | In a video message, Anthony Albanese says the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel will carry \u201cterrible pain\u201d but that he holds out hope for peace for all. One year on | Many in Australia\u2019s Jewish community are feeling targeted by hate and exhausted by conflict amid dissolving unity and a rise in antisemitism. Analysis | The help to buy housing bill \u2013 the government\u2019s shared equity housing affordability scheme \u2013 is darkening parliament\u2019s doors again. Will this time be any different, Paul Karp asks. Queensland fire | An eight-year-old girl has died and a woman remains unaccounted for after a townhouse caught fire at Thorneside, east of Brisbane, yesterday. World Middle East crisis | Israel has again attacked Lebanon and Gaza amid intense airstrikes and evacuation orders; its defence minister said \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d as it prepares a strike on Iran. Benjamin Netanyahu has hit out at Emmanuel Macron over his call for a halt to arms exports to Israel; Israel\u2019s lack of vision may be fatally exposed, Peter Beaumont writes. US politics | Kamala Harris has embarked on a media blitz as she tries to edge out Donald Trump in key swing states; Tim Walz says Trump\u2019s agenda would \u201cdestroy\u201d the US economy; Trump makes a theatrical return to Butler, the scene of an assassination attempt. Tunisia elections | As voting begins, democracy campaigners have criticised President Kais Saied \u2013 who is seeking a second term while his most prominent political opponents are in prison. Catholicism | Pope Francis has named 21 new cardinals, significantly increasing the size of the college of cardinals and extending his mark on the group of prelates who will one day elect his successor. They include the 44-year-old head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic church in Melbourne. \u2018Unprecedented savagery\u2019 | Marseille\u2019s long-running drug turf wars are under a renewed spotlight after a 14-year-old boy was allegedly hired as a hitman via social media to carry out a revenge killing. Full Story How England\u2019s far-right riots erupted For a week in July and August English towns and cities seemed on the brink of chaos as racist chants rang out and homes, businesses and hotels housing asylum seekers were attacked.

The world of sport Rugby league | Penrith Panthers have climbed the highest mountain in a heavyweight clash to seal their place among NRL greats, Jack Snape writes. Football | Manchester United held 0-0 by Aston Villa to leave Erik Ten Hag\u2019s future up in the air; Ange Postecoglou\u2019s Tottenham side fell 3-2 at Brighton; Mary Fowler scored for Manchester City as they beat West Ham in the WSL.

It\u2019s one of the world\u2019s deadliest spiders but researchers believe funnel-web venom could be the key to treating heart attack and transplant patients, the Mercury reports. Melbourne\u2019s suburbs could be home to more skyscrapers as developers may be allowed to exceed apartment height limits if they include \u201ccommunity benefits\u201d, the Age reports.

The disappointment comes from us not doing the very basics of what\u2019s expected at the highest level from a competitive standpoint.\u201d",

Now, arguably a week too late, she did.</p> <p>This year\u2019s oldest contestant at 66, Toyah had admirable energy and enthusiasm but didn\u2019t direct it into disciplined dancing.

Her week three samba was all performance and no precision, ending up barely like a samba at all. I Want to Be Free, she sang in 1981. Well, now she is.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for watching along with me, glitter gang. Our 13 couples (provided Nick \u201cKnowlesy\u201d Knowles is off his sick bed) now dance onto next weekend\u2019s mercifully un-themed live show. It airs next Saturday at 6.20pm on BBC1. Meet you back here for more bloggery-pokery. And in the meantime, you know what to do: keeeeep dancing! Goodnight and have a good week. Finally, MikeMoonlight says: \u201cI\u2019m a bit disappointed that we\u2019ve never seen a Lord Of the Rings-themed dance in Movie Week. Although let\u2019s face it, it will inevitably turn out to be Mordor On the Dancefloor.\u201d You shall not pass (up any opportunity for a pun), Mike. styletraveller says of Paul Merson: \u201cI think Karen made the mistake of not giving Paul enough to do. There is some ability in there somewhere.\u201d Gardener_Maidhc adds: \u201cPaul and Karen\u2019s cowboy cha cha was no better for a second time out but looks more like the dance it claims to be than Toyah\u2019s did. Feel like the choreo makes no sense here. He does some cha cha but mostly just faffin\u2019 abaht.\u201d Of the pros accompanying Alexis Ffrench, acanthe says: \u201cWell, that was rather beautiful. Lauren is really one of the most beautiful dancers. She and Kai were perfect in that.\u201d Sebnose adds: \u201cBeautiful music, beautiful dancing. Alas the CGI does rather remind me of my colonoscopy.\u201d IvanTiger says: \u201cToyah no surprise but how will Shirley bear to get rid of Neil?\u201d AtAmber says: \u201cWynne needs to sing every week. Should he not make the final, they should just let him sit with the orchestra.\u201d Time for a swift vox pop of your comments. Strictlylounging says: \u201cThis pro dance is better than the Minions last night! There seem to be a couple of extra pros in this too, which is how Kai first appeared!\u201d TV viewers can mow flip to Scotland: The New Wild on BBC2, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? on ITV1 or The Dog House on Channel 4. At 9pm, there\u2019s the return of legal thriller Showtrial on BBC1, Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing on BBC2, American Godfathers: The Five Families on Sky History, Chimp Crazy on Sky Documentaries or Big Brother: Live Launch on ITV2. Film-wise to mark Movie Week, choose at 9pm between A Passage to India on Sky Arts (Maggie Smith klaxon!), Man Up on BBC3 or Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol on E4. At 10pm, there\u2019s Till on BBC2 and at 10.10pm, Aliens is on ITV4. That\u2019s probably enough to be going on with. It was cockle-warming to see Strictly stalwart Neil Jones get a celebrity partner after two series on the bench. As his baby daughter Havana had printed on her babygro: \u201cMy daddy FINALLY has a partner!\u201d However, it proved pretty short-lived for the unlucky pro hoofer. In his eighth year as a Strictly pro, Neil\u2019s best run remains 2019, when he reached the quarter-final with Alex Scott. At least Toyah lasted a week longer than his 2021 partner Nina Wadia, who was first out. Now it\u2019s back to the ensemble again for this unsung cult hero. At least he got to lead the romcom-themed group dance at the top of this show as a consolation prize. It\u2019s A Mystery certainly doesn\u2019t apply to her exit. Consigned to the dreaded dance-off for the second week running, it was only right that Toyah Willcox should depart the dancefloor. She was the lowest scorer in the contest, totalling just 45 points across three dances and never notching more than a five. Having scored four points fewer than Paul Merson last night, she was always up against it. Many viewers thought she should have bit the dust last week against Tom Dean. Now, arguably a week too late, she did. This year\u2019s oldest contestant at 66, Toyah had admirable energy and enthusiasm but didn\u2019t direct it into disciplined dancing. Her week one tango was full of wild head-shaking and saw her compared to a \u201cspringbok\u201d. Her week two jive wasn\u2019t compact or controlled enough. Her week three samba was all performance and no precision, ending up barely like a samba at all. I Want to Be Free, she sang in 1981. Well, now she is. Ta-ta, Toyah. Paul Merson definitely deserved to stay another week but might his race be run next time? He\u2019s surely due a ballroom dance next. Having been third from bottom, Pete Wicks did well to dodge another dance-off and could be at risk next week. Nick Knowles will also be under severe pressure if he\u2019s fit to return. And without the Bollywood feelgood factor, can Dr Punam Krishan stay clear of danger? It\u2019s all to dance for. As the eliminated pair take a final turn around the ballroom to We Go Together from Grease, the credits roll and the other couples crowd in for \u201cglad it\u2019s not me\u201d cuddles. Please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. Her pro partner Neil Jones says: \u201cShe\u2019s made me laugh so much. I have never seen someone work so hard.. I\u2019m the one asking for breaks! She wanted to learn so much. She\u2019s been practicing in the hallways. She\u2019s brilliant, she\u2019s what Strictly is all about and I\u2019ve loved every moment.\u201d Health &amp; Safety should get involved. She must be a fire hazard in those hallways. In her exit interview, Toyah Willcox tells Tess: \u201cIt\u2019s been the best two months of my life, it has been fantastic. I have enjoyed every second. And Neil has been phenomenal, thank you so much. I felt so comfortable and safe with Neil. You\u2019re a great teacher and a great friend as well. You\u2019ve just given me a new zest for life. That\u2019s the most valuable thing I\u2019ve come away with.\u201d Lovely words but that \u201ccomfortable and safe\u201d bit felt like a conscious reference to The Great Unpleasantness. No split decision this week, it\u2019s unanimous. Head judge Twirly Shirley, the Queen Of Latin and tiny shoes, also would\u2019ve chosen to save Paul and Karen. The majority vote means Toyah and Neil become this year\u2019s second couple to depart the dancefloor. Paul and Karen, saying \u201cneither were flawless but they had better technique\u201d. Paul and Karen, saying \u201cthey were stronger and more solid\u201d. Paul and Karen, saying \u201cthey did better second time around, while Toyah\u2019s timing was out and there was a loss of balance\u201d. Craig scored both routines a measly three last night. Motsi and Shirley preferred Paul\u2019s by one point, Anton by two points. Will they stand by that or be swayed by those performances? Paul Merson and his dance partner Karen Hauer reprise their cowboy cha cha cha to The Magnificent Seven theme. The judges said last night it was joyous and full of characterisation but with non-existent hip action and turned-in feet. It notched 19 points, four more than Toyah, so all Paul needs to do is not fall off his horse and he should be fine. Toyah Willcox and her pro partner Neil Jones have another go at their samba to Poor Unfortunate Souls from The Little Mermaid. The judge said last night it was powerful and full of storytelling but she made footwork whoopsies and her lower half was ploddy and floppy. Her husband Robert Fripp promptly stood up to heckle Craig. She scored just 15 points, four fewer than Paul, so needs to show considerable improvement here and hope that he slips up. Musical performance now from classical soul pianist Alexis Ffrench. He\u2019s had two number one albums in the classical charts, is Scala Radio\u2019s composer-in-residence, and has worked with the likes of Paloma Faith and Leona Lewis. He\u2019s playing The Heart Asks Pleasure First, Michael Nyman\u2019s piece from the soundtrack to Jane Campion\u2019s The Piano, named after an Emily Dickinson poem. Kai Widdrington and Lauren Oakley provide classy choreographic accompaniment. Sarah Hadland shares an update on Percy the fancy-dressed cat. Celebrity MasterChef champion Vito Coppola has been making parmigiana for everyone. Jealous. And it\u2019s to Down Under by Men At Work. Vegemite sandwiches all round. Jamie Borthwick does an impression of Shirley Ballas and is going back to Latin next week. Well, she\u2019s been stuck at the foot of the scoreboard for the past three weeks and hasn\u2019t been saved by viewer votes. As widely predicted, Toyah Willcox and Neil Jones are consigned to the dance-off for the second week running. So are Shayne Ward, Sarah Hadland and Montell Douglas. Now to find out who will face Paul Merson in the dance-off. Stand by your fancy dress boxes and prop cupboards. Anton Du Beke praises Pete Wicks Of The Jungle for being \u201ca changed man\u201d. Motsi Mabuse hails Dr Punam Krishan\u2019s Bollywood routine, saying \u201cthe more diverse our world is, the more beautiful it is\u201d. Up to the Clauditorium for some judgely gossip and a closer look at last night\u2019s routines. Shirley Ballas is sad to see \u201cnatural born entertainer\u201d Paul Merson in the dance-off. A mid-show group number from the professional troupe now. It\u2019s a romcom-inspired routine, choreographed by Mandy Moore and starring Neil Jones as the leading man. Nods to Love Actually, Say Anything and Sleepless In Seattle so far. An old-fashioned one to sweep us off our feet. Tasha Ghouri is dreading the quickstep because it looks tiring. Something tells me she\u2019ll be fine. Sam Quek and Nikita Kuzmin are dancing a Shakira samba next week. Sadly, he sings the wrong Shakira song. Everyone falls about laughing. Excellent. My breasts are indeed small and humble. Gorka admits he\u2019s been using his partner Dr Punam as a text diagnosis service for his children. Up in the Clauditorium with the relieved couples who are safely through to next week, Katya Jones reveals that she and Wynne are dancing an Abba tango. He hits a big note from Money, Money, Money. Go compare THAT. Wonder if Shirley\u2019s got her Victorian ghost child\u2019s shoes in her bag again? Shudder. Probably no surprise, considering that he finished second from bottom on the scoreboard. Paul Merson and Karen Hauer will dance again for survival. Saddle up those horses again. But who will he face? So are Wynne Evans, Tasha Ghouri, JB Gill and Pete Wicks. Buckle up, it\u2019s time for long pauses, relieved hugs and grateful thanks yous down the camera. Commenters last night compared Shayne Ward\u2019s Elvis look to both Liberace and a TV evangelist. Thangyewverymch, uh-huh. Last night\u2019s live show gets rewound and recapped. Chris McCausland parties on! Tasha Ghouri\u2019s Barbie rumba! Punan Krishan\u2019s Bollywood milestone! Sam Quek\u2019s bullfighting Lara Croft! Wynne Evans does Mrs Doubtfire, dear! Sarah Hadland pays tribute to Maggie Smith! Pete Wicks pays tribute to a sort of pelvic-thursting Tarzan! Here come our presentational dream duo, so let\u2019s do the traditional frockular face-off. Tess Daly is in a pink one-shoulder. Claudia Winkleman is in a drapey Jedi dress again. Claudia wins. Roll opening titles. One of these couples will be heading home on the Elstree night bus in approximately 40 minutes. But which? Select sweet or salty popcorn. Think better of buying one of those sweaty hotdogs. Take your front row seats. We\u2019re about to head back to the Elstree picture house\u2026 On BBC1 right now is Sunday night stalwart Antiques Roadshow from Edinburgh\u2019s Royal Botanic Garden. Wonder how they\u2019d value Shirley Ballas\u2019 Victorian ghost child\u2019s shoes? A mere five minutes to wait now\u2026 Musical guest tonight is classical-soul pianist Alexis Ffrench, playing a piece from a film score. I won\u2019t spoil which one but it\u2019s a goodie, in my book. Ten minutes until showtime\u2026 Tonight\u2019s show will open with another pro number but thankfully, it\u2019s a little less sugar-crazed than last night\u2019s Minions monstrosity. This one is romcom-themed. Is it raining? I hadn\u2019t noticed. Just 15 minutes until we\u2019re back in the ballroom\u2026 Meanwhile, Iain Crofts in Montreal writes: \u201cGiovanni Pernice\u2019s new gig on the Italian edition, Ballando con le Stelle, has been quite a discovery for your Canadian correspondent. Now I\u2019m juggling following Striclly and Ballando from blogs and YouTube clips. Rai 1\u2019s clips on YouTube are more generous than the BBC\u2019s. They even include the judges\u2019 comments and scores. Five judges pontificating in Italian is a severe test of my linguistic skills. Fortunately, a blog distills the comments in writing, which is easier to figure out than trying to grasp what they\u2019re saying. It\u2019s fun trying to imagine how Giovanni and his partner, actress Bianca Guaccero, would fare against this year\u2019s Strictly line-up. I\u2019m happy to report that your blog is still my favourite (and I\u2019m not just channelling Brucie)!\u201d A pair of emails have arrived from foreign climes. Liesbeth van Leeuwen said last night from the Netherlands: \u201cHere we are again, all set up for our Strictly watchalong from Amsterdam! Enjoying your blog. Feels like watching in company, which is lovely. I always struggle a bit when the dance does not match the music. The first dance by Montell Douglas would be better with a bit of proper tango music. But I\u2019m looking forward to Mrs Doubtfire!\u201d The DIY SOS host withdrew from this weekend\u2019s show after sustaining a knee injury during Friday\u2019s dress rehearsal while practising a jump. As per Strictly rules, he received a bye through to next week, when he\u2019ll hopefully be ready to dance again. However, Nick was photographed yesterday leaving his home on crutches and looking glum. Fingers crossed he stages another miraculous recovery after bouncing back from an arm injury last week. It\u2019s always a shame when a celebrity\u2019s Strictly journey is brought to a premature end on doctor\u2019s orders - not to mention a headache for producers. It\u2019s 25 minutes to glitter o\u2019clock\u2026 Coming into this weekend, bookmakers\u2019 even-money favourite for elimination was Toyah Willcox. She duly finished bottom of the standings again after her misfiring Little Mermaid samba. Will the 80s punk popstrel be saved by viewer votes or will she face her second dance-off in a row? And who might join her? Half an hour until we\u2019re ready for our Movie Week close-ups\u2026 The end credits are about to roll on one couple. Good evening and welcome to the second elimination of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your torch-wielding cinema usherette for tonight\u2019s Movie Week results show. You are cordially invited to watch along with me as another celebrity gets sent straight to the DVD bargain bin. Hollywood and Bollywood both came to Borehamwood last night in a feast of filmic fancy dress and celluloid-inspired moves. Tasha Ghouri topped the leaderboard with her Barbie rumba. In joint second spot were Sarah Hadland, Shayne Ward and Dr Punam Krishan. Now our 13 pro-celebrity pairs wait to find out their fates. Last night\u2019s scores have been combined with the public vote and the bottom two will hoof again for survival. But who\u2019ll be consigned to the dreaded dance-off? Toyah Willcox was once more left propping up the scoreboard, with Paul Merson second from bottom. Will voting viewers agree? If not, the likes of Pete Wicks, Montell Douglas or even Sam Quek could come into choreographic contention. It\u2019s showtime at 7.15pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6.45pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and quips from the back row of the cinema. So hum the Pearl &amp; Dean theme and I\u2019ll see you on the sofa. As always, I\u2019d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me at michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for all your Movie Week musings. I\u2019ll don my Mrs Doubtfire skirt and cha-cha down there periodically to gauge your reaction to the show and report on your comments. The critics\u2019 reviews are in. The box office receipts have been totted up. Nearly time to staaaaaart cinematic eliminating! That concludes Saturday\u2019s filmic-themed liveblog but like any movie hit, there will be a sequel. Meet you back here for the results show, which airs at 7.15pm Sunday on BBC1. I\u2019ll bang the clapperboard on the blog at 6.45pm for build-up, so I hope you\u2019ll rejoin me then. In the meantime, I\u2019m @michaelhogan on Twitter, so do rumba-walk over and say hi. Thanks for watching along with me and your cracking company. See you for the franchise continuation tomorrow. Liveblog 2: Pig In The City or Liveblog 2: Electric Boogaloo, perhaps. In the meantime, the usual applies: keeeeeep dancing! Goodnight. Finally, some thoughts on the judges. G1adys says: \u201cWas that really necessary, Shirley? Somebody take that bag off her. We don\u2019t need a repeat performance of that.\u201d Jennifera030 says: \u201cNot the return of Shirley\u2019s tiny shoes! I\u2019ve only just started sleeping with the lights off.\u201d MartGray adds: \u201cI wish Anton would pack it in with Demo Time. And give Gorka his trousers back.\u201d On Jamie Borthwick\u2019s show-closing quickstep, ReclinedPotato says: \u201cI know Jamie is meant to be Elton but I\u2019m getting major Verka Serduchka vibes (Ukrainian drag queen with a star head piece from Eurovision). Still. wigs are expensive. I suppose.\u201d whistledownthewind says: \u201cThank goodness he\u2019s supposed to be Elton John. I thought he was dressed as Su Pollard.\u201d MsChuffy says: \u201cHold me closer, tidy dancer.\u201d RegWhelk adds: \u201cJamie is off the beat and fairly rubbish and gets 30, puzzling.\u201d Of Punam Krishan\u2019s Couples Choice, TeeDubyaBee says: \u201cAmazing! More Bollywood, Strictly.\u201d Petebail adds: Usually can\u2019t stand Couple\u2019s Choice but that was fantastic. Dance of the night.\u201d Of Wynne Evans, YodaknowsAll says: \u201cI\u2019m willing to forgive Wynne his lack of hip movement as his legs and feet in that cha cha were tremendous.\u201d jagadox adds: \u201cWynne is a big surprise. I thought he\u2019d be rubbish but funny but he can actually move. Even in a skirt.\u201d Whistledownthewind says: \u201cA good dance from Shayne Ward I thought. Pity the wig made him look more like Liberace than Elvis though!\u201d On Paul Merson\u2019s cowboy cha cha, Strictlylounging says: \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind about Paul. I think he\u2019s genuinely trying and actually cares about improving. Good effort!\u201d wtrukus says: The frustrating thing is that I think Paul can sort of dance for an old footballer. I mean there\u2019s stuff to work with there, if they didn\u2019t spend so much time on the comic element. Jennifera030 adds: \u201cKaren has actually got Paul to wake up and attempt to dance. Not successful but she really deserves a bonus.\u201d On Sarah Hadland\u2019s Harry Potter number, FloraBelle says: I absolutely think Maggie Smith would have approved of that vamped-up Professor McGonagall dress.\u201d MartGray adds: \u201cJust magical, so elegant. The schoolteacher capes added excellent flow, the music was tremendous, the lighting and FX great.\u201d On JB Gill, Mike Moonlight says: \u201cI\u2019m probably not the only one who\u2019s disappointed that they didn\u2019t try to recreate the Glasgow Wonka Experience with the sad Oompa Loompa standing behind what looked like a crystal meth factory, handing out one jellybean to sobbing children.\u201d On Pete Wicks, YodaknowsAll says: \u201cThe shock and joy on Pete\u2019s face on receiving those scores was so sweet. He is this year\u2019s Krishnan, falling in love with dance and Strictly.\u201d Hanlouliv adds: \u201cThat seems like a generous score for Pete but given the terrible song and costume he was lumbered with, I don\u2019t begrudge it!\u201d On Chris McCausland, MarkRoche says: \u201cSo impressed with how Dianne is able to teach such choreography and to Chris for being able to translate that into performance.\u201d ReclinedPotato adds: \u201cWhen Chris dances I just get incredibly happy. I think he could do a Bill Bailey and win the whole shebang. I hope he does.\u201d On leaderboard-topping Tasha Ghouri, Petebail says: \u201cMight as well give Tasha a bye to the final now.\u201d Somersetlass adds: \u201cI rather loved that rumba. There was some great flow and I have nothing but admiration for Tasha\u2019s ability to move so fluidly in those heels!\u201d On Toyah Willcox\u2019s samba, ButterflyBlu says: \u201cI thought Toyah\u2019s husband was spoiling for a fight there! Can\u2019t these celebrities take criticism of any kind?!\u201d LazyMillennial says: \u201cLmao at Craig and the Frippster.\u201d FascinatingFlamenco adds: \u201cToyah would be GREAT in pantomime!\u201d On Montell Douglas\u2019 tango, MartGray says: \u201cMontell looks stiff and lost. Doesn\u2019t seem much like a tango. And of course, awful song choice.\u201d FascinatingFlamenco adds: \u201cLove Montell but thought she was too strong and tough dominant in this dance. Was she leading in places? I so understand wanting to push your best, but in this dance a little less power would have worked better.\u201d About the show-opening Minions mayhem, Joanieloves says: \u201cI am already freaked out by the make-up and costumes. More Nosferatu than Gru. Gardener_Maidhc adds: \u201cI think I might hate everything about a Minions themed opening pro dance, from the disturbing Gru costume on Kai (how old?) to the bad yellow face paint and body suits and the lack of nice ballroom dancing in favour of prancing in time.\u201d A rapid-fire round-up of your comments. Of Sicknote Knowles\u2019 absence, G1adys says: \u201cDoesn\u2019t bode well for Nick if he\u2019s injured again. Feels like he may be doomed. I hope this is the last of his problems.\u201d RegWhelk adds: \u201cCan\u2019t believe Nick\u2019s not with us for this show. Life seems empty without him.\u201d TV viewers can now flip to Kirsty MacColl Night on BBC2 or stay on BBC1 for a duos-themed edition of The Weakest Link - including showbiz couple Tyler West and Molly Rainford, who met when they were Strictly castmates two years ago. Aww. If Movie Week has put you in the mood for a film, at 9pm you can choose from Spectre on ITV2+1, Prey on Channel 4, A Few Good Men on Film4 or Margrete: Queen Of The North on BBC4. At 10.30pm, The Terminator is on ITV4 and at 11.20pm, underrated rave comedy Go is on Comedy Central. Who needs those piffling Academy Awards when they could win one of our coveted liveblog baubles? Here are this week\u2019s celluloid-style gong-getters\u2026 Best dance: Despite what the scoreboard says, either Sarah Hadland\u2019s Maggie Smith tribute or Punam\u2019s Bollywood landmark. Worst dance: Toyah Willcox\u2019s non-samba samba by a country mile. Best music choice: Harry Potter and Mrs Doubtfire worked a treat, while I\u2019ve got a soppy soft spot for Pure Imagination. Worst music choice: George Of The Jungle or Wayne\u2019s World. Both shoutathons. Best outfit: Sarah Hadland-as-Professor McGonagall\u2019s spellbinding green gown. Worst outfit: Pete Wicks\u2019 leopard print loincloth. Judges Anton and Motsi weren\u2019t done any wardrobe favours, though. Best judges\u2019 comment: Shirley casually namedropping that she was judging the World Championships at the Royal Albert Hall this week. Clang! Worst VT: The sweet-making and the climbing wall were both a bit after-school club. Best Claudia quip: Roping in \u201cyoung person\u201d Montell to help her out with the socials, before adding \u201cI love you, don\u2019t leave me\u201d. Tasha Ghouri tops the standings, with Punam Krishan, Sarah Hadland and Shayne Ward just one point behind. Toyah Willcox is way down at the bottom, with Paul Merson just above. As always, though the viewer vote will play its part in tomorrow night\u2019s dance-off. It could be squeaky bum time for Pete Wicks and Montell Douglas too. \u201cKeeeeeep dancing,\u201d chorus Tess and Claud, according to tradition. As the facepaint is wiped off and the props wheeled back into Tess Daly\u2019s broom cupboard, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. Tonight\u2019s routines get recapped on-screen. Which Oscar-worthy performance are you voting for? Which box office stinker are you definitely not? Cue fancy-dressed anarchy in the Clauditorium and behind the judges\u2019 table, complete with endearingly rubbish dinosaur puppet. Nikita hoists Claudia aloft. Judges\u2019 scores for Jamie and Michelle: 8, 8, 7, 7 for a total of 30 points. His best yet, mid-table on a high-scoring night. Judges\u2019 comments for Jamie and Michelle: Anton says \u201cyou\u2019re a super dancer, you could be one of the favourites but a bit in and out, floppy and lacking consistency\u201d. Craig says \u201csome gapping but flow and natural rhythm, stamina, energy, loved it\u201d. Motsi says \u201cgave it 100%, feathers made it untidy, get back the neatness an the glitterball is close\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201clots of potential, keep working on feet and posture but good job\u201d. Eights for Elts? The EastEnders actor won the Christmas special with a quickstep, so he should have a head-start here. Jamie Borthwick is in a great Elton John costume, complete with feathered top and signature specs, with pro partner Michelle Tsiakkas in a matching feathered dress. This one is more complicated and technically challenging than his festive number, upping the ante for the main show. Fast and light on his feet, jumping and leaping across the floor. High-energy skips and Charleston steps. Lacks a little Rolls Royce smoothness in places but great side-by-side section and plentiful changes of pace. Song: I\u2019m Still Standing from Rocketman. The video for Elton\u2019s 1983 hit was choreographed by one former Strictly judge, Arlene Phillips - and one of the dancers was another, Bruno Tonioli. Judges\u2019 scores for Punam and Gorka: 8, 9, 8, 8 for a total of 33 points. Her best by far and joint second on the scoreboard. Punam proudly dedicates it to her late grandfather, who passed away during the pandemic. Judges\u2019 comments for Punam and Gorka: Craig says \u201cincredible, full of changing rhythms and loved all the shaping\u201d. Motsi says \u201cthat really moved me, wonderful to see that on Strictly, it went so deep, brilliant energy\u201d. Shirley says \u201csupercalafragilisticexpyalidocius\u201d (excuse the spelling, Poppins posse). Anton concludes \u201cyou lived it, great musicality, your best by far\u201d. Eights and nines? First Couple\u2019s Choice of the series now - and Strictly\u2019s first ever Bollywood routine from a couple. Dr Punam Krishan is understandably excited about this milestone moment of representation for the South Asian community. A poignant, tearful pre-dance VT. Lovely costumes with lots of delicate lace detail in her skirt and bodice. Great floor projection too. It\u2019s a fun and playful routine. Punam is palpably enjoying herself and it\u2019s infectious. Makes a bracing change from contempo-waft Couple\u2019s Choices. Scarf-ography, spins and lifts, changes of pace, strong finish. Bravo. Song: Bole Chudiyan from Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. Punam describes the 2001 blockbuster as \u201cthe Love Actually of Bollywood\u201d - a romantic, feelgood family saga which is widely nicknamed \u201cK3G\u201d. Judges\u2019 scores for Wynne and Katya: 7, 7, 8, 8 for a total of 30 points. Scrapes into the top five so far. Judges\u2019 comments for Wynne and Katya: Motsi says \u201cexcellent choreography, Katya, great feet, needed more hips and body action but brilliant\u201d. Shirley says \u201cappreciated the poly-rhythms, lovely foot position, embrace those difficult details\u201d. Anton says \u201cMovie Week magic, exceptional, enjoyed the show\u201d. Craig concludes \u201chip action let it down, wooden and stiff, but this is a look you could go to the supermarket in\u201d. \u201cThese are all my own chins,\u201d quips Wynne. Opera singer Wynne Jones has been a revelation, skilfully guided by taskmaster pro Katya Jones. Now he\u2019s back to Latin, playing Robin Williams\u2019 dad-in-diguise. Wearing a skirt to show off his leg action, Wynne is clearly enjoying the characterisation. Vacuum cleaner-ography. Swishing his skirt and showing off his frilly bloomers. Good footwork, timing and content. High-energy and entertainment value. Well done, dear. Song: Papa\u2019s Got A Brand New Bag from Mrs Doubtfire. The 1965 James Brown funk classic was his first Top 10 hit. Talking of bags, Robin Williams once described his Mrs Doubtfire bodysuit as \u201clike a walking beanbag chair\u201d. Judges\u2019 scores for Shayne and Nancy: 8, 9, 8, 8 for a total of 33 points. His best yet and joint second so far. Judges\u2019 comments for Shayne and Nancy: Anton says \u201cThe King would\u2019ve loved that\u201d then demonstrates a correct arm position. Craig says \u201cabsolutely loved it, total natural, gorgeous\u201d. Motsi says \u201cbest male tonight, well done\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201cgreat awareness, you were in your zone\u201d. Eights, maybe a nine? Craig tipped \u201cShancy\u201d as ones to watch after last week\u2019s impressive tango. Can they fulfil that promise? Shayne Ward is a huge Elvis fan, so is relishing donning the quiff and sideburns. Long, stylish solo section to start before they start spinning and twirling around the floor. Gets a little hesitant in hold but fleckerls and contra checks as they change direction. Spectacular floor spin. Drama and mood on-point. Shayne\u2019s dance has now left the building. Song: If I Can Dream from Elvis. Presley\u2019s 1968 hit was based on Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech, shortly after his assassination. Brilliantly, football manager Terry Venables charted with a cover version in 2010. Judges\u2019 scores for Sam and Nikita: 7, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 30 points. Her best by far. Of training, Sam says: \u201cPeople at home are working properly hard \u2013 builders, nurses, teachers \u2013 so we can\u2019t complain.\u201d Well said. Judges\u2019 comments for Sam and Nikita: Craig says \u201clegs too straight, looked stiff but strong and hot, hot, hot\u201d. Motsi says \u201canother new flavour, kept character, intensity, loved that\u201d. Shirley says \u201cin and out for me, soften knees, keep fluidity but strong connection\u201d. Anton concludes \u201cyou say stiff, I say strong, wonderful lines, your best yet\u201d. Sixes and sevens? Sam Quek admits that she struggled with last week\u2019s jolly hockeysticks Charleston, although she finished in respectable mid-table. She says this week\u2019s paso has proved equally tricky to master, although she should be at home portraying Lara Croft - Sam\u2019s been to not one but two fancy dress parties as her before. She\u2019s been criticised for a lack of synchronisation, so needs nail the timing as well as technique. Some lovely detail and bold choreography. Powerful, imperious and fiery but a little flat-footed and lacking curved Spanish line. Song: Elevation from Tomb Raider. The video for U2\u2019s Grammy-winning 2001 hit was shot on the New York street portion of the Universal Studios Tour. Judges\u2019 scores for JB and Amy: 7, 8, 8, 9 for a total of 32 points. His best yet. Third so far behind Sarah and Tasha. JB gives out sweets to the judges before they mark him. Clever boy. Judges\u2019 comments for JB and Amy: Shirley says \u201cgreat signs of a ballroom dancer, a few unsteady glitches but sincerity from the heart, full of heart\u201d. Anton says \u201cgreat narrative, perfect package, just take largest steps and stride out\u201d. Craig says \u201clost flow in hold but a proper musical theatre number, you sold it, you\u2019re a showman\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201cgetting sweeter every week, great ear for music, just breathe\u201d. Eights incoming? The last time they did ballroom, JB Gill and Amy Dowden topped the leaderboard. Can they repeat the trick and win a golden ticket through to next week? Or will they fall into the chocolate river? JB is channelling Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in a top hat and frock coat. Foxtrot steps, lots of cheeky details and fluidity across the floor. Changes of pace. Amy\u2019s been drilling the footwork and fundamentals (for Shirley) into him and it shows. Sweet and smooth as chocolate. Song: Pure Imagination from Wonka. This tingly classic was written by composers Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley over the phone in a day. Judges\u2019 scores for Pete and Jowita: 6, 6, 7, 7 for a total of 26 points. Generous but his best yet. \u201cHate the film, love the samba,\u201d says Pete. Judges\u2019 comments for Pete and Jowita: Mosti says \u201cwow, we told you to loosen up so I blame us, you went in and out of the music\u201d. Shirley says \u201cyou\u2019re unrecognisable, took risks, full of content, you\u2019re improving and I commend you\u201d. Anton says \u201ca changed man, there were efforts at the samba, keep going\u201d. Craig concludes \u201cI\u2019m still in recovery from the opening, darling, it lacked bounce and coordination, a trip hazard but your personal best\u201d. Fives and sixes, do we say? Pete Wicks is all hair and not much clothing as he plays Brendan Fraser\u2019s Tarzan spoof. Leaf projections on floor for that jungle vibe. He swings in on a vine from the judges\u2019 table (mind that tree, George/Pete!) before launching into a rhythmical Rio carnival dance. The hip action\u2019s a bit wild, timing is off and timing is off but it\u2019s bouncy, loose and showcasing his fun side. Partner Jowita Przystal might even have made the self-styled \u201cgrumpy git\u201d smile. Oh, a stumble at the end where he almost tripped her up. Shame. Song: George Of The Jungle Theme. John Cleese voiced the talking gorilla in the 1997 comedy. Well, he had another divorce to pay for. Judges\u2019 scores for Sarah and Vito: 8, 9, 8, 8 for a total of 33 points. Her first nine and second on the leaderboard at this stage. Judges\u2019 comments for Sarah and Vito: Anton says \u201ca few footwork problems but beautiful\u201d before busting out an overlong demo time. Craig says \u201crise and fall crept in but fantastic, simple, effective, I loved it\u201d. Motsi says \u201chighlight of the night so far, nostalgic and brilliant\u201d. Shirley raids her carpet bag, gets out her haunted child\u2019s shoes and concludes \u201cmarvellous potential\u201d. Eights ahoy? The high-energy pairing of actor Sarah Hadland and reigning pro champion Vito Coppola finished second on the combined leaderboard last week. Can they maintain that standard with this Harry Potter-themed Viennese? She\u2019s playing Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith RIP). Lots of smooth spins, soft buttery knees, a mid-waltz wobble but full of class, character and elegance. Magical. Song: Hedwig\u2019s Theme from Harry Potter. The orchestral piece, composed by John Williams, has become the signature music of the wizarding franchise. Williams was knighted two years ago for services to film music. Considering his credits include Jaw, E.T and Star Wars, the accolade was well-deserved. Judges\u2019 scores for Paul and Karen: 3, 5, 5, 6 for a total of 19 points. His highest yet. Second bottom as it stands. Proud Ma Merse in the audience. \u201cMum, I played for Arsenal and England,\u201d protests Paul. Judges\u2019 comments for Paul and Karen: Shirley says \u201ca jolly holiday, full of joy, some lovely walks, music hasn\u2019t quite arrived in your hips but it\u2019s getting there\u201d. Karen says \u201cmade an effort at mastering the technique, on a good path, keep going\u201d. Craig says \u201cfeet turned in throughout, hip action non-existent but made up for it in characterisation, I see improvement\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201cnot just comedy, the final is close \u2013 or not\u201d. Five hands high? Paul Merson is bookies tip to appear in the dance-off against Toyah Willcox. Can he defy the odds with a wild west cha-cha? Ironically, he arrives on horseback - even though he lost all his money gambling on the gee-gees. He and Karen Hauer are sporting cowboy hats, tasseled chaps and neckerchiefs. A spot of lasso-ography. He\u2019s unleashing his hips and having fun. It\u2019s not there technically or timing-wise but much improved for me. Yee-hah. Although somehow I doubt that will score a magnificent seveeen! Song: The Magnificent Seven Theme. A certain John Williams (sees Sarah and Vito\u2019s Harry Potter number) played piano in the orchestra that recorded Elmer Bernstein\u2019s score for the classic 1960 western. Judges\u2019 scores for Tasha and Alja\u017e: 8, 8, 9, 9 for a total of 34 points. One fewer than last week but still top of the pops. Judges\u2019 comments for Tasha and Alja\u017e: Craig says \u201csticky transitions but my goodness, those legs, expressive arms, strong storytelling, ex-quisite\u201d. Motsi says \u201cyou made it soft and light, great quality but move your pelvis\u201d. Shirley says \u201cmoving, sensitive, clarity, off-the-charts\u201d. Anton concludes \u201clove your legs and lines, just loosen that back up\u201d. Eights and nines again? Love Island alumna Tasha Ghouri and returning pro Alja\u017e \u0160korjanec topped last week\u2019s combined leaderboard . Now she\u2019s the first female celebrity this series to tackle the ever-tricky rumba. Barbie is lonely and Ken\u2019s there to help her through it, so it\u2019s a soft and vulnerable type of rumba rather than a saucily seductive one. Slow, slinky and swivelling. Controlled turns and spins. Lovely timing, arm extensions and leg action. Almost balletic rather than Latin at times. Good Barbie. Song: What Was I Made For? from Barbie. Billie Eilish\u2019s melancholic ballad won a Grammy, a Golden Globe and an Oscar. She directed the video herself. Judges\u2019 scores for Chris and Dianne: 7, 7, 8, 8 for a total of 30 points. His best yet and top of the scores so far. Judges\u2019 comments for Chris and Dianne: Standing ovation in the studio. Motsi says \u201cI\u2019m impressed, timing was spot-on but two tiny hesitations at the end\u201d. Shirley says \u201cunbelievable musicality, lovely footwork and very good jive action\u201d. Anton says \u201cmarvellous and joyous\u201d. Craig concludes \u201cget up on your toes but packed full of rhythm, you can dance\u201d. Seveeeens incoming? Blind comedian Chris McCausland has been the story of the series so far. Now the metalhead is jiving to one of his favourite films, swapping last week\u2019s foxtrotting elegance for high-energy rock mayhem. Chris and partner Dianne Buswell are in Wayne and Garth wigs, baseball caps and ripped jeans. It\u2019s fast and relentless with kicks, flicks and tricks. Knee-slides, air guitar and headbanging. Solo sections which are all the more impressive. Lacks bounce, sharpness and retraction but ex-cellent! Schwing! Party on! We\u2019re not worthy! Other catchphrases! Song: Wayne\u2019s World Theme by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey. The 1992 comedy remains the highest-grossing Saturday Night Live spin-off film. There have been 12, including The Blues Brothers. Judges\u2019 scores for Toyah and Neil: 3, 4, 4, 4 for a total of 15 points. Dance-off danger. Judges\u2019 comments for Toyah and Neil: Shirley says \u201cpowerful and in control, some nice content but got on the wrong foot\u201d. Anton says \u201cwonderful storytelling but a couple of mistakes\u201d. Craig says \u201call a bit stuck in the mud, ploddy and floppy\u201d. Robert Fripp stands up to boo him. Motsi concludes \u201cupper half brilliant, lower half needed more\u201d. Fours, do we think? Last week\u2019s rather lucky dance-off survivors will be looking to bounce back but haven\u2019t got an easy dance to help them do so. Toyah Willcox is villainous sea witch Ursula, partnered by \u201cEel Jones\u201d. Octo-prop to start, which her husband Robert Fripp won\u2019t like \u2013 he has a phobia, of octopuses, apparently. It\u2019s a slow, spiteful sort of samba, cheeky and hammy but not terribly recognisable as the Rio carnival dance. She\u2019s fearless and committed but at the cost of technique. It\u2019s a bit walky aroundy, flat-footed and lacking any bounce. Weird. Song: Poor Unfortunate Souls from The Little Mermaid. It\u2019s a burlesque-meets-Broadway number in which Ursula persuades Ariel to trade her voice for the chance to become human. Melissa McCarthy performed it in last year\u2019s live-action film version. Charra Tea and Zahirah Zapanta from RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK is our Clauditorum guest, reading out the voting small print. Start your engines, Strictly. Judges\u2019 scores for Montell and Jojo: 7, 7, 7, 7 for a total of 28 points. Two down on last week but solid. Judges\u2019 comments for Montell and Jojo: Anton says \u201cstrong tango, you have the makings of a wonderful ballroom dancer but you got a little tight around the shoulders\u201d. Craig says \u201ciffy head placement but good frame\u201d. Motsi says \u201cstarted off well, then hesitated, fire not fear, let go\u201d. Shirley Poppins concludes \u201cdidn\u2019t disappoint, beautiful frame but got locked up\u201d. Sixes and sevens? Powerhouse couple Team Mojo are proving one of the surprise contenders this year. Can they maintain their top five form for a Tinseltown tango? Ex-Olympian Montell Douglas is going for gold in a glittery gown. She\u2019s playing Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s role as Deena the diva, based on Diana Ross, with Johannes Radebe donning a moustache for the Eddie Murphy role. It\u2019s a dapper, dramatic tango, telling a story through dance. Can she stay connected to Johannes and close her feet nicely? Lacking some fire and snapping staccato. Footwork hesitant and some gapping. Not her best for me. Song: One Night Only from Dreamgirls. A disco version of the soul ballad from the Broadway musical-turned-film. Danny Mac and Oti Mabuse also tangoed to it in the 2016 quarter-final, scoring a whopping 38 points. Our couples emerge on the staircase. It\u2019s fancy dress a-go-go. Barbie and Ken! Harry Potter people! Hats! Loincloths! Elderly Scottish housekeepers! Hello, dear! Here come our paddle-raising panel of Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Anton Du Beke and Shirley Ballas. They\u2019ve embraced the Movie Week theme and raised the BBC costume box. It\u2019s like some sort of sex panto out there. Finally, Shirley descends from the ceiling as Mary Poppins. Fundamentals, Shirl. Here come our Hollywood hosts with the mosts, so time for our weekly frock-off. Tess Daly is in a midnight blue sparkly jumpsuit. Claudia Winkleman is in a red lacy jumpsuit. Both look lovely but Tess wins. Gru eventually succumbs to the happiness and joins in with his little yellow pals. Despicably good fun, firmly targeted at younger viewers. It\u2019s wacky, it\u2019s colourful, it\u2019s hyperactive. And frankly, it\u2019s a bit cruise ship. We open with the professional dancers performing the first of two filmic group numbers this weekend. This one\u2019s a Minions-themed affair, choreographed by Lizzie Gough and Kieran Donovan. Kai Widdrington has donned a bald cap to play grumpy Gru. Aww, look, it\u2019s poor Tom Dean. Remember him? Tall swimmer fella? No? Hey, that\u2019s showbiz. Ah, textbook Claudia-and-Dave Arch punchline to finish. Slightly belatedly, presumably due to being one couple down. Cue the traditional movie-themed VT. Take your seats, switch off your phones and snog on the back row. We\u2019re about to go over live to Elstree Studios\u2026 Alan Carr\u2019s Numberwang just wrapping up on BBC1 now. Hurry up, Spexy Beast, we\u2019ve got themes to flog to within an inch of their lives. We began the series with a gender-imbalanced field of six female celebrities and nine males. Blame the Great Unpleasantness. Tonight it\u2019s a more even 6-to-7 split, since we\u2019re two men down - Tom Dean was eliminated and Nick Knowles is injured. With 13 dances instead of the scheduled 14, expect some frantic padding to fill the 135-minute running time. A mere five minutes until the glittery curtain comes up\u2026 Toyah Willcox is bookies\u2019 strong favourite for the second elimination, priced at evens to depart the contest this weekend. Paul Merson is predicted to face her in the dance-off, followed by Pete Wicks and Punam Krishnan. Nick Knowles would\u2019ve been in the mix too until that late knee-knacked withdrawal. Just 10 minutes until that ba-ba-daa theme tune\u2026 We\u2019re promised an array of big screen delights tonight, taking in everything from The Magnificent Seven to The Minions, from The Little Mermaid to Lara Croft, from boy wizards to Scottish housekeepers. It\u2019s a veritable twinkle-toed multiplex. Just 15 minutes until sequin time\u2026 Tick them off when you spy them on-screen! Take a drink for each! Get the hiccups and use a variety of bizarre methods to cure them! Here\u2019s your 10-point Movie Week spotter\u2019s checklist for tonight: A celebrity unconvincingly claims that they\u2019re paying tribute to their all-time favourite film Chronic overuse of the word \u201ciconic\u201d Chris McCausland makes a joke which Tess Daly doesn\u2019t get Shirley Ballas thanks couples for \u201copening our show\u201d and \u201cclosing our show\u201d Anton Du Beke makes a misty-eyed reference to his Movie Week routines of yore Craig argues with Shirley, while Motsi sits in the middle looking awkward Corny, overlong movie-themed montage with Craig playing the villain Claudia Winkleman honks with laughter at a Wynne Evans witticism Judges have no idea how to mark Couple\u2019s Choice so dish out random high scores Male celebrity distracts the judges with a bare chest or comedy wig We\u2019ll see the first Couple\u2019s Choice of the series tonight. Too soon? There will also be two sambas, two cha chas and two Viennese waltzes. Twenty minutes until the glitterball starts spinning\u2026 He\u2019s only just recovered from the bicep tear which reduced his training time last week. Now the DIY SOS host is crocked again. Nick Knowles and his pro partner Luba Mushtuk won\u2019t be dancing tonight after he sustained a knee injury yesterday\u2019s dress rehearsal and being sent for an MRI by medics. As per Strictly rules, the couple will receive a bye through to next weekend, when hopefully he\u2019ll be fit to dance again. If not, he\u2019ll have to withdraw from the contest. Unlucky Nick says he\u2019s determined to be back next Saturday, even if it\u2019s on glittery crutches. Somebody wrap him in cotton wool. Get ready to roll out the red carpet. Good evening and welcome to the first themed weekend of Strictly Come Dancing 2023. I\u2019m Michael, your usherette for tonight\u2019s Movie Week live show. You are cordially invited to watch along with me as our couples perform silver screen-inspired dances. Yep, fancy dress is 100% guaranteed. After last week\u2019s first elimination - ta-ta, Tom Dean \u2014 tonight our 13 surviving pro-celebrity pairs take to the Elstree Studios ballroom floor once again. Yes, it\u2019s 13 not 14 because Nick Knowles is out injured but hoping to be back next week. More on that in a moment. Tomorrow, the second couple will leave the contest. No more of this \u201cscores carried forward from last week\u201d business now the series is into its stride. Tonight\u2019s judgely marks will be combined with viewer votes, then the bottom two couples will hoof for survival on Sunday night. But who\u2019ll join sunken Olympic swimmer Tom on the sparkly scrapheap? It\u2019s showtime at 6.25pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 5.55pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and sarky asides. So stock up on popcorn, nachos and over-priced pick \u2019n\u2019 mix and I\u2019ll see you on the sofa. As always, I\u2019d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for the usual ballroom \u201cbantz\u201d. I\u2019ll swivel down there every now and again to gauge your reaction to the show. Don\u2019t be shy about sharing your thoughts. Hollywood and Bollywood are both coming to Borehamwood. Nearly time to staaaaaart cinematic dancing!",

No other side have done it on more than seven occasions. As Giorgio Chiellini observed after Juventus had scored twice in three second-half minutes to transform a Champions League tie Spurs had seemed to be dominating in 2018, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/08/giorgio-chiellini-spurs-mental-toughness-juventus-champions-league#:~:text=Chiellini%20argued%20that%20Juventus's%20triumph%20was%20built%20on%20their%20superior%20knowhow.&amp;text=%E2%80%9CIt's%20the%20history%20of%20Tottenham,to%20arrive%20at%20the%20end.\">this is the history of the Tottenham</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps in retrospect, there were just a couple of warning signs in the first half, the sense that Brighton had the capacity to slice Spurs open. But the story at the break seemed to be of Brighton\u2019s fragility, the remarkable vulnerability of their high line. There was the unusual sensation of watching a dogmatic approach being undone in a Spurs game and Ange Postecoglou being on the right side of it.</p> <p>The tone was set within 16 seconds as Dominic Solanke released Timo Werner behind Jo\u00ebl Veltman; again and again the away side hit the space <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/28/chelsea-brighton-premier-league-match-report\">Chelsea had exploited last week</a>. Fabian H\u00fcrzeler has insisted the issue is not the height of the line but a lack of pressure on the ball, but playing a line that high with players as slow on the turn as Lewis Dunk and Adam Webster means there is no failsafe such as, for instance, Spurs enjoy with the pace of Micky van de Ven. The loss of Webster to what appeared a hamstring injury after nine minutes only complicated matters further. Igor Julio came on, but Jan Paul van Hecke is badly missed.</p>    <p>Even allowing for the fact that Werner is not, it\u2019s fair to say, as lethal as Cole Palmer, the surprise was that it took 23 minutes for Spurs to take the lead. The method, though, was entirely predictable, as Georginio Rutter was dispossessed and Solanke fed Johnson to score his sixth in six games. The second, similarly, resulted from a simple transition, Solanke holding off Igor to play in Werner, who teed up James Maddison.</p> <p>Spurs could have got more before the break. As Postecoglou said, Spurs should have \u201cput the game to bed\u201d. He seemed almost shell-shocked afterwards, standing on the pitch for a lengthy period and then acknowledging that his side hadn\u2019t done the basics, that they hadn\u2019t competed after half-time. It wasn\u2019t just that they were open in the second half, it was that the life went out of them. Had more than three of this side played <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/03/ferencvaros-tottenham-europa-league-match-report\">away to Ferencvaros on Thursday</a>, it might have been tempting to blame fatigue, but there were no obvious explanations and, from Postecoglou\u2019s point of view, no excuses.</p> <p>After a promising start to the season, Brighton had run into a slightly sticky spell, failing to win any of their previous four league games. There have now been 20 goals in their past four games in all competitions; that might not be sustainable, but it is fun. Pervis Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s arrival for Ferdi Kalioglu at left-back helped shore up that side and, with a more solid platform, Kauro Mitoma suddenly was able to impose himself.</p> <p>Still, though, for all that Brighton improved, for all that they became more compact, for all the determined running of Rutter and the aerial threat of Danny Welbeck, it was hard to avoid the feeling that Tottenham gave this up. The first Brighton goal came after an air shot by Van de Van and a miskick by Destiny Udogie. The second came after Mitoma was allowed a run and Udogie\u2019s shove almost seemed to give Rutter the momentum to get past Van de Ven. And the third resulted from Rutter beating Udogie far too easily and Rodrigo Bentancur then being indecisive, allowing Rutter to cross.</p> <p>Brighton deserve credit, of course, but this was about Spurs\u2019 collapse. Postecoglou said he\u2019d seen nothing like this from his side before, but there had been elements of similar wastefulness against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/19/leicester-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/sep/01/newcastle-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">Newcastle</a>, games in which Spurs were the better side for significant periods but failed to win. And that, perhaps, is the true curse of Spursiness, the sense that there are always three teams on the pitch: Spurs, their opponents, and the demons of their worse natures.</p>",

But the Spursiness of Spurs is never to be underestimated. This was the 10th time Spurs have lost a Premier League game having been two goals up. No other side have done it on more than seven occasions. As Giorgio Chiellini observed after Juventus had scored twice in three second-half minutes to transform a Champions League tie Spurs had seemed to be dominating in 2018, \u201cthis is the history of the Tottenham\u201d. Perhaps in retrospect, there were just a couple of warning signs in the first half, the sense that Brighton had the capacity to slice Spurs open. But the story at the break seemed to be of Brighton\u2019s fragility, the remarkable vulnerability of their high line. There was the unusual sensation of watching a dogmatic approach being undone in a Spurs game and Ange Postecoglou being on the right side of it. The tone was set within 16 seconds as Dominic Solanke released Timo Werner behind Jo\u00ebl Veltman; again and again the away side hit the space Chelsea had exploited last week. Fabian H\u00fcrzeler has insisted the issue is not the height of the line but a lack of pressure on the ball, but playing a line that high with players as slow on the turn as Lewis Dunk and Adam Webster means there is no failsafe such as, for instance, Spurs enjoy with the pace of Micky van de Ven. The loss of Webster to what appeared a hamstring injury after nine minutes only complicated matters further. Igor Julio came on, but Jan Paul van Hecke is badly missed. Even allowing for the fact that Werner is not, it\u2019s fair to say, as lethal as Cole Palmer, the surprise was that it took 23 minutes for Spurs to take the lead. The method, though, was entirely predictable, as Georginio Rutter was dispossessed and Solanke fed Johnson to score his sixth in six games. The second, similarly, resulted from a simple transition, Solanke holding off Igor to play in Werner, who teed up James Maddison. Spurs could have got more before the break. As Postecoglou said, Spurs should have \u201cput the game to bed\u201d. He seemed almost shell-shocked afterwards, standing on the pitch for a lengthy period and then acknowledging that his side hadn\u2019t done the basics, that they hadn\u2019t competed after half-time. It wasn\u2019t just that they were open in the second half, it was that the life went out of them. Had more than three of this side played away to Ferencvaros on Thursday, it might have been tempting to blame fatigue, but there were no obvious explanations and, from Postecoglou\u2019s point of view, no excuses. After a promising start to the season, Brighton had run into a slightly sticky spell, failing to win any of their previous four league games. There have now been 20 goals in their past four games in all competitions; that might not be sustainable, but it is fun. Pervis Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s arrival for Ferdi Kalioglu at left-back helped shore up that side and, with a more solid platform, Kauro Mitoma suddenly was able to impose himself. Still, though, for all that Brighton improved, for all that they became more compact, for all the determined running of Rutter and the aerial threat of Danny Welbeck, it was hard to avoid the feeling that Tottenham gave this up. The first Brighton goal came after an air shot by Van de Van and a miskick by Destiny Udogie. The second came after Mitoma was allowed a run and Udogie\u2019s shove almost seemed to give Rutter the momentum to get past Van de Ven. And the third resulted from Rutter beating Udogie far too easily and Rodrigo Bentancur then being indecisive, allowing Rutter to cross. Brighton deserve credit, of course, but this was about Spurs\u2019 collapse. Postecoglou said he\u2019d seen nothing like this from his side before, but there had been elements of similar wastefulness against Leicester and Newcastle, games in which Spurs were the better side for significant periods but failed to win. And that, perhaps, is the true curse of Spursiness, the sense that there are always three teams on the pitch: Spurs, their opponents, and the demons of their worse natures.",

Nowhere is an unruly creation, sometimes frustratingly undisciplined, but with such rich moments that it feels like more than theatre, and asks something of its audience with its consciousness-raising message for peace at the end, which feels like a radical and urgent action in our world. \u2022 At Battersea Arts Centre, London, until 19 October; then Home, Manchester, 22-26 October",

By 2034, qualified GPs in England will deliver just 70% of all appointments at surgeries, down from the 90% who did so as recently as 2015, the analysis forecasts. Patients will increasingly see another type of health professional, such as a nurse, physiotherapist or pharmacist, when they visit their practice, Frontier Economics predicts. Rising demand for care driven by the ageing population and a rise in lifestyle-related illnesses, together with the trend towards family doctors working less than full-time hours, will mean GPs are unable to hold a consultation with everyone who wants to see them. Matthew Bell, the Frontier Economics director who led the research, said the government would have to help the public understand that traditional access to a GP would become harder to obtain in the future. The prime minister and Wes Streeting, the health secretary, have repeatedly promised to \u201cbring back the family doctor\u201d as a vital part of their plan to revive the NHS.

The prime minister is hoping the summit will send a clear signal to investors that Britain under Labour is open for business and encourage a fresh injection of private money to drive his growth agenda. The government said other confirmed speakers included the current president of Google\u2019s owner Alphabet, Ruth Porat; the chief executive of the Canadian investment firm Brookfield Asset Management, Bruce Flatt; and the boss of UK self-driving car technology startup Wayve, Alex Kendall.

Five wins in a row will do that sort of thing. Spurs were impressive against Manchester United, and then in midweek toughed it out at Ferencvaros. A win could take Ange Postecoglou\u2019s team into the top four, where they would like to be. Brighton haven\u2019t won in the Premier League since August and were on the wrong end of a thriller last week with Chelsea.

We paid the price. \u201cThe problem is we are travelling along too smoothly, football and life will trip you up if you get too far ahead of yourself. There is no message. It is a terrible loss for us - as bad as it gets. Only one way to fix it and that\u2019s my responsibility. Dom in Florence gets in touch: \u201cGenuinely Spurs are the weakest mentally in the league. How often can they look world beaters, should be well out of sight, get casual, concede and then IMMEDIATELY just run round like Penelope Pitstop with her hair on fire shouting HEEEEEEEELP!?. \u201dAs soon as Brighton scored my phone lit up like a Christmas tree with family &amp; friends saying we were doomed. And so it proved. TBF it\u2019s not just on Ange, but we need the flattest of tracks to get anything (eg United) \u201dAnd when things start to slip, then he just looks at wane after wave of attacks, and then goals, and just says \u201cOK let\u2019s just see where they are going with this\u2026.\u201d Ange Postecolglou spoke to the BBC: \u201cFair to say that the second half was unacceptable and we paid a price for that. We probably should have put it to bed in the first half. What we did in that second half is unacceptable and we got what we deserved. \u201cMaybe we just thought we\u2019d roll out there and play well again and that\u2019s not how it works and we paid for it. We\u2019ve conceded before but it is how you react and our reaction wasn\u2019t what it should be. It\u2019s a bad day for us and when it\u2019s a bad day the responsibility falls at my feet.\u201d Fair to say he didn\u2019t look up while saying that. Danny Welbeck speaks to Sky: \u201cAn amazing feeling. First half was embarrassing. The second half was about attiude. I was really peed off in the first half, there was an opportunity we had to do better with. \u201cWe have got to give credit to the senior boys who are not in the pitch the likes, of Steely [Jason Steele] and Milner [James Milner] - they told us the bare minimum is we\u2019ve got to fight. Everyone is together in this.\u201d So does Georginio Rutter: \u201cWe stayed together, and we had to believe. It\u2019s not about tactics, it\u2019s about fighting.\u201d Nayson Ratcliffe gets in touch: \u201cDid a fly on the wall hear Fabian H\u00fcrzeler at half time say: \u2019Jungs, es ist Tottenham\u2019\u201d Here\u2019s the table after the weekend of Premier League action. K\u00e1ri Tulinius gets in touch: \u201cI really think that Postecoglou is a football visionary, and that if he had the right team, they\u2019d sweep all before them. However, I\u2019m starting to think that this Spurs squad might not be right for him. The question is whether such a squad exists in the real world, or only in Ange\u2019s vision.\u201d What a comeback from Brighton, what a shambles from Tottenham, who had been so in the first half. Danny Welbeck is as good as ever, and his goal wins a minor Premier League classic. Fabian Hurzeler has a big beaming smile. Ange Postecoglou has seen a ghost, by the looks of things. The ghost of Spurs past, present and future. 90+4 min: Enciso tries to send away Gruda again. Relentless stuff from Brighton. Attack has been their form of defence. 90+3 min: The home fans are noisy, so much noisier than in that painful first half. Their team\u2019s second half has been excellent. 90+2 min: Brighton have men over as Enciso and Gruda the subs take too long. Danny Welbeck, the old warhorse, tells them they have been wasteful. 90 min: Four minutes to be added on. Spurs win a corner. Ange Postecoglou is shaking his head. 89 min: Spurs look to young Moore for salvation but he\u2019s closed down. Brighton look the fitter team. Still, Sarr arrows a ball at Solanke but the striker can achieve little. 88 min: All hands to the pump for Brighton. This would be a huge win, the first since August. There are few doubts against Hurzeler at the club but morale needed pepping up. 87 min: Off goes Minteh and on comes another Brighton winger, Bryan Gruda, making his first ever appearance for his new club. 85min: Minteh next shoots wide, and off goes Maddison, and on comes Moore. No pressure, Mike. 84 min: Mikey Moore is imminent for Tottenham. Udogie suddenly finds space and jabs a shot that Verbruggen saves well. Vindication after that earlier mistake\u2026..the ball flies down the other end and the excellent Minteh rides a tackle and only just runs out of room. Spurs were all over the place there. 83 min: Lots of snappy, scrappy stuff. Spurs playing hurry-up offense. The silkiness of the first half but a memory. They\u2019re going to have to tough it. 80 min: JW is in touch: \u201cWithout Son, Romero is captain. Yet it was clearly Vicario giving the big speech in the half time huddle and now we\u2019ve crumbled. No leadership on the field. Fuming.\u201d Here\u2019s where the recriminations begin, then. An uncomfortable fortnight awaits Ange if it stays this way. 79 min: The Timo show is over, with Bentancur off too. On come Sarr and Yves Bissouma, booed for the manner of his departure from Falmer. 78 min: Jeremy Boyce is back: \u201cSo all the same, we\u2019re still on for an 8 - 8, despite Mr Young\u2019s negativity ? When he\u2019s on it Mitoma is something else, isn\u2019t he ? And as a Leeds fan sad to see him go, good to see Rutter stepping up and slotting them in. I lived in Brighton for a while, great place. Good team.\u201d 77 min: Marlon Cameron gets in touch: \u201cWhat was that you were saying about a gulf in class?\u201d You can always build a bridge, I suppose. 76 min: Hinshelwood runs back to clear Brighton lines. It feels like the home team may come under the pump soon. That\u2019s the least of expectations from Tottenham. 74 min: Wieffer\u2019s first task is to be bounced over by Bentancur. 73 min: Brighton want to bring on Enciso. Off goes the excellent Rutter. Carlos \u201cI\u2019m A\u201d Baleba departs and on comes Wieffer. 71 min: Tottenham have what is a rare attack. And a corner The angle of Porro\u2019s ball is too wide, outswinging and cleared. Werner \u2013 a forgotten man \u2013 cuts inside. He shoots and, yes, misses. 69 min: Spurs reduced to reducers\u2026Mitoma is having one of those days. Kulusevsi goes into the book for hacking him down. Spurs seem angry with each other. 67 min: Spurs ragged, so ragged. Minteh is smashed down by Udogie. This is a painful lesson in Spurs lore. Nobody else does it like this. Oh my, Rutter sets on a solo run, hits the byline and scoops the ball on to the head of Welbeck. Brighton lead, and Tottenham are in ruins. 63 min: That corner is swept up, to relief from Tottenham. They\u2019re rocking back on their heels. 62 min: Brighton go close again. Welbeck skips on, and Mitoma has another effort. From the next passage of play, Minteh forces a corner. 60 min: And what noise in the Falmerdome, too. Ange\u2019s face is a picture. His team have done exactly what he probably told them not to do. 59 min: So much better from Brighton. Like they\u2019ve had 5800 MegaHurzelers jolted into them. Lads, it\u2019s Brighton. Mitoma zooms on, slips the ball inside. Rutter has work to do, but steps inside Van der Ven and scores. Ange Postecoglou fixes his eye-line ever lower than normal. 56 min: Mitoma is buzzing along, and forces a save from Vicario, End to end, stuff. Kulusevski scampers away, and aims his pass at Solanke, only for the danger to be cleared by Veltman. 55 min: Richard Hirst gets in touch: \u201cJust come in and caught up with the news of Barry Lloyd\u2019s death. 257 games for Fulham, and unused sub for the 1975 Cup Final; a good man. Also the subject of one of my favourite chants, not I think heard much these days: He\u2019s here, he\u2019s there We\u2019re not allowed to swear Barry Lloyd, Barry Lloyd 54 min: It\u2019s getting physical. Veltman, the first-half enforcer, clatters into Udogie and ends up knacking himself. 52 min: Spurs force a corner, Estupinan conceding. From the second ball, Porro finds Romero but the defender heads away \u2013 oddly. Next time, the offside flag rings out. 51 min: Brighton enjoying a level of possession that seemed beyond them in that first half. Though when they did play well in the first half, those were the moments they conceded. 49 min: Spurs defended rather too much like Brighton in the first half for that game. Hurzeler\u2019s team talk has had its effect. Brighton back in it. Mitoma\u2019s ball, Udogie and van der Ven fail to clear. Minteh forces it home game on. 46 minutes: There\u2019s been a Brighton change, with Kadioglu departing the scene, and Estupinan is on. The Ecuadorian can maybe add some thrust down the flank. Brighton have been bamboozled, and Tottenham excellent. Brennan Johnson\u2019s finish was fine, James Maddison was a tad lucky. A couple of decent Brighton chances draw only a fig leaf over the gulf in class between these two. 45+2 min: A case in point: Rutter, a passenger all half, is miles offside when the ball is played to him. 45+1 min: Spurs invite on the Brighton press but the home team are struggling to put anything together. 45 min: Three minutes are added on, and the Falmerdome is very quiet. 44 min: It could have been three, Johnson outmuscling the tracking run of Mitoma to thrash over the bar. Ange is aghast though that looked a difficult chance. 42 min: Brighton seek their way back, but Tottenham seek to see out the half. As was pointed out elsewhere, they have a fine defensive record. 40 min: Van der Ven\u2019s speed stops Welbeck\u2019s run. The quickest in the business \u2013 confirmed. 38 min: Spurs look very good, full of attacking dimensions. They have had a share of fortune with that goal but have been easily the better team. Still, from Kadioglu\u2019s ball from the flank, Welbeck heads wide. That Brighton pressure means more room for Tottenham. Solanke out to Werner, the ball slotted inside to Maddison, who strokes it goalwards, and Verbruggen makes a hash of it. The goalie holds his head in despair. 36 min: Welbeck gets down the channels, and Mioma and him exchange passes. Eventually, Mitoma lands the ball on Hinshelwood\u2019s head but the ball drifts behind. 35 min: Can Brighton maintain the momentum they have at last located? 33 min: Sudden waves of Brighton attacks, Minteh to the fore, and a corner forced. The corner sees a foul. Veltman and Maddison at it? Next, Igor Julio yellow-carded for bringing down Kulusevski. 32 min: And yet, Brighton almost score. Mitoma\u2019s cross is a beauty, and Welbeck misses, Oh Danny, Danny. That\u2019s a sore one. 30 min: As if to illustrate that, Lewis Dunk is forced into using his turning circle to clear the ball. 29 min: Jeers from the Tottenham vans as Verbruggen is forced to thwack the ball out of play. In the battle of high-pressing, Spurs are winning. 27 min: Some ludicrous acting, as Maddison and Veltman clash. The Dutchman accuses him of diving. Then does a theatrical fall to make his point. No booking, and Veltman makes a limp-wristed gesture to his foe. Amusing stuff. More please? 26 min: A rare Brighton attack, but Mitoma is disappointed when he doesn\u2019t get on the receiving end. 25 min: With that goal, Johnson has equalled a feat by Harry Kane. Remember him? Brighton have no answer to Spurs\u2019 pace all over the park. Another goal \u2013 sixth in a row \u2013 from Johnson. Fine play from Solanke, winning the loose ball and Johnson scores. That goal had been coming. Spurs have been excellent. 21 min: Porro gallops down the wing, ball to Johnson, and then a ball into Werner, the header down, and Maddison pokes in. Offside. Though how? 19th min: Verbruggen can only shank the ball back to Spurs. Brighton camped in their area. This is not how they usually have to play. Big test for their young manager. Lewis Dunk is having to do some old-style stopping, and comes across to stop Solanke. 16th min: Here\u2019s some zip from Timo Werner, and Lewis Dunk closes down Udogie. Brighton are trying to play out from defence but are really struggling. Tottenham pushing up high. 15th min: On the Sky broadcast, Alan Smith has just admitted he got three points on his driving licence for doing 24 in a 20. The game\u2019s not that bad. Much more zip than at Villa Park. 14 min: Here comes the Irish question, from Tik: \u201cDoes Evan Ferguson need to wait for Danny Welbeck to start collecting his pension before he starts again or is it time for him to go on loan in January, even if it\u2019s in the Championship? With Pedro out injured and Evan back training full time for about two months surely if Hurzeler had any intention of using him it would have happened by now.\u201d 13 min: Mary Waltz gets in touch: \u201cJohn good morning from California. Praying for an exciting match. Watched the first half of the United v Villa tussle, it put me to sleep so I switched to the Chelsea Forrest fixture and was rewarded with a slam bang 1-1 draw and followed the United snooze fest on the MBM. When the MBM is better than the actual match it is so sad.\u201d So does Tim Young: \u201cI notice in your MBM a contributor suggesting that the way these two teams are \u2018scoring and conceding\u2019 it could be 8-8, reflecting the commonly held view that both teams have been profligate at the back. But Tottenham have so far conceded the second fewest goals in the league, so why do you think this idea has become so well accepted as true?\u201d Tim, it\u2019s Spurs. 11 min: Porro \u2013 with his wand of a right foot \u2013 hits a diag Maddison might have done rather better with. Next, Mitoma looks to get away for the first time. He\u2019s offside; Ange using the halfway line again. Risky business. 10 min: How do Brighton respond? They almost catch out Bentancur with the highest of presses, Spurs desperately clearing the danger. 8 min: That will be it for Webster. Igor Julio will come on. Webster in some pain, having had a mare last week at Chelsea. Good player, Webster, and a reminder the lower leagues bring through plenty. Julio speeds on. 7 min: Baleba tries to cut back but is crowded out. Adam Webster is down, and injured. He pulled it when clearing his lines, a hamstring or a calf injury. 5 min: Another Tottenham attack, Brighton so open. Romero\u2019s ball is a beauty and Maddison has time once he brings down the ball, and Webster blocks. 3 min: Brighton try and get a move underway but Udogie clears his lines when the exciting, speedy Minteh looks to get away. Spurs go back to the other end, Kulusevski cuts the ball in and Dunk uses his experience to put the block in. It\u2019s an open game so far. 1 min: Spurs get off to a flier, and it\u2019s the Timo show underway. Does he shoot? No, he aims a pass at Brennan Johnson. And misses his target. The players pay tribute to Barry Lloyd, the club\u2019s one-time manager and chief scout. A name from a very different Brighton. Pascal Gross \u2013 or is that Gro\u00df? \u2013 is shown off to the Falmer faithful, as a means of saying goodbye. He\u2019s at Dortmund now. What a player he was for Brighton. One of those so underrated he\u2019s rated players. Via the BBC: Some interesting quotes from Ange Postecoglou, who welcomed Fabian Hurzeler to Tottenham\u2019s training facility last season. \u201cHe spent a day with us. He asked a lot of questions and I gave him too many answers, for sure. \u201cI actually palmed him off at one stage because he was asking too many. I passed him to the other coaches. He was inquisitive about everything. He was already a senior manager, doing a good job, and the fact that he still wanted to ask questions - he made a real impression on everyone.\u201d Yash Gupta gets in touch: \u201cDavid Squires made cartoon about Werner after Chelsea-Man City final in 2021. Best player on land outside box. Okay maybe 6th best in this Tottenham team. As long as he contributes well, I think his \u2018show\u2019 can be sidelined for now.\u201d I\u2019m a fan. A total entertainer. Congratulations, Daniel Harris, for staying awake during this. I was glad the Arc came on in the second half. Elsewhere, Chelsea and Nottingham Forest drew 1-1. That\u2019s a fine result for Nuno, a manager we all wrote off, didn\u2019t we. (OK, I did.) Jeremy Boyce gets in touch: \u201cGiven the way these two are scoring and conceding it\u2019s either 8 - 8 or 0 - 0 isn\u2019t it?\u201d Getting that vibe, yes. Last time out for these two teams. Fabian Hurzeler makes two changes from Chelsea last week. Yankuba Minteh and Joel Veltman in, Mats Wieffer and Pervis Estupinan dropping to the bench. Ange Postecoglou opts for the same team that smashed Manchester United. That means the Timo Werner show rolls on. Brighton: Verbruggen, Kadioglu, Webster, Dunk, Veltman, Hinshelwood, Baleba, Minteh, Rutter, Mitoma, Welbeck. Subs: Steele, Lamptey, Igor, Gruda, Enciso, Ayari, Wieffer, Ferguson, Estupinan. Tottenham Hotspur: Vicario, Porro, Romero, van de Ven, Udogie, Kulusevski, Bentancur, Maddison, Johnson, Solanke, Werner. Subs: Forster, Dragusin, Bissouma, Gray, Bergvall, Spence, Sarr, Lankshear, Moore. As the season starts to shake out, Brighton\u2019s great start to the season has dissipated, and so have fears that Tottenham are about to explode. Five wins in a row will do that sort of thing. Spurs were impressive against Manchester United, and then in midweek toughed it out at Ferencvaros. A win could take Ange Postecoglou\u2019s team into the top four, where they would like to be. Brighton haven\u2019t won in the Premier League since August and were on the wrong end of a thriller last week with Chelsea. Fabian Hurzeler\u2019s already shown off that he has fire in his belly, and so does Ange. So let\u2019s hope for fireworks in Falmer. Kick-off at 4.30pm, UK time. Join me.",

      "bodyText": "The Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson is expected to discover on Monday whether there will be any repercussions after video showed him putting his hand in the face of Morato during a fiery 1-1 draw with Nottingham Forest at Stamford Bridge. However, Chelsea\u2019s head coach, Enzo Maresca, urged his players to carry on fighting to continue their strong start to the season. Jackson, who had been substituted, emerged from the stand to join 15 to 20 players and staff in a brawl as tempers flared. Footage showed him apparently flailing to reach Morato, a second-half substitute for Callum Hudson-Odoi. Video assistant referee officials confirmed they had seen the incident but did not consider it obvious enough violent conduct to change the decision of the on-field referee, Graham Kavanagh, to show yellow cards only to Marc Cucurella and Neco Williams. Professional Game Match Officials Limited considers the matter closed and Jackson is expected to escape sanction but the Football Association will make a final decision after assessing the referee\u2019s report. Chelsea face an FA hearing and a \u00a325,000 fine after six of their players were booked, the second time that has happened this season, and it remains to be seen whether the scenes are could be regarded as bringing the game into disrepute, aside from any individual disciplinary charges. Wesley Fofana was one of those booked and he and Cucurella will miss the Liverpool fixture under the totting-up procedure. \u201cIf you ask me if I prefer when something like that happens \u2013 I like the spirit of our team,\u201d Maresca said. \u201cIn terms of emotion, the team is fighting altogether and I don\u2019t think some of them lose their heads.

      "body": "<p>My favourite Benjamin Disraeli story \u2013 in a crowded if largely apocryphal field \u2013 comes from a dinner party the then prime minister attended in the late 1870s. War is raging in the Balkans, and with public opinion overwhelmingly in favour of a British intervention, the mood at the table is understandably tense. Eventually one guest, unable to bear the awkward silence any longer, bursts out: \u201cMr Disraeli, <em>what</em> are you waiting for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt this moment, madam,\u201d Disraeli replies, \u201cthe potatoes.\u201d</p> <p>I ended up thinking about this story quite a bit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/06/aston-villa-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">during the 0-0 draw at Villa Park</a> on Sunday afternoon, which tells you pretty much everything you need to know about a game defined \u2013 to an unusual degree \u2013 by waiting. Waiting for United to take a goal kick to Andr\u00e9 Onana. Waiting for Onana to then decide what to do with the ball. Waiting for the ball to land after another soaring clearance. Waiting for corners and free-kicks and substitutions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/06/erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-aston-villa-football-premier-league\">Ten Hag confident Manchester United owners retain support after Villa draw</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Waiting for five minutes near the end for the referee Robert Jones to change his VAR radio. Waiting for anything to happen, the lightning bolt of divine prerogative that would somehow make all the waiting worthwhile.</p> <p>Which, of course, it never did. This is the beauty of football, particularly league football: it offers no guarantees. Nothing <em>has</em> to happen. Your hard work often goes unrewarded. You do not always get the thing you deserve. Most shots miss their target, most attacks peter out, most corners come to nothing, most cup runs end in failure and statistically speaking this is almost certainly not going to be \u201cyour year\u201d.</p> <p>By now the hierarchy of Manchester United will be aware that this is not going to be their year either, not that they needed to sit through 97 minutes of Midlands coma to work that out. Last month their chief executive, Omar Berrada, claimed with an entirely straight face that United were targeting the 2027-28 Premier League title, an objective that somehow manages to feel wildly ambitious and wildly unambitious at the same time.</p>    <p>Erik ten Hag offered a similar prognosis in his press conference here, addressing questions about United\u2019s lack of potency and cohesion with a promise that \u201cone day it will click\u201d. Right now United feel like a club locked in a holding pattern, offering up comforting visions of the future as an antidote to the misrule of the present.</p> <p>Waiting for things to click. Waiting because on some level they have convinced themselves that waiting carries its own intrinsic virtue. Waiting because Alex Ferguson got time, and so all United managers must get time. Waiting because these are serious men, and serious men do not rush.</p> <p>In the meantime a club marooned in the bottom half of the table has to approach these games with a certain humility. A point at Aston Villa, in the circumstances, is an excellent result. Does it tell us very much about Ten Hag\u2019s team beyond that? Not sure. Villa, perhaps understandably after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/02/aston-villa-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report\">the sugar rush of Bayern Munich</a> last Wednesday night, were actually pretty poor: ponderous in buildup, not creative enough in the United half, the final ball often woeful.</p> <p>Allied to which, we need to acknowledge that this was a United team sent out \u2013 above all \u2013 not to lose. In defence Jonny Evans and Harry Maguire were reunited in a surprising tribute to the Leicester City backline of 2018-19. On the flanks Marcus Rashford and later Antony were almost auxiliary full-backs at times, as preoccupied by the threat of Lucas Digne than anything they might be able to conjure themselves. Ten Hag\u2019s pride at a fourth clean sheet in the league the season was a pretty good barometer of his priorities.</p> <p>And all this is offered not as criticism but merely as observation. Slow, painstaking, often fitful improvement is the only way this festering ghost ship is ever going to right itself. Sometimes it\u2019s going to work, sometimes you\u2019re going to grind out 0-0 draws away from home, sometimes Rasmus H\u00f8jlund is going to spend the entire game running away from the ball like a scared cat \u2013 and sometimes it\u2019s going to be all three.

      "bodyText": "My favourite Benjamin Disraeli story \u2013 in a crowded if largely apocryphal field \u2013 comes from a dinner party the then prime minister attended in the late 1870s. War is raging in the Balkans, and with public opinion overwhelmingly in favour of a British intervention, the mood at the table is understandably tense. Eventually one guest, unable to bear the awkward silence any longer, bursts out: \u201cMr Disraeli, what are you waiting for?\u201d \u201cAt this moment, madam,\u201d Disraeli replies, \u201cthe potatoes.\u201d I ended up thinking about this story quite a bit during the 0-0 draw at Villa Park on Sunday afternoon, which tells you pretty much everything you need to know about a game defined \u2013 to an unusual degree \u2013 by waiting. Waiting for United to take a goal kick to Andr\u00e9 Onana. Waiting for Onana to then decide what to do with the ball. Waiting for the ball to land after another soaring clearance. Waiting for corners and free-kicks and substitutions. Waiting for five minutes near the end for the referee Robert Jones to change his VAR radio. Waiting for anything to happen, the lightning bolt of divine prerogative that would somehow make all the waiting worthwhile. Which, of course, it never did. This is the beauty of football, particularly league football: it offers no guarantees. Nothing has to happen. Your hard work often goes unrewarded. You do not always get the thing you deserve. Most shots miss their target, most attacks peter out, most corners come to nothing, most cup runs end in failure and statistically speaking this is almost certainly not going to be \u201cyour year\u201d. By now the hierarchy of Manchester United will be aware that this is not going to be their year either, not that they needed to sit through 97 minutes of Midlands coma to work that out. Last month their chief executive, Omar Berrada, claimed with an entirely straight face that United were targeting the 2027-28 Premier League title, an objective that somehow manages to feel wildly ambitious and wildly unambitious at the same time. Erik ten Hag offered a similar prognosis in his press conference here, addressing questions about United\u2019s lack of potency and cohesion with a promise that \u201cone day it will click\u201d. Right now United feel like a club locked in a holding pattern, offering up comforting visions of the future as an antidote to the misrule of the present. Waiting for things to click. Waiting because on some level they have convinced themselves that waiting carries its own intrinsic virtue. Waiting because Alex Ferguson got time, and so all United managers must get time. Waiting because these are serious men, and serious men do not rush. In the meantime a club marooned in the bottom half of the table has to approach these games with a certain humility. A point at Aston Villa, in the circumstances, is an excellent result. Does it tell us very much about Ten Hag\u2019s team beyond that? Not sure. Villa, perhaps understandably after the sugar rush of Bayern Munich last Wednesday night, were actually pretty poor: ponderous in buildup, not creative enough in the United half, the final ball often woeful. Allied to which, we need to acknowledge that this was a United team sent out \u2013 above all \u2013 not to lose. In defence Jonny Evans and Harry Maguire were reunited in a surprising tribute to the Leicester City backline of 2018-19. On the flanks Marcus Rashford and later Antony were almost auxiliary full-backs at times, as preoccupied by the threat of Lucas Digne than anything they might be able to conjure themselves. Ten Hag\u2019s pride at a fourth clean sheet in the league the season was a pretty good barometer of his priorities. And all this is offered not as criticism but merely as observation. Slow, painstaking, often fitful improvement is the only way this festering ghost ship is ever going to right itself. Sometimes it\u2019s going to work, sometimes you\u2019re going to grind out 0-0 draws away from home, sometimes Rasmus H\u00f8jlund is going to spend the entire game running away from the ball like a scared cat \u2013 and sometimes it\u2019s going to be all three. Patience is an admirable trait. But let\u2019s not pretend it earns you anything on its own. United have an executive board meeting in London for Tuesday, a scheduled diary event that will nonetheless be described in the media as a \u201ccrunch meeting\u201d, a \u201ccrisis summit\u201d, \u201cTen Hag sack talks\u201d and so on. Perhaps if the manager is moved on, there may also be some scrutiny of the decision to offer him a new contract in July, after spending a good portion of the summer undermining what was left of his authority. The likeliest prescription, by contrast, is probably a little more waiting. A little more commitment to the process. A little more standing firm, maintaining their focus, sticking to the plan, even if that plan has so far yielded five goals in seven games, 14th in the table and a centre-back pairing out of an ITV2 detective drama. What are they waiting for? At this moment, it\u2019s not entirely clear.",

      "body": "<p>Herman Ouseley, who has died aged 79, was a public servant and campaigner who worked at three levels of government to bring an understanding of the challenges faced by the UK\u2019s black population into the heart of the political establishment. </p> <p>He did so by creating a link between the neighbourhood-level impacts of racism and the possibility of using the institutions of government to deliver change, during a period when Britain was moving on painfully from the early post-Windrush decades to the multiracial society it is today.</p> <p>Working in community relations in south London in the 1970s, Ouseley became head of a pioneering ethnic minorities unit at the Greater London council under Ken Livingstone in the 80s and was appointed in the 90s as chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, where one of his most high-profile achievements was to establish the <a href=\"https://www.kickitout.org/\">Let\u2019s Kick Racism Out of Football</a> programme to tackle the racial abuse of professional footballers.</p> <p>Despite other possibilities open to him, Ouseley chose the government route to tackling racial discrimination, and it was only after a career in government administration that he went on to become a campaigner, albeit within politically non-aligned bodies. This approach allowed him a degree of independence that made it easier for the establishment to accept someone with radical aspirations in terms of equality and racial justice.</p> <p>Ouseley was born in British Guiana (now Guyana). His father, a baker, died when he was seven, after which his mother remarried and moved to the UK to work as a nurse. Initially Herman remained in British Guiana, but at the age of 11 he moved to live with his mother in Peckham, south-east London, attending William Penn school in Dulwich and then Catford College.</p>    <p>This was a London where race riots took place in 1958, two years after his arrival. Gangs of young white men, spurred on by far-right politicians, rioted in Notting Hill against the local Caribbean population. Black people in Britain were the object of virtually unchallenged racism until the passage of the Race Relations Act, 1965, and Ouseley recalled that \u201cI was called a black bastard and beaten up on the way home from school.\u201d</p> <p>He started his local government career as a clerical officer at Middlesex county council in 1963, then became a community relations worker in a Lambeth council-supported organisation helping young black people. By the end of the 70s he ran Lambeth\u2019s community relations unit, which proved a stepping stone to the GLC, where he became head of its ethnic minorities unit from 1981 to 1984.</p> <p>Livingstone was leader of the GLC at the time, in charge of a radical administration that prioritised initiatives and funding for minority communities. Like Livingstone, Ouseley believed in the need for deliberate policies to promote more black people and, among other things, to confront racism in textbooks. Such policies were often lampooned at the time but are now seen as mainstream. </p> <p>No less radical and controversial than the GLC was Lambeth council, to where Ouseley next moved, as assistant chief executive in 1984. At the time \u201cRed\u201d <a href=\"https://insidecroydon.com/2020/03/31/corbyn-leads-tributes-to-ted-knight-a-champion-for-the-people/\">Ted Knight</a> was leader, engaged in a full-throttle fight with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\">Margaret Thatcher</a>\u2019s government over rate capping.</p> <p> But the council\u2019s administration was in a poor state, with its leadership more interested in ideology than running services effectively, and Ouseley left in 1986 to become director of education at the Inner London Education Authority (Ilea).</p> <p>The GLC was abolished that year, leaving Ilea as a residual curiosity, running schools and colleges in the inner London boroughs. Ouseley went on to be its chief executive from 1988 to 1990 until it, too, was abolished. After Ilea he became chief executive of Lambeth council, starting the long process of rebuilding its poorly run services.</p> <p>He was thus employed throughout a decade of political struggle between an ideological Conservative government and radical Labour local authorities. It is hard to exaggerate how bitter the political mood was. Running complex public services in a vast city is difficult at the best of times, but Ouseley was adept at surviving, in part because he treated politicians on all sides with respect.</p> <p>In 1993 the Conservative home secretary Kenneth Clarke appointed Ouseley to chair the CRE, feeling that his performance in starting to turn Lambeth around showed that he might be able to get to grips with the CRE\u2019s own internal strife. Ouseley\u2019s greatest mark at the CRE came to be seen as his creation of Let\u2019s Kick Racism Out of Football, later shortened to Kick It Out, which he formally launched alongside the Chelsea player Paul Elliott, with support from the <a href=\"http://\">Professional Footballers Association</a> chair Gordon Taylor and black players, including Wimbledon\u2019s John Fashanu.</p> <p>Ouseley explained at the time that when he himself started playing club football in the 60s \u201cchanging rooms were filled with talk of the N word \u2026 You had to keep your cool or leave. I wasn\u2019t prepared to walk away.\u201dBy getting high-profile clubs involved, Ouseley was able to encourage others to join, though it proved hard to convince some clubs and managers that there really was a problem. He fought not only for black players but against antisemitic chanting, and remained chair of Kick It Out for 25 years.</p> <p>Ouseley\u2019s willingness to confront controversial issues affecting the politics of race relations was clear in a report he wrote in 2001, the year after he left the CRE, about race relations in Bradford, commissioned by Bradford Vision, a local organisation chaired by the Conservative council leader Margaret Eaton.</p> <p>Ouseley pointed to communities\u2019 ignorance of each other and the influence of segregated schooling within the city. \u201cDifferent cultural communities believe they get nothing, while others get all the benefits,\u201d he said, in remarks that could easily be applied to many parts of Britain today. West Yorkshire police were criticised in his report for being afraid to tackle ethnic minority crime for fear of being labelled racist.</p> <p>From 1997 to 2019 Ouseley chaired the London-based <a href=\"https://chandranfoundationuk.org/\">Chandran Foundation</a>, which provides education and employment opportunities for disadvantaged young people. He was also a longstanding council member on the Institute of Race Relations, and chaired the Ujima and Carib housing associations.</p> <p>Knighted in 1997, he was made a peer in 2001, sitting as a crossbencher in the House of Lords, where he spoke mainly on equality, policing, education and sport. He sat on the board of the Manchester United Foundation and was a fan of that club as well as Millwall and Dulwich Hamlet.</p> <p>In 1972 he married Margaret (nee Neill), a teacher. She survives him, along with a son and a daughter.</p> <p>\u2022 Herman George Ouseley, Lord Ouseley, public servant and campaigner, born 24 March 1945; died 2 October 2024</p>",

Ouseley\u2019s greatest mark at the CRE came to be seen as his creation of Let\u2019s Kick Racism Out of Football, later shortened to Kick It Out, which he formally launched alongside the Chelsea player Paul Elliott, with support from the Professional Footballers Association chair Gordon Taylor and black players, including Wimbledon\u2019s John Fashanu. Ouseley explained at the time that when he himself started playing club football in the 60s \u201cchanging rooms were filled with talk of the N word \u2026 You had to keep your cool or leave. I wasn\u2019t prepared to walk away.\u201dBy getting high-profile clubs involved, Ouseley was able to encourage others to join, though it proved hard to convince some clubs and managers that there really was a problem. He fought not only for black players but against antisemitic chanting, and remained chair of Kick It Out for 25 years. Ouseley\u2019s willingness to confront controversial issues affecting the politics of race relations was clear in a report he wrote in 2001, the year after he left the CRE, about race relations in Bradford, commissioned by Bradford Vision, a local organisation chaired by the Conservative council leader Margaret Eaton. Ouseley pointed to communities\u2019 ignorance of each other and the influence of segregated schooling within the city. \u201cDifferent cultural communities believe they get nothing, while others get all the benefits,\u201d he said, in remarks that could easily be applied to many parts of Britain today. West Yorkshire police were criticised in his report for being afraid to tackle ethnic minority crime for fear of being labelled racist. From 1997 to 2019 Ouseley chaired the London-based Chandran Foundation, which provides education and employment opportunities for disadvantaged young people. He was also a longstanding council member on the Institute of Race Relations, and chaired the Ujima and Carib housing associations. Knighted in 1997, he was made a peer in 2001, sitting as a crossbencher in the House of Lords, where he spoke mainly on equality, policing, education and sport. He sat on the board of the Manchester United Foundation and was a fan of that club as well as Millwall and Dulwich Hamlet. In 1972 he married Margaret (nee Neill), a teacher. She survives him, along with a son and a daughter. \u2022 Herman George Ouseley, Lord Ouseley, public servant and campaigner, born 24 March 1945; died 2 October 2024",

The only thing to correct it is to get the points, but with the way they\u2019re playing at the moment that\u2019s going to be hard to do.\u201d Unai Emery, the Aston Villa manager, conceded it was a \u201cfair\u201d result and acknowledged Wednesday\u2019s Champions League win over Bayern Munich affected their performance. \u201cOf course, playing in Europe and a match like Manchester United, the demands for us are tough,\u201d Emery said. \u201cWe were planning on imposing ourselves and dominating. We wanted to forget Wednesday and play with all of our energy. Maybe we needed some refreshed players.\u201d Emery cast doubt over Ezri Konsa joining up with England for their Nations League double-header against Greece and Finland after the Villa defender was forced off 12 minutes into the match with an apparent hamstring injury. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a big or small injury,\u201d Emery said. \u201cHopefully he can rest during the international break. We can try to recover our energy.\u201d",

He entered No 10 as head of political strategy, in charge of charting the party\u2019s path to another victory in five years\u2019 time. When it emerged there were rival power bases around McSweeney and Gray in No 10, few had any doubt he would survive any fallout. He has now emerged as chief of staff, with unrivalled influence, and is likely to bring a much sharper political focus to the job. McSweeney is adored by many staffers, with some party figures retaining more affection for him than they do for Starmer. The highest form of praise in Labour HQ has been said to be: \u201cMorgan loves it.\u201d However, he is something of a bogeyman on the left after leading the thinktank Labour Together in a campaign to purge the party of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s influence. After working in Labour\u2019s attack unit in the New Labour years, McSweeney cut his teeth as chief of staff to the then Lambeth council leader Steve Reed, who is now a cabinet minister, and helped defeat the British National party in Barking and Dagenham. Born in Ireland, he divides his time between Scotland and Westminster. His wife, Imogen Walker, is Labour\u2019s MP for Hamilton and Clyde Valley. James Lyons, director of strategic communications Lyons is hugely experienced as a former tabloid and broadsheet journalist who went on to big jobs in PR dealing with crisis situations, and boasts connections in Westminster among journalists and politicians. Having worked for the Daily Mirror and Sunday Times, he became a communications chief for the NHS in 2017 and rose to a director job, helping the health service navigate the challenges of the Covid pandemic. He left the job last year to join the Chinese-owned social media company TikTok. Vidhya Alakeson, deputy chief of staff Alakeson was Starmer\u2019s director of external relations in opposition and entered No 10 as political director, running a team to help shape messaging, conduct research and keep the government on the front foot. Her new role as deputy chief of staff is likely to still be highly political. She previously worked as deputy director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank and was the founder of a charitable trust, Power to Change, that supports community businesses. Jill Cuthbertson, deputy chief of staff Cuthbertson is one of the prime minister\u2019s most relied-upon political organisers and gatekeepers. She entered No 10 in a senior role as director of government relations and will now be a co-deputy chief of staff. \u201cShe never drops a ball,\u201d says one colleague. Ninjeri Pandit, principal private secretary Pandit is a former NHS digital executive who joined No 10 to focus on health policy. She became director of its policy unit and will now be the prime minister\u2019s principal private secretary \u2013 a key civil service role. Pandit was once praised by Dominic Cummings in a blog as one of \u201cthe brilliant women around the table\u201d who would have done the job of prime minister \u201c10 times better\u201d than Boris Johnson.",

Its main thesis was that cultural changes don\u2019t take place as a matter of steady gradualism but instead reach a critical mass that opens the flood gates or enables a trend or product to \u201cgo viral\u201d.</p> <p>The book, his first, itself acted like an infectious virus, as it went on to sell millions around the world. It also helped create a new genre, which mixed science and business and popular culture with counterintuitive theories, a formula repeated by books such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/jul/24/society1\">Freakonomics</a></em> and host of other imitators, and one more or less reused by Gladwell himself in a further six bestselling books.</p> <p>Now he has returned to that first trendsetter with <em>Revenge of the Tipping Point</em>. Apparently, his initial intention was simply to update the first book, but in the process he realised that he wanted to write a completely new work. The result is an odd and occasionally frustrating confection that takes the (sometimes disputed) conclusions of the original as a given, and then sets off on a self-consciously digressive examination of Miami\u2019s corruption problem, a suicide outbreak at an elite school and the struggle for same-sex marriage, among several other seemingly unrelated subjects.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the book has something new to say beyond what was written a quarter of a century ago, then it\u2019s never made entirely clear</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What was once novel and bracing has hardened over the years into a structural cliche, a storytelling tease designed not just to defer intellectual satisfaction, but to suggest a join-the-dots hidden narrative that will eventually cohere into a revelatory unifying theme. That moment never quite arrives. Along the way there are plenty of interesting facts and thought-provoking ideas but Gladwell introduces them with prose that has evolved (or devolved) from a variation of the middle-highbrow <em>New Yorker</em> house style into something much more folksy and podcast-like. His sentences are littered with phrases such as \u201cOh my\u201d and \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d and \u201cYou guessed it\u201d, as though his readers are looking for conspiratorial bonhomie, as though, in other words, they are fans.</p> <p>None of that would matter very much if the book held together as a well-argued thesis, but if it has something new to say beyond what was written a quarter of a century ago, then it\u2019s never made entirely clear. It starts out with a political hearing in which the identities of the participants are concealed, but which obviously concerns Purdue Pharma, the company that triggered the opioid crisis in the US. Sure enough, Gladwell reveals what we already knew in a final chapter that rehashes this well-covered story.</p> <p>The point he\u2019s seeking to make in the intervening 300 pages is that epidemics \u2013 whether opioid, Covid, white flight, or any other kind \u2013 all have causes and rules and therefore appropriate measures can be taken. It\u2019s just that he takes an awfully roundabout way of getting there; so roundabout, in fact, that this reader often lost his way. Gladwell seems alive to this danger because he keeps having to summarise \u201cwhat we\u2019ve learned so far\u201d, and then open sections with sentences such as: \u201cSo: Back to the LA survivors club\u2026 in the late 1950s.\u201d</p> <p>That particular switchback concerns the plight of Holocaust survivors relocated to California, and how for three decades after the war they kept their horrific stories to themselves. What changed everything, argues Gladwell, is an American TV miniseries in 1978 called <em>Holocaust</em> that suddenly enabled public discussion of the Nazi genocide three decades before. There\u2019s certainly good evidence that the drama popularised the word \u201cHolocaust\u201d, which helped define the horror and allow it to be discussed. For Gladwell, this meant it changed what he calls the \u201coverstory\u201d, the meta-narrative in which all epidemics \u2013 good and bad \u2013 unfold.</p> <p>It\u2019s one of a number of less-than-scientific terms that Gladwell employs as though they were established paradigms. He refers elsewhere in the book to the \u201cMagic Third\u201d, the fraction of a group that is required to effect change, as a \u201cuniversal law. (Or at least something very close to universal.)\u201d One example he gives is that in a boardroom of nine directors, two women is not a sufficient number to empower effective function in a male-dominated environment. Yet studies show that the addition of a third woman \u2013 making a (magic) third of the directors \u2013 does lead to female flourishing at board level. What does that mean for minorities? Does every minority need a third of representation in the boardroom to attain best performance? In any case, there is also, Gladwell acknowledges, a Magic Quarter, in which 25% is the tipping point for other group dynamics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/sep/28/exclusive-extract-malcolm-gladwell-on-schoolchildren-superspreaders-and-the-new-science-of-epidemics\">Exclusive extract: Malcolm Gladwell on schoolchildren, super\u2011spreaders and the new science of epidemics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And if this universal law is starting to look a bit slippery, then let\u2019s consider the role of superspreaders (in both pathological and cultural epidemics), whom Gladwell discusses at length in a fascinating section on aerosol science.

Gladwell calls this the \u201cLaw of the Very, Very, Very Few\u201d (in a winking reference to the Law of the Few he outlined in the first book).

Hostmore\u2019s board said last month that they had \u201cinherited a very challenging set of circumstances\u201d and that cutting annual spending by \u00a312m, reducing losses from unprofitable stores, and improving customer experience had not been enough to save the business. \u201cUnfortunately, all of the board\u2019s efforts to implement a lasting solution to support the long-term financial future of the business came against a highly challenging trading and macroeconomic backdrop, and efforts to create value for shareholders through the proposed acquisition of TGI Fridays, while well-advanced, encountered adverse events outside the board\u2019s control,\u201d Hostmore said in September. Hostmore\u2019s shares have since been suspended from trading. Teneo declined to comment. Calveton and Breal Capital could not be immediately reached for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer\u2019s premiership so far has been marred by scandals, resignations and rebellions. From Freebiegate to political infighting, here is a timeline of the leader\u2019s first three tumultuous months in Downing Street \u2013 and the five issues that have dogged him. 23 July Seven MPs suspended for supporting amendment to scrap the two-child benefit limit In a move that sent shock waves through the party, Starmer suspended seven MPs in an unprecedented response to a rebellion supporting an amendment to scrap the two-child benefit limit. Those who lost the whip for six months included the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, Apsana Begum and Zarah Sultana, prompting significant anger from backbench MPs. The Nottingham East MP, Nadia Whittome, said the decision was \u201cappalling\u201d and the party should be able to \u201ctolerate disagreement without making threats and employing the most severe punishments\u201d. 17 September The freebie scandal takes hold The long-running row over freebies accepted by Starmer and other Labour figures reached its peak in September when it was revealed the prime minister had declared more free tickets and gifts than other major party leaders in recent times. He was found to have taken more than \u00a3100,000 of freebies in the form of tickets, clothes and accommodation, including \u00a34,000 in Taylor Swift tickets and \u00a320,000 of accommodation from the Labour donor Waheed Alli. Lord Alli also gave Starmer \u00a32,435 worth of glasses and \u00a316,200 worth of work clothing, as well as clothes for his wife, Victoria, that were not initially declared. It was later announced that Labour figures would stop accepting clothes as free gifts, and Starmer repaid \u00a36,000 worth of gifts and hospitality he had received since taking office. 25 September Backlash over removing pensioners\u2019 winter fuel allowance At the party\u2019s conference in September, the leadership lost a highly anticipated motion that called on ministers to reverse the cuts to winter fuel payments. The vote was carried \u2013 albeit narrowly \u2013 to loud cheers in the conference hall, after Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, had criticised Starmer for removing the allowance while \u201cleaving the super-rich untouched\u201d. It came two weeks after a controversial Commons vote when dozens of Labour MPs refused to back the plan to cut the winter fuel allowance after a tense debate in the chamber. Party sources said those who missed the vote were stripped of potential privileges and warned about their future conduct. 28 September Rosie Duffield resigns with scathing attack on Starmer In what was thought to be the fastest an MP has given up their party\u2019s whip after an election in modern times, the Canterbury MP, Rosie Duffield, resigned from the party in a furious letter to Starmer denouncing his \u201ccruel and unnecessary\u201d policies. Although Duffield has long been critical of the party\u2019s leader, her comments to him about the freebie scandal \u2013 that it had made her \u201cso ashamed of what you and your inner circle have done to tarnish and humiliate our once proud party\u201d \u2013 will have come as a blow to Downing Street. 6 October Sue Gray\u2019s resignation as Starmer\u2019s chief of staff After months of government in-fighting involving Sue Gray, Starmer\u2019s chief of staff accused by some of \u201ccontrol freakery\u201d and holding up policy decisions in Downing Street, she announced she was stepping down. She was blamed by some Labour figures for the party\u2019s inability to avoid the controversy over freebies, and her \u00a3170,000 salary \u2013 higher than the prime minister\u2019s \u2013 prompted fury among the party. She has now resigned, saying the \u201cintense commentary around my position risked becoming a distraction to the government\u2019s vital work of change\u201d.

Joe Biden, Keir Starmer and other western leaders have responded to Israel\u2019s actions by repeatedly stating that they stand with Israel and its right to defend itself. They have been quick to vociferously condemn those who threaten or attack Israel, but silent on the atrocities Israel inflicts on tens of thousands of innocent civilians in neighbouring countries.

Joe Biden, Keir Starmer and other western leaders have responded to Israel\u2019s actions by repeatedly stating that they stand with Israel and its right to defend itself. They have been quick to vociferously condemn those who threaten or attack Israel, but silent on the atrocities Israel inflicts on tens of thousands of innocent civilians in neighbouring countries. Benjamin Netanyahu has interpreted this silence as permission to pursue his strategy without effective censure or sanction. Therefore the question remains of whether these political leaders are complicit in the killing of thousands of innocent civilians, the creation of millions of refugees and the destruction of towns and cities.

      "bodyText": "A call by Emmanuel Macron for a halt in arms supplies to Israel for use in Gaza has been met with an angry rebuttal from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The French president\u2019s comments were directed mainly at the US and were part of continuing French efforts to revive its call for a ceasefire in Lebanon. France provides few arms to Israel but is keen to strengthen its longstanding influence in Lebanon by showing it wants the US to put some genuine pressure on Israel to accept a ceasefire. Washington appeared to mount little diplomatic resistance when Israel \u2013 after sending mixed signals \u2013 rejected a US-French plan for a 21 day ceasefire in Lebanon announced at the UN in New York nearly a fortnight ago. In an interview recorded on Monday, but broadcast on Saturday, Macron told France Inter radio: \u201cI think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop supplying weapons to lead the fighting in Gaza.\u201d \u201cFrance is not supplying them,\u201d he immediately clarified, indirectly turning the spotlight on the US, Israel\u2019s main arms supplier. He also warned about \u201ca resentment that is being born, a hatred that is being fuelled by this\u201d . Lebanon could not be turned into another Gaza, he added. Repeating his call on Sunday, Macron\u2019s office said he favoured a halt to arms exports for use in Gaza because a ceasefire is needed to stop the mounting violence and \u201cclear the way to the political solutions needed for the security of Israel and the whole Middle East\u201d. His comments brought a swift response from Netanyahu. \u201cAs Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilised countries should be standing firmly by Israel\u2019s side,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cYet, President Macron and other western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them.\u201d Macron also announced he was convening an international conference on aid to Lebanon and the establishment of Lebanese government armed troops on the border with Israel. The Israeli attacks on Lebanon are designed to destroy the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group that has been firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas, which mounted the attack on Israel from Gaza on 7 October 2023. Macron\u2019s remarks, welcomed by the Lebanese, Qatari and Egyptian governments as well as the Palestinian Authority, may reflect French concern that some officials in the White House appeared to be willing to be relaxed to the point of welcoming the Israeli rejection of the French-US plan for a 21-day ceasefire. Few US officials have condemned Israel for escalating the conflict. The headline row about arms sales comes amid diplomatic efforts to end a two-year deadlock in Lebanon about the election of a president. With Hezbollah having sustained heavy losses to its leadership from Israeli strikes, there is pressure on the group\u2019s political wing to let the election go ahead and for the military wing to accept a peace deal decoupled from a ceasefire in Gaza. Hezbollah\u2019s stated position until recently has been no elections preceding a ceasefire in Lebanon, and no ceasefire in Lebanon without a ceasefire in Gaza. Since the end of the term of the former president Michel Aoun in 2022, Lebanon has been in political deadlock with its 128 strong factionalised parliament unable to secure the required constitutional majority for any candidate. The US is said to be in favour of exploiting Hezbollah\u2019s weakness to install as president the army commander-in-chief, Gen Joseph Aoun.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s how the table looks after all that: a thriller at Brisbane Road, a stroll at the Joie Stadium, history at the King Power and resistance at the Emirates. That\u2019ll be all from me \u2013 thanks for joining. History for the side from south London \u2013 that\u2019s their first ever victory in the WSL. Annabel Blanchard\u2019s brace does the job. 80 min: Leicester 0-2 Crystal Palace Blanchard, I should add, is an ex-Leicester player, having spent a couple of seasons with them in the Championship. A hat-trick awaits. Blanchard doubles up from the spot. It was an obvious penalty, with Lexi Potter going down after a rash challenge from Ruby Mace. A thriller comes to a close. Liverpool have nicked the win right at the death. It\u2019s all happening in the WSL now. Leicester are loose trying to play out from the back, with Palace securing the ball with their press before some wonderful technical work in the area. Annabel Blanchard plays to Katherine Stengel, who backheels for Blanchard to seize upon, the finely placed finish following to give Palace the lead. Spencer gets a hand to it, diving to her right, but H\u00f6binger has her second! In the fourth minute of added time! It looks soft, with Sophie Rom\u00e1n Haug going down in the box after a cross from the right, sandwiched in-between two Spurs shirts. 90+1 min: Tottenham 2-2 Liverpool Spurs are looking more likely to get a winner here. Seven minutes are added on as a corner comes in from the right \u2026 Laws tips it away before Hayley Raso cuts in from the left to strike \u2026 her shot is deflected out for another corner. Beth England nearly slams home after the corner comes in. Nervy times. Well, that didn\u2019t last long. It\u2019s another case of poor near-post defending from Liverpool. Clare Hunt spins her marker around on the right, inside the area, and launches a hopeful shot with her left foot. Gemma Bonner gets in the way, in front of Laws, but appears stuck in the turf as she diverts the ball into her own net. Hunt will claim the goal but it\u2019s another tame way for Liverpool to lose their lead. 82 min: Tottenham 1-2 Liverpool Rachael Laws, the Liverpool keeper, scampers out of her area to make herself big and deny Jessica Naz, who was through, one on one. Top save. A frustrating afternoon for Jonas Eidevall\u2019s side comes to a close, with the visitors holding on to get their first point of the WSL season. Another cracker! Marie H\u00f6binger steps up for a free-kick \u2013 central, just outside the D \u2013 and finds the top right corner with a curling strike. Delightful from the Austrian. 90+3 min: Arsenal 0-0 Everton A huge chance for Blackstenius in the middle after a cross from the right \u2026 she leaps up at the front post \u2026 only to head over. 90 min: Arsenal 0-0 Everton Foord strikes the bar with a top effort, chesting the ball down before launching from the right-side of the area. Four minutes are added on. Half-time: Leicester 0-0 Crystal Palace I\u2019ll show this fixture a bit more love when the other two games wrap up. 83 min: Arsenal 0-0 Everton The rearguard continues from Everton, with Courtney Brosnan continuing to sweep up the ball at the back. 60 min: Tottenham 1-1 Liverpool Spurs are piling forward, with Martha Thomas, inside the area, forcing Rachael Laws into a strong save with a powerful left-footed hit. Matt Beard, Liverpool\u2019s head coach, covers his face in despair. Jessica Naz skips downs the right and sends in a low cross, where Taylor Hinds, at the front post, diverts the ball into her own net. She only had her keeper around her but couldn\u2019t launch a full-blooded clearance. 65 min: Arsenal 0-0 Everton Arsenal make three changes to get things going: Leah Williamson, Caitlin Foord and Stina Blackstenius are all on the field. 61 min: Arsenal 0-0 Everton Arsenal have a free-kick out on the left to be whipped into the box \u2026 Mead delivers but it\u2019s cleared before a cross from the right finds the safe hands of Courtney Brosnan. 55 min: Arsenal 0-0 Everton The Gunners wheel the ball around, looking sharp until they get to the final third; Karoline Olesen pulls off an excellent sliding challenge to win the ball off Kim Little on Arsenal\u2019s right. Half-time: Tottenham 0-1 Liverpool The visitors hold their lead through to the half-time whistle after Cornelia Kapocs\u2019 cracking hit, her first for the club. City go top of the WSL after a comfortable victory, with Mary Fowler setting one up and then scoring the sealer. The hosts flexed their depth, making several changes from their last league game, and will head into their bumper Champions League clash with Barcelona all smiles. Half-time: Arsenal 0-0 Everton It\u2019s not been a thriller. 40 min: Arsenal 0-0 Everton Justine Vanhaevermaet leaps high from a corner, with her header cleared by Katie McCabe, defending on the line for Arsenal. I\u2019m not sure if it was trickling in or just going wide of the post. The final fixture of the day: That should be the game for City. A backpass goes wrong for West Ham, with Khadija Shaw, on as a sub, intercepting in the area. She keeps a hold of it by the byline before hanging up a cross at the far post; Mary Foster leaps high to guide a header into the net. Stunner! It\u2019s an error from Becky Spencer in goal that creates it, her kick out from the back going straight to Cornelia Kapocs in the left channel. With Spencer off her line, Kapocs quickly launches from more than 20 yards out, perfectly placing it into the net. 17 min: Arsenal 0-0 Everton Any sense of drama is yet to emerge at the Emirates. Elsewhere in London, Spurs have kicked off against Liverpool. 48 min: Manchester City 1-0 West Ham Hemp nearly has her and City\u2019s second, striking the crossbar before blasting over a simple chance less than a minute later, having been perfectly set up by Chloe Kelly\u2019s pass across goal. 46 min: Manchester City 1-0 West Ham Jill Roord is off for City, with Vivianne Miedema getting a run out for the second half. 1 min: Arsenal 0-0 Everton We\u2019re up and away at the Emirates, where Everton are searching for their first points of the season. Half-time: Manchester City 1-0 West Ham City have had an overwhelming amount of possession but haven\u2019t tested Kinga Szemik enough; the Hammers remain in the contest. 39 min: Manchester City 1-0 West Ham City seem unable to lose the ball, a gazillion-pass move only breaking down after Leila Ouahabi\u2019s attempted ball across goal to Chloe Kelly is cut out. 30 min: Manchester City 1-0 West Ham Hemp remains a nuisance, drifting from the left into the area to threaten the goal. This time she gets her head on the end of a cross from Yui Hasegawa, the ball looping over the bar. 27 min: Manchester City 1-0 West Ham It\u2019s all City at the moment at the Joie Stadium, forming a game of attack versus defence in the West Ham half. On to the line-ups for the 2.15pm kick-off. I should add: feel free to drop me a line here with your thoughts on any of the action. Book/film/TV recommendations also welcome. Lauren Hemp gets City up and running. Mary Fowler is surrounded by West Ham shirts on the edge of the box, with her back to goal, but somehow gets the ball to slip into the area. Hemp makes a sneaky run inside, nails the dummy and calmly slots in. Here\u2019s the situation at the Emirates: Viviane Asseyi is through on goal, with her deflected shot trickling into the net to give West Ham a shock lead inside two minutes \u2026 but the flag is up. It was a killer through ball from Katrina Gorry to split the City defence. Things are about to get underway at the Joie Stadium. The Netherlands\u2019 Jill Roord, by the way, is in the starting XI having made her return from an ACL injury off the bench last weekend. Another pre-match read for you, courtesy of Tom Garry: The international flavour of the WSL no doubt has many benefits, not least in widening the broadcast appeal of the division across the globe, engaging fans on different continents and boosting sponsorship revenues. However, could it come at a cost to the development of young English players? City\u2019s XI \u2013 heavily rotated \u2013 means they\u2019re giving the big names a rest before the big clash with Barcelona in the week. Speaking of the Champions League, here\u2019s more on the mess surrounding that Chelsea-Manchester United postponement. This, from a couple days ago, is a really lovely read. Here\u2019s how we\u2019re looking \u2026 So Vivianne Miedema drops to the bench for City, as does Bunny Shaw \u2013 City make five changes from the side that started in the 1-0 victory over Brighton last weekend. West Ham have just the one switch, with new signing Camila S\u00e1ez replacing Shannon Cooke from the XI that drew against Liverpool. Hello, hello, hello and welcome to coverage of Chelsea\u2019s bumper WSL clash with Manchester United today\u2019s WSL clockwatch! There\u2019s been a controversial postponement but we\u2019ve still got plenty to keep an eye on: Manchester City v West Ham \u2013 1pm BST Arsenal v Everton \u2013 2pm Tottenham v Liverpool \u2013 2.15pm Leicester v Crystal Palace \u2013 3pm City will be eyeing up a spot at the top of the table even if it is brief, with Arsenal and Spurs both on four points, too. Brighton kicked off the weekend\u2019s action with a victory against Aston Villa yesterday, Fran Kirby slotting in the crucial spotkick. Tom Garry was there for that one.",

The respected racing ratings organisation ditched all their print products when the virus subsided with the world going back to normal and the annuals became a thing of the past.</p> <p>My collection of them dates back to the mid-1970s and I even have a copy of a very rare item, the \u2018Best Horses of 1945\u2019 edition. That will be worth a nice price now but those who have the 1942 publication have a book worth at least \u00a310k in their possession.</p> <p>What I was reminded of in particular today was the essay on Cirrus Des Aigles\u2019 essay in Racehorses of 2014.</p> <p>\u2018The tree-dwelling three-toed sloth is generally regarded as being the world\u2019s slowest mammal,\u201d wrote Timeform back then, \u201cits average speed around one sixth of a mile an hour. </p> <p>\u201cRacing could nominate its own contender: the collective membership of the European Pattern Committee moving imperceptibly towards removing the nonsensical ban on geldings in some of Europe\u2019s Group 1 races \u2026 The idea that geldings should be excluded from the top races because those races exist for the purpose of selecting the best colts for breeding belongs to a bygone era.\u201d</p> <p>The geldings Goliath and Calandagan would easily have topped the Arc ratings this year if they had been allowed to run in the big race at Longchamp today and, as Timform stated this week, \u201cthe absence of both leaves Europe\u2019s richest race [this year] very much the poorer.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that Goliath beat this year\u2019s convincing Arc winner Bluestocking in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in great style underlines the case again for geldings being allowed to run in future.

It will take just under a minute to watch the key race as far as recent form goes, as the first six home in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CQeGeowxMEI?si=_WumOsXso3FljzYP\">the Flying Five at the Curragh</a> last month \u2013 <strong>Bradsell, Believing, Makarova, Kerdos, Washington Heights</strong> and <strong>Desperate Hero</strong> \u2013 are all in today\u2019s field. Bradsell and Hollie Doyle were convincing winners there but this is a race where a high draw is generally fairly terminal for a runner\u2019s chance and all five of the re-opposers are drawn lower. The main local trial is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FXVXSOv8kUg?si=keIlFKzjpFKRy2-D\">the Prix du Petit Couvert</a> over track and trip three weeks ago, when the field included another half-dozen of today\u2019s runners, and the one to take out of the race is probably Richard Hughes\u2019s <strong>No Half Measures</strong>, who was beaten less than half a length in sixth despite being forced wide. She has a difficult draw again though in stall 12. I\u2019ll probably have a few euros on <strong>Kerdos</strong> from an excellent pitch in stall three, although <strong>Desperate Hero, </strong>who posted an exceptional time when hosing up in a Hamilton handicap four runs ago, also makes some appeal from six.</p> <p><strong>SELECTION: KERDOS</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AtTheRaces/status/1842907716282396789\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;He&#39;s a Guineas horse!&quot; <br><br>Aidan O&#39;Brien has outlined plans for next season with the classy Camille Pissarro... <a href=\"https://t.co/W9t2oqEvxt\">pic.twitter.com/W9t2oqEvxt</a></p>&mdash; At The Races (@AtTheRaces) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AtTheRaces/status/1842907716282396789?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 6, 2024</a></blockquote>   </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670283ce8f0809b6ab31b933\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-06T12:35:15.658Z\">1.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Prix Jean-Luc Lagadere (1.30pm) result</strong><br>1 <strong><a href=\"https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/profiles/horse/1141991\">Camille Pissarro</a> </strong>10/1<br>2 <strong><a href=\"https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/profiles/horse/1141159\">Rashabar </a></strong>8/1<br>3 <strong><a href=\"https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/profiles/horse/1154148\">Misunderstood</a> </strong>11/2</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AtTheRaces/status/1842906848267055178\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">From last to first!

Unlike 12 months ago, when many unprepared racegoers from Britain and Ireland had lobster-pink necks by lunchtime, it is a damp and chilly day here, although there is little sign of any significant rain at present.</p> <p>The going is therefore likely to remain soft throughout the afternoon, which is arguably not ideal for the Japanese-trained challenger, <strong>Shin Emperor, </strong>but he remains prominent in the big-race betting at around 6-1 with British bookies.</p> <p>This is an unusually open running of the Arc on paper, with four three-year-olds \u2013 <strong>Los Angeles, Sosie, Look De Vega </strong>and <strong>Shin Emperor </strong>- at the top of the lists \u2013 but no certainty as yet about which of them will set off as favourite. <strong>Look De Vega</strong>, though, has taken a brisk trot in the betting this morning, and the French Derby winner, who was shading 4-1 favouritism from <strong>Sosie </strong>two days ago, is all the way out to 17-2 with one firm at present.</p> <p>The fact that Aidan O\u2019Brien reeled off a four-timer on the card here on Saturday, including two Group One wins, can only add to the confidence behind the trainer\u2019s main hope <strong>Los Angeles, </strong>while his second Group One winner yesterday was a big outsider ridden by Christophe Soumillon \u2013 just like his second-string in today\u2019s Arc, the 2023 St Leger winner, <strong>Continuous.</strong></p> <p><strong>Al Riffa, </strong>trained in Ireland by Joseph O\u2019Brien but due to be ridden this afternoon by Japan\u2019s veteran superstar jockey, Yutaka Take, is currently the only older horse at a single-figure price, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/05/big-in-japan-yutaka-take-rides-again-in-search-of-arc-triumph-on-al-riffa\">but you could make some sort of case</a> for at least a dozen of the runners. <strong>Bluestocking </strong>and <strong>Sunway, </strong>the only contenders from British stables, are definitely in that dozen, although in terms of both numbers and likely odds, this is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2024/sep/30/paucity-of-british-arc-runners-raises-questions-over-health-of-flat-racing\">the weakest British challenge</a> for the Arc for some time.</p> <p>There are plenty of live contenders from British yards on the undercard, though, and in the <strong>Prix de l\u2019Abbaye</strong> in particular, where <strong>Bradsell</strong> and <strong>Hollie</strong> <strong>Doyle</strong> head the market as they go in search of their third Group One win in a row, and their fourth in all.</p> <p>Ralph Beckett\u2019s <strong>Kinross, </strong>the Prix de la Foret winner two years ago and the runner-up last year, is back for another tussle with the 2023 winner, <strong>Kelina</strong>, at 4.40, while the card kicks off with two Group Ones for juveniles.</p> <p>With six Group Ones for all ages, genders and at all distances up to a mile-and-a-half, there is something on the card for everyone and you can, as always, follow all the action live here on the blog from the first hoof-fall to the last.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "As another Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe day draws to a close I\u2019m reminded how much I do miss the famous Timeform Racehorses annuals which were another victim of the wretched Covid pandemic breakout. The respected racing ratings organisation ditched all their print products when the virus subsided with the world going back to normal and the annuals became a thing of the past. My collection of them dates back to the mid-1970s and I even have a copy of a very rare item, the \u2018Best Horses of 1945\u2019 edition. That will be worth a nice price now but those who have the 1942 publication have a book worth at least \u00a310k in their possession. What I was reminded of in particular today was the essay on Cirrus Des Aigles\u2019 essay in Racehorses of 2014. \u2018The tree-dwelling three-toed sloth is generally regarded as being the world\u2019s slowest mammal,\u201d wrote Timeform back then, \u201cits average speed around one sixth of a mile an hour. \u201cRacing could nominate its own contender: the collective membership of the European Pattern Committee moving imperceptibly towards removing the nonsensical ban on geldings in some of Europe\u2019s Group 1 races \u2026 The idea that geldings should be excluded from the top races because those races exist for the purpose of selecting the best colts for breeding belongs to a bygone era.\u201d The geldings Goliath and Calandagan would easily have topped the Arc ratings this year if they had been allowed to run in the big race at Longchamp today and, as Timform stated this week, \u201cthe absence of both leaves Europe\u2019s richest race [this year] very much the poorer.\u201d The fact that Goliath beat this year\u2019s convincing Arc winner Bluestocking in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in great style underlines the case again for geldings being allowed to run in future. Apparently the matter is being discussed by the French racing authorities currently. Let\u2019s hope they come to the right conclusion this time. Good night and see you again a week on Saturday here for Champions Day from Ascot. Prix de la Foret (4.40pm) result 1 Ramatuelle 7/2 2 Kinross 7/4f 3 Beauvatier 20/1 And they\u2019re off \u2026 Matilda Picotte takes up the running with Ramatuelle also prominent \u2026 into the straight with Ramatuelle coming fast and quick and she clears away for a great and convincing win. it will be the Breeders\u2019 Cup Mile for her next time out and can\u2019t wait to see her in that. Prix de la Foret (4.40pm) preview Despite the best efforts of the course executives at York and Goodwood, among others, to boost the status of their top seven-furlong events, this race is still the only Group One at the trip in Europe, and thus an automatic target for every decent seven-furlong specialist around. Kelina and Kinross, separated by half a length at the end of last year\u2019s renewal, are both in the field again, and this will in fact be Kinross\u2019s fourth run in the race \u2013 he won in 2022 and finished fourth in 2021. Kelina, a 25-1 chance 12 months ago, has failed to add to last year\u2019s success in four subsequent races and is a relative outsider again, but Kinross is the likely favourite and may have most to fear from Christopher Head\u2019s Ramatuelle, who looked as if she might appreciate a drop back to seven furlongs when finishing third in both the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket in May. SELECTION: RAMATUELLE Prix de l\u2019Opera (4.05pm) result 1 Friendly Soul 9/1 2 Running Lion 28/1 3 Sparkling Plenty 3/1 f And they\u2019re off \u2026 Almara leads in the early stages of the race \u2026 Sparkling Plenty towards the back as they turn for home but now trying to make ground \u2026 Friendly Soul fights hard up front and will beat her stablemate Running Lion.

There was quite some trip down to the ceremony after the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe for the winning trophy there at Longchamp! Prix de l\u2019Opera (4.05pm) preview A big run from Bluestocking, Aventure or both in the preceding Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe will be a positive for Sparkling Plenty, the Prix de Diane (French Oaks) winner here, as she was a creditable sixth in the Prix Vermeille last time having been given a bizarrely unambitious ride until halfway down the straight. She is vying for favouritism with Karl Burke\u2019s Fallen Angel, the runner-up in the Matron Stakes last time out with Ylang Ylang just behind in fourth, while Ylang Ylang\u2019s stable-companion at the Aidan O\u2019Brien yard, Content, is another leading contender on her winning form in the Yorkshire Oaksalthough this drop back to 10 furlongs is not entirely certain to suit. The Group Two Blandford Stakes, won by Hanalia with American Sonja back in fifth, could be worth a second look too. SELECTION: SPARKLING PLENTY You can read Greg Wood\u2019s quick report on the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe from Paris here: Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe (3.20pm) result 1 Bluestocking 5/1 2 Aventure 17/2 3 Los Angeles 6/1 And they\u2019re off ... Los Angeles is out there early with the well-backed Bluestocking just behind \u2026 Haya Zark has gone wrong and been pulled up very quickly \u2026 they turn for home with Los Angeles leading \u2026 Bluestocking now leads \u2026 and comes home the winner of the Arc for British trainer Ralph Beckett after being supplemented into the race only earlier this week!

Apparently the owners would be fined \u20ac55k if they didn\u2019t give a good enough reason to pull out so they haven\u2019t done so and the horse will run with the Longchamp stewards telling all concerned that \u201cthe horse must run on its merits.\u201d That is they will be watching closely in case the horse is given an easy time of it. Bravo! The French get their priorities right at the races \u2026 This horse (Batwan geddit) earns the best-turned out horse at Longchamp today! Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe (3.20pm) preview The 103rd Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe is, as I may already have mentioned once or twice, a pin-sticker\u2019s delight. I can\u2019t see Haya Zark or Survie playing any kind of a role in the finish, but that leaves 14 to choose from and the ratings suggest that at their best, there is precious little between them. Zarakem, for instance, is a 50-1 shot with the bookies, but he was a close second behind Auguste Rodin in the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes at Royal Ascot just two runs ago, and fellow outsiders like Sevenna\u2019s Knight, Sunway, Continuous andFantastic Moon all have something in their back-catalogue that gives them a squeak. The key pieces of form among the market leaders include the Prix Niel (Sosie beat Delius and Look De Vega), the Irish Champion Stakes \u2013 watch Shin Emperor finishing fast into third after struggling for running room with Los Angeles just behind in fourth - and the Grosser Preis von Berlin, which has the recent Arc winners Torquator Tasso and Alpinista on its roll of honour and was won this year by Al Riffa. The Prix Vermeille, where Bluestocking beat Aventure, is also worth a look before coming to any firm decisions, and while I\u2019m happy enough to row in with Al Riffa and Yutaka Take, there is almost no possible outcome that would entirely surprise. SELECTION: AL RIFFA Prix de l\u2019Abbaye (2.05pm) result 1 Makarova 14/1 2 Bradsell 6/4f 3 Believing 7/2 This will be a fast and furious race over only five furlongs and the camera angles on the straight track at Longchamp are notoriously difficult to follow so bear with me \u2013 this will be a short description! And they\u2019re off \u2026 Bradsell is out quickly early as with Kerdos \u2026 Bradsell has a narrow lead as they head for the line \u2026 Makarova takes the lead close home and holds on to win. Tom Marquand has beaten his partner Hollie Doyle (Brasell) in this always frantic race. The trainer Ed Walker is very emotional as he relays to Sky Sports Racing that this is his runner\u2019s last race and he has won a major European prize. \u201cIt\u2019s great when the little man gets his day!\u201d he says. News \u2026 Fantastic Moon will not run in the Arc de Triomphe. Prix de l\u2019Abbaye (2.05pm) betting Bradsell 2/1 Believing 4/1 Starlust 15/2 Kerdos 14/1 Grand Grey 16/1 Makarova 16/1 No Half Measures 18/1 Desperate Hero 25/1 Washington Heights 25/1 BAR 28/1 \u2013 16 Runners Full odds via Oddschecker here Prix de l\u2019Abbaye (2.05pm) preview If there is a Group One race on the Arc weekend schedule that is all but certain to go to an overseas-trained runner, it is undoubtedly this five-furlong sprint, which has gone abroad 13 times in the last 15 years. The locals, in fact, almost seem to have given up trying, and just three of the 16 runners are from French stables. It will take just under a minute to watch the key race as far as recent form goes, as the first six home in the Flying Five at the Curragh last month \u2013 Bradsell, Believing, Makarova, Kerdos, Washington Heights and Desperate Hero \u2013 are all in today\u2019s field. Bradsell and Hollie Doyle were convincing winners there but this is a race where a high draw is generally fairly terminal for a runner\u2019s chance and all five of the re-opposers are drawn lower. The main local trial is the Prix du Petit Couvert over track and trip three weeks ago, when the field included another half-dozen of today\u2019s runners, and the one to take out of the race is probably Richard Hughes\u2019s No Half Measures, who was beaten less than half a length in sixth despite being forced wide. She has a difficult draw again though in stall 12. I\u2019ll probably have a few euros on Kerdos from an excellent pitch in stall three, although Desperate Hero, who posted an exceptional time when hosing up in a Hamilton handicap four runs ago, also makes some appeal from six. SELECTION: KERDOS Prix Jean-Luc Lagadere (1.30pm) result 1 Camille Pissarro 10/1 2 Rashabar 8/1 3 Misunderstood 11/2 And they\u2019re off \u2026 Field Of Gold jumps out well but Misunderstood grabs the lead with Camille Pissarro at the back in the early stages \u2026 Rashabar is there \u2026 Camille Pissarro comes from the back to lead with Rashabar just second. and holds on at the line in a tight finish. Prix Jean-Luc Lagadere (1.30pm) betting Henri Matisse 7/4 Field of Gold 7/2 Misunderstood 13/2 Rashabar 13/2 Houquetot 12/1 Cowardofthecounty 18/1 Camille Pissarro 20/1 Heybetil 33/1 Full betting via Oddschecker here Prix Jean-Luc Lagadere (1.30pm) preview Like the preceding race, the juvenile colts\u2019 Group One features an Aidan O\u2019Brien runner on something of a retrieval mission, as Henri Matisse was unbeaten and odds-on for last month\u2019s Group One National Stakes at the Curragh but finished only second behind Scorthy Champ having wandered alarmingly inside the final furlong. There is less obvious opposition from the home-trained contingent, however, as Field Of Gold, John Gosden\u2019s Solario Stakes winner, and Brian Meehan\u2019s Rashabar, the runner-up behind Whistlejacket in the Prix Morny in August, are next best on ratings, with Mario Baratti\u2019s unbeaten Misunderstood, a four-and-a-half length winner of the Group Three Prix des Chenes last time, likely to offer the biggest threat from the locals. SELECTION: FIELD OF GOLD Prix Marcel Boussac (12.55pm) result 1 Vertical Blue 100-1 2 Zarigana 4/7 f 3 Exactly 7/1 And they\u2019re off \u2026 Simmering is out quickly with Exactly \u2026 hot favourite Zarigna is in midfield \u2026 Exactly leads as they turn for home \u2026 Zarigana finishes fast with Vertical Blue down the centre of the track and it\u2019s a photo finish! Vertical Blue HAS got up close home and won at the amazing odds of 100-1! Fantastic Moon is now a doubtful runner in the Arc de Triomphe at 3.20pm after so much rain in the period running up to the race today, the Racing Post are reporting. Prix Marcel Boussac (12.55pm) betting Zarigana 4/5 Bedtime Story 11/4 Simmering 9/1 Exactly 9/1 Lhakpa 28/1 La Guapisima 80/1 Vertical Blue 100/1 Inhebhaa 300/1 La Ferretcapienne 300/1 Full beting here via Oddschecker Your non-runners today \u2026 cross this lot off your list of horses due to line up because they\u2019e not going to. 12.55 No 5: Longchamp Rose Salve 1.30 No 5: Revolutionairre 4.40 No 16: Flora Of Bermuda Prix Marcel Boussac (12.55pm) preview A fascinating contest between three hugely-promising two-year-old fillies to open the Group One action on Arc day. Francis Graffard\u2019s Zarigana, a grand-daughter of the brilliant, unbeaten Arc winner Zarkava, is the likely favourite, having won her first two startsby a combined seven lengths, but she faces stern opposition from Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Bedtime Story, whose unbeaten record went west when she finished fifth and last in the Moyglare Stud Stakes last time. She was subsequently found to be lame, however, and had set off at odds-on in a race that was won by her stable companion, Lake Victoria, the easy winner of last week\u2019s Group One Cheveley Park Stakes. Ollie Sangster\u2019s Simmering, meanwhile, also deserves close consideration, having finished a length-and-a-quarter behind Lake Victoria in the same event. SELECTION: ZARIGANA \u201cPunters are increasingly happy to take on those at the front of the betting\u201d, the BestofBets.com folk remind me in their press release which has just landed. \u201cIn the last 24 hours, we\u2019ve seen support for outsiders who ran in the ace last year like Continuous and Fantastic Moon, both of which are now 25-1.\u201d One very fascinating aspects of this year\u2019s Arc is that it is genuinely wide-open. Sky Sports Racing presenter Alex Hammond just asked who will go off favourite and answered her own question by saying: \u201cWe still don\u2019t know\u201d. Sosie and Los Angeles are current market leaders at 9-2 and the betting reads like a sprint handicap rather than a Group One contest of this calibre with a mature betting market. Good morning all. It\u2019s still a bit damp and drizzly in Paris but the Arc de Triomphe has been a glittering day in the European racing calendar since it became the target for the greatest horses on the continent and beyond in the post-War era. The forecast is for the precipitation to stop and we\u2019re in for a fabulous day\u2019s action on the track this afternoon. Hello from Longchamp in the Bois de Boulogne, where the 16 runners in the 103rd running of the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe are due to set off at 4.20 local time, or 3.20 BST. Unlike 12 months ago, when many unprepared racegoers from Britain and Ireland had lobster-pink necks by lunchtime, it is a damp and chilly day here, although there is little sign of any significant rain at present. The going is therefore likely to remain soft throughout the afternoon, which is arguably not ideal for the Japanese-trained challenger, Shin Emperor, but he remains prominent in the big-race betting at around 6-1 with British bookies. This is an unusually open running of the Arc on paper, with four three-year-olds \u2013 Los Angeles, Sosie, Look De Vega and Shin Emperor - at the top of the lists \u2013 but no certainty as yet about which of them will set off as favourite. Look De Vega, though, has taken a brisk trot in the betting this morning, and the French Derby winner, who was shading 4-1 favouritism from Sosie two days ago, is all the way out to 17-2 with one firm at present. The fact that Aidan O\u2019Brien reeled off a four-timer on the card here on Saturday, including two Group One wins, can only add to the confidence behind the trainer\u2019s main hope Los Angeles, while his second Group One winner yesterday was a big outsider ridden by Christophe Soumillon \u2013 just like his second-string in today\u2019s Arc, the 2023 St Leger winner, Continuous. Al Riffa, trained in Ireland by Joseph O\u2019Brien but due to be ridden this afternoon by Japan\u2019s veteran superstar jockey, Yutaka Take, is currently the only older horse at a single-figure price, but you could make some sort of case for at least a dozen of the runners. Bluestocking and Sunway, the only contenders from British stables, are definitely in that dozen, although in terms of both numbers and likely odds, this is the weakest British challenge for the Arc for some time. There are plenty of live contenders from British yards on the undercard, though, and in the Prix de l\u2019Abbaye in particular, where Bradsell and Hollie Doyle head the market as they go in search of their third Group One win in a row, and their fourth in all. Ralph Beckett\u2019s Kinross, the Prix de la Foret winner two years ago and the runner-up last year, is back for another tussle with the 2023 winner, Kelina, at 4.40, while the card kicks off with two Group Ones for juveniles. With six Group Ones for all ages, genders and at all distances up to a mile-and-a-half, there is something on the card for everyone and you can, as always, follow all the action live here on the blog from the first hoof-fall to the last.",

Also in the line-up are Nightbitch, Marielle Heller\u2019s genre-bending adaptation of Rachel Yoder\u2019s 2021 novel, which stars Amy Adams as a mother who puts her career on hold to parent her toddler; and the Witches, Elizabeth Sankey\u2019s powerful personal essay weaving women\u2019s experience of postpartum depression with mosaic clips showing how witches have been portrayed throughout the history of film. Sankey has previously written for the Guardian about her experience on a psychiatric ward that treats women with perinatal mental health issues. \u201cI was in a horror film \u2026 and the worst part? The person I was in danger from was me,\u201d she wrote. There is also Darren Thornton\u2019s comedy drama Four Mothers, which tells the story of a queer Irish novelist juggling four very different mothers. \u201cFrom a robot bringing up a baby gosling (Wild Robot) to a woman embracing her animal instincts (Nightbitch), extraordinary mothers abound in this year\u2019s programme,\u201d said the festival director, Kristy Matheson. \u201cAfter a few years of great father-daughter films, this year mothers/sons are taking centre stage once more! In the charming and funny Four Mothers an octogenarian mum keeps her successful literary son on his toes, while the unshakeable familial bond sits at the heart of our opening night film Blitz. Across our many months of viewing, the team encountered so many different sides of motherhood \u2013 full of hope, resilience and invention.\u201d Mapplebeck said it was \u201cgreat to see\u201d the number of films at LFF this year exploring motherhood. \u201cTheir popularity proves that there is a huge audience for raw and intimate stories about motherhood, whatever your family looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were once turned down by a producer who told us that Motherboard felt too \u2018small\u2019 for him. He wanted \u2018big stories about true crime and space, epic journeys\u2019. But raising my son alone, him meeting his dad for the first time, the two of us surviving my breast cancer diagnosis, that\u2019s a pretty epic journey.\u201d LFF opens on Wednesday with the premiere of Steve McQueen\u2019s Blitz, which follows the travails of a young boy separated from his mother during the second world war and stars Kathy Burke, Saoirse Ronan and Paul Weller. Other highlights include the closing film, Morgan Neville\u2019s Lego animation Piece by Piece, and The Extraordinary Miss Flower, which is made by Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, who directed the Nick Cave documentary 20,000 Days on Earth. There is also a screening of the silent Sherlock Holmes film The Golden Pince-Nez, being shown for the first time since its release in 1922 after restoration work by the BFI national archive. This year, LFF is showing 255 films, of which 44% are made by female and non-binary directors, an increase on last year\u2019s 39%. Matheson has previously said the film industry is \u201cnowhere near [gender] parity\u201d because it produces an \u201calarmingly\u201d low number of mid-career female directors. The programme includes a number of titles that won awards at previous film festivals including the film-making duo Fernanda Valadez and Astrid Rondero\u2019s Sundance winner Sujo, Sarah Friedland\u2019s Venice debut award-winning Familiar Touch, and Jacques Audiard\u2019s Cannes jury prize winning Emilia P\u00e9rez. This year\u2019s talks feature Daniel Kaluuya, Sean Baker, Andrea Arnold, Mike Leigh, Steve McQueen, Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Denis Villeneuve.",

And, over the last decade or so, there\u2019s been no more reliable source of that pleasure than Manchester United, such that we are all now experts in what it looks like when their latest manager is finished.</p> <p>For David Moyes it was Everton away in April 2014, a tenure of entirely predictable ineptitude crystallised by as dreadful a display as could possibly be imagined and the Goodison crowd singing \u201cStuck with Moyes, stuck with Moyes Man United\u201d. He was sacked the next day.</p> <p>Next was Louis van Gaal and football so bad it left all who witnessed it with scarred eyes and scorched soul. His regime collpased on Boxing Day 2015 via humiliation at Stoke and a performance of epochal awfulness which ensured a third straight defeat \u2013 the other two having come against the powerhouses of Bournemouth and Norwich. He was sacked just over five months later, the day after lifting the FA Cup.</p> <p>So Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was engaged and, with his otherworldly magic now consumed by pubescent paranoia, the end became apparent in August 2018 when Ed Woodward backed his own footballing acumen over that of an indisputable all-time great, then bragged about it to the press. But it was not until five months later that on-pitch events made dismissal essential with unseemly defeat at Anfield. He was sacked the next day.</p> <p>The game that should\u2019ve signalled Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s demise was a 4-2 defeat at Leicester in October 2021, his defence conceding goals faster than his attack could score them. He was sacked just over a month later, allowed to sneak in the valedictory gifts of a a 5-0 home thrashing by Liverpool, a home derby outclassing from Manchester City and a 4-1 undressing at Watford before accepting his carriage clock.</p> <p>What unites these multifarious incompetencies, travesties and debacle is the absence of hope: before them, there was a little, after them there was none. Which brings us to The Beleaguered Erik ten Hag<sup>TM</sup>, the most thoroughly backed managed of the Post-Fergie Wilderness Years<sup>TM</sup> but in whom it became impossible rather than implausible to believe following last Sunday\u2019s abomination against Spurs. Though he survived to preside over a second consecutive midweek mess, he must now fear that regardless of what happens today, the imminent international break will mean curtains.</p> <p>Nor will he find Aston Villa accommodating opponents. Unai Emery\u2019s outfit are so much of what Ten Hag\u2019s are not, a collection of excellent individuals deftly forged into a coherent, physical and unobliging unit that accentuates strengths and minimises weaknesses. Before you watch them play you know what you\u2019re going to see, after you watch them play you\u2019re pleased you saw it, and they arrive at this game having first beaten Bayern Munich then enjoyed a day\u2019s more rest than their opponents. They also owe United, having lost to them twice last season \u2013 first in embarrassing circumstances then in devastating circumstances \u2013 and need to keep pace with the league leaders. They will fancy this.</p> <p>All of which should mean an entertaining afternoon \u2013 but perhaps not for the just-about-current Manchester United manager.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off: 2pm BST</strong></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Righto, our match report is ready, which means we\u2019re all done here. Thanks for your company and comments \u2013 peace out. Some post-game chat from Ten Hag, striking a defiant tone \u2026 I mentioned it at full time, but it bears repeating: United have scored five goals in seven league games! Chelsea and Forest have drawn 1-1. The former stay fourth on 14 points, above Villa on goal difference, the latter ninth, two above United. You\u2019ve got to laugh. In the studio, Dimitar Berbatov says everyone bar Evans should be ashamed to see him win the award, and he\u2019s right. Evans says United were better than the last few games and against a good team, but their passing wasn\u2019t good enough and they couldn\u2019t find the moment of quality they needed. He feels like he still plays the game he always had and still has pace in the legs to get him out of trouble. He wasn\u2019t expecting to get on to the pitch against Porto and is just enjoying every moment of action he can get. Even though United aren\u2019t good, he accepts, it\u2019s still a privilege to play for them \u2013 especially given the love the supporters show. He\u2019s also pleased to put in a performance for the manager, who was hurt by what happened in midweek, and accepts what he thinks is his first ever POTM award. We started today wondering about Ten Hag\u2019s future, and we end it none the wiser. Another humiliation and the pressure might well have been too much, but a respectable point doesn\u2019t necessarily change things, given any decision will be based, not on today but on everything he\u2019s done at United so far. The board could definitely get away without sacking him, but there\u2019ll be concern that if things don\u2019t improve soon, another season will have disappeared and with it the immediate improvement Ineos will have wanted. A result that both sides will accept. Villa stay fifth, four points off the lead with 14, while United languish in 14th with eight points \u2013 the fewest they\u2019ve ever had at this stage of a Premier League season. They\u2019ve scored five in seven, their lowest ever at this stage \u2013 after 72-73, in which they were relegated. 90+7 min We move into added time of added time, De Ligt just about robbing Duran with Evans out of position having gone to the ball. But when Rogers finds Barkley inside the box, a lofted, dug-out finish sails beyond the far post. 90+5 min Carragher names Evans player of the match \u2013 the right call in mine, for the little that\u2019s worth. He\u2019s made some crucial interventions, absurd though it is that he\u2019s being picked on merit at this point in human history. 90+4 min United counter and Garnacho shrieks away at inside-right! He\u2019s got Fernandes in the middle and Antony over one more, but instead manages to direct a simple pass into the legs of the covering defender the consolation prize of a corner quickly wasted. 90+3 min Villa work it well, moving from centre to left, and when De Ligt slides in to block the low cross, cunningly allowing the ball through his legs, it looks for all the world like Duran will score. But though Dalot turns his back on it, he manages to impart the block, congratulating himself like he\u2019s just done Bobby Moore on Pele. 90+2 min Finally, we set sail again, United clearing the free-kick. 90 min We\u2019ll have six additional minutes \u2013 but probably more, given we\u2019re still not ready to resume. 89 min And still, a lad running around the touchline with a box. I know it\u2019s a ludicrous suggestion, but how about we put the game before the tech and just get on with it? No one fell in love with football because of its robust decision-making process, so the bid to improve correct decisions from 90-something% to 90-something-else%, in the process compromising the greatest feeling known to mankind \u2013 the scoring of a goal \u2013 is to satisfy who, exactly? 87 min The ref\u2019s VAR gear issn\u2019t working, so there\u2019s a break while he gets it sorted. 87 min Lindelof shoves Duran and escapes punishment, so to make sure he sythes through Duran and is booked. Free-kick Villa, down the left, a few yards deeper than the corner of the box. 86 min Bit of United possession in the Villa half, the first for a while. But no one feeds Zirkzee, then Lindelof flights an aimless cross directly into Martinez\u2019s gloves. 86 min Soon to get under way: 84 min Change apiece: first, United send Casemiro on for Mainoo, then Villa try Maatsen for Digne. 82 min I daresay both managers would accept a draw here \u2013 lucky for them, given neither side looks to have the quality needed to score. 80 min Villa have struggled to isolate Lindelof, and when Tielemans sets Digne at him, the cross is easily blocked. United then counter, the move foundering at the feet of Zirkzee \u2013 whose easy touch of just a few of games ago seems to have deserted him. 80 min Another poor delivery, United clearing easily \u2013 which tells one all one needs ta kna. 79 min Duran moves through centrefield and ignores the exhortations to shoot, instead finding Watkins whose cross is blocked behind. But before Tielemans can take the corner, the ref has to intercede, Torres and Evans scuffling in front of Onana. 77 min Antony beats his man on the turn and does his one thing, a looping curler easily claimed by Martinez. 76 min Again, Digne\u2019s kick is poor, his shot soaring way over wall and bar. 74 min De Ligt, a front-foot defender if ever there was one \u2013 one reason he and Martinez don\u2019t pair well \u2013 comes around Watkins to insert a foot. It looks a fair challenge but the ref appraises a foul, so Villa have a free-kick 25 yards out, just left of centre. 72 min Eriksen sweeps out to Garnacho who goes on the outside and drills low and hard across the box, Carlos sliding in to poke back to Martinez. He looks to have hurt himself, but is alright for now 71 min Fernandes sets Zirkzee away, but with no support and even less pace he has to check \u2026 then gets the ball caught under his feet. 70 min Barkley leans inside, Lindelof swaying similarly, then sets Rogers away on the outside only for the cross to sail over the bar. Villa have been very poor today. 68 min Fernandes curls over the wall, seeking the near side-netting \u2026 and hits the face of the bar! De Ligt then shanks the rebound wide, and that\u2019s the closest either side have come to scoring \u2013 though perhaps Martinez makes the save if the shot\u2019s lower. 67 min Fernandes wastes a decent situation \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 following nice, quick passing. He\u2019s been very poor so far this season, having carried United through the second half of last, and they need him to find himself. He\u2019s behind the free-kick, 25 yards out, just left of centre\u2026 65 min De Ligt wins two important pokes, then Rogers moves by Mainoo \u2026 who responds with an important challenge. 64 min Two changes for United, Antony and Zirkzee replacing Hojlund and Rashford. I\u2019m not certain what the former has done to earn the shout ahead of Amad; my gusss is that his ball-holding ability is what Ten Hag is after. 63 min Villa send on Duran for Bailey, then send the free-kick into the box, Watkins eventually hooking a slice well over the top. 61 min Duran has been called back and will soon be with us, then Bailey diddles Rashford on the outside via stepover. So Rashford lazily dangles a leg, trips Bailey, and is extremely lucky to avoid a second booking. If he\u2019d not been carded before, he\u2019d for sure have got one for that. 60 min Tielemans and Digne fake the cross twice each, then go down the line and United clear. 60 min Cash gets away from Rashford, who runs through him and is booked. Another chance for Villa to swing a free-kick into the box\u2026 59 min \u201cFunny how the mind plays tricks,\u201d says Adam Webster. \u201cI remember that 1984 Villa v Man Utd game, but I could have sworn that Didier Six got a hat-trick that day. It was so exotic seeing a foreign player playing in England.\u201d 57 min Evans misses a challenge and Rogers finds Watkins, who lashes over the top. Villa have taken control of midfield here \u2013 and of course still have the cheat code that is Jhon Duran on the bench. 55 min Villa are coming, picking some space in the United box when Barkley slides a gentle ball down the side of the box for Cash. But his square-pass is poor, Dalot heading behind, and again the corner goes short, this time to Bailey, who finds Tielemans, and his shot, though powerfully struck, is turned behind by Onana easily enough, and this time the kick comes to nowt. 54 min Noni Madueke has made it Chelsea 1-1 Forest. 53 min Rogers gets a chance to open his legs, dashing through centrefield. But a heavy touch allows De Ligt to step in, Evans completing the job. 51 min \u2026which Tielemans cuts back for Cash, who swipes wide. On the Villa bench, Austin McPhee, the set-piece coach looks befuddled; perhaps he\u2019s just passed a reflective surface, because he looks like he\u2019s just woken up after 67,043 years. 51 min Villa move from one end to the other, winning a corner of their own\u2026 49 min From the corner, Eriksen\u2019s looks for De Ligt, but he\u2019s crowded out, then Garnacho pulls a shot wide of the near post. 48 min Mainno sees a shot charged down then wins a loose ball, turning and spreading to Rashford who comes across the face of the box, feints the shot then clobbers one, Martinez tipping behind. 47 min Also going on: 47 min Elsewhere, Chris Wood has put Forest 1-0 up at Chelsea. 46 min \u201cI thought your River Island call was a good one,\u201d says Adam Roberts.\u201d Whenever I see this horror story of a third kit, I expect to see the Ralph Lauren polo horse rather than a cartoon too-big devil.\u201d 46 min Off we go again. Lindelof is at right-back, which should interest Philogene. Villa should be getting him on the ball at every opportunity. It\u2019s De Ligt who gets the shout to replace Maguire, not Martinez. He\u2019s not done anything to justify that, so we can only assume it\u2019s his profile Ten Hag wants \u2013 more physical power and a bit more pace over the first few yards. Oh, and Mazraoui is also going off, presumably injured, so Victor Lindel\u00f6f comes on for his first appearance of the season. I do, though \u2013 partially at least \u2013 agree with the point on the reffing. United players seem to have been booked for infractions that might\u2019ve been fairly punished with a free-kick, while Villa\u2019s have been excused similar offences. \u201cSometimes I feel like I am watching a different match to everyone else, especially when watching the MBMs,\u201d says Andy Donald. \u201cI\u2019m not a Utd supporter by any description but they seem much better than Villa here. There also seems to be no mention of the very cynical fouls Villa are not getting called out on. I guess my point is that very often commentators ignore what is happening in front of them when a team is on the rise outside of the context of a match happening. Case in point: a headline on another publication reads \u2018United holding firm at Aston Villa\u2019. It makes it sound like they are holding back this almost unstoppable tidal wave of dominance by Villa when it\u2019s not comparable to what I am seeing with my own eyes.\u201d I think \u201cmuch better\u201d is a stretch. It\u2019s been a fairly even half and I think the \u201cholding firm\u201d line is there to tell people United are defending well, which they are. Half-time email: \u201cIs it that surprising that Ugarte hasn\u2019t played that much so far?\u201d wonders David Wall. \u201cHe arrived late on the last day of the transfer window, so only a month ago. Plus he\u2019d played no football since the Copa Am\u00e9rica, arriving late back from that to PSG and then not being involved at all with them. He\u2019s unlikely to be match fit having had no pre-season and no season before he arrived. Hardly an ideal situation to chuck someone into a new side, let alone one that is really struggling.\u201d I agree, but given the state of United\u2019s midfield, and his status as a young athlete at his physical peak, I\u2019d expected to see him more. Half-time entertainment from on this day in 1984: Neither side has offered much going forward, and both will feel they can improve enough to pinch a win. 45+2 min Evans goes in the back of Bailey, and again Digne\u2019s delivery is poor, picking out Big Bruno Fernandes, who heads away. Then, when the ball comes back, it misses everyone, and Maguire limps away with jiggered quad; that looks like being his afternoon done, De Ligt preparing to replace him \u2013 but they\u2019ll take a view during the break. 45+1 min Hojlund outpaces Diego Carlos, coming form behind to steal possession. But as blind-side shove goes unpunished, to his consternation. 45 min We\u2019ll have three added minutes. 44 min Hojlund picks up a loose ball after Torres loses it in his feet, but with Fernandes waiting for a pass in the middle, he instead opts for a scoop down the side of the box, which predictably runs behind. 44 min Garnacho gives away a free-kick down the left, and again, it\u2019s bent directly into Onana\u2019s gloves. 43 min \u201cPersonally, United\u2019s kit puts me in mind of the natty number that Egypt wore at the 1974 African Cup of Nations,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. 42 min Mainoo beats one man then, with nowhere else to go, slides into a challenge with Carlos. He\u2019s booked, somewhat harshly. 40 min It\u2019s so good to see Ross Barkley back playing well. In 2013-14 he looked the nearest thing to Gazza we\u2019d seen in a while, his strength in possession while moving through the middle of the pitch marking out an unusual talent. But he never quite developed his football brain and looked to be on the way out, so his renaissance is as surprising as it is welcome. 39 min Dalot clips into Rashford, who uses a thigh to lay off for Garnacho, backing him up. But the curling shot, though hit with venom, is too close to Martinez who fists away on the dive. 38 min Digne whips directly into Onana\u2019s midriff. 36 min Watkins isolates Maguire out wide, saunters by on the outside and is immediately introduced to grass. Maguire is booked and Digne will now swing in a free-kick from just outside the box, right-hand side\u2026 35 min Digne swings in a decent ball from the left but at the back post, Bailey opts to go with foot not head and can\u2019t make decent connection. 34 min \u201cTwo of the best, in my humble opinion, kits of the season on show here today,\u201d returns Matthew Lysaght. \u201cSuch a pity they\u2019ll be forgotten about by this time next year. Oh for the two-season kit use of yesteryear.\u201d I\u2019m not sure that ever existed. For as long as I\u2019ve been watching football, United have had three \u2013 in the mid-80s it was red home, white away and blue third for Southampton and Sunderland. I do, though, agree that Villa\u2019s colours are great. The below is one of my all time favourites. 33 min Fernandes heads Digne\u2019s corner away, then Eriksen gets rid when the ball comes back and Hojlund wins free-kick release. 31 min United, growing in confidence until they shrink in confidence, knock it about nicely, Garnacho then retrieving possession inside the Villa box before being crowded out. But they come again, Diego Carlos heading Rashford\u2019s cross clear, then Evans again averts the counter. But not for long, Tielemans\u2019 cross blocked behind by Evans \u2013 so far the best player on the pitch \u2013 for a corner. 28 min In co-comms, Carragher notes that Rashford is narrow, explaining that United are keen to force Villa wide. But it may also be the case that they want him closer to goal than he has been \u2013 though in the meantime, here come Villa, Fernandes\u2019 ill-advised flick finding barkley. He moves through midfield and spreads to Bailey, but when the return cut-back arrives, his first touch is heavy, and again Evans slides in to win the challenge. 26 min Villa haven\u2019t started especially well \u2013 they\u2019ll have dumped a load of energy, physical and emotional, on Wednesday night, which perhaps explains it. But here comes Rogers now, easily shrugging off Eriksen, so Evans hurtles in to win a useful challenge. He the limps away, holding his left knee, but should be fine. 25 min United\u2019s kit looks like it was sold in River Island, c.1997. 23 min United counter and Fernandes wins a free-kick, hit long towards Maguire on the far side of the box. His header hits Rogers\u2019 arm, but it was too close to the ball to yield the kind of ludicrous penalty handed over in the 2023 FA Cup final. 22 min Kobbie Mainoo is a fantastic talent, but he needs to improve \u2013 and United need to improve \u2013 at getting him on the ball. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s touched it yet. 20 min Philogene wanders in off the left and, with no one closing down, waves a right foot at a wobble-ball that flies a yard or two wide of the far post. 19 min \u201cLike other non-Utd football fans, I\u2019m enjoying Manchester United\u2019s current run of hopelessness and misery\u201d says Yash Gupta. |But I can\u2019t get my head around why they refused to hire Pochettino? Even at Chelsea Pochettino showed he can sort mess out. From the outside it looks like Man Utd need a coach who can play exciting football which maximises talent available at their disposal and also promotes academy talent. And United generally give their managers enough time which was one accusation thrown at Poch that his project usually took time initially. Anyway Pochettino is now off to USMNT. So let\u2019s bring in Southgate for more fun.\u201d I guess they didn\u2019t employ Pochettino because he\u2019d (arguably) proven himself just a bit less good than the managers he\u2019d have to catch, and we\u2019re now a few years away from the best of him. 17 min Excellent from Dalot, who spins away from goal then slides a decent reverse-pass into the inside-left channel for Hojlund, who times his run well. But a heavy touch allows Diego Carlos to intercede, and this has the look of a classic game between a good side and a side with good players: close until it isn\u2019t. 15 min United win a free-kick 40 yards from goal, send the big men forward \u2026 and Eriksen passes square to predictable avail. 14 min Maguire wins a decent challenge and passes into misfield, Hojlund laying off for Fernandes, who sticks one in behind for Garnacho. He looks offside but the flag stay down even when the ball goes into touch \u2013 but Villa soon win it back. 13 min \u201cRogers missed the shot but he just exposed the slow ponderous Evans and Maguire in a single play,\u201d reckons Mary Waltz. \u201cOh dear, poor, sad lads.\u201d My personal bugbear with that chance is how easily Villa passed through the lines, but we\u2019ve no need to choose. 12 min Diego Carlos replaces Konsa. 10 min Konsa is down following a challenge from Hojlund and that\u2019s bad news for Villa, who already have injury issues at the back. As soon as he went down, he was holding his hammy and beating the ground, so he\u2019ll soon depart. 9 min \u201cI agree that there doesn\u2019t seem to be a clear style of play under Ten Hag,\u201d writes Karen Asad. \u201cThat\u2019s why the excuse of \u2018not being integrated\u2019 for dropping Ugarte doesn\u2019t really wash; you want to tell me the rest of the team is completely integrated? That and the fact he\u2019s presided over a lot of questionable transfers don\u2019t exactly scream keep confidence.\u201d In general, Ten Hag is quite circumspect with new players, young players and those returning form injury, but I\u2019m amazed by how little Ugarte has played given the circumstances. 8 min Again Konsa easily passes into Rogers, who finds Watkins, accepts a return, and shifts the ball away from Evans, creating a shooting lane before whamming into the near-post side-netting. Behind the goal, plenty think it\u2019s in, but Onana had it covered \u2013 theoretically speaking, at least. 6 min There\u2019s a calm, focused intensity about Villa \u2013 they believe in what they\u2019re doing. their confidence and composure on the ball giving different vibes to United\u2019s wilder, more desperate passing. 5 min Rashford robs Cash and immediately has his collar felt sets off from halfway, kinking inside Barkley \u2013 had he fallen over the leg extended into his path, he might\u2019ve earned a penalty \u2013 before thrashing a shot that Martinez beats away. He\u2019s looking better on the ball these last few games \u2013 but the problem during them has been his work out of possession. 4 min Digne picks out Dalot, who heads clear and Villa start again. 3 min It\u2019s been a slow start, but then Konsa feeds a nice pass into Rogers, so Eriksen trips him and is booked. Free-kick Villa, 30 yards out and well right of centre. 2 min United look to be pressing high before sitting in a mid-to-low block. I have no knowledge of what Ten hag\u2019s instructions are, but I\u2019d be certain the game-model demanded of him stipulates a high defensive line. 1 min By the way, is the Holte the best end in English football? My contention is that it is. 1 min Away we go! Our teams are tunnelled \u2026and here they come! \u201cJust on De Ligt,\u201d says Matthew Lysaght, \u201cI\u2019d say there\u2019s a reason as to why both Juventus and Bayern Munich have been happy to sell the guy after a couple of seasons, particularly as they are both clubs who tend to operate at the business end of their respective Leagues. Although Bayern have a habit of foisting their unwanted players onto Utd, and Utd have a habit of gladly taking them.\u201d They do, though it\u2019s fair to say De Ligt did pretty well for both those clubs and that circumstances are also important. The problem at United is there was no call for a centre-back of his characteristics. \u201cThere needs to be some perspective here I feel,\u201d writes Rick Harris. \u201cUnited have had one day fewer recovery and travelled to and from Portugal so Villa have to be massive favourites given their excellent start to the season, their home advantage and their easier calendar. Why is the Guardian trying so hard to get Ten Hag sacked? You did it with Solksjaer and here we go again. Arsenal kept faith with Arteta and are now reaping the rewards, so United should give Ten Hag until the end of the season and review the situation then.\u201d I don\u2019t think Villa are relevant here because we\u2019re not evaluating Ten Hag on the basis of a match we\u2019ve not seen yet, rather than after more than two years, his team are still a mess with no firm identity. Even when Arteta was losing, the plan was clear \u2013 this is not so of Ten Hag \u2013 and as a team of writers, all we can do is say what we see: that his team are inexcusably appalling. We should also note that we\u2019ve not yet mentioned Manuel Ugarte.If reports are to be believed, he was not the manager\u2019s choice, which perhaps explains why he\u2019s been offered so few minutes \u2013 though his performances so far haven\u2019t demanded them. Thing is, United desperately need someone in his position, and Villa will be excited to explore the space in between the midfield and defensive lines. We should, though, say in Dalot\u2019s defence that he\u2019s playing out of position and behind a midfield without the legs to protect him. Email! \u201cCould I put forward Dalot as a bigger issue with the United defence?\u201d beseeches David Flynn. \u201cI can think of at least five goals this season where he has been absent at the back post. Again against Spurs for the first last weekend and all three midweek goals came from or where scored on his side. I don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s been told to remain high up but it\u2019s exposing the nearest centre-back, which destabilises the middle in turn.\u201d I agree he\u2019s had some terrible moments this season, the failure to track back for the Johnson goal particularly egregious. I also agree that when he inverts, he can leave a space down the wing , but I can\u2019t excuse De Ligt\u2019s charging about, nor his ability to allow strikers to run off him. Happily, there\u2019s lots of blame to go around and no need to be sparing. There is something fairly weird about a manager dropping two centre-backs he signed for big money for two he did not, one tried and found wanting at the top level, the other almost a decade past his best. Thing is, De Ligt was a strange signing by Ten Hag \u2013 and it\u2019s strange the board sanctioned it \u2013 given his rashness and lack of pace are exactly the things Mart\u00ednez\u2019s ideal partner needs to temper. It\u2019s no surprise their partnership has been disastrous \u2013 though of course it\u2019s also fair to say the former needs time to settle in a new league. United, meanwhile, presumably plan for their three midfield technicians to keep the ball away from Villa and look for early long passes out to the wide men. They\u2019ll also have to find a way of serving H\u00f8jlund, who suffered in that aspect last season; Garnacho playing on his natural side might help with the crosses and cut-backs he needs, because he\u2019s more than enough pace to go at Lucas Digne on the outside. Where is the game? Villa will, of course, look to exploit United\u2019s lack of pace at the back, while outmuscling and outrunning them in midfield \u2013 in fairness, my 11-year-old daughter\u2019s team would fancy themselves to manage that. I\u2019d also expect Bailey to target the hole left by Diogo Dalot when he inverts, while Jaden Philogene will back himself to have too much power for Noussair Mazraoui. The problem United have \u2013 and have always had under Ten Hag \u2013 is a lack of control. H\u00f8jlund\u2019s hold-up play is unlikely to help them retain possession, while the wide players are focused on going for goal \u2013 likewise Bruno Fernandes behind them. This may or may not lead to the spamming of hopeful passes to no one\u2026 Otherwise, United go with the wide players deployed to exploit Spurs\u2019 high line last weekend. Perhaps their starting positions will be conducive to that tactic \u2013 Rashford in particular was too deep and too wide \u2013 and perhaps that won\u2019t be the sum of the strategy as it it seemed to be then. But with H\u00f8jlund preferred to Zirkzee, chances are United hope to target Villa in similar fashion, because all of their front three like space in behind. As below, the big news for United is the omission of Mart\u00ednez and De Ligt. The idea, though, that they\u2019ve not been dropped, is hard to believe given how poorly both are playing \u2013 and a question that might be asked is whether the rashness of the latter is exacerbating the faults of the former. Either way, though, Ten Hag has swapped two young(ish) centre-backs with no pace for two older centre-backs with no pace, against a team with loads of it and, let\u2019s be real, the selection smacks of a manager hoping to force a one-off result and hang in there, rather than build for the future as per his brief. Ten Hag tells Sky that he\u2019s rotating, hence the defensive changes, saying it\u2019s nothing to do with external pressure. He believes his players are ready for the game, and everyone in the club is calm and composed; they just have to improve their process. Villa will play as they always do, but will particularly miss the presence of Onana in midfield \u2013 especially given United\u2019s weakness at defending set-pieces. Konsa, meanwhile, isn\u2019t as suited to combating the physical threat of Rasmus H\u00f8jlund as Diego Carlos, and i\u2019d not be surprised to see United target him. Erik ten Hag makes four changes: Matthijs de Ligt, Lisandro Mart\u00ednez, Casemiro and Amad are left out, with Jonny Evans, Harry Maguire, Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho coming in. Unai Emery makes three changes to the side that beat Bayern so memorably in midweek: Diego Carlos, Amadou Onana and Jacob Ramsey drop out, the latter two missing from the squad entirely due to injury; they\u2019re replaced by Matty Cash, Ross Bailey and Leon Bailey, with Ezri Konsa moving from right-back to centre-back. Aston Villa (4-4-1-1): Mart\u00ednez; Cash, Konsa, Pau Torres, Digne; Philogene, Barkley, Tielemans, Bailey; Rogers; Watkins. Subs: Gauci, Nedeljkovic, Maatsen, Carlos, Bogarde, Swinkels, Buendia, Young, Duran. Man United (4-3-3): Onana; Mazraoui, Maguire, Evans, Dalot; Eriksen, Mainoo, Fernandes; Garnacho, H\u00f8jlund, Rashford. Subs: Bayindir, De Ligt, Lindelof, Martinez, Casemiro, Ugarte, Amad, Antony, Zirkzee. Referee: Rob Jones (Merseyside) In real life, it\u2019s considered bad form to enjoy the misfortunes of others, but happily we have football to redeem us from such woke nonsense. And, over the last decade or so, there\u2019s been no more reliable source of that pleasure than Manchester United, such that we are all now experts in what it looks like when their latest manager is finished. For David Moyes it was Everton away in April 2014, a tenure of entirely predictable ineptitude crystallised by as dreadful a display as could possibly be imagined and the Goodison crowd singing \u201cStuck with Moyes, stuck with Moyes Man United\u201d. He was sacked the next day. Next was Louis van Gaal and football so bad it left all who witnessed it with scarred eyes and scorched soul. His regime collpased on Boxing Day 2015 via humiliation at Stoke and a performance of epochal awfulness which ensured a third straight defeat \u2013 the other two having come against the powerhouses of Bournemouth and Norwich. He was sacked just over five months later, the day after lifting the FA Cup. So Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was engaged and, with his otherworldly magic now consumed by pubescent paranoia, the end became apparent in August 2018 when Ed Woodward backed his own footballing acumen over that of an indisputable all-time great, then bragged about it to the press. But it was not until five months later that on-pitch events made dismissal essential with unseemly defeat at Anfield. He was sacked the next day. The game that should\u2019ve signalled Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s demise was a 4-2 defeat at Leicester in October 2021, his defence conceding goals faster than his attack could score them. He was sacked just over a month later, allowed to sneak in the valedictory gifts of a a 5-0 home thrashing by Liverpool, a home derby outclassing from Manchester City and a 4-1 undressing at Watford before accepting his carriage clock. What unites these multifarious incompetencies, travesties and debacle is the absence of hope: before them, there was a little, after them there was none. Which brings us to The Beleaguered Erik ten HagTM, the most thoroughly backed managed of the Post-Fergie Wilderness YearsTM but in whom it became impossible rather than implausible to believe following last Sunday\u2019s abomination against Spurs. Though he survived to preside over a second consecutive midweek mess, he must now fear that regardless of what happens today, the imminent international break will mean curtains. Nor will he find Aston Villa accommodating opponents. Unai Emery\u2019s outfit are so much of what Ten Hag\u2019s are not, a collection of excellent individuals deftly forged into a coherent, physical and unobliging unit that accentuates strengths and minimises weaknesses. Before you watch them play you know what you\u2019re going to see, after you watch them play you\u2019re pleased you saw it, and they arrive at this game having first beaten Bayern Munich then enjoyed a day\u2019s more rest than their opponents. They also owe United, having lost to them twice last season \u2013 first in embarrassing circumstances then in devastating circumstances \u2013 and need to keep pace with the league leaders. They will fancy this. All of which should mean an entertaining afternoon \u2013 but perhaps not for the just-about-current Manchester United manager. Kick-off: 2pm BST",

Neither outcome achieves Israel\u2019s security objectives \u2026 Forcing the choice between escalation and the status quo gives Iran, and, by extension, Hezbollah, an advantage and is a key feature of its proxy strategy.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "As Israelis approached the beginning of the high holy days last week on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, the news began to circulate. Several IDF units fighting on the border with Lebanon had taken casualties in at least two different locations. Soldiers had died in combat, and many were wounded. The confirmation of the wounded and dead, if not the circumstances served as a stark reminder for Israelis of the blows that come in war, even as Israel\u2019s punishing air offensive has killed hundreds of Lebanese and wounded more. The soldiers\u2019 deaths came after two weeks in which Israel struck a series of blows against Hezbollah, including the assassination of the group\u2019s leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and most of the top leadership. Underlining that sense of hazard was another story that revealed itself slowly last week: how the wave of Iranian missiles launched against Israel had not been as inconsequential as initially claimed by Israel\u2019s leadership, and instead shown that a large-scale strike could not only overwhelm Israel\u2019s anti-missile defences but that Tehran could accurately explode warheads on the targets it was aiming for, in this case several military bases. All of which raises serious questions as Israel prepares for a \u201csignificant\u201d military response to Iran for the its missile attack. A year into Israel\u2019s fast metastasising multi-front war that now includes Iran, Lebanon and Gaza, Yemen, Syria and Iraq, Israel\u2019s undoubted military and intelligence superiority is faltering on several fronts. In Israel\u2019s expanding war, as Israeli security analyst Michael Milshtein told the Guardian last week, there have been \u201ctactical victories\u201d but \u201cno strategic vision\u201d and certainly not one that unites the different fronts. What is clear is that the conflict of the last year has seriously exposed Israel\u2019s newly minted operational doctrine, which had planned for fighting short decisive wars largely against non-state actors armed with missiles, with the aim of avoiding being drawn into extended conflicts of attrition. Instead, the opposite has happened. While Israeli officials have tried to depict Hamas as defeated as a military force \u2013 a questionable characterisation in the first place \u2013 they concede that it survives as a guerilla organisation in Gaza, although degraded. Even as Israel has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza, levelled large areas of the coastal strip and displaced a population assailed by hunger, death and sickness on multiple occasions, Israeli armour was assaulting areas of the strip once more this weekend in a new operation into northern Gaza to prevent Hamas regrouping. Hezbollah too, despite sustaining heavy losses in its leadership, retains a potency fighting on its own terrain in the villages of southern Lebanon where it has had almost two decades to prepare for this conflict. All of which raises serious questions as to whether Israel has any clearer vision for its escalating conflict with Iran. A long-distance war with Iran, many experts are beginning to suggest, could also devolve into a more attritional conflict despite the relative imbalances in capabilities, even as Israel continues to plan for the scale of its own response to last week\u2019s missile attack. Speaking to Bloomberg TV, Carmiel Arbit, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Middle East programme, described that dynamic. \u201cI think we are going to be looking at this as the new reality for a long time,\u201d Arbit predicted. \u201cI think the question is simply going to be how often is the tit for tat going to happen, and is it just going to be tit for tat, or is this going to escalate only further. And I think the hope of the international community at this point is to avert a world war three rather than this smaller-scale war of attrition.\u201d Nicole Grajewski, a fellow at of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, echoes that view in part, while cautioning that an extended series of exchanges could push Tehran to a less predictable reaction. \u201cThe continued asymmetrical tit-for-tat between Iran and Israel risks devolving into a futile cycle of Iranian missile strikes and Israeli retaliations, each exposing Tehran\u2019s military limitations while failing to alter the balance \u2013 and potentially driving Iran toward more desperate and unpredictable measures in its quest for credible deterrence.\u201d \u201cIn the long term \u2013 and it cannot be assumed that the Israeli-Iranian conflict will end soon,\u201d wrote Haaretz\u2019s main military analyst, Amos Harel, \u201cthere will be competition between the production rate and sophistication of Iran\u2019s offensive systems on one side and of Israel\u2019s interception systems on the other.\u201d With Israel now so deeply immersed in a widening conflict, it is unclear whether it can escape what Anthony Pfaff, the director of the Strategic Studies Institute at the US Army War College, in August called the \u201cescalatory trap\u201d. \u201cIf Israel escalates,\u201d wrote Pfaff, \u201cit fuels the escalatory spiral that could, at some point, exceed its military capability to manage. \u201cIf it chooses the status quo, where Hamas remains capable of terrorist operations, then it has done little to improve its security situation. Neither outcome achieves Israel\u2019s security objectives \u2026 Forcing the choice between escalation and the status quo gives Iran, and, by extension, Hezbollah, an advantage and is a key feature of its proxy strategy.\u201d",

Two minutes later, in a nod to his previous lack of precision, Madueke side-footed a much easier chance over the bar. Chelsea looked the favourites for a winner and the first time Jackson burst free towards goal he sparked another period of mesmerising pinball in the Forest area \u2013 again with nobody in blue able to divert it in.

      "body": "<p>There is something about hair that sparks conversations (and questions! So many questions!) often riddled with frustration. It is a reminder that our hair isn\u2019t simply this thing that sprouts from our scalps. It is much more complex than that. It\u2019s about the right products, people and places that help you achieve something that makes you feel amazing. Which we all want. Post summer, when we see our hair in a different (autumnal) light, makes us consider what we can do to make it thicker, shiner, stronger, fuller, healthier\u2026 And sometimes we simply want hair that looks less basic. The industry understands this all too well, which is why so many brands launch a ton of product and treatments at this time.</p> <p>We have sifted through many of their offerings and pulled together a hair special to tackle not every single question, but some of the key ones around hair that I hear time and time again. Why is the Dyson so expensive? How do I combat hair loss? What shampoos will give me thicker hair? Do supplements actually work? Who on social media might just inspire me to have a new style or simply embrace the one I already have? I can\u2019t promise you we have all the answers you want, but hopefully it\u2019s an inspiring start.</p> <h2>Let it shine: frazzled, dull, lacklustre? These smart products will help</h2> <p><strong>Briogeo Yuzu + Plum Oil Sleek Stick, \u00a320, <a href=\"http://cultbeauty.co.uk/\">cultbeauty.co.uk</a></strong> Most styling products \u2013 particularly those that help achieve a super-shiny look \u2013 are not as focused on hair health as they should be. Briogeo\u2019s Yuzu + Plum Oil Sleek Stick includes nourishing and protective antioxidants and vitamins, so you can achieve that slick ponytail without compromising the health of the hair.</p> <p><strong>Grown Alchemist Hydra-Restore Shampoo and Conditioner, \u00a324 each, <a href=\"http://grownalchemist.com/\">grownalchemist.com</a> </strong>If you find your hair is still frazzled from the heat of your summer holidays, look no further than Grown Alchemist. Its new Hydra-Restore will gently exfoliate your scalp and give your hair a powerful injection of moisture.</p> <p><strong>Leonor Greyl Energisant range, from \u00a334.50, <a href=\"http://feelunique.com/\">feelunique.com</a> </strong>If your hair looks limp and lacklustre, try the new Energisant range, which includes shampoo, conditioner and treatment serum, from this sustainable, luxe Parisian haircare brand. Combining ingredients such as moringa seed, Indian plum and almond protein, it strengthens hair at the follicle (thereby reducing hair thinning) and adds body to the hair without weighing it down.</p> <p><strong>Josh Wood Colour Miracle hair Oil, \u00a315, <a href=\"http://joshwoodcolour.com/\">joshwoodcolour.com</a> </strong>Great colour comes down to incredible expertise and good aftercare. Hairstylist Josh Wood \u2013 the globally renowned, expert colourist delivers both. His latest launch is a versatile oil that manages frizz and also works as a pre-shampoo or overnight treatment and detangler. However you use it, you can expect shinier and softer locks that look amazing long after you\u2019ve had your colour done.</p> <p><strong>Colour Wow Dream Filter, \u00a326, <a href=\"http://uk.colourwowhair.com/\">uk.colourwowhair.com</a></strong> Dull, brittle and breakage-prone hair are just some of the disadvantages of living in a hard water area. Colour Wow\u2019s Dream Filter removes the buildup of the minerals in hard water, which leaves hair looking dull and makes it difficult for moisture to penetrate strands.</p> <p><strong>Living Proof Perfect Hair Day High Shine Gloss, \u00a330, <a href=\"http://livingproof.com/\">livingproof.com</a> </strong>An excellent new launch from one of the industry\u2019s best haircare brands, High Shine Gloss does exactly what it says on the tin. Using a light-enhancing technology, it gives your hair the best shine ever. And unlike most hair glosses, it is lightweight and silicone free, so leaves no residue.</p> <h2>\u2018Start with it on the long side\u2019: Tom Smith on how to adapt to a new fringe</h2>    <p>A great place to start is to gather up to three photos of fringe styles you like \u2013 ideally hair types and face shapes that resemble your own. Show these to your stylist and ask their advice on how to adapt the style to suit you best. Ask about what maintenance is required to have it looking like your photos and how often it will need to be trimmed (I have some clients who pop in for a fringe \u2018dust\u2019 every three weeks). Feel free to ask your stylist to cut your fringe on the longer side first, so you can assess and check how your hair naturally settles (this is something I\u2019m in the habit of doing anyway) then, if required, slowly trim it shorter. Ask your stylist to show you an easy way to reset your fringe each morning. Something to note: fringes do typically require some form of tending to every day, so if your daily hair routine is currently minimal, having a fringe cut in may change that. <em>Tom Smith is artist in residence at Billi Currie, an artist at Olaplex and colour director at Evo</em></p> <h2>Head teachers: the influencers, hairstylists and salons to follow on social media </h2> <p><strong>For coils and curls: </strong>Ni\u00e0 the Light (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/niathelight/?hl=en\">@niathelight</a>); Michelle Sultan (@<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hairbymichellesultan/?hl=en\">hairbymichellesultan); Charlotte Mensah</a> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/charlottemensah/?hl=en\">@charlottemensah</a>)</p> <p><strong>For grey hair: </strong>JoAni Johnson (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joanijohnson6000/?hl=en\">@joanijohnson6000); </a>Linda Rodin (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lindaandwinks/?hl=en\">@lindaandwinks</a>); Caroline Labouchere (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/carolinelabouchere/\">@carolinelabouchere</a>)</p> <p><strong>For celebrity: </strong>Chris Appleton (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chrisappleton1/?hl=en\">@chrisappleton</a>1); George Northwood (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/georgenorthwood/?hl=en\">@george northwood</a>); Larry King (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/larrykinghair/?hl=en\">@larrykinghair)</a></p> <p><strong>For fashion: </strong>Jawara (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jawaraw/?hl=en\">@jawaraw)</a>; Sam McKnight (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sammcknight1/?hl=en\">@sammcknight1</a>); Cyndia<strong> </strong>Harvey (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/CyndiaHarvey/\">@CyndiaHarvey</a>); Duffy (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/duffy_duffy/?hl=en\">@duffy_duffy</a>)</p> <p><strong>For Korean hair care:</strong> Park Jun Beauty Lab (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/parkjunbeautylab/\">@parkjunbeautylab</a>)</p> <p><strong>For colour: </strong>Josh Wood (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joshwood/?hl=en\">@joshwood</a>); Nicola Clarke(<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nicolaclarkecolour/?hl=en\">@nicolaclarkecolour</a>); Bleach London (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bleachlondon/?hl=en\">@bleachlondon</a>)</p> <p><strong>For wigs: </strong>Tokyo Stylez (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tokyostylez/?hl=en-gb\">@tokyostylez</a>); Kim Kimble (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kimblehaircare/?hl=en\">@kimblehaircare</a>); Haus of Shee (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hausofshee/?hl=en\">@hausofshee</a>)</p> <h2>Machine learning: clever gadgets and tools that make haircare simple</h2>    <p><strong>Dyson Supersonic Nural, \u00a3399, <a href=\"https://www.dyson.co.uk/en\">dyson.co.uk</a></strong> There has long been hype around Dyson. Hairstylists around the world swear by the brand. However, the smart gadgets do come at a price. So the question is: why? Perhaps we need to change our perspective on what Dyson creates. They consider everything from the way the product is shaped to fit your hand, to the weight and then, of course, how it works. The Supersonic Nural hairdryer \u2013 their smartest hairdryer yet, is launched this month. It is no ordinary dryer. It has a scalp protector-meets-hair-health sensor that is automatically reduced to 55C \u2013 the optimum temperature for scalp comfort and drying speed. It prioritises safety and has a motion sensor that automatically deactivates heat, while decreasing airflow and noise when you are in between styling. It considers everything: the ease and efficiency of the process; the finished results and the health of your hair. So is it worth it? Well, when you consider all the above, yes.</p> <p><strong>GHD Chronos, \u00a3289, <a href=\"http://ghdhair.com/\">ghdhair.com</a> </strong>Hair straightening is widely considered to be terrible for hair health \u2013 particularly if you fry your hair on a regular basis. But choosing the right flat iron limits the damage. The Chronos features cutting-edge ceramic heat technology that ensures the heat distribution across your hair is even. It does this by keeping the plates at a temperature that is high enough to give you a smooth, sleek finish, but not so high that you end up with crispy hair.</p> <p><strong>BaByliss Air Power Pro, \u00a3150, <a href=\"http://boots.com/\">boots.com</a> </strong>A hairdryer that makes a lot of noise is pleasant to no one. Hence this excellent dryer by BaByliss is a godsend. Lightweight, powerful, performance driven\u2026 it has four temperature settings, three airflow settings, two styling concentrator nozzles and a wet-to-dry styling combination for all hair types and textures. It\u2019s also one of the quietest.</p> <p><strong>Hershesons The Wand, \u00a3120, <a href=\"http://hershesons.com/\">hershesons.com</a></strong> Unless your hair is naturally poker straight, it should be able to hold a curl \u2013 with the right tools, expertise and styling products. Hershesons, the chic London hair salon headed up by A-list hairstylist Luke Hersheson, has channelled his years of experience into a product line, the most recent of which is the Wand. Super lightweight with a ceramic-coated barrel, which minimises heat damage, it has been created to work at just the right temperature to ensure your curls last and last and last, regardless of your hair type.</p> <p><strong>Manta Detangling Brush, \u00a330, <a href=\"http://mantahair.com/\">mantahair.com</a></strong> A hairbrush is undoubtedly an anomaly in the world of tech-driven hair tools. And while the thought of a manual hair tool immediately reads like \u201ca lot of work\u201d, Manta makes the detangling process a breeze. Tim Mannington, a hairdresser with more than 25 years in the business, created Manta after his wife lost her hair through cancer. As she recovered and her hair began to grow back, she needed a brush that was effective yet gentle and minimised breakage. There are now numerous options for every hair type \u2013 even for babies.</p> <p><strong>Shark SmoothStyle Hot Brush &amp; Smoothing Comb, \u00a379.99, <a href=\"http://sharkclean.co.uk/\">sharkclean.co.uk</a></strong> This heated brush and comb gets the thumbs up for a few reasons. It is an all-in-one tool that works on both wet and dry hair. It styles, shapes and smooths with minimal heat damage. You can use it on any texture \u2013 straight, wavy or curly. In a time where high-priced hair tools have become the norm, having something that does all the above and is still under \u00a3100? That\u2019s a win.</p> <h2>Less can be more: how to cope with hair loss and what you can do to prevent thinning</h2>    <p>The signs of hair loss are easy to spot: a thinner ponytail, more of your scalp showing when you part your hair, shorter hairs \u2013 particularly along your hairline \u2013 and, of course, increased shedding. Reasons include age, stress, change in hormones, deficiencies in diet, hairstyles that pull too tight (the latter is easy to treat \u2013 simply start wearing your hair in a different style). The others, however, are more complex and might need medical attention. That aside, there are things you can certainly do for starters: take regular high-quality hair supplements that incorporate hair- and scalp-strengthening vitamins. This will boost growth and minimise shedding. Use hair products that not only boost scalp health, target hair density and minimise hair loss. <strong>Living Proof\u2019s Scalp Care Density Serum</strong> is a leave-in treatment infused with pea sprout and amaranth peptides to improve the appearance of thickness and density, but also reduces hair fallout rate. The <strong>Genesis </strong>haircare line by <strong>Kerastase </strong>is developed specifically to treat hair thinning (it also offers a hair-diagnostics service and in-salon treatments specifically to deal with this). <strong>Davines</strong> has a full range of products dedicated to treating hair loss. <strong>Typebea</strong>, a brand launched by beauty entrepreneur Anna Lahey and singer Rita Ora, has taken a different route from the usual celebrity brands to focus on products concerned with hair growth and hair thinning, while <strong>Nioxin</strong> offers shampoos and hair serums that will increase the appearance of thicker hair in eight weeks. Still, if you are really concerned about hair loss, it is worth seeing a trichologist. <strong>Phillip Kingsley</strong> \u2013 whose density line is clinically proven to slow hair loss and give you thicker, fuller hair \u2013 is still one of the best in the business.</p> <h2>Daily helpers: boost growth and pump up the volume with these supplements</h2> <p>Whether you are looking for supplements to encourage growth, attain more volume, or strengthen your hair, there is a supplement on the market that speaks to your needs. But do they work? Well, yes and no. The key to hair supplements, or any supplement, is to choose good quality(not ones that have numerous bulking agents) and to be consistent in taking them. That said, diet is key. Naturopath Rita Arora once told me: \u201cYou can\u2019t put crap in your body and still expect supplements to work.\u201d Here are five to consider\u2026</p> <p><strong>Viviscal Hair Growth Supplements, from \u00a337, <a href=\"http://viviscal.co.uk/\">viviscal.co.uk</a> </strong>Female hair follicles start to shrink from our mid-40s, so this hair growth supplement \u2013 from the OG of hair supplements \u2013 includes ingredients such as AminoMar, a rich marine protein complex, to promote the growth and repair of hair cells.</p> <p><strong>Vida Glow Hairology Capsules, \u00a345, <a href=\"http://uk.hairology.com/\">uk.hairology.com</a> </strong>Hair thinning and hair loss \u2013 be it through age or use of chemical/heat treatments \u2013 is addressed by Vida Glow\u2019s Hairology through this once-a-day capsule. The results of the trials are impressive \u2013 34% reduction in hair loss in a month.</p> <p><strong>The Nue Co Growth Phase, \u00a365, <a href=\"https://uk.thenueco.com/\">uk.thenueco.com</a></strong> Balancing nutritional deficiencies, supporting hormonal health, calming stress and protecting against free radicals for longer, thicker, fuller hair is the mission of this supplement. The blend of vitamins, proteins and adaptogens will reduce hair loss and thinning in 90 days.</p> <p><strong>Philip Kingsley Density Hair Complex, \u00a333, <a href=\"http://philipkingsley.co.uk/\">philipkingsley.co.uk</a> </strong>Philip Kingsley (the man was one of the world\u2019s leading trichologists) knows a thing or two about hair. Its holistic approach to haircare means it understood the importance of hair and scalp health decades before it became trendy. Which is why all of its supplements include an essential blend of amino acids to ensure the maintenance of healthy hair.</p> <p><strong>Ouai Thick and Full Supplements, \u00a328, <a href=\"http://cultbeauty.co.uk/\">cultbeauty.co.uk</a> </strong>One of the downsides with many supplements is the taste. Ouai \u2013 the brand founded by celebrity hair stylist Jen Atkin \u2013 has hair supplements that are formulated with a super-hydrating multivitamin complex to support hair strength \u2013 with no unpleasant aftertaste.</p> <h2>\u2018A sharp bob suits anyone\u2019: It\u2019s chic and versatile, but needs maintenance</h2>    <p>The chin-grazing cut is back. For the super-sharp bob, think fashion doyenne Anna Wintour, sans fringe, think Jessica Biel, more loose and liberated, think Ayo Edebiri. The undone, textured bob that made Alexa Chung the poster girl of the noughties is still going strong, too. There is the 50s Hollywood Baroque Bob, as seen on the likes of Zendaya. The versatility of the bob, explains Brixton Cowie, creative director at Neil Moodie Studio, is what makes it forever popular. \u2018Its length can be adjusted to suit the wearer\u2019s face and hair texture.\u2019 But there is the issue of maintenance. According to Jay Birmingham, celebrity hairstylist and Tresemm\u00e9\u2019s brand ambassador: \u2018Most bobs require daily styling to stay looking chic.\u2019 A textured bob can be more forgiving as it can be grown out into a \u2018lob\u2019 \u2013 a long bob. Your tool kit? Texturising spray, a diffuser for that \u2018dried naturally\u2019 style and, says Birmingham, a good hair oil, such as Lamellar Shine Oil from Tresemm\u00e9.</p> <h2>Leave it to the experts: salon hair treatments that are both innovative and helpful</h2> <p><strong>Jo Hansford\u2019s Metal Detox, <a href=\"http://johansford.com/\">johansford.com</a> </strong>Chlorine in swimming pools, residue from the pipes of a soft water system, or hard water from your taps, can all leave traces of metal in your hair. This causes brittleness and dulls colour. Yes, you can now tackle it with an off-the-shelf product (see Colour Wow Dream Filter) but, for a professional approach, head to the Jo Hansford salon (below). Its Metal Detox treatment will neutralise and remove the metals and then protect the hair to prevent new particles from entering. (And you can keep up the good work at home with the Jo Hansford\u2019s Metal Detox product line)</p> <p><strong>Olaplex Bond Shaper Curl Rebuilding Treatment Pro Service, <a href=\"http://olaplex.com/\">olaplex.com</a> </strong>This curl-restoring salon service is a new treatment that restores coils to their never-before-seen glory. Using its now famous bond-building innovation, the professional treatment contains a blend of 23 amino acids and coconut-avocado milk to improve curl retention, control frizz, reduce breakage and increase overall strength. The results are outstanding.</p> <p><strong>K18 Repair Service, <a href=\"https://www.k18hair.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopqS9IceTfwc2EJjPileD4mx4woVOYwP6G-9ekpWjuXCZW0TqxD\">K18hair.com</a></strong> For anyone that has experienced hair damage from heat styling, chemical processing or colour, this treatment from K18 is a must. It fortifies the hair leaving it smoother, bouncier and silkier.

      "bodyText": "There is something about hair that sparks conversations (and questions! So many questions!) often riddled with frustration. It is a reminder that our hair isn\u2019t simply this thing that sprouts from our scalps. It is much more complex than that. It\u2019s about the right products, people and places that help you achieve something that makes you feel amazing. Which we all want. Post summer, when we see our hair in a different (autumnal) light, makes us consider what we can do to make it thicker, shiner, stronger, fuller, healthier\u2026 And sometimes we simply want hair that looks less basic. The industry understands this all too well, which is why so many brands launch a ton of product and treatments at this time. We have sifted through many of their offerings and pulled together a hair special to tackle not every single question, but some of the key ones around hair that I hear time and time again. Why is the Dyson so expensive? How do I combat hair loss? What shampoos will give me thicker hair? Do supplements actually work? Who on social media might just inspire me to have a new style or simply embrace the one I already have? I can\u2019t promise you we have all the answers you want, but hopefully it\u2019s an inspiring start. Let it shine: frazzled, dull, lacklustre? These smart products will help Briogeo Yuzu + Plum Oil Sleek Stick, \u00a320, cultbeauty.co.uk Most styling products \u2013 particularly those that help achieve a super-shiny look \u2013 are not as focused on hair health as they should be. Briogeo\u2019s Yuzu + Plum Oil Sleek Stick includes nourishing and protective antioxidants and vitamins, so you can achieve that slick ponytail without compromising the health of the hair. Grown Alchemist Hydra-Restore Shampoo and Conditioner, \u00a324 each, grownalchemist.com If you find your hair is still frazzled from the heat of your summer holidays, look no further than Grown Alchemist. Its new Hydra-Restore will gently exfoliate your scalp and give your hair a powerful injection of moisture. Leonor Greyl Energisant range, from \u00a334.50, feelunique.com If your hair looks limp and lacklustre, try the new Energisant range, which includes shampoo, conditioner and treatment serum, from this sustainable, luxe Parisian haircare brand. Combining ingredients such as moringa seed, Indian plum and almond protein, it strengthens hair at the follicle (thereby reducing hair thinning) and adds body to the hair without weighing it down. Josh Wood Colour Miracle hair Oil, \u00a315, joshwoodcolour.com Great colour comes down to incredible expertise and good aftercare. Hairstylist Josh Wood \u2013 the globally renowned, expert colourist delivers both. His latest launch is a versatile oil that manages frizz and also works as a pre-shampoo or overnight treatment and detangler. However you use it, you can expect shinier and softer locks that look amazing long after you\u2019ve had your colour done. Colour Wow Dream Filter, \u00a326, uk.colourwowhair.com Dull, brittle and breakage-prone hair are just some of the disadvantages of living in a hard water area. Colour Wow\u2019s Dream Filter removes the buildup of the minerals in hard water, which leaves hair looking dull and makes it difficult for moisture to penetrate strands. Living Proof Perfect Hair Day High Shine Gloss, \u00a330, livingproof.com An excellent new launch from one of the industry\u2019s best haircare brands, High Shine Gloss does exactly what it says on the tin. Using a light-enhancing technology, it gives your hair the best shine ever. And unlike most hair glosses, it is lightweight and silicone free, so leaves no residue. \u2018Start with it on the long side\u2019: Tom Smith on how to adapt to a new fringe A great place to start is to gather up to three photos of fringe styles you like \u2013 ideally hair types and face shapes that resemble your own. Show these to your stylist and ask their advice on how to adapt the style to suit you best. Ask about what maintenance is required to have it looking like your photos and how often it will need to be trimmed (I have some clients who pop in for a fringe \u2018dust\u2019 every three weeks). Feel free to ask your stylist to cut your fringe on the longer side first, so you can assess and check how your hair naturally settles (this is something I\u2019m in the habit of doing anyway) then, if required, slowly trim it shorter. Ask your stylist to show you an easy way to reset your fringe each morning.

The popular stand-up Nate Bargatze has been handed over hosting duties once again after his well-received hosting debut almost exactly a year ago. Meanwhile, musical guest Coldplay returned for their eighth appearance. On the sketch front, there were multiple retreads of past bits; one from just last week.

Finding a slick way to include this election season\u2019s eclectic cast of characters, the sketch volleyed between Rudolph\u2019s Harris and Samberg\u2019s Emhoff watching Walz take on JD Vance (keenly played by Bowen Yang) on TV, with the cordialness between Walz and Vance played to romantic effect here.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E_WeuKkJ2s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7E_WeuKkJ2s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Samberg did what he does best by grafting his goofy guy persona onto his caricature of Emhoff, while Rudolph served as the glue that sticks everything together. That includes nods of Walz\u2019s cringey mishaps last week (including his \u201cI\u2019m friends with school shooters\u201d line), which cut back to Rudolph spitting out her red wine. \u201cI should have chosen Josh,\u201d she said, with Samberg\u2019s Emhoff assuming she was referring to possible vice-presidential pick Josh Shapiro. No, she was actually referring to the wine brand.</p> <p>Providing a link to the sketch show\u2019s stacked political history, Carvey then wanders into the room as President Biden, armed with the president\u2019s vocal tic and non-sequiturs (\u201cGuess what \u2026 and by the way!\u201d) and eventually, a vanilla ice cream cone. And yes, it eventually does indeed drip all over Rudolph\u2019s Harris. The final result was an opening slapstick, relevant, cartoonish and bitingly satirical.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exHYXolgb6w\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/exHYXolgb6w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Bargatze is one of stand-up comedy\u2019s modern powerhouses, last year he broke the attendance record at Bridgestone Arena in his hometown of Nashville, Tennessee. So if you\u2019re unsure who he is, perhaps that says more about the splintered culture of the craft than his personal impact on mainstream culture. Regardless, Bargatze delivered a monologue focused on the food delivery app DoorDash, which at times felt like hearing your friend\u2019s simple rehash of an otherwise normal DoorDash order. It was endearing and unspectacular, which was probably the whole point.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbo48BvE9x8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vbo48BvE9x8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The history of Saturday Night Live has featured plenty of goofs on mainstream sports like football and baseball, while golf has seemed to be underrepresented with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arnuebqlt2I&amp;ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive\">some exceptions</a>. The premise for this filmed short centers on a golfer who can\u2019t seem to stop killing animals while on the course; with each accidental kill, the consequences get higher (including veterans turning their backs on him and a Nike representative played by Michael Longfellow taping over their logo on his hat in an attempt for the brand to distance themselves).

He\u2019s back here in a sketch that follows the same beats and finds more to comment on, including how the meat from cows and pigs are called beef and pork, while chicken is just, well, chicken. Once again, it\u2019s the writing that shines here, as both the first and now this second Washington\u2019s Dream could have felt right at home as a witty Shouts and Murmurs piece in<em> </em>the New Yorker.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy5BhV0z8E0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Yy5BhV0z8E0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Before the season began, cast member Marcello Hern\u00e1ndez was being teed up as its breakout star (including covering Variety for their <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/entertainers/snl-marcello-hernandez-dave-chappelle-saturday-night-live-1236096469/\">Power of Young Hollywood</a> issue). Here, Hern\u00e1ndez plays host during a parody of Univision\u2019s long-running S\u00e1bado Gigante, where an American (Bargatze, naturally) appears as a confused guest. It all harkened back to one of the most memorable game show sketches in the history of the show when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLVmybhXqtU&amp;ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive\">Chris Farley played a hapless contestant</a> on a Japanese game show in 1994. The 90s truly are making a comeback.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6o9zVNr6IE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s6o9zVNr6IE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The game, or premise, of this unique sketch is based around whether to carry down a dead body from the top of a waterslide or just push him down, which was inspired by a longtime stand-up routine from cast member Longfellow. Going back and forth with Bargatze playing another version of his laidback self, its inherent strangeness made you wonder why it didn\u2019t air later in the show.

      "bodyText": "The second episode of the landmark comedy show\u2019s 50th season felt like a comeback of sorts on multiple levels. The popular stand-up Nate Bargatze has been handed over hosting duties once again after his well-received hosting debut almost exactly a year ago. Meanwhile, musical guest Coldplay returned for their eighth appearance. On the sketch front, there were multiple retreads of past bits; one from just last week. And by the last quarter of the show, the surprise return of an SNL favorite. Following up on last week\u2019s grand debuts of Dana Carvey as Joe Biden, Jim Gaffigan as Tim Walz, Andy Samberg as Doug Emhoff, that star-studded cameo crew anchored by Maya Rudolph\u2019s pitch-perfect spin on Kamala Harris reunited to spoof the most recent vice-presidential debate. Finding a slick way to include this election season\u2019s eclectic cast of characters, the sketch volleyed between Rudolph\u2019s Harris and Samberg\u2019s Emhoff watching Walz take on JD Vance (keenly played by Bowen Yang) on TV, with the cordialness between Walz and Vance played to romantic effect here. Samberg did what he does best by grafting his goofy guy persona onto his caricature of Emhoff, while Rudolph served as the glue that sticks everything together. That includes nods of Walz\u2019s cringey mishaps last week (including his \u201cI\u2019m friends with school shooters\u201d line), which cut back to Rudolph spitting out her red wine. \u201cI should have chosen Josh,\u201d she said, with Samberg\u2019s Emhoff assuming she was referring to possible vice-presidential pick Josh Shapiro. No, she was actually referring to the wine brand. Providing a link to the sketch show\u2019s stacked political history, Carvey then wanders into the room as President Biden, armed with the president\u2019s vocal tic and non-sequiturs (\u201cGuess what \u2026 and by the way!\u201d) and eventually, a vanilla ice cream cone. And yes, it eventually does indeed drip all over Rudolph\u2019s Harris. The final result was an opening slapstick, relevant, cartoonish and bitingly satirical. Bargatze is one of stand-up comedy\u2019s modern powerhouses, last year he broke the attendance record at Bridgestone Arena in his hometown of Nashville, Tennessee. So if you\u2019re unsure who he is, perhaps that says more about the splintered culture of the craft than his personal impact on mainstream culture. Regardless, Bargatze delivered a monologue focused on the food delivery app DoorDash, which at times felt like hearing your friend\u2019s simple rehash of an otherwise normal DoorDash order. It was endearing and unspectacular, which was probably the whole point. The history of Saturday Night Live has featured plenty of goofs on mainstream sports like football and baseball, while golf has seemed to be underrepresented with some exceptions. The premise for this filmed short centers on a golfer who can\u2019t seem to stop killing animals while on the course; with each accidental kill, the consequences get higher (including veterans turning their backs on him and a Nike representative played by Michael Longfellow taping over their logo on his hat in an attempt for the brand to distance themselves). It\u2019s another sophomoric jaunt that wouldn\u2019t have felt out of place as a Looney Tunes cartoon \u2013 not that that\u2019s a bad thing. One of the most acclaimed sketches in recent memory occurred the last time Bargatze hosted in the form of Washington\u2019s Dream, in which the titular father of America muses about his inane goals for the new country, with the sketch essentially doubling as a commentary on the nonsensical cultural phrasing we take for granted. He\u2019s back here in a sketch that follows the same beats and finds more to comment on, including how the meat from cows and pigs are called beef and pork, while chicken is just, well, chicken. Once again, it\u2019s the writing that shines here, as both the first and now this second Washington\u2019s Dream could have felt right at home as a witty Shouts and Murmurs piece in the New Yorker. Before the season began, cast member Marcello Hern\u00e1ndez was being teed up as its breakout star (including covering Variety for their Power of Young Hollywood issue). Here, Hern\u00e1ndez plays host during a parody of Univision\u2019s long-running S\u00e1bado Gigante, where an American (Bargatze, naturally) appears as a confused guest. It all harkened back to one of the most memorable game show sketches in the history of the show when Chris Farley played a hapless contestant on a Japanese game show in 1994. The 90s truly are making a comeback. The game, or premise, of this unique sketch is based around whether to carry down a dead body from the top of a waterslide or just push him down, which was inspired by a longtime stand-up routine from cast member Longfellow. Going back and forth with Bargatze playing another version of his laidback self, its inherent strangeness made you wonder why it didn\u2019t air later in the show. It\u2019s nothing a little Coldplay can\u2019t fix, with the band performing their schmaltzy All My Love. Coming down off their offshoot Peacock project New York After Dark, Colin Jost and Michael Che are back in their comfort zone behind the Update desk by skewering the aforementioned vice-presidential debate as well as the latest in Trump world, including the former president\u2019s appearance with Elon Musk at his Pennsylvania rally. Notably the jokes turned inward, with Jost zinging the next time we\u2019ll see Trump and Musk together is when they both host SNL in December, a nod to the show\u2019s penchant for occasionally courting controversy when it comes to their hosting choices, with both the tech billionaire and former president hosting in recent memory. Meanwhile, it was Jane Wickline\u2019s time to shine in her second episode as cast member after she was recruited after her turn on the under-the-radar TikTok sketch comedy series dubbed Stapleview after gaining a following on the platform. Tonight she made her Update debut representing gen Z with a charming song about partying with lines like: \u201cI am the plus one of someone who has left.\u201d It was somewhat stressful to see her walk out on a tightrope with her keyboard, but in the end she seemed to have pulled it together. Here, a family has a serious conversation about the patriarch\u2019s dementia while Heidi Gardner tries to chow down on a massive burger to win a trip to Hawaii.

      "bodyText": "As a rule, retailers tend to trumpet price cuts and keep quiet about increases but wine sellers are breaking ranks to warn customers of looming rises due to a shake-up of the way wine is taxed. The big names behind the campaign include Majestic Wine, Laithwaites, Cambridge Wine Merchants and the Wine Society, who are trying to head off a new alcohol duty system \u201cbefore it\u2019s too late\u201d. The industry has previously said the price of 75% of red wines would increase on the back of the new rules. The new regime, which comes into effect on 1 February, increases the number of tax bands for wine from one to 30. The campaign\u2019s posters say it will increase costs and complexity for wine retailers and \u201ccould result in your favourite wine having to rise in price or potentially being removed from our ranges entirely\u201d. Majestic and Cambridge Wine Merchants have also emailed their customers to ask for help to overturn the policy, urging them to raise the issue with their MP. \u201cMost concerningly for you, as discerning wine drinkers, the quality and choice of wine available for you to purchase is likely to be negatively impacted,\u201d the email said. \u201cThere is a genuine risk that the producers of your favourite wine will stop shipping it to the UK entirely, due to the additional administrative burden that will be involved.\u201d Under the plan, drinks will be taxed on alcohol by volume (ABV) rather than the type. The amount of duty paid rises by 2p for every 0.1% increase in strength. It took effect officially last summer after being put forward by the Treasury when Rishi Sunak was chancellor. Nevertheless, the government acknowledged the new administrative burden and put an 18-month \u201ceasement\u201d period in place. During this period all wines between 11.5% and 14.5% ABV pay \u00a32.67 in tax, which is the 12.5% ABV duty rate. Analysis by the Wine and Spirits Trade Association (WSTA) found that when this finishes at the end January the prices on about 43% of wines will increase. The tax on a bottle of wine with an ABV of 14.5%, the highest percentage to come under the rules, will increase by the maximum 42p to \u00a33.09. Red wines will be most affected given their higher alcohol content, with prices on 75% expected to go up. Wine sellers, along with the WSTA, are campaigning for the easement to be made permanent in the budget on 30 October, arguing it would \u201chelp businesses grow, keep prices down for consumers and stabilise Treasury income\u201d. \u201cThis is not just about Majestic,\u201d said John Colley, its chief executive. \u201cRemoving the wine easement will disproportionately hit small businesses \u2013 including the 900 independent wine merchants operating across the UK and the many importers.

      "bodyText": "Florida is expected to get walloped by another hurricane next week, just 10 days after it was hit by Hurricane Helene, which caused widespread storm surge and wind damage before it moved inland to cause devastating flooding. The latest system, Tropical Storm Milton, formed in the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday. Forecasters expect the storm to quickly strengthen into a hurricane and rush toward Florida in the next few days. Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, declared a state of emergency in 35 counties ahead of the storm\u2019s potential landfall. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Florida said Milton, which could become a hurricane on Monday, is expected to bring surge and high winds to the recovering west coast and serious flood risks to south and central Florida. Jamie Rhome, the deputy director of the NHC in Miami, said Milton could develop into a \u201cpotentially very impactful hurricane\u201d and hit Florida\u2019s Gulf coast on Tuesday or Wednesday. Milton is expected to pack maximum sustained winds of 110mph when it makes landfall near St Petersburg and Tampa as a category 2 to category 3 hurricane, Rhome said. Category 3 and above are considered \u201cmajor\u201d hurricanes. Tropical Storm Milton\u2019s center was about 860 miles (1,385km) west-south-west of Tampa, Florida, early Sunday, heading east at 5mph with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. \u201cMilton is moving slowly but is expected to strengthen rapidly,\u201d the center said. \u201cThere is increasing confidence that a powerful hurricane with life-threatening hazards will be affecting portions of the Florida west coast around the middle of this week.\u201d \u201cRegardless of where the storm tracks, it\u2019s going to produce a large area of heavy rain and potential flooding,\u201d Rhome said on Saturday. \u201cEven if this doesn\u2019t realize a high-end wind core, it will have the potential for significant surge inundation,\u201d Andrew Moore, a meteorologist for Arch Reinsurance, wrote on X. A major factor in predicting Milton\u2019s increasing strength is that surface sea temperatures, or SSTs, did not cool off after Helene passed over and remain significantly above normal. \u201cMost of the Gulf is above-average SST still, and the loop current is prominent. Shelf south of Tampa is extremely warm as well. Lots of potential fuel,\u201d wrote Andy Hazelton, an associate scientist at the hurricane research department at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In Florida, since many of the 35 counties now in a state of emergency for Milton are still recovering from Hurricane Helene, DeSantis asked the Florida division of emergency management and the Florida department of transportation to coordinate all available resources and personnel to supplement local communities as they expedite debris removal. Separately, the NHC said on Sunday another storm, Hurricane Kirk, diminished to a category 2 hurricane in the open Atlantic early, with top winds of 105mph (165kph), sending large swells and \u201clife-threatening surf and rip current conditions\u201d to Bermuda and northward along the US and Canadian coasts. Hurricane Leslie also was moving north-west over the open Atlantic, with top winds of 85mph (140kph) but posing no threats to land.",

As Australian politicians prepare to mark the anniversary of Hamas\u2019s assault on southern Israel, the prime minister released a video message declaring that \u201csorrow knows no boundaries and recognises no differences\u201d. In Monday\u2019s video, Albanese recognised \u201cthe distress the conflict has caused here in Australia\u201d and took the opportunity again to condemn \u201call prejudice and hatred\u201d \u2013 something he has done repeatedly over the past year. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cSince the atrocities of October 7, Jewish Australians have felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day \u2013 and as a nation we say never again,\u201d Albanese said. The prime minister \u2013 who will join the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, at a commemoration in Melbourne on Monday \u2013 said it was a moment to \u201cpause to reflect on the horrific terrorist atrocity that reverberated around the globe\u201d. \u201cOctober 7 is a day that carries terrible pain,\u201d he said. \u201cOver 1,200 Jews died \u2013 more than on any single day since the Holocaust.\u201d Albanese said he unequivocally condemned Hamas for killing women, men and children in their homes and at a music festival, characterising this as \u201cbrutality that was inflicted with cold calculation\u201d. \u201cToday, we also think of the hostages whose lives remain suspended in the fear and isolation of captivity,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cFor their loved ones, this past year must have felt like an eternity \u2013 the agony of waiting and not knowing, or of having the terrible truth confirmed.\u201d Community organisations in Australia have documented sharp increases in antisemitism and anti-Palestinian racism, Islamophobia and anti-Arab hostility over the past 12 months. Albanese said in his video message that there was \u201cno place in Australia for discrimination against people of any faith\u201d. He also reaffirmed \u201ca fundamental principle of our shared humanity: every innocent life matters\u201d. \u201cThe number of civilians who have lost their lives is a devastating tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cToday we reflect on the truth of our shared humanity, of the hope that peace is possible, and the belief that it belongs to all people.\u201d At least 41,825 Palestinians have been killed and 96,910 wounded in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza begun in response to the 7 October attack, the territory\u2019s health authorities said on Saturday. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, told the UN last month the death toll in Gaza included more than 11,000 children. Pro-Palestine protesters who gathered in Sydney\u2019s Hyde Park on Sunday chanted \u201cceasefire now\u201d, while those who gathered in Melbourne\u2019s city centre cried \u201cthere\u2019s no shopping while bombs are dropping\u201d. The Albanese government has repeatedly called for a ceasefire and the release of hostages but has been facing political pressure from the Coalition and the Greens about its stance. The government is increasingly concerned about the prospect of a regional war as Israel intensifies its military operations in Lebanon and considers a response to Iran. Two charter flights from Lebanon\u2019s capital, Beirut, to Cyprus on Saturday carried a total of 407 Australians. A further two such flights were scheduled to leave Beirut on Sunday. Wong told the UN security council in New York late last month that Lebanon \u201ccannot become the next Gaza\u201d and Lebanese civilians \u201cshould not pay the price\u201d of attacking Hezbollah. In a pointed message to Israel, Wong said at the time: \u201cWar has rules \u2013 even when confronting terrorists; even when defending borders.\u201d The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, declined to say on Sunday whether he believed Israel had complied with the laws of war, insisting that \u201call of that will ultimately be judged when the facts come out\u201d. \u201cWe are deeply anxious and concerned about the activities that have ensued in the course of the last 12 months which have seen such an extraordinary loss of innocent life in Gaza and we are now seeing that loss of life in Lebanon,\u201d Marles told the ABC\u2019s Insiders program. The Coalition\u2019s home affairs spokesperson, James Paterson, told Sky News the Labor government had \u201cabandoned Israel at the UN\u201d because it was worried about \u201cthe domestic political implications of standing with our friend and ally\u201d. Marles, Wong and the trade minister, Don Farrell, are to attend a 7 October commemoration ceremony at the Israeli embassy in Canberra on Monday. With Albanese attending a commemoration in Melbourne, he will be represented by the health minister, Mark Butler, at an event in Sydney.",

      "body": "<p>Ten days after the Hamas attacks that triggered the start of the Israel-Gaza war, Ayelet Nussbaum\u2019s niece and nephew fled from Haifa in northern Israel.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re very relieved \u2013 we were very nervous,\u201d the Australian-Israeli florist from Glebe in New South Wales told Guardian Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/17/first-israel-repatriation-flight-touches-down-in-sydney\">when she met her relatives at Sydney airport</a>. Within about a month of that first repatriation flight, Haifa was deemed safe enough for them to return home. To the south, the bombardment of Gaza picked up pace.</p> <p>Ten grim months on, those children are again facing upheaval as Nussbaum\u2019s brother and sister-in-law weigh up whether to flee the city, 30km from Lebanon\u2019s border, amid escalating hostilities. In Lebanon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/29/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-bombardment-lebanon-hezbollah-hassan-nasrallah-latest\">more than 1,000 people were killed</a> in the fortnight after September\u2019s pager attacks on Hezbollah, and authorities say more than a million people have been displaced.</p>    <p>In Haifa, schools have closed, the family of five is taking shelter in a bunker and Nussbaum\u2019s elder nephew is days away from being called up to military service, she says.</p> <p>As she mourns the lack of humanity in Israel\u2019s actions, she also longs for security for the country.</p> <p>\u201cThere should always be empathy,\u201d she says of Israel\u2019s right to protect itself, \u201cbut \u2026 everything feels like it\u2019s heading towards complete destruction.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/17/first-israel-repatriation-flight-touches-down-in-sydney\">First Israel repatriation flight touches down in Sydney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Much changed on 7 October \u2013 and its reverberations continue to rock Australia\u2019s Jewish community. That diaspora is variously, and often in combination, supportive of Israel, empathetic towards Palestinians, targeted by hate and exhausted by conflict.</p> <p>For a brief moment after the \u201cdeep and personal horrors\u201d of 7 October \u2013 more Jews were killed that day than on any single day since the end of the Holocaust \u2013 Israel\u2019s security was paramount, bringing Australia\u2019s Jewish community together, Nussbaum observed. As the war ground on, some of that unity dissolved, she believes.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s deeper and deeper separation between nationalism and [the left],\u201d she says, describing a cementing of extreme views and conversations that have become less open-minded.</p> <p>\u201cThe complexity of it really leads to that split in ideology,\u201d she says. \u201cEven within our little family it\u2019s split. It\u2019s very controversial.\u201d</p> <p>That splintering goes well beyond the kitchen table.</p>    <p>The initial pain and sorrow fomented determination within the Jewish community, according to Alex Ryvchin, the co-chief of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, which channelled \u201crage and sorrow into communal unity. We are now more determined than we have ever been to fight for our place in this society.\u201d</p> <p>And, while the ECAJ deplores conflict and mourns its loss of life, he says, \u201cIsrael\u2019s war is just and necessary.\u201d</p> <p>A year in, Sarah Schwartz, the executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, says the conflict has made it clear that the Jewish community does not speak with a single voice. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/01/progressive-australian-jews-opposing-antisemitism-israel-gaza-war\">The JCA was formed in February</a> to give voice to progressive Jews, providing an alternative to the mainstream.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a real break in the Jewish consensus around Israel,\u201d she says. Whether publicly or privately, \u201cmany Jewish people are growing more and more uncomfortable and asking more and more questions about Israel\u2019s conduct, particularly given the absolute devastation that Israel has caused in Gaza.\u201d</p> <p>There the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/17/gaza-publishes-identities-of-34344-palestinians-killed-in-war-with-israel\">death toll stands at more than 41,000</a>, many of whom are women and children. Israel has lost nearly 350 young men and women fighting Hamas in Gaza, the ECAJ says. </p> <p>About 200 of the 820 signatories to the JCA\u2019s core principles are anonymous because of the subsequent doxing and shaming that Schwartz says comes, in part, from within the Jewish community.</p> <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t say that Israel\u2019s acting on behalf of all Jewish people,\u201d she says of groups that have reacted negatively to the formation of the council. \u201cI don\u2019t think that they can really just try to silence us out of existence any more.\u201d</p>    <p>***</p> <p>Amid the turmoil, rates of antisemitism targeting Australia\u2019s 100,000 Jews have leapt since the attacks of 7 October. In the six months from 1 October 2023 to 31 March 2024, there was a 427% increase in the number of anti-Jewish incidents from the same period the year before, ECAJ figures show. In the immediate aftermath of 7 October, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/10/islamophobic-and-antisemitic-incidents-rise-in-australia-advocates-say\">incidents shot up by 738%</a>.</p> <p>The ECAJ believes the figures \u2013 described as \u201cshocking and confronting\u201d by Jillian Segal in her inaugural speech as Australia\u2019s first special envoy to combat antisemitism \u2013 represent a fraction of the real number because of underreporting. A lack of data makes the problem hard to tackle, Schwartz says.</p> <p>The problem is worsened by accusations of lying and deceit on the part of Jews, driven by ancient perceptions and prejudice, Ryvchin says.</p> <p>\u201cThe denial of antisemitism and the gaslighting of our community has to end,\u201d he says. \u201cThe experiences of ordinary Australian Jews have been harrowing this past year.\u201d</p>    <p>***</p> <p>In December Guardian Australia spoke with Elena, a grandmother and retired teacher who lived in Israel during the Yom Kippur war and now calls Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs home. At the time, she said her \u201ctrust in the world had been shattered\u201d by the 7 October attacks.</p> <p>Today she is exhausted by all she has witnessed from afar. \u201cThere\u2019s an overwhelming sadness, bordering on depression,\u201d she says. \u201cI just can\u2019t bounce back.\u201d</p> <p>In the intervening months, she has seen a tightening of extreme and divisive views among some within her circles.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody\u2019s just digging in. It\u2019s sad to see people suddenly making observations about all Arabs or all Jews, as if there\u2019s no diversity or different points of view. That\u2019s shocking \u2013 and it\u2019s getting more entrenched because people feel threatened.\u201d</p>    <p>In solidarity with Israel, she has attended small vigils and peaceful gatherings, but her hope, once unshakeable, is diminishing. In its place is a new and alien sense of being under siege, she says.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that it will be possible to negotiate [with Hamas and Hezbollah], and I have never, ever felt that before. If we can\u2019t move forward, then what can we do?\u201d</p> <p>Her answer, for the time being, is to protect the innocence of her grandchildren \u2013 and go back to the gentle tenets of her religion.</p> <p>\u201cAt night, I actually say prayers for the hostages,\u201d she says. \u201cJewish holidays are coming up and I\u2019m composing in my mind how to get to God: please, help these hostages.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ten days after the Hamas attacks that triggered the start of the Israel-Gaza war, Ayelet Nussbaum\u2019s niece and nephew fled from Haifa in northern Israel. \u201cWe\u2019re very relieved \u2013 we were very nervous,\u201d the Australian-Israeli florist from Glebe in New South Wales told Guardian Australia when she met her relatives at Sydney airport. Within about a month of that first repatriation flight, Haifa was deemed safe enough for them to return home. To the south, the bombardment of Gaza picked up pace. Ten grim months on, those children are again facing upheaval as Nussbaum\u2019s brother and sister-in-law weigh up whether to flee the city, 30km from Lebanon\u2019s border, amid escalating hostilities. In Lebanon more than 1,000 people were killed in the fortnight after September\u2019s pager attacks on Hezbollah, and authorities say more than a million people have been displaced. In Haifa, schools have closed, the family of five is taking shelter in a bunker and Nussbaum\u2019s elder nephew is days away from being called up to military service, she says. As she mourns the lack of humanity in Israel\u2019s actions, she also longs for security for the country. \u201cThere should always be empathy,\u201d she says of Israel\u2019s right to protect itself, \u201cbut \u2026 everything feels like it\u2019s heading towards complete destruction.\u201d Much changed on 7 October \u2013 and its reverberations continue to rock Australia\u2019s Jewish community. That diaspora is variously, and often in combination, supportive of Israel, empathetic towards Palestinians, targeted by hate and exhausted by conflict. For a brief moment after the \u201cdeep and personal horrors\u201d of 7 October \u2013 more Jews were killed that day than on any single day since the end of the Holocaust \u2013 Israel\u2019s security was paramount, bringing Australia\u2019s Jewish community together, Nussbaum observed. As the war ground on, some of that unity dissolved, she believes. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cThere\u2019s deeper and deeper separation between nationalism and [the left],\u201d she says, describing a cementing of extreme views and conversations that have become less open-minded. \u201cThe complexity of it really leads to that split in ideology,\u201d she says. \u201cEven within our little family it\u2019s split. It\u2019s very controversial.\u201d That splintering goes well beyond the kitchen table. The initial pain and sorrow fomented determination within the Jewish community, according to Alex Ryvchin, the co-chief of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, which channelled \u201crage and sorrow into communal unity. We are now more determined than we have ever been to fight for our place in this society.\u201d And, while the ECAJ deplores conflict and mourns its loss of life, he says, \u201cIsrael\u2019s war is just and necessary.\u201d A year in, Sarah Schwartz, the executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, says the conflict has made it clear that the Jewish community does not speak with a single voice. The JCA was formed in February to give voice to progressive Jews, providing an alternative to the mainstream. \u201cThere\u2019s been a real break in the Jewish consensus around Israel,\u201d she says. Whether publicly or privately, \u201cmany Jewish people are growing more and more uncomfortable and asking more and more questions about Israel\u2019s conduct, particularly given the absolute devastation that Israel has caused in Gaza.\u201d There the death toll stands at more than 41,000, many of whom are women and children. Israel has lost nearly 350 young men and women fighting Hamas in Gaza, the ECAJ says. About 200 of the 820 signatories to the JCA\u2019s core principles are anonymous because of the subsequent doxing and shaming that Schwartz says comes, in part, from within the Jewish community. \u201cThey can\u2019t say that Israel\u2019s acting on behalf of all Jewish people,\u201d she says of groups that have reacted negatively to the formation of the council. \u201cI don\u2019t think that they can really just try to silence us out of existence any more.\u201d *** Amid the turmoil, rates of antisemitism targeting Australia\u2019s 100,000 Jews have leapt since the attacks of 7 October. In the six months from 1 October 2023 to 31 March 2024, there was a 427% increase in the number of anti-Jewish incidents from the same period the year before, ECAJ figures show. In the immediate aftermath of 7 October, incidents shot up by 738%. The ECAJ believes the figures \u2013 described as \u201cshocking and confronting\u201d by Jillian Segal in her inaugural speech as Australia\u2019s first special envoy to combat antisemitism \u2013 represent a fraction of the real number because of underreporting. A lack of data makes the problem hard to tackle, Schwartz says. The problem is worsened by accusations of lying and deceit on the part of Jews, driven by ancient perceptions and prejudice, Ryvchin says. \u201cThe denial of antisemitism and the gaslighting of our community has to end,\u201d he says. \u201cThe experiences of ordinary Australian Jews have been harrowing this past year.\u201d *** In December Guardian Australia spoke with Elena, a grandmother and retired teacher who lived in Israel during the Yom Kippur war and now calls Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs home. At the time, she said her \u201ctrust in the world had been shattered\u201d by the 7 October attacks. Today she is exhausted by all she has witnessed from afar. \u201cThere\u2019s an overwhelming sadness, bordering on depression,\u201d she says. \u201cI just can\u2019t bounce back.\u201d In the intervening months, she has seen a tightening of extreme and divisive views among some within her circles. \u201cEverybody\u2019s just digging in. It\u2019s sad to see people suddenly making observations about all Arabs or all Jews, as if there\u2019s no diversity or different points of view. That\u2019s shocking \u2013 and it\u2019s getting more entrenched because people feel threatened.\u201d In solidarity with Israel, she has attended small vigils and peaceful gatherings, but her hope, once unshakeable, is diminishing. In its place is a new and alien sense of being under siege, she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that it will be possible to negotiate [with Hamas and Hezbollah], and I have never, ever felt that before. If we can\u2019t move forward, then what can we do?\u201d Her answer, for the time being, is to protect the innocence of her grandchildren \u2013 and go back to the gentle tenets of her religion. \u201cAt night, I actually say prayers for the hostages,\u201d she says. \u201cJewish holidays are coming up and I\u2019m composing in my mind how to get to God: please, help these hostages.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Help to Buy, the government\u2019s shared equity housing affordability scheme, will come back to parliament this week. Is it the definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results? In September, the Greens and the Coalition teamed up to delay the bill in the Senate until November, leading to a flurry of speculation \u2013 egged on by Anthony Albanese \u2013 that the bill could function as a double dissolution trigger. This week, the housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, will reintroduce the bill to the House of Representatives as Labor continues to urge for it to be considered on its own merits, not as a means to advance other housing affordability demands. The scheme makes it cheaper for first-timers to buy a home because the government takes a 40% stake in a new-build or 30% of an existing property. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email But there is a catch: a single person can only get into the scheme if they earn less than $90,000; for a couple, they must earn less than $120,000. The Greens will on Monday release new Parliamentary Library advice that examines the scheme\u2019s merits, taking aim at O\u2019Neil\u2019s claim that it will help ensure that \u201chome ownership, that great Australian dream \u2026 is still accessible to childcare workers, to nurses, [and] paramedics\u201d. Based on median full-time earnings, the library found that a paramedic (who earns $127,600), registered nurse ($112,900), or a primary school teacher ($105,000) \u201cwould not qualify under the Help to Buy singles threshold\u201d. For these professions, workers would have to be early in their career or working part-time to qualify, meaning they could have to buy back the government\u2019s share as their earnings and hours increase. An aged or disability care worker (earning, on average, $79,000) or childcare worker ($67,430) would qualify. But if they were paying off a mortgage on a dwelling in a major capital city, for which the Help to Buy price cap can be below even the median price, the aged or disability care worker would be paying at least 48% of their income for a dwelling in Brisbane, 52% in Melbourne and a whopping 65% in Sydney. The mortgage stress for a childcare worker would be even greater, with at least 56% of their income going to a dwelling in Brisbane, 61% in Melbourne and 76% in Sydney. It\u2019s fair to say these key workers would need to look for apartments, not houses, in the city, or dwellings in cheaper suburbs or the regions. Arguably, these are exactly the sorts of people the scheme should be helping (low-paid, early career or part-time workers) with all the usual compromises that first home buyers have to make in Australia\u2019s difficult housing market, only the goal is a little bit more achievable with government help. But for the Greens, the advice underscores the pointlessness of the scheme. \u201cIt is cruel and deeply dishonest for Labor to suggest their dodgy scheme will help teachers, childcare workers or nurses when the reality is they will either be completely ineligible or otherwise unable to afford the mortgage repayments under the scheme,\u201d the Greens\u2019 housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, said. With the government so far ignoring the Greens\u2019 demands about curbing negative gearing and the capital gains tax concession, the minor party has been sharpening its argument that it is not engaging in horse-trading but rather opposing a bad bill. In the Senate inquiry report, Greens senators said that \u201cin effect, all this scheme does is increase the purchasing power of a small fraction of renters, at the expense of the 99.8% of renters denied access to the scheme every year\u201d. At times, the Greens say Help to Buy is too weak to overcome the horrendous economics of what O\u2019Neil herself says is a housing crisis; at other times, they say it is just strong enough to disadvantage other aspiring first homeowners. There\u2019s a similar tension in the Coalition\u2019s dissenting inquiry report, which argues the scheme is \u201ctiny\u201d, that nobody will take it up because similar state schemes are undersubscribed but nevertheless \u201clike all demand-side measures, there will be some inflationary impact\u201d. It can be hard to imagine the Goldilocks participant in the scheme: with income just low-enough to need and qualify for government help, but just high enough to service the rest of the mortgage. But for those who get access, paying off a mortgage of about two-thirds the size, despite having the benefit of living in the whole house, seems a boon. The Coalition and the Greens have decided to throw the kitchen sink at Help to Buy, with objections that capitalise on frustration about lack of affordability.

Its inspection teams may not visit each year and traditional owners had only limited visiting rights.</p> <p>One site might have hundreds of individual artworks or another a few stone tools, making the 10% level \u201crandom\u201d and meaningless, Knight said.</p> <p>A 2023 report by Niche, an environment consultancy, said the area of Longwall 19, now being extracted, contained Aboriginal sites \u201cof high cultural significance\u201d.

Knight was not a member of the July visit to the site.</p> <p>Sydney is among the few cities anywhere in the world to allow mining within its water catchment areas. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969720383054?dgcid=author\">Scientists have argued for years</a> that the longwalls were causing cracks to reach the surface, diverting water away from some of the 1,000 upland swamps in the Woronora plateau and reducing inflows into nearby dams.</p> <h2>\u2018Very concerning\u2019</h2> <p>The catchment\u2019s 364,000 hectares are also designated as \u201cspecial areas\u201d with restricted public access. Those curbs have served to preserve Indigenous cultural sites dating back thousands of years \u2013 unless they are damaged by mining.</p> <p>Damage to Indigenous sites \u2013 or the potential for it \u2013 was deemed sufficient cause for the federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/31/mcphillamys-goldmine-tanya-plibersek-fight-explainer-belublua-river\">to reject approval for a tailings dam</a> in August for the McPhillamys open-cut goldmine proposed for Blayney in NSW\u2019s central-west.</p> <p>The coalmines, though, are designated as state-significant developments with fewer environmental or heritage hurdles to clear to secure approval.</p> <p>A spokesperson for WaterNSW said the agency had written to [the mine owners], registered Aboriginal parties and other government bodies \u201cexpressing concerns about the extent of the damage caused and the potential for irreparable loss of this and other significant environmental (such as upland swamps and watercourses) and cultural values and landscapes\u201d.</p> <p>It also \u201crequested that all reasonable steps are taken to protect them\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesperson for NSW\u2019s Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water said the report of damage to Aboriginal cultural sites \u201cwas very concerning and is being investigated\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe investigation will determine the extent of any harm to the various sites known to occur in the area,\u201d she said. The department would inspect the site next week.</p> <p>A spokesperson for South 32, the mine owner at the time of site 21\u2019s damage was detected, said the company aimed \u201cto develop natural resources responsibly and minimise our adverse impacts\u201d.</p> <p>The mine plan for longwall 19A beneath the site had been approved by the NSW Department of Planning and Environment. It was \u201cdeveloped carefully and incorporated setbacks to avoid or minimise impacts to the environment and surface features\u201d, he said.</p> <p>In late August, South 32 sold Illawarra Metallurgical Coal to GM3, an entity owned by the Singapore-based Golden Energy and Resources and M Resources.</p> <h2>\u2018They are trying to cover it up\u2019</h2> <p>A GM3 spokesperson said the company was \u201cstrongly committed to long-term sustainability, including environmental management, social performance, operational excellence, and economic contribution\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are currently co-developing a specific site management plan in collaboration with the registered Aboriginal parties and the landowner, WaterNSW,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Illawarra Local Aboriginal Land Council declined to comment until its board meets this month.</p> <p>Sue Higginson, a Greens MP and former chief executive of the Environmental Defenders Office, said in situ protection of cultural heritage was vital to ensure their integrity.</p> <p>Every registered Aboriginal party she had worked with understood that taking part in the mining process meant they would not be able to \u201cgenuinely protect\u201d their culture. That inevitably meant they were \u201cliving the harm and the trauma of the destruction of their cultural heritage\u201d, Higginson said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to explain a process so perverse,\u201d she said. In NSW, \u201ca decision has been made that mining will be prioritised over the protection of cultural heritage every time\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was at the EDO \u2026 over a 10-year period, the [planning] department had never once refused the granting of a licence to destroy cultural heritage,\u201d Higginson said.</p> <p>The Minns Labor government promised to reform the state\u2019s heritage laws before coming to office. \u201cIt\u2019s had 18 months and still not changed the laws that have been in place for decades and decades that allow mining companies to go and smash the crap out of \u2026 significant Aboriginal cultural heritage that should be protected,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The reforms may involve standalone legislation to ensure traditional owners have more say over what happens to their heritage, as is the case elsewhere in Australia, Higginson said.</p> <p>Kazan Brown, a NSW Indigenous leader, likened the damage to heritage sites by the mines under Woronora to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/rio-tinto-blasts-46000-year-old-aboriginal-site-to-expand-iron-ore-mine\">Rio Tinto\u2019s notorious blasting of a cave</a> in the Pilbara in May 2020 to expand an iron ore mine.

      "bodyText": "A mine excavating coal beneath greater Sydney\u2019s water catchment has damaged a site of \u201csignificant\u201d cultural heritage, prompting an investigation by the New South Wales government and warnings from Indigenous elders about \u201ca second Juukan Gorge\u201d. A routine inspection at the Dendrobium coalmine near Cordeaux dam in March found fracturing and associated rock falls beneath an overhang that features culturally significant artwork, authorities say. Subsidence, as soil and rocks sank into the void left by the mining, is blamed for the cracking. Four months later, on 25 July, the then mine owner South 32 invited WaterNSW and the registered Aboriginal parties to inspect the damage to the site. The First Nations\u2019 stakeholders were distressed by what they saw, authorities said. An environment planning department compliance unit will visit the site, near Sandy Creek Road, as soon as next week. Paul Knight, a former head of the Illawarra Local Aboriginal Land Council, one of the mine\u2019s registered Aboriginal parties, said the damage from coalmining was just the latest involving cultural and environmental sites on the Woronora plateau region north-west of Wollongong. Knight, who is a traditional custodian of the area, noted that Dendrobium and other mines within the Illawarra Metallurgical Coal group were approved with a \u201cperformance measure\u201d based on modelling that less than 10% of such sites would be affected by subsidence. \u201cThe whole system is flawed in terms of accountability,\u201d he said, adding it was up to the mine owner to report damage. Its inspection teams may not visit each year and traditional owners had only limited visiting rights. One site might have hundreds of individual artworks or another a few stone tools, making the 10% level \u201crandom\u201d and meaningless, Knight said. A 2023 report by Niche, an environment consultancy, said the area of Longwall 19, now being extracted, contained Aboriginal sites \u201cof high cultural significance\u201d. These included site 21, the one being assessed for damage. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Knight said destruction or damage to one site potentially disturbed links to the landscape as a whole. \u201cSonglines are basically a journey, a path of a story,\u201d he said. \u201cNow if you damage one in the middle, that\u2019s like removing a whole section of pathway [and] you can never journey take that journey again because you\u2019ve disconnected.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019d be like me taking the Mona Lisa and cutting it in half, and saying, \u2018Sorry about that,\u2019\u201d he said. Knight was not a member of the July visit to the site. Sydney is among the few cities anywhere in the world to allow mining within its water catchment areas. Scientists have argued for years that the longwalls were causing cracks to reach the surface, diverting water away from some of the 1,000 upland swamps in the Woronora plateau and reducing inflows into nearby dams. \u2018Very concerning\u2019 The catchment\u2019s 364,000 hectares are also designated as \u201cspecial areas\u201d with restricted public access. Those curbs have served to preserve Indigenous cultural sites dating back thousands of years \u2013 unless they are damaged by mining. Damage to Indigenous sites \u2013 or the potential for it \u2013 was deemed sufficient cause for the federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, to reject approval for a tailings dam in August for the McPhillamys open-cut goldmine proposed for Blayney in NSW\u2019s central-west. The coalmines, though, are designated as state-significant developments with fewer environmental or heritage hurdles to clear to secure approval. A spokesperson for WaterNSW said the agency had written to [the mine owners], registered Aboriginal parties and other government bodies \u201cexpressing concerns about the extent of the damage caused and the potential for irreparable loss of this and other significant environmental (such as upland swamps and watercourses) and cultural values and landscapes\u201d. It also \u201crequested that all reasonable steps are taken to protect them\u201d. A spokesperson for NSW\u2019s Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water said the report of damage to Aboriginal cultural sites \u201cwas very concerning and is being investigated\u201d. \u201cThe investigation will determine the extent of any harm to the various sites known to occur in the area,\u201d she said. The department would inspect the site next week. A spokesperson for South 32, the mine owner at the time of site 21\u2019s damage was detected, said the company aimed \u201cto develop natural resources responsibly and minimise our adverse impacts\u201d. The mine plan for longwall 19A beneath the site had been approved by the NSW Department of Planning and Environment. It was \u201cdeveloped carefully and incorporated setbacks to avoid or minimise impacts to the environment and surface features\u201d, he said. In late August, South 32 sold Illawarra Metallurgical Coal to GM3, an entity owned by the Singapore-based Golden Energy and Resources and M Resources. \u2018They are trying to cover it up\u2019 A GM3 spokesperson said the company was \u201cstrongly committed to long-term sustainability, including environmental management, social performance, operational excellence, and economic contribution\u201d. \u201cWe are currently co-developing a specific site management plan in collaboration with the registered Aboriginal parties and the landowner, WaterNSW,\u201d he said. The Illawarra Local Aboriginal Land Council declined to comment until its board meets this month. Sue Higginson, a Greens MP and former chief executive of the Environmental Defenders Office, said in situ protection of cultural heritage was vital to ensure their integrity. Every registered Aboriginal party she had worked with understood that taking part in the mining process meant they would not be able to \u201cgenuinely protect\u201d their culture. That inevitably meant they were \u201cliving the harm and the trauma of the destruction of their cultural heritage\u201d, Higginson said. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to explain a process so perverse,\u201d she said. In NSW, \u201ca decision has been made that mining will be prioritised over the protection of cultural heritage every time\u201d. \u201cWhen I was at the EDO \u2026 over a 10-year period, the [planning] department had never once refused the granting of a licence to destroy cultural heritage,\u201d Higginson said. The Minns Labor government promised to reform the state\u2019s heritage laws before coming to office. \u201cIt\u2019s had 18 months and still not changed the laws that have been in place for decades and decades that allow mining companies to go and smash the crap out of \u2026 significant Aboriginal cultural heritage that should be protected,\u201d she said. The reforms may involve standalone legislation to ensure traditional owners have more say over what happens to their heritage, as is the case elsewhere in Australia, Higginson said. Kazan Brown, a NSW Indigenous leader, likened the damage to heritage sites by the mines under Woronora to Rio Tinto\u2019s notorious blasting of a cave in the Pilbara in May 2020 to expand an iron ore mine. The cave had been occupied for 46,000 years. \u201cThis is like another Juukan Gorge, and they are trying to cover it up in the same way,\u201d Brown said. The miners \u201cshould be taking responsibility for the damage they do to cultural heritage\u201d, she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been able to get away with it for too long.\u201d",

Prieto had been on the way to Atlanta at the time, according to court documents, because he planned to kill as many Black people as he could at a Bad Bunny concert while planting Confederate flags and shouting white power slogans, to provoke a race war ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2024\">2024 election</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reason I say Atlanta,\u201d Prieto allegedly told an informant working with the FBI, \u201cWhy, why is Georgia such a fucked-up state now? When I was a kid that was one of the most conservative states in the country. Why is it not now? Because as the crime got worse in LA, St Louis and all these other cities, all the n****** moved out of those [places] and moved to Atlanta.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prieto is a product of decades of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republican</a> fearmongering, not just about Atlanta, but about big cities across the country. This is the message that Tucker Carlson and other conservative pundits have been pushing for years about San Francisco, New York and Detroit \u2013 it\u2019s exactly the same way conservatives amped up their rhetorical combat on Chicago in the wake of Barack Obama\u2019s ascension to the White House 16 years ago.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not because of crime. Cities in every country have <a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/5430.html\">long had more crime</a> than their suburban counterparts, simply because it\u2019s easier to commit a crime in a city, and it has largely trended downward. It\u2019s because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> \u2013 often Black Democrats \u2013 control most big city governments, and they help national politicians win. Joe Biden won 85% of San Francisco\u2019s votes in 2020. He also won 83% of Chicago, 77% of Los Angeles and 76% of New York City.</p> \n<p>As a result, conservative state governments are cauterizing upstart municipalities, burning any pretense of respect for small-D democracy at the local level in the process. They fear those blue dots will bleed enough Black political power into red states to turn them purple and cost them the White House, not just in 2024, but permanently.</p> \n<p>Race is at the center of the fear.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>\u201cAny mayor, county judge that was dumb-ass enough to come meet with me, I told them with great clarity, my goal is for this to be the worst session in the history of the legislature for cities and counties.\u201d</p> \n<p>That\u2019s former Texas House speaker Dennis Bonnen, in a conversation recorded with another legislator leaked to the <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2019/10/15/texas-house-speaker-dennis-bonnen-animus-toward-cities-laid-bare-tape/\">Texas Tribune</a> in 2019.</p> \n<p>In response to Austin legislation requiring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/30/texas-heatwave-worker-protections-illness-sun-exposure#:~:text=Despite%20the%20heatwave%2C%20Texas's%20Republican,really%20do%20need%20those%20breaks.\">water breaks</a> for construction workers in the punishing Texas heat, the Republican-controlled legislature in 2023 passed what progressives call the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/01/texas-new-laws-republican-legislature\">\u201cDeath Star\u201d bill</a>.

The law is in legal limbo today. But the damage is already being done to municipal leaders, who are frozen in place waiting for the case to be resolved.</p> \n<p>This story is playing out across the country, with red state governments seeing big blue cities as launching places for progressive ideas.</p> \n<p>In the wake of the deadly police beating of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/26/memphis-police-tyre-nichols-death-what-we-know\">Tyre Nichols</a> in Memphis, the city government created a police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/08/justice-department-review-memphis-police-tyre-nichols\">review board</a>.

The law, with some exceptions for budgeting, automatically enjoins Florida cities from enforcing a municipal ordinance if that ordinance is being challenged in court, and awards court costs to challengers if they win.</p> \n<p>In Jackson, Mississippi, lawmakers ostensibly concerned about crime <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/08/jackson-mississippi-republicans-unelected-court-system\">attempted to create</a> an entirely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2023/feb/15/mississippi-jackson-judicial-district-unelected-judges-prosecutors\">new court system</a>, supplanting elected judges in Hinds county with appointees of the Republican chief judge.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo one could tell us why do we need this bill?\u201d said Judge Winston Kidd. \u201cThe only thing I could go back to was the fact that all four circuit judges are African American, and in no other jurisdiction in this state had they tried something of that nature.\u201d</p> \n<p>And, of course, there\u2019s Atlanta.</p> \n<p>A few years ago, legislators began looking at ways to curb the power of locally elected district attorneys after the prosecutor in Athens-Clarke county decided to stop charging people for petty drug offenses. The failure of a different local prosecutor \u2013 Brunswick county\u2019s Jackie Johnson \u2013 to charge the men who murdered Ahmaud Arbery threw the question into sharp relief.</p> \n<p>But lawmakers are now pivoting this legislation toward the Fulton county district attorney, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/21/fani-willis-georgia-election-result\">Fani Willis</a>, who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donald-trump-trials\">prosecuting Trump</a> and 18 others for interfering with the 2020 election. </p> \n<p>\u201cIf the inmates are running the asylum here, then we maybe ought to be stepping in here, and that\u2019s the role of this committee, to recommend if we need uniform state laws and ethical boundaries,\u201d said Bill Cowsert, a Georgia state senator and chairman of the committee, at a meeting in August.</p> \n<p>\u201cMadam DA in Fulton county says she ain\u2019t got to do what Fulton county tells her to do, with whistleblowers, with treatment of employees or anything because she is a constitutional officer and she can set her own durn policies.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prospect of a Black Democrat empowered to hold white conservatives accountable to the law, without being accountable to white conservatives in return, is the political dragon to be slain. Willis has refused demands to testify before the state senate committee, describing it as an interference in her prosecution.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/houston\">Houston</a> is the fourth-largest city in the United States and the nation\u2019s most diverse. In Karl Rove\u2019s heyday, it voted for Republicans.</p> \n<p>Now Harris county, where Houston sits, leans Democratic. About 44% of Harris county residents are Latino. About 19% are Black, and about 7% are Asian. Less than 30% of Harris county is non-Hispanic and white.<strong> </strong>\u201cThere\u2019s values coming out of blue cities and places like Houston, where we love the fact that we\u2019re so diverse,\u201d said Nicole Pedersen, the county\u2019s Democratic party elections director. \u201cWe love our restaurants and different cultures. I think there\u2019s a fear of that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden won Harris county, where Houston is located, by about 218,000 votes in 2020, while losing Texas 52-46 by about 630,000 votes. Pedersen estimates that Harris county needs to turn out about 1.1 million Democratic voters to flip the state.</p> \n<p>Is Harris county getting there? Hard to tell. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate run in 2018 started a clock ticking. O\u2019Rourke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/06/beto-orourke-loses-ted-cruz-texas-shift-democrats-midterms\">lost</a> that race by fewer than three points, the closest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/18/senate-races-elections-to-watch\">US Senate</a> contest in Texas in a generation. But as they say in Texas, just because a chicken\u2019s got wings don\u2019t mean it can fly.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, Texas Republicans recognize the existential threat to one-party rule presented by Harris county. Two years ago, Republicans passed legislation to allow the state to take over elections in Harris county \u2013 and <em>only </em>Harris county \u2013 in the event of problems with an election.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe problems that were listed are the kinds of things that happen in every single election,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cOur county is as big as half the states. We have these massive elections \u2026 of course, things are going to go wrong, equipment is going to break, there\u2019s going to be things that just happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThe law is written in such a way that they can take advantage of that and come in kind of whenever they want.\u201d</p> \n<p>A state takeover of the election\u2019s office doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that someone new will suppress Democratic votes. But it\u2019s telling that the Republican effort to convert voters of color in Harris county, one of the most diverse counties in the United States, does not appear to be a priority.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not personal to Republicans necessarily, Doyle said. It\u2019s just math. \u201cThey\u2019d like to erase Harris county voters from the map, and then they\u2019ll win forever,\u201d Doyle said.</p> \n<p>Republicans <em>have </em>been able to make gains among Latino voters, particularly those along the southern border, with appeals to patriotism, faith and safety.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/10/election-latino-voters-texas-trump\">Latinos in once true-blue Texas border zone are getting on the Trump train</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But the largely unspoken corollary is that Republicans \u2013 despite all effort to the contrary \u2013 cannot expect to win over voters of color in big cities in sufficient numbers to blunt the demographic impact of their increase in the electorate. </p> \n<p>After all, it\u2019s hard to win over people who live in cities when Republicans\u2019 primary political argument is that conservative voters have to be protected <em>from </em>people who live in cities.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Why would Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/18/trump-election-rally-wisconsin\">trash a city</a> like Milwaukee \u2013 or Atlanta, for that matter \u2013 in a swing state in an election year?

Even then, in an audience packed with almost exclusively white supporters, he once again railed against cities and crime.</p> \n<p>\u201cLook, the crime is most rampant right here and in African American communities,\u201d Trump said at 180 Church in Detroit. \u201cMore people see me and they say, \u2018Sir, we want protection.

We don\u2019t want to get robbed and mugged and beat up or killed.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Between the rise of Kamala Harris after Biden\u2019s withdrawal and the pratfall of comments about \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/31/trump-lies-questions-kamala-harris-racial-identity-nabj\">Black jobs</a>\u201d, in front of a group of Black journalists, Trump has begun abandoning the pretense of cross-racial outreach in favor of railing against \u201csanctuary cities\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Atlanta is, from time to time, the center of the political universe. It is also home to all things evil and villainous, a festering cesspool of lurid crime, a \u201cshooting gallery\u201d in the words of Donald Trump, spoken in the vile confines of a brand new college basketball arena amid the unspeakable horrors of a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood with a microbrewery. Conservatives stoking fear of big cities would be a joke, if not for the damage it does. In May, the FBI arrested Mark Adams Prieto, a 58-year-old gun show dealer from Prescott, Arizona, on firearms trafficking charges. Prieto had been on the way to Atlanta at the time, according to court documents, because he planned to kill as many Black people as he could at a Bad Bunny concert while planting Confederate flags and shouting white power slogans, to provoke a race war ahead of the 2024 election. \u201cThe reason I say Atlanta,\u201d Prieto allegedly told an informant working with the FBI, \u201cWhy, why is Georgia such a fucked-up state now? When I was a kid that was one of the most conservative states in the country. Why is it not now? Because as the crime got worse in LA, St Louis and all these other cities, all the n****** moved out of those [places] and moved to Atlanta.\u201d Prieto is a product of decades of Republican fearmongering, not just about Atlanta, but about big cities across the country. This is the message that Tucker Carlson and other conservative pundits have been pushing for years about San Francisco, New York and Detroit \u2013 it\u2019s exactly the same way conservatives amped up their rhetorical combat on Chicago in the wake of Barack Obama\u2019s ascension to the White House 16 years ago. It\u2019s not because of crime. Cities in every country have long had more crime than their suburban counterparts, simply because it\u2019s easier to commit a crime in a city, and it has largely trended downward. It\u2019s because Democrats \u2013 often Black Democrats \u2013 control most big city governments, and they help national politicians win. Joe Biden won 85% of San Francisco\u2019s votes in 2020. He also won 83% of Chicago, 77% of Los Angeles and 76% of New York City. As a result, conservative state governments are cauterizing upstart municipalities, burning any pretense of respect for small-D democracy at the local level in the process. They fear those blue dots will bleed enough Black political power into red states to turn them purple and cost them the White House, not just in 2024, but permanently. Race is at the center of the fear. *** \u201cAny mayor, county judge that was dumb-ass enough to come meet with me, I told them with great clarity, my goal is for this to be the worst session in the history of the legislature for cities and counties.\u201d That\u2019s former Texas House speaker Dennis Bonnen, in a conversation recorded with another legislator leaked to the Texas Tribune in 2019. In response to Austin legislation requiring water breaks for construction workers in the punishing Texas heat, the Republican-controlled legislature in 2023 passed what progressives call the \u201cDeath Star\u201d bill. The law in effect ends the practice of home rule in Texas governments \u2013 a legal principle enshrined in the Texas constitution and that of many states \u2013 giving cities broad autonomy to create local laws, as long as those laws do not conflict with state or federal law. House Bill 2127 takes that power away from cities in a swath of policy areas, from managing climate change to labor law. The law is in legal limbo today. But the damage is already being done to municipal leaders, who are frozen in place waiting for the case to be resolved. This story is playing out across the country, with red state governments seeing big blue cities as launching places for progressive ideas. In the wake of the deadly police beating of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, the city government created a police review board. Tennessee\u2019s conservative legislature promptly passed a law banning such boards. Nashville\u2019s response to the Covenant school shooting led to protesters in and outside the state capitol. The legislature responded with an attempt to cut Nashville\u2019s elected metro council in half and threatened takeovers of the city\u2019s sports and airport authority boards. Florida has blocked its cities from passing LGBTQ+ nondiscrimination ordinances, from regulating pit bulls, from making socially conscious investments, and from passing local zoning laws around \u201cmissing middle\u201d housing and building construction. Florida\u2019s famous \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d bill mandates local school boards to provide politically vetted instructional materials. On top of all of this, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, signed Senate Bill 170 into law last July with almost no national media commentary. The law, with some exceptions for budgeting, automatically enjoins Florida cities from enforcing a municipal ordinance if that ordinance is being challenged in court, and awards court costs to challengers if they win. In Jackson, Mississippi, lawmakers ostensibly concerned about crime attempted to create an entirely new court system, supplanting elected judges in Hinds county with appointees of the Republican chief judge. \u201cNo one could tell us why do we need this bill?\u201d said Judge Winston Kidd. \u201cThe only thing I could go back to was the fact that all four circuit judges are African American, and in no other jurisdiction in this state had they tried something of that nature.\u201d And, of course, there\u2019s Atlanta. A few years ago, legislators began looking at ways to curb the power of locally elected district attorneys after the prosecutor in Athens-Clarke county decided to stop charging people for petty drug offenses. The failure of a different local prosecutor \u2013 Brunswick county\u2019s Jackie Johnson \u2013 to charge the men who murdered Ahmaud Arbery threw the question into sharp relief. But lawmakers are now pivoting this legislation toward the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, who is prosecuting Trump and 18 others for interfering with the 2020 election. \u201cIf the inmates are running the asylum here, then we maybe ought to be stepping in here, and that\u2019s the role of this committee, to recommend if we need uniform state laws and ethical boundaries,\u201d said Bill Cowsert, a Georgia state senator and chairman of the committee, at a meeting in August. \u201cMadam DA in Fulton county says she ain\u2019t got to do what Fulton county tells her to do, with whistleblowers, with treatment of employees or anything because she is a constitutional officer and she can set her own durn policies.\u201d The prospect of a Black Democrat empowered to hold white conservatives accountable to the law, without being accountable to white conservatives in return, is the political dragon to be slain. Willis has refused demands to testify before the state senate committee, describing it as an interference in her prosecution. *** Houston is the fourth-largest city in the United States and the nation\u2019s most diverse. In Karl Rove\u2019s heyday, it voted for Republicans. Now Harris county, where Houston sits, leans Democratic. About 44% of Harris county residents are Latino. About 19% are Black, and about 7% are Asian. Less than 30% of Harris county is non-Hispanic and white. \u201cThere\u2019s values coming out of blue cities and places like Houston, where we love the fact that we\u2019re so diverse,\u201d said Nicole Pedersen, the county\u2019s Democratic party elections director. \u201cWe love our restaurants and different cultures. I think there\u2019s a fear of that.\u201d Biden won Harris county, where Houston is located, by about 218,000 votes in 2020, while losing Texas 52-46 by about 630,000 votes. Pedersen estimates that Harris county needs to turn out about 1.1 million Democratic voters to flip the state. Is Harris county getting there? Hard to tell. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate run in 2018 started a clock ticking. O\u2019Rourke lost that race by fewer than three points, the closest US Senate contest in Texas in a generation. But as they say in Texas, just because a chicken\u2019s got wings don\u2019t mean it can fly. Nonetheless, Texas Republicans recognize the existential threat to one-party rule presented by Harris county. Two years ago, Republicans passed legislation to allow the state to take over elections in Harris county \u2013 and only Harris county \u2013 in the event of problems with an election. \u201cThe problems that were listed are the kinds of things that happen in every single election,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cOur county is as big as half the states. We have these massive elections \u2026 of course, things are going to go wrong, equipment is going to break, there\u2019s going to be things that just happen.\u201d \u201cThe law is written in such a way that they can take advantage of that and come in kind of whenever they want.\u201d A state takeover of the election\u2019s office doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that someone new will suppress Democratic votes. But it\u2019s telling that the Republican effort to convert voters of color in Harris county, one of the most diverse counties in the United States, does not appear to be a priority. It\u2019s not personal to Republicans necessarily, Doyle said. It\u2019s just math. \u201cThey\u2019d like to erase Harris county voters from the map, and then they\u2019ll win forever,\u201d Doyle said. Republicans have been able to make gains among Latino voters, particularly those along the southern border, with appeals to patriotism, faith and safety. But the largely unspoken corollary is that Republicans \u2013 despite all effort to the contrary \u2013 cannot expect to win over voters of color in big cities in sufficient numbers to blunt the demographic impact of their increase in the electorate. After all, it\u2019s hard to win over people who live in cities when Republicans\u2019 primary political argument is that conservative voters have to be protected from people who live in cities. *** Why would Trump trash a city like Milwaukee \u2013 or Atlanta, for that matter \u2013 in a swing state in an election year? Because those cities cost him those states in 2020. On the podium on a fateful 6 January 2021, speaking to a group of supporters who would eventually become a riot storming the Capitol, Trump intoned a litany of grievances with no regard for evidence and repeating debunked claims from these cities. Trump said Fulton county in Georgia was \u201ccorrupt\u201d and had stuffed machines with fake votes. Detroit had \u201c139%\u201d turnout \u2013 a lie \u2013 after canvassers were \u201cre-scanning batches of ballots over and over again\u201d \u2013 another lie. The grievance lives on. When Trump was speaking in Atlanta\u2019s Summerhill neighborhood in August, he described Atlanta as \u201clike a killing field\u201d, referencing a recent high-profile murder downtown. When Congressman John Lewis refused to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017, Trump suggested by tweet that the city was \u201ccrime infested\u201d and that Lewis \u201cshould spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart\u201d. Trump refused to observe Lewis\u2019s death with dignity as a revered civil rights icon. He instead attacked Lewis\u2019s legacy, telling a reporter he \u201ccouldn\u2019t say one way or another\u201d whether Lewis was worthy of praise, complaining again about being snubbed at the inauguration and musing about how the Civil Rights Act had \u201cworked out\u201d for Black voters. Atlantans have not forgotten these insults. Fulton and DeKalb counties \u2013 Atlanta\u2019s core \u2013 delivered a net gain of about 140,000 votes for Biden in 2020. Overall turnout in Georgia increased by about 20% four years ago; in these counties, Democratic turnout increased by about 32%. Lewis\u2019s name was on their lips as they stood in line to vote. The Trump campaign had been trying to coax Black voters into their camp, with events like the launch of his Black voter coalition group at a historically Black church in Detroit in June. Even then, in an audience packed with almost exclusively white supporters, he once again railed against cities and crime. \u201cLook, the crime is most rampant right here and in African American communities,\u201d Trump said at 180 Church in Detroit. \u201cMore people see me and they say, \u2018Sir, we want protection. We want police to protect us. We don\u2019t want to get robbed and mugged and beat up or killed.\u2019\u201d Between the rise of Kamala Harris after Biden\u2019s withdrawal and the pratfall of comments about \u201cBlack jobs\u201d, in front of a group of Black journalists, Trump has begun abandoning the pretense of cross-racial outreach in favor of railing against \u201csanctuary cities\u201d. Over the last few weeks, he has made a tour of sundown towns \u2013 communities that would terrorize Black people caught within the city limits after sundown \u2013 on the campaign trail. Trump, trying to counter-program against the Democratic national convention, made a campaign stop in August to Howell, Michigan, a city 40 miles (64km) west of Detroit with historical ties to the Ku Klux Klan. Even there, he unloaded on cities. \u201cCities. I will say this. The top 25: almost all are run by Democrats. And they have very similar policies. It\u2019s just insane. But you can\u2019t walk across the street to get a loaf of bread,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get shot. You get mugged, you get raped, you get whatever it may be. And you\u2019ve seen it and I\u2019ve seen it and it\u2019s time for a change. We have to bring back our cities. We have these cities that are great cities where people are afraid to live in them. They\u2019re fleeing the cities of our country.\u201d But it might be Trump\u2019s commentary about Milwaukee in July that truly makes the point. In a closed-door meeting with conservative leaders ahead of the Republican national convention there, he called it a \u201chorrible city\u201d. His comment left people wondering what could be so horrible about Milwaukee, a city filled with people who by and large are known for avoiding offense. Crime? Traffic? Bad schools? High costs? Homelessness? Liberals? Mostly, it\u2019s about a place with people who cost him an election. \u201cI only like people who like me,\u201d he has said. Mayor Cavalier Johnson shot back, Milwaukee-style. \u201cDonald Trump was talking about things that he thinks are horrible. All of us lived through his presidency. So, right back at you, buddy.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>One morning six years ago, Horatio Clare got out of bed and looked at the winter sunrise through a locked window. \u201cYou are,\u201d he said aloud, \u201cin a mental hospital under Section Two of the Mental Health Act.\u201d A few days earlier, police had delivered Clare to this psychiatric facility in Yorkshire for his own good. \u201cI was fully, psychotically delusional,\u201d he recalls, \u201cbelieving I was helping the security service and aliens to bring about world peace, and engaged to Kylie Minogue.\u201d</p> <p>Clare was suffering from cyclothymia (a type of bipolar disorder), seasonal affective disorder, alcohol issues, self-loathing and a relationship failing because he\u2019d cheated on his partner. He\u2019d also experienced a psychotic episode prompted by sleep deprivation and powerful weed. But, in the words of anti-psychiatrist RD Laing, remarkably not cited here given that they express so well Clare\u2019s book philosophy: \u201cMadness need not be all breakdown. It may also be break-through.\u201d</p> <p>And so it was for Clare. Being away from family and relationship commitments was, he writes, \u201ca boon, and relief\u201d. Indeed, the utopian Clare imagines a good future in which mental hospitals will become known as retreats, to which each of us might retire for a bit from this world\u2019s greater madness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He yearns to find a third way between madness and medication\u2026 stressing the need to engage with others as part of recovery</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His book is an overwhelmingly kind-natured and inspiring self-help manual. The tone \u2013 unerringly hopeful, sometimes Pollyannish \u2013 is captured by the blurb: \u201cIf you or a loved one are in a tough mental place, hang in there. Things can and will get better. This book shows how, and Horatio has written it for you.\u201d</p> <p>And yet it could be read profitably by anyone: very few of us will quit this mortal coil without suffering anxiety, depression, insomnia, suicidal thoughts or eating disorders, nor \u2013 to get political for a moment \u2013 without being spiritually crushed by late capitalism. To put it another way, if you\u2019ve never been mad in this mad society, there is something <em>really</em> wrong with you.</p> <p>That said, Clare\u2019s experiences may not be entirely relatable. He\u2019s called Horatio for a start. He\u2019s a middle-class white journalist who teaches writing at university, has presented a Radio 4 series called <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001h3y5\">Is Psychiatry Working?</a></em> and has written 15 books. One of them, 2021\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/heavy-light-9781529112641/\">Heavy Light: A Journey Through Madness, Mania and Healing</a></em>, included details of Clare\u2019s experience of breakdown, some of which are recycled here. Very few of us would dare, still less get commissioned, to write about hitting rock bottom once; Clare, astutely if uncynically, has managed it twice.</p> <p>He is aware of his entitlement, writing: \u201cPrivilege is the reason I am able to own my own variety of madness\u2026 I am often cash poor but in freedom and self-determination I am fundamentally rich.\u201d The point of this book is to instil the self-determination he had into others struggling like him. What gives the book power and energy is that it is written out of outrage at the \u201cdisastrous way we misunderstand and mistreat people who suffer from mental ill health\u201d. He yearns to help others to find a third way \u2013 between madness and lifelong medication.</p>    <p>To that end, he interviews many mental health professionals, each of whom in their various ways are writhing in the straitjacket of a mental health care system that does its users too little good. Mike Slade, professor of mental health recovery and social inclusion at Nottingham University, tells Clare that the current system is riven with \u201ctoxic assumptions\u201d that often involve telling people at their most difficult moments that \u201ceverything is hopeless, and [they] should abandon [their] life ambitions and accept [an] identity as a \u2018mental health service user\u2019 and live with the stigma and discrimination that entails\u201d.</p> <p>Clare\u2019s book is a two-fingered salute to what Slade calls that \u201cbullshit narrative\u201d. He often writes like a Martin Lewis of mental health, a consumer champion giving tips on how to game a system that only a fool would have consciously devised; one replete with obscenely lengthy waiting lists and over-stigmatising diagnoses and which, at worst, offloads anti-psychotic meds long term to make the mad supine.</p> <p>But this is no individualist\u2019s charter; rather Clare\u2019s third way stresses the need to engage with other people as part of recovery. He\u2019s very taken with something called Chime, a system of recovery established by Mike Slade and others. Chime stands for Connection, Hope, Identity, Meaning and Empowerment, and is now, Clare claims, \u201cthe most widely used system internationally to understand and operationalise what recovery means\u201d. It\u2019s not anti-psychiatry but it\u2019s certainly anti-doom.</p> <p>What Chime amounts to was incarnated best for me in the book\u2019s sweetest passage. One rainy winter\u2019s morning, Clare looked out of another Yorkshire window. Hunched neighbours passed by defeated by the season. And then he saw an indomitable woman picking up litter, finding meaning and connection in the most humble yet worthwhile of tasks. She chimed with Clare and with me too: a little altruistic life-affirming sanity in a world gone nuts.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Your Journey, Your Way</em>: <em>How to Make the Mental Health System Work for You</em> by Horatio Clare is published by Penguin Life (\u00a318.99).

      "bodyText": "One morning six years ago, Horatio Clare got out of bed and looked at the winter sunrise through a locked window. \u201cYou are,\u201d he said aloud, \u201cin a mental hospital under Section Two of the Mental Health Act.\u201d A few days earlier, police had delivered Clare to this psychiatric facility in Yorkshire for his own good. \u201cI was fully, psychotically delusional,\u201d he recalls, \u201cbelieving I was helping the security service and aliens to bring about world peace, and engaged to Kylie Minogue.\u201d Clare was suffering from cyclothymia (a type of bipolar disorder), seasonal affective disorder, alcohol issues, self-loathing and a relationship failing because he\u2019d cheated on his partner. He\u2019d also experienced a psychotic episode prompted by sleep deprivation and powerful weed. But, in the words of anti-psychiatrist RD Laing, remarkably not cited here given that they express so well Clare\u2019s book philosophy: \u201cMadness need not be all breakdown. It may also be break-through.\u201d And so it was for Clare. Being away from family and relationship commitments was, he writes, \u201ca boon, and relief\u201d. Indeed, the utopian Clare imagines a good future in which mental hospitals will become known as retreats, to which each of us might retire for a bit from this world\u2019s greater madness. His book is an overwhelmingly kind-natured and inspiring self-help manual. The tone \u2013 unerringly hopeful, sometimes Pollyannish \u2013 is captured by the blurb: \u201cIf you or a loved one are in a tough mental place, hang in there. Things can and will get better. This book shows how, and Horatio has written it for you.\u201d And yet it could be read profitably by anyone: very few of us will quit this mortal coil without suffering anxiety, depression, insomnia, suicidal thoughts or eating disorders, nor \u2013 to get political for a moment \u2013 without being spiritually crushed by late capitalism. To put it another way, if you\u2019ve never been mad in this mad society, there is something really wrong with you. That said, Clare\u2019s experiences may not be entirely relatable. He\u2019s called Horatio for a start. He\u2019s a middle-class white journalist who teaches writing at university, has presented a Radio 4 series called Is Psychiatry Working? and has written 15 books. One of them, 2021\u2019s Heavy Light: A Journey Through Madness, Mania and Healing, included details of Clare\u2019s experience of breakdown, some of which are recycled here. Very few of us would dare, still less get commissioned, to write about hitting rock bottom once; Clare, astutely if uncynically, has managed it twice. He is aware of his entitlement, writing: \u201cPrivilege is the reason I am able to own my own variety of madness\u2026 I am often cash poor but in freedom and self-determination I am fundamentally rich.\u201d The point of this book is to instil the self-determination he had into others struggling like him. What gives the book power and energy is that it is written out of outrage at the \u201cdisastrous way we misunderstand and mistreat people who suffer from mental ill health\u201d. He yearns to help others to find a third way \u2013 between madness and lifelong medication. To that end, he interviews many mental health professionals, each of whom in their various ways are writhing in the straitjacket of a mental health care system that does its users too little good. Mike Slade, professor of mental health recovery and social inclusion at Nottingham University, tells Clare that the current system is riven with \u201ctoxic assumptions\u201d that often involve telling people at their most difficult moments that \u201ceverything is hopeless, and [they] should abandon [their] life ambitions and accept [an] identity as a \u2018mental health service user\u2019 and live with the stigma and discrimination that entails\u201d. Clare\u2019s book is a two-fingered salute to what Slade calls that \u201cbullshit narrative\u201d. He often writes like a Martin Lewis of mental health, a consumer champion giving tips on how to game a system that only a fool would have consciously devised; one replete with obscenely lengthy waiting lists and over-stigmatising diagnoses and which, at worst, offloads anti-psychotic meds long term to make the mad supine. But this is no individualist\u2019s charter; rather Clare\u2019s third way stresses the need to engage with other people as part of recovery. He\u2019s very taken with something called Chime, a system of recovery established by Mike Slade and others. Chime stands for Connection, Hope, Identity, Meaning and Empowerment, and is now, Clare claims, \u201cthe most widely used system internationally to understand and operationalise what recovery means\u201d. It\u2019s not anti-psychiatry but it\u2019s certainly anti-doom. What Chime amounts to was incarnated best for me in the book\u2019s sweetest passage. One rainy winter\u2019s morning, Clare looked out of another Yorkshire window. Hunched neighbours passed by defeated by the season. And then he saw an indomitable woman picking up litter, finding meaning and connection in the most humble yet worthwhile of tasks. She chimed with Clare and with me too: a little altruistic life-affirming sanity in a world gone nuts. \u2022 Your Journey, Your Way: How to Make the Mental Health System Work for You by Horatio Clare is published by Penguin Life (\u00a318.99).

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s already been a hard morning for Beau Woodbridge. He\u2019s had several breakdowns. Or, rather, the same one on repeat.</p> <p>The actor is deep into rehearsals for the Australian premiere of Dear Evan Hansen, the hit Broadway musical by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, a coproduction by Sydney Theatre Company and Michael Cassel Group that opens at Sydney\u2019s Roslyn Packer Theatre this month before seasons in Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide. He\u2019s playing the titular lead: an anxious teenager who, through a mix-up and misunderstanding \u2013 and a not-so-little white lie \u2013 has a hero\u2019s mantle placed on him by his high school peers after the suicide of another student, Connor, who they believe was Evan\u2019s friend.</p> <p>Today Woodbridge (the son of doubles tennis champ Todd Woodbridge) has been working on one of Evan\u2019s big numbers, Words Fail, in which he confesses all to Connor\u2019s shocked and disbelieving family. If you know the show, or have seen the 2021 movie version, you\u2019ll remember this moment. It\u2019s a hard one.</p> <p>Moments before this interview, Woodbridge was acting to an empty dining table \u2013 emoting to the air \u2013 as the rest of the cast were given the morning off. \u201cIt\u2019s a big song,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I really love about Dear Evan Hansen is that each song has a great big story and they are really demanding technically, so with songs like Words Fail, I know I have to pace myself. There\u2019s something like 14 or 15 songs in the show and I lead 11 or 12 of them. It\u2019s quite a heavy load.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Woodbridge, who landed the role while in his graduate year at the Royal Academy of Music in London, is also feeling the weight of expectation. The title role in Dear Evan Hansen is synonymous in the minds of its fans with the performance by Ben Platt, who won a Tony in 2017 for his performance on Broadway and starred in the film \u2013 to the chagrin of some, who thought that Platt (aged 27 at the time) was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/14/dear-evan-hansen-review-ghoulish-ben-platt-sinks-high-school-musical\">too old to play a teenager</a>. He copped a pasting on socials.</p> <p>Aged 22, the soft-faced Woodbridge might be considered more \u201cteen adjacent\u201d.</p>    <p>\u201cI was lucky enough to actually see the original production on Broadway when I was quite young, about 14, and I saw Ben as Evan,\u201d he says. \u201cI think there are definitely parts of his Evan that have stayed in my head but I don\u2019t think too much about stuff like that. It\u2019s fun for me to approach it from the text [and] from the score, and really honour that. I definitely have my own version of Evan and my own idea of the social anxiety he experiences.\u201d</p> <p>Is that something from Woodbridge\u2019s imagination? \u201cI do have anxiety myself in certain areas and I\u2019ve definitely been using that to fuel some of the decisions I\u2019m making,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s something that tends to manifest physically, you know? It sort of drops into my stomach. So that\u2019s something I\u2019ve been playing with, gathering and releasing that tension in your gut.\u201d</p> <p>Some of Evan\u2019s anxiety might be the result of his hyper-awareness, Woodbridge says. \u201cDean [Bryant, the director] and I have been developing his idea that Evan isn\u2019t one of those socially anxious people who wants to avoid people and issues. Instead, we see him as hyper-aware, really good at reading situations. He\u2019s just unable to interact with them. [What] I really want to show in my Evan is this longing for connection.\u201d</p>    <p>Bryant says putting on a new Australian production of a much-loved musical doesn\u2019t faze him; he did the same for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/may/11/fun-home-review-alison-bechdel-memoir-musical-adaptation-burrows-its-way-into-your-heart\">Fun Home</a> in 2021. \u201cThat show was beloved as well, not maybe as much of a blockbuster as Dear Evan Hansen, but still, so many people had seen it on Broadway or in London. I have the same approach I would take to any classic or even new work, which is, what does it feel like the writers were intending to do? What does it feel like it\u2019s saying about mental health in 2024 and the way teenagers and parents talk in 2024, while using the set text that you\u2019re given?\u201d</p> <p>In his staging, \u201cThe [theatre] space feels like Evan\u2019s mind, compressing him, with screens used sparingly, swamping the characters, much like we experience social media [and the internet],\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/sep/25/naturism-nude-play-sydney-theatre-company-2025-schedule\">\u2018A very brave thing to do\u2019: all-nude play about boomers v gen Z to premiere at Sydney\u2019s Griffin theatre</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Natalie O\u2019Donnell, who plays Connor\u2019s mother Cynthia, has two teenagers of her own and says she\u2019s particularly struck by the authenticity of Bryant\u2019s production. \u201cWhat I think this show captures beautifully is the way the teenagers engage with each other, and how conversations between the parents and teenagers sit in a very different world. For me, that really resonated, and I don\u2019t say that lightly, because I\u2019m a mum seeing my kids do the same.\u201d</p> <p>Woodbridge saw the Broadway production with his own mother. \u201cI remember both of us turning to each other at the end and we were both in tears. You come away wanting to talk, just to let them know you appreciate them being there. You\u2019ve watched these characters moving through all these moral and ethical grey areas and it\u2019s so real, so like the world we are in every day.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s already been a hard morning for Beau Woodbridge. He\u2019s had several breakdowns. Or, rather, the same one on repeat. The actor is deep into rehearsals for the Australian premiere of Dear Evan Hansen, the hit Broadway musical by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, a coproduction by Sydney Theatre Company and Michael Cassel Group that opens at Sydney\u2019s Roslyn Packer Theatre this month before seasons in Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide. He\u2019s playing the titular lead: an anxious teenager who, through a mix-up and misunderstanding \u2013 and a not-so-little white lie \u2013 has a hero\u2019s mantle placed on him by his high school peers after the suicide of another student, Connor, who they believe was Evan\u2019s friend. Today Woodbridge (the son of doubles tennis champ Todd Woodbridge) has been working on one of Evan\u2019s big numbers, Words Fail, in which he confesses all to Connor\u2019s shocked and disbelieving family. If you know the show, or have seen the 2021 movie version, you\u2019ll remember this moment. It\u2019s a hard one. Moments before this interview, Woodbridge was acting to an empty dining table \u2013 emoting to the air \u2013 as the rest of the cast were given the morning off. \u201cIt\u2019s a big song,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I really love about Dear Evan Hansen is that each song has a great big story and they are really demanding technically, so with songs like Words Fail, I know I have to pace myself. There\u2019s something like 14 or 15 songs in the show and I lead 11 or 12 of them. It\u2019s quite a heavy load.\u201d Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Woodbridge, who landed the role while in his graduate year at the Royal Academy of Music in London, is also feeling the weight of expectation. The title role in Dear Evan Hansen is synonymous in the minds of its fans with the performance by Ben Platt, who won a Tony in 2017 for his performance on Broadway and starred in the film \u2013 to the chagrin of some, who thought that Platt (aged 27 at the time) was too old to play a teenager. He copped a pasting on socials. Aged 22, the soft-faced Woodbridge might be considered more \u201cteen adjacent\u201d. \u201cI was lucky enough to actually see the original production on Broadway when I was quite young, about 14, and I saw Ben as Evan,\u201d he says. \u201cI think there are definitely parts of his Evan that have stayed in my head but I don\u2019t think too much about stuff like that. It\u2019s fun for me to approach it from the text [and] from the score, and really honour that. I definitely have my own version of Evan and my own idea of the social anxiety he experiences.\u201d Is that something from Woodbridge\u2019s imagination? \u201cI do have anxiety myself in certain areas and I\u2019ve definitely been using that to fuel some of the decisions I\u2019m making,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s something that tends to manifest physically, you know? It sort of drops into my stomach. So that\u2019s something I\u2019ve been playing with, gathering and releasing that tension in your gut.\u201d Some of Evan\u2019s anxiety might be the result of his hyper-awareness, Woodbridge says. \u201cDean [Bryant, the director] and I have been developing his idea that Evan isn\u2019t one of those socially anxious people who wants to avoid people and issues. Instead, we see him as hyper-aware, really good at reading situations. He\u2019s just unable to interact with them. [What] I really want to show in my Evan is this longing for connection.\u201d Bryant says putting on a new Australian production of a much-loved musical doesn\u2019t faze him; he did the same for Fun Home in 2021. \u201cThat show was beloved as well, not maybe as much of a blockbuster as Dear Evan Hansen, but still, so many people had seen it on Broadway or in London. I have the same approach I would take to any classic or even new work, which is, what does it feel like the writers were intending to do? What does it feel like it\u2019s saying about mental health in 2024 and the way teenagers and parents talk in 2024, while using the set text that you\u2019re given?\u201d In his staging, \u201cThe [theatre] space feels like Evan\u2019s mind, compressing him, with screens used sparingly, swamping the characters, much like we experience social media [and the internet],\u201d he says. Natalie O\u2019Donnell, who plays Connor\u2019s mother Cynthia, has two teenagers of her own and says she\u2019s particularly struck by the authenticity of Bryant\u2019s production. \u201cWhat I think this show captures beautifully is the way the teenagers engage with each other, and how conversations between the parents and teenagers sit in a very different world. For me, that really resonated, and I don\u2019t say that lightly, because I\u2019m a mum seeing my kids do the same.\u201d Woodbridge saw the Broadway production with his own mother. \u201cI remember both of us turning to each other at the end and we were both in tears. You come away wanting to talk, just to let them know you appreciate them being there. You\u2019ve watched these characters moving through all these moral and ethical grey areas and it\u2019s so real, so like the world we are in every day. It\u2019s really moving to see a musical that is not all glitz and glam.\u201d Dear Evan Hansen is at Roslyn Packer Theatre, Sydney, from 12 October; Arts Centre Melbourne from 14 December; Canberra Theatre Centre from 27 February 2025; and Her Majesty\u2019s Theatre, Adelaide, from 3 April",

      "bodyText": "People who have been UK residents for decades are worried they could find themselves \u201clocked out\u201d of the country at the end of the year when eVisas come into force. The scheme means many physical immigration documents such as biometric residence permits (BRPs) or biometric residence cards (BRCs) need to be replaced by online visas, which critics have said do not work properly. The current permits show proof of the right to reside, rent, work and claim benefits in the UK, but critics says that owing to flaws in the eVisas\u2019 design, rollout and implementation, there could be problems. There is particular concern about the 200,000 people in the UK who have legacy documents proving their right to be in the country, and who are expected to first apply for a BRP and then apply for a UK visas and immigration account. As with the Windrush scandal, these tend to be older people who may not know they need to apply for an eVisa until they try to access health or other public services. Kathleen Harper, 78, an American actor, was given indefinite leave to remain in 1974. It was documented as a stamp in her paper passport. The Home Office did not send her any information about the eVisa scheme and she knew nothing about it until a friend living in the US told her he had read about it. Despite having had indefinite leave to remain for half a century, she has in effect been asked to reapply for the right to be in the UK. The Home Office has requested proof that she has lived in the UK for each of the 50 years she has been in the country. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of proof the Home Office needs of my 50 years in the UK, and when I asked them they couldn\u2019t really tell me. I\u2019m fortunate that because I\u2019ve worked here as an actress for so long there are a lot of records of my work,\u201d Harper said. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting to hear about when I will get an appointment with the Home Office about my eVisa. I\u2019ve had two strokes, one a TIA, and I\u2019m finding the whole thing very stressful.\u201d She told the Guardian that when she spoke to a Home Office official about her concerns, she was told she would not be proactively deported but may not be allowed back into the UK if she travelled abroad. She has booked a family holiday to Sri Lanka in January and she is fearful she may not be allowed back into the UK. Many others with a right to reside in the UK but who are not British citizens share her concerns. One British man is fearful that his foreign-born wife will be locked out of the UK the next time she travels to her home country to see her family. \u201cMy wife now has her eVisa. It shows a photo and a date of birth but not a passport number. I don\u2019t understand how a foreign airline will accept this as proof of immigration status,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like the kind of thing you could knock up on Photoshop.\u201d Sara Alsherif, the programme manager for migrant digital justice at the Open Rights Group, said: \u201cYet again, migrants are living in fear that they won\u2019t be able to prove their right to be in the UK because of a flawed Home Office programme.

In particular, the July decision of the six-to-three rightwing majority to grant Donald Trump substantial immunity from criminal prosecution for actions he carried out as president astonished even seasoned observers of the country\u2019s top court. \u201cThat ruling was shocking, it was a rip to the constitutional fabric, and it gave vast new power to presidents to break the law,\u201d Michael Waldman said at a recent webinar by the Brennan Center, the progressive thinktank, of which he is president. Despite the ructions caused by its actions, the increasingly hard-right court shows no signs of reining itself in. The first big case of the new term that will be addressed on Tuesday takes the justices back into the vexed area of gun controls. The case, Garland v VanDerStok, concerns \u201cghost guns\u201d, kits that can be assembled at home that are increasingly used to skirt around basic gun regulations including serial numbers and federal background checks.

The case has potentially huge implications for gun control. A decision that exempts ghost guns from basic regulations would punch a giant loophole in America\u2019s already lax approach to firearms. As it is, US courts are wrestling with chaos and confusion in the wake of recent supreme court gun rulings. In his Bruen judgment, the hard-right justice Clarence Thomas invented a new rule that any handgun ban must comport with the country\u2019s \u201chistory and tradition\u201d \u2013 a phrase which has set federal judges scrambling to try to make sense of it. The ghost gun case has emerged out of the fifth circuit court of appeals, which has the distinction of being the most rightwing appeals court in the US.

      "body": "<p>My hair looks incredible at the moment. I know because people keep telling me \u2013 in bakeries, cafes and when I was getting my tattooed eyebrows touched up yesterday.</p> <p>What to say? \u201cThanks!\u201d feels conceited. \u201cMy hairdresser\u2019s a genius,\u201d is (part of) the truth. I often narcissistically worry what would happen if he were to slip away before me; how wrong would it be to bring him five or six wigs to cut on his deathbed? In a similar vein, I was thrilled yesterday, when S, who has done my brows for decades, told me her daughter may be going into the family business \u2013 succession secured!</p> <p>The honest \u2013 if awkward \u2013 answer, of course, is: \u201cIt\u2019s not mine.\u201d I have alopecia; I have no idea whose hair I\u2019m wearing. For someone who frets about where my avocados come from, I\u2019m shamefully incurious about how my hair is sourced (\u201cthe general public of the world\u201d, my wig supplier\u2019s site says, vaguely).</p> <p>It\u2019s definitely lusher and more lustrous than the hair I saw in a recent <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/alopecia-treatment-growth-self-image.html\">New York magazine</a><em> </em>article. That was barely fluff, a halo of fine baby hairs catching the light, but it was the author\u2019s own. Lindsey Sullivan also has alopecia; she had been taking Pfizer\u2019s new treatment, Litfulo (ritlecitinib), for a few months when the picture was taken. \u201cI\u2019ve never had eyebrow hair before and am now contemplating brow products,\u201d she says in the piece. Her Instagram, which I instantly sought out, shows her, a year into treatment, with a decent amount of real hair on her head. Zooming in, I spotted she has eyelashes too. Eyelashes! The dream.</p> <p>It\u2019s a literal dream I have sometimes. I wake up weirdly bereft, my fingertips tingling with the phantom sensation of running my hand over my head and feeling hair, something that hasn\u2019t happened since it all fell out in 1995 and I gave up the unpleasant, ineffective steroids I was prescribed a year later.</p> <p>But now there may be an effective treatment. It\u2019s no magic bullet but it\u2019s the best chance yet. In trials, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/infographics/ritlecitinib_alopecia/Ritlecitinib_alopecia_areata.pdf\">\u201cnearly 25%\u201d of people saw 80% or above scalp coverage</a> (the percentage was higher over longer periods at higher doses).</p> <p>It\u2019s probably not imminent here. Nice approved Litfulo in March, but Alopecia UK suggests <a href=\"https://www.alopecia.org.uk/ritlecitinib-questions-and-answers\">accessing it on the NHS will be tough</a> in the short term. Dermatology referrals are inconsistent and waiting lists are long. Hair loss is understandably way down the bottom of healthcare priorities in 2024, and a private <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-68367795\">month\u2019s supply can cost up to nearly \u00a31,000</a>, so that\u2019s out of the question. Costs will come down and access should improve, but, even then, I may not be a good candidate because I\u2019ve had alopecia for so long. Still, it\u2019s a \u201cmaybe\u201d, after 30 years of \u201cno\u201d\u2013 a confusing possibility I\u2019m struggling to navigate.</p> <p>For Sullivan, growing more hair has been a conflicted experience. Her identity was wrapped up in her hair loss (which started when she was a toddler), her decade of out and proud acceptance of her baldness, and her role as a support group leader and <a href=\"https://verynearlyalmost.buzzsprout.com/1822807/episodes/15771939-lindsey-opens-up-about-her-alopecia-treatment?t=0\">advocate for people with alopecia</a>. Even seeking treatment, she wrote, felt like \u201ca betrayal\u201d.</p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t be conflicted. If I could, I\u2019d take Litfulo in a flash; I\u2019d do it for the eyelashes alone. It feels weird to conduct that thought experiment and realise my answer is so unequivocal, like an expression of unhappiness with my hairless life when I\u2019m not, I think, unhappy.

      "bodyText": "My hair looks incredible at the moment. I know because people keep telling me \u2013 in bakeries, cafes and when I was getting my tattooed eyebrows touched up yesterday. What to say? \u201cThanks!\u201d feels conceited. \u201cMy hairdresser\u2019s a genius,\u201d is (part of) the truth. I often narcissistically worry what would happen if he were to slip away before me; how wrong would it be to bring him five or six wigs to cut on his deathbed? In a similar vein, I was thrilled yesterday, when S, who has done my brows for decades, told me her daughter may be going into the family business \u2013 succession secured! The honest \u2013 if awkward \u2013 answer, of course, is: \u201cIt\u2019s not mine.\u201d I have alopecia; I have no idea whose hair I\u2019m wearing. For someone who frets about where my avocados come from, I\u2019m shamefully incurious about how my hair is sourced (\u201cthe general public of the world\u201d, my wig supplier\u2019s site says, vaguely). It\u2019s definitely lusher and more lustrous than the hair I saw in a recent New York magazine article. That was barely fluff, a halo of fine baby hairs catching the light, but it was the author\u2019s own. Lindsey Sullivan also has alopecia; she had been taking Pfizer\u2019s new treatment, Litfulo (ritlecitinib), for a few months when the picture was taken. \u201cI\u2019ve never had eyebrow hair before and am now contemplating brow products,\u201d she says in the piece. Her Instagram, which I instantly sought out, shows her, a year into treatment, with a decent amount of real hair on her head. Zooming in, I spotted she has eyelashes too. Eyelashes! The dream. It\u2019s a literal dream I have sometimes. I wake up weirdly bereft, my fingertips tingling with the phantom sensation of running my hand over my head and feeling hair, something that hasn\u2019t happened since it all fell out in 1995 and I gave up the unpleasant, ineffective steroids I was prescribed a year later. But now there may be an effective treatment. It\u2019s no magic bullet but it\u2019s the best chance yet. In trials, \u201cnearly 25%\u201d of people saw 80% or above scalp coverage (the percentage was higher over longer periods at higher doses). It\u2019s probably not imminent here. Nice approved Litfulo in March, but Alopecia UK suggests accessing it on the NHS will be tough in the short term. Dermatology referrals are inconsistent and waiting lists are long. Hair loss is understandably way down the bottom of healthcare priorities in 2024, and a private month\u2019s supply can cost up to nearly \u00a31,000, so that\u2019s out of the question. Costs will come down and access should improve, but, even then, I may not be a good candidate because I\u2019ve had alopecia for so long. Still, it\u2019s a \u201cmaybe\u201d, after 30 years of \u201cno\u201d\u2013 a confusing possibility I\u2019m struggling to navigate. For Sullivan, growing more hair has been a conflicted experience. Her identity was wrapped up in her hair loss (which started when she was a toddler), her decade of out and proud acceptance of her baldness, and her role as a support group leader and advocate for people with alopecia. Even seeking treatment, she wrote, felt like \u201ca betrayal\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t be conflicted. If I could, I\u2019d take Litfulo in a flash; I\u2019d do it for the eyelashes alone. It feels weird to conduct that thought experiment and realise my answer is so unequivocal, like an expression of unhappiness with my hairless life when I\u2019m not, I think, unhappy. I never did the active work of getting to the place of acceptance that Sullivan describes, but the passage of time did its job, and being bald hasn\u2019t felt like a big deal for ages. Now, though, I\u2019m thinking about it all the time, wondering about the alternative.

      "body": "<p>An opossum will play dead to escape a predator. Ants remove the corpses of fallen soldiers from their nest. A group of chimpanzees will gather to bid farewell to one of their own. Like humans, animals have complicated, surprising relationships with death. <a href=\"https://susanamonso.com/\">Susana Mons\u00f3</a>, associate professor of philosophy at the <a href=\"https://www.uned.es/universidad/inicio/en/conocenos.html\">National University of Distance Education</a> in Madrid, examines animal perceptions of dying in her new book, <em><a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691260761/playing-possum?srsltid=AfmBOoqzcUgv6n_SGWkFW_yUSh9oQ7hZnlxloiC-YcfR9hCfXQ-kfTNV\">Playing Possum: How Animals Understand Death</a></em>.</p> <p><strong>Most pet owners wouldn\u2019t think their dog or cat pays much mind to the great beyond. How have animals been observed to respond to death?<br></strong>We don\u2019t see a standard response in every species, but rather many different responses to death. We\u2019ve seen many cases of mammalian mothers carrying the remains of their deceased babies \u2013 a very common phenomenon, especially among primate mothers, that might be an expression of grief. There was a very famous case of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDZcmmxmsxI\">chimpanzee seen cleaning the teeth</a> of the corpse of an adolescent male of the group. We\u2019ve seen another chimpanzee play-parenting the corpse of another species. And there are many cases of companion animals feeding on the remains of their caregivers.</p> <p>Elephants have been witnessed showing immense interest in the corpses of fellow elephants. There was a very intriguing report that had found the corpses of five different elephant calves <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2420561-asian-elephants-seen-burying-their-dead-for-the-first-time/\">buried within tea estates</a> in India, and some suggestions they were buried by elephants themselves. So we have a wide variety of reactions to death, and that raises the question: what is going on in their minds?</p> <p><strong>Presumably it\u2019s not the same as what\u2019s going on in our minds when we think of death?<br></strong>Humans are animals of very high cognitive complexity, but also we are immersed in cumulative cultures where we have all these symbolic representations of death and elaborate rituals. We have this scaffolding of cultural systems and processes that shape our perception and understanding of death, that non-linguistic animals probably don\u2019t have. So for animals, the way they learn about death is solipsistically. Each animal is on their own journey, and is dependent on their own experiences and life history to shape how they understand death.</p>    <p><strong>What do these animal responses to death tell us?<br></strong>Two things. On the one hand, they can tell us how animals understand death on a cognitive level: do they understand that death implies the irreversible cessation of functions? But we can also see something about the emotional significance that they attach to this event. In humans, we tend to think of death as something that triggers grief and is followed by a mourning response. But throughout our lives, we hear about many people dying, and for most of them we don\u2019t grieve because they\u2019re not close to us in any way.</p> <p>So these are two different things: what we can process cognitively, and how we deal with it emotionally. In animals, we see variations of both these things, and we need to have an open mind with regard to how animals might understand death, but might also react to it emotionally.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of people, when they\u2019re about to turn 30, become obsessed with death</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>It\u2019s tempting to explain animal behaviour by pointing to our human emotions. Does that risk conflating their response to death with our own understanding?<br></strong>The danger of anthropomorphising animals and projecting our own human experiences and way of understanding the world on to them is a legitimate worry. But the opposite worry is also there \u2013 the idea that because animals aren\u2019t human, they can\u2019t have any human-like psychological capacities. This is a corresponding bias that <a href=\"https://www.kristinandrews.org/\">Kristin Andrews</a> [professor of philosophy at York University, Ontario, Canada] has called anthropectomy.</p> <p><strong>Even with </strong><strong>empirical studies, a cynic might wonder whether </strong><strong>we can ever truly know the workings of an animal\u2019s mind. Might all this be futile?<br></strong>I\u2019ve heard that worry, but I think it\u2019s overstating that objection to say: \u201cWell, let\u2019s just abandon the whole thing, because we can\u2019t ever fully know what\u2019s going on inside an animal\u2019s mind.\u201d We can\u2019t achieve certainty in this debate, but science doesn\u2019t move with certainty. What we have in science are hypotheses that are more or less supported by the data.</p> <p><strong>Animal perceptions of death are often studied from a psychological or biological perspective, but you\u2019re coming to it from a philosophical background. Why bring philosophy into the mix?<br></strong>Philosophy is a part of science whether we like it or not. Science is about gathering data, but we have to decide first what questions we\u2019re going to be asking, how we\u2019re going to be addressing these questions, what methods we\u2019re going to be using. And then, once we have the data, we have to choose a statistical method and interpret those results. These are all steps where philosophical choices are made \u2013 choices that have to do with concepts and how we\u2019re using them, what our values are, the theory that we are bringing to the table.</p> <p>So the philosopher can help the scientists really reflect on how the concepts are being used, what suppositions are driving the scientific endeavour, what assumptions are in place, whether there are biases in how the questions are answered or the experiments are designed. Philosophers have this training in conceptual analysis and looking at things from a wider perspective, which I think scientists can really benefit from.</p> <p><strong>Your book ends on the hopeful idea that if we accept we\u2019re animals, we might better face our mortality. How has your outlook on death changed since studying this topic?<br></strong>A lot of people, when they\u2019re about to turn 30, become obsessed with death. It was definitely my case. When I began studying this topic, I didn\u2019t realise the connection at the time, but looking back, it\u2019s very obvious that I was searching for answers.</p> <p>Since studying death, I\u2019ve looked at it from every possible angle, I\u2019ve examined it and dissected it, and it\u2019s lost a lot of its emotional weight.

      "bodyText": "An opossum will play dead to escape a predator. Ants remove the corpses of fallen soldiers from their nest. A group of chimpanzees will gather to bid farewell to one of their own. Like humans, animals have complicated, surprising relationships with death. Susana Mons\u00f3, associate professor of philosophy at the National University of Distance Education in Madrid, examines animal perceptions of dying in her new book, Playing Possum: How Animals Understand Death. Most pet owners wouldn\u2019t think their dog or cat pays much mind to the great beyond. How have animals been observed to respond to death? We don\u2019t see a standard response in every species, but rather many different responses to death. We\u2019ve seen many cases of mammalian mothers carrying the remains of their deceased babies \u2013 a very common phenomenon, especially among primate mothers, that might be an expression of grief. There was a very famous case of a chimpanzee seen cleaning the teeth of the corpse of an adolescent male of the group. We\u2019ve seen another chimpanzee play-parenting the corpse of another species. And there are many cases of companion animals feeding on the remains of their caregivers. Elephants have been witnessed showing immense interest in the corpses of fellow elephants. There was a very intriguing report that had found the corpses of five different elephant calves buried within tea estates in India, and some suggestions they were buried by elephants themselves. So we have a wide variety of reactions to death, and that raises the question: what is going on in their minds? Presumably it\u2019s not the same as what\u2019s going on in our minds when we think of death? Humans are animals of very high cognitive complexity, but also we are immersed in cumulative cultures where we have all these symbolic representations of death and elaborate rituals. We have this scaffolding of cultural systems and processes that shape our perception and understanding of death, that non-linguistic animals probably don\u2019t have. So for animals, the way they learn about death is solipsistically. Each animal is on their own journey, and is dependent on their own experiences and life history to shape how they understand death. What do these animal responses to death tell us? Two things. On the one hand, they can tell us how animals understand death on a cognitive level: do they understand that death implies the irreversible cessation of functions? But we can also see something about the emotional significance that they attach to this event. In humans, we tend to think of death as something that triggers grief and is followed by a mourning response. But throughout our lives, we hear about many people dying, and for most of them we don\u2019t grieve because they\u2019re not close to us in any way. So these are two different things: what we can process cognitively, and how we deal with it emotionally. In animals, we see variations of both these things, and we need to have an open mind with regard to how animals might understand death, but might also react to it emotionally. It\u2019s tempting to explain animal behaviour by pointing to our human emotions. Does that risk conflating their response to death with our own understanding? The danger of anthropomorphising animals and projecting our own human experiences and way of understanding the world on to them is a legitimate worry. But the opposite worry is also there \u2013 the idea that because animals aren\u2019t human, they can\u2019t have any human-like psychological capacities. This is a corresponding bias that Kristin Andrews [professor of philosophy at York University, Ontario, Canada] has called anthropectomy. Even with empirical studies, a cynic might wonder whether we can ever truly know the workings of an animal\u2019s mind. Might all this be futile? I\u2019ve heard that worry, but I think it\u2019s overstating that objection to say: \u201cWell, let\u2019s just abandon the whole thing, because we can\u2019t ever fully know what\u2019s going on inside an animal\u2019s mind.\u201d We can\u2019t achieve certainty in this debate, but science doesn\u2019t move with certainty. What we have in science are hypotheses that are more or less supported by the data. Animal perceptions of death are often studied from a psychological or biological perspective, but you\u2019re coming to it from a philosophical background. Why bring philosophy into the mix? Philosophy is a part of science whether we like it or not. Science is about gathering data, but we have to decide first what questions we\u2019re going to be asking, how we\u2019re going to be addressing these questions, what methods we\u2019re going to be using. And then, once we have the data, we have to choose a statistical method and interpret those results. These are all steps where philosophical choices are made \u2013 choices that have to do with concepts and how we\u2019re using them, what our values are, the theory that we are bringing to the table. So the philosopher can help the scientists really reflect on how the concepts are being used, what suppositions are driving the scientific endeavour, what assumptions are in place, whether there are biases in how the questions are answered or the experiments are designed. Philosophers have this training in conceptual analysis and looking at things from a wider perspective, which I think scientists can really benefit from. Your book ends on the hopeful idea that if we accept we\u2019re animals, we might better face our mortality. How has your outlook on death changed since studying this topic? A lot of people, when they\u2019re about to turn 30, become obsessed with death. It was definitely my case. When I began studying this topic, I didn\u2019t realise the connection at the time, but looking back, it\u2019s very obvious that I was searching for answers. Since studying death, I\u2019ve looked at it from every possible angle, I\u2019ve examined it and dissected it, and it\u2019s lost a lot of its emotional weight. I think it has to do with normalising it, understanding that it\u2019s just a fact of life, and that it\u2019s not something unfair that happens to us. It\u2019s just the deal \u2013 if you want to be alive, then you have to die. Pretending it\u2019s not going to happen makes the fear of death stronger than if you look at it head on and just accept it for what it is.

      "body": "<p>You can\u2019t afford to ignore mobility as you get older. If you can\u2019t get in and out of the bath, or on and off the bed or the toilet, independent living is going to be difficult. But long before you reach that point, reduced mobility can be a problem. Everyone wants to be able to scratch their own back or grab a jar from the top shelf in the kitchen. This isn\u2019t just about extending or bending your body into the required positions: you also need enough strength to be able to do stuff when you\u2019re in them. <a href=\"https://www.bodyset.co.uk/general/what-is-mobility-and-why-is-it-so-important/\">As physiotherapists put it</a>, mobility is your ability to move your joints actively rather than passively. Flexibility and gravity will get you down on to the toilet; it\u2019s mobility that will get you back up again.</p> <p>Look, I\u2019m 61, with a 61-year-old\u2019s plumbing. I think about toilets a lot, and about what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/24/underactive-overindulging-40s-now-im-trying-to-live-to-100\">the next 39 years of my life</a> could look like. But whatever age you are, mobility should matter to you because it helps you to have fun. If you play tennis (there\u2019s no accounting for tastes, and at least it\u2019s not golf), it will help you reach a high ball and smash it back over the net. If you have dogs, it will help you throw a ball for them and pick up their poo. If you want to delight your grandkids with a handstand, it will even help with that.</p>    <p>That\u2019s why Lucy Joslin\u2019s mobility class at the <a href=\"https://www.mission-e1.com/\">Mission</a> movement studio in east London is always fully subscribed, mostly by women and men decades younger than me. \u201cIt\u2019s not very enjoyable,\u201d Joslin admits, \u201cbut I always say it\u2019s like medicine. You just know you\u2019ve got to do it.\u201d</p> <p>I stumbled into Joslin\u2019s class via calisthenics, which she coaches as a member of the <a href=\"https://www.cali-kulture.com/\">Cali Kulture</a> group of instructors. A mix of bodyweight exercises and the kind of moves that you\u2019d usually associate with gymnastics, calisthenics is one of the most enjoyable ways to build muscle if you\u2019re not keen on lifting weights or using the gym. But it makes big demands on your joints.</p> <p>Everyone knows about pull-ups, where you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/04/the-dead-hang-delight-how-this-quick-surprisingly-simple-exercise-can-change-your-life\">hang from a bar</a> then hoist your body up until your chin or chest comes above it; calisthenics includes variations like the muscle-up, where you add in a push-up and just <em>keep going</em> until your hips are level with the bar. Or there\u2019s the back lever, which starts with you grasping some gymnastic rings, adds a back flip and ends with you hanging face down from the rings, arms twisted behind you, body in a plank parallel to the ground. Even basic calisthenics moves are hard: after months of daily exercises, I can just about manage one pull-up or half a back lever.</p> <p>Having taken one of Joslin\u2019s mobility classes, I can confirm that it\u2019s not very enjoyable. There\u2019s a lot of squatting, a lot of pushing hard against things, a lot of tensing muscles that are crying out for a rest. During my class, there was also a lot of groaning, not all of it from me. But I left it feeling just a little bit freer in my movements, a little more in control of my body. I\u2019d do it again, dreading it a little but also kind of loving it.</p> <p>In the meantime, here\u2019s Joslin\u2019s 10-part routine to stretch and strengthen hips, hamstrings, quads, chest, hip flexors, shoulders and lower back.</p> <h2>Use it or lose it: 10 moves to keep you mobile</h2> <p>Because mobility is all about end-of-range strength, these exercises are hard work and fatiguing. The full set should take about 30 mins to complete, but you can break it up if needed.</p> <p><strong>1. Hips and hamstrings</strong></p>    <p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes turned to about 11 and 1. Squat down as far as you can comfortably go, keeping your torso as upright as possible. If you\u2019re struggling to go deep, raise each heel an inch or two by resting it on an ankle weight, a book or something similar. Bend forward to place your palms flat on the floor in front of you. Keeping your palms down, rotate your feet inwards so they are facing forwards and straighten your legs fully, sticking your bottom out to keep your back as flat as possible. You will feel a stretch in your hamstrings. (If you struggle to get your palms down to the ground, or to keep them there, place each hand on a yoga block or a dictionary.) Do this 10 times.</p> <p><strong>2. Hip flexors 1 (extension)</strong></p>    <p>Kneel on something padded, like a folded towel or yoga mat. Take a big step forward with one leg so you\u2019re in a lunge position. Keeping your torso upright, tuck your bottom under you, then sink your hips forward and down to stretch the rear leg\u2019s hip flexor (the muscles at the very top and front of your thigh). To build strength as well as flexibility, place two yoga blocks on end either side of your front leg. Use your hands to push up from them and lift the rear knee two or three inches off the ground. Then the difficult bit: raise both hands off the blocks and hold the position for five seconds. (If you can\u2019t manage this, maybe because you\u2019re wobbling, keep just your fingertips on the blocks, or even just one fingertip per block.) Do this twice for each leg.</p> <p><strong>3. Hip flexors 2 (flexion)</strong></p>    <p>Sit on the floor, legs wide, but not uncomfortably so. Place a block or a book on the inside of each ankle. Trying not to lean back too much, put your hands down in front of you, so that your splayed fingertips are taking just a little of your weight. Keep your legs straight and lift both feet up and over the blocks, before lowering so they just touch on the floor inside them. Immediately lift them up and over again, back to the starting position. This may be <em>extremely</em> hard. To make it easier, lean back, put your hands down either side of just one leg and lift just that foot up, over the block and back again. Then repeat on the other side. However you do it, repeat until each foot has moved up, over and back again 10 times. If you\u2019re doing this correctly, you\u2019ll feel it in your hip flexors rather than your quads. If necessary, lean a little further back.</p> <p><strong>4. Shoulders/hips/chest</strong></p>    <p>Sit on the floor, legs straight out in front of you. Place your palms down on the floor next to your hips. Straighten your arms to lift your bum off the floor then swing your hips back so your feet slide towards you and your bum pushes up and out behind you. (If you struggle to get enough height, place a block or book beside each hip and push up from this.) Hold for 10 seconds.</p>    <p>Keeping your bum in the air, bend your knees to put the soles of your feet on the floor and raise your hips and knees to the ceiling, pushing your chest and neck back so you end up in a reverse <a href=\"https://www.yogabasics.com/asana/crab-pose/\">table top position</a>. Hold for 10 seconds. Return to the previous position and hold for another 10 seconds. You can make this harder by trying to lift one leg off the floor for five seconds, and then the other \u2013 but be sure to keep them straight.</p> <p><strong>5. Upper arms and chest</strong></p>    <p>Kneel or stand in front of a table or window sill, with both elbows resting near the edge, shoulder-width apart. Step or shuffle backwards until your back is flat and your hips are directly above your knees. Control your ribs so they don\u2019t splay. Clasp your hands together, still reaching up towards the ceiling (to make this more challenging, hold a block, book or broomstick). Now pull your shoulder blades apart and drive your chest towards the ground. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat.</p> <p><strong>6. Shoulders 1</strong></p>    <p>Lie on your belly, feet shoulder-width apart, with the tops pressing into the floor. Pull your belly in and tuck your bum under to tighten your core. Stretch your arms straight out in front of you, with your hands grasping a broomstick (or similar) a little more than shoulder-width apart. Make your arms and body as long as you can. Pull your shoulder blades apart but keep reaching forward. Keeping your chin or forehead and your chest on the ground, raise the stick as high as you can \u2013 this will probably be less than 6in/15cm. Hold for 15 seconds. Then draw the stick down your back behind your head as far as you can (keeping chest and forehead on the floor) and hold for 15 seconds. Repeat, covering both positions.</p> <p><strong>7. Shoulders 2</strong></p>    <p>Lie on your belly, feet apart and with your arms out in cactus position (stretched out to the sides, then bent at the elbow), so your forearms are facing forward and your palms are down. Place a block under each elbow. Hold a light weight (1kg or so) in each hand. Without moving your shoulders, slowly raise and lower the weights 10 times. Repeat three times. You can also do this one arm at a time.</p> <p><strong>8. Side body stretch</strong></p>    <p>This one\u2019s actually enjoyable. Lie on your back, arms stretched out to form a T shape, and your legs together, knees bent so your soles are flat on the floor. Then cross the right leg over the left (mid-thigh). Keeping the legs glued together, roll them over to the left, keeping the opposite arm stretched out and as close to the ground as possible. Hold for 30 seconds. You should feel a stretch down the right side of your body. Return to centre, cross the left leg over the right, and repeat to the right side.</p> <p><strong>9. Lower back</strong></p>    <p>Lie on your belly, with something like a rolled yoga mat or a cushion under your pelvis and your arms in push-up position. Push your shoulders up till your arms are straight, keeping your chest and head upright. If you\u2019re into yoga, this is a lot like cobra pose.</p> <p><strong>10. Thoracic chair twist</strong></p>    <p>Sit on a chair or stool, feet and knees hip-width apart, with a right angle at the ankle, knee and hip. Place the back of the left hand on the outside of the right knee, and the right hand on the back of the chair or stool. Sit as upright as possible, with the shoulders away from the ears. Keeping the knees where they are, turn your navel, ribs, chest and finally head to the right, as if you are wringing out a sponge \u2013 pushing with the left hand and pulling with the right. Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side.</p>",

This may be extremely hard. To make it easier, lean back, put your hands down either side of just one leg and lift just that foot up, over the block and back again. Then repeat on the other side. However you do it, repeat until each foot has moved up, over and back again 10 times. If you\u2019re doing this correctly, you\u2019ll feel it in your hip flexors rather than your quads. If necessary, lean a little further back. 4. Shoulders/hips/chest Sit on the floor, legs straight out in front of you. Place your palms down on the floor next to your hips. Straighten your arms to lift your bum off the floor then swing your hips back so your feet slide towards you and your bum pushes up and out behind you. (If you struggle to get enough height, place a block or book beside each hip and push up from this.) Hold for 10 seconds. Keeping your bum in the air, bend your knees to put the soles of your feet on the floor and raise your hips and knees to the ceiling, pushing your chest and neck back so you end up in a reverse table top position. Hold for 10 seconds. Return to the previous position and hold for another 10 seconds. You can make this harder by trying to lift one leg off the floor for five seconds, and then the other \u2013 but be sure to keep them straight. 5. Upper arms and chest Kneel or stand in front of a table or window sill, with both elbows resting near the edge, shoulder-width apart. Step or shuffle backwards until your back is flat and your hips are directly above your knees. Control your ribs so they don\u2019t splay. Clasp your hands together, still reaching up towards the ceiling (to make this more challenging, hold a block, book or broomstick). Now pull your shoulder blades apart and drive your chest towards the ground. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat. 6. Shoulders 1 Lie on your belly, feet shoulder-width apart, with the tops pressing into the floor. Pull your belly in and tuck your bum under to tighten your core. Stretch your arms straight out in front of you, with your hands grasping a broomstick (or similar) a little more than shoulder-width apart. Make your arms and body as long as you can. Pull your shoulder blades apart but keep reaching forward. Keeping your chin or forehead and your chest on the ground, raise the stick as high as you can \u2013 this will probably be less than 6in/15cm. Hold for 15 seconds. Then draw the stick down your back behind your head as far as you can (keeping chest and forehead on the floor) and hold for 15 seconds. Repeat, covering both positions. 7. Shoulders 2 Lie on your belly, feet apart and with your arms out in cactus position (stretched out to the sides, then bent at the elbow), so your forearms are facing forward and your palms are down. Place a block under each elbow. Hold a light weight (1kg or so) in each hand. Without moving your shoulders, slowly raise and lower the weights 10 times. Repeat three times. You can also do this one arm at a time. 8. Side body stretch This one\u2019s actually enjoyable. Lie on your back, arms stretched out to form a T shape, and your legs together, knees bent so your soles are flat on the floor. Then cross the right leg over the left (mid-thigh). Keeping the legs glued together, roll them over to the left, keeping the opposite arm stretched out and as close to the ground as possible. Hold for 30 seconds. You should feel a stretch down the right side of your body. Return to centre, cross the left leg over the right, and repeat to the right side. 9. Lower back Lie on your belly, with something like a rolled yoga mat or a cushion under your pelvis and your arms in push-up position. Push your shoulders up till your arms are straight, keeping your chest and head upright. If you\u2019re into yoga, this is a lot like cobra pose. 10. Thoracic chair twist Sit on a chair or stool, feet and knees hip-width apart, with a right angle at the ankle, knee and hip. Place the back of the left hand on the outside of the right knee, and the right hand on the back of the chair or stool. Sit as upright as possible, with the shoulders away from the ears. Keeping the knees where they are, turn your navel, ribs, chest and finally head to the right, as if you are wringing out a sponge \u2013 pushing with the left hand and pulling with the right. Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side.",

      "bodyText": "Clergy abuse survivors and other parties ensnared in the Roman Catholic archdiocese of New Orleans\u2019 expensive and lengthy bankruptcy reorganization are concerned after a nationally recognized business-turnaround expert brought on to assist with resolving the unusually contentious proceeding had some of his actions questioned in an unrelated case. Judge Meredith Grabill\u2019s chosen expert, Mohsin \u201cMo\u201d Meghji, was recently the subject of a Wall Street Journal investigation that examined ethical concerns over some of his maneuvering in a pharmaceutical company\u2019s high-stakes bankruptcy reorganization. None of the clergy abuse claimants \u2013 who have spent years fighting for compensation \u2013 or their supporters wanted to speak on the record about the Journal\u2019s investigation into Meghji for fear of troubling Grabill after their side and the church each presented to the judge competing settlement plans that are hundreds of millions of dollars apart. However, one prominent bankruptcy attorney who is not involved in either the New Orleans church case or the pharmaceutical matter \u2013 Ken Rosen \u2013 analyzed Meghji\u2019s reported actions at the request of the Guardian, and he acknowledged what the Journal documented was \u201cimproper behavior\u201d. The Journal\u2019s investigation found the New York City-based Meghji hosted a ritzy party for two bankruptcy judges who later oversaw the chapter 11 reorganization of Sorrento Therapeutics. Meghji subsequently took a job with Sorrento and helped steer the drugmaker\u2019s reorganization to the judges\u2019 dockets. In fact, one of the two judges, David Jones, authorized a loan worth tens of millions of dollars that Meghji\u2019s M3 Partners said would be needed to pay its employees and professional advisers, though Sorrento and its shareholders had objected. Court filings reviewed by the Guardian show Meghji earned up to $225,000 monthly in his role with Sorrento, a billion-dollar company that ended up essentially being dismantled at the conclusion of its bankruptcy. Jones, coincidentally, consulted with Grabill before she decided to remove four clergy abuse victims from a committee representing the interests of survivors involved in the New Orleans archdiocesan bankruptcy after their attorney alerted a local Catholic high school that a priest stationed there had admitted molesting a teenage girl during a previous assignment. It is not clear if Grabill at all solicited Jones\u2019s input before appointing Meghji to the New Orleans archdiocese\u2019s bankruptcy on 21 August. Neither she nor Meghji responded to a request for comment. Nonetheless, the involvement of Meghji and that of Jones in the Journal\u2019s story on Sorrento was enough to make one clergy abuse attorney say he was \u201cnot happy to read these reports\u201d. \u201cIt is disturbing this is how things work in our legal system,\u201d said that attorney, whose clients were not involved in the committee removals ordered by Grabill. Grabill brought Meghji, M3 and the Latham &amp; Watkins national law firm with which they frequently collaborate into the archdiocesan bankruptcy to find out the viability of two competing reorganization plans being promised by the church and those to whom it is indebted, among them 500 survivors of clergy sexual abuse. She also directed them to review $40m in costs already incurred in the bankruptcy since its filing in 2020 \u2013 when the church estimated it could resolve the matter for about $7.5m \u2013 as well as to determine whether the archdiocese has the \u201cfinancial wherewithal\u201d to reorganize its books. The judge arrived at that choice after some of the abuse survivors urged the court to appoint a trustee to strip away control of archdiocesan finances from the archbishop, Gregory Aymond, a move the archdiocese is resisting by arguing that to do so would be a violation of the separation of church and state embedded in the US constitution. That plea came after the Guardian and WWL Louisiana reported exclusively that Aymond\u2019s designee in charge of the bankruptcy, Lee Eagan, testified in a series of legal depositions that he had no relevant expertise for his role and had been suffering mental impairment from a 2022 car crash. Eagan also described doing things to purposely impede negotiations aimed at striking a settlement with clergy abuse survivors and other creditors. At a hearing prior to Meghji\u2019s appointment, Grabill predicted that bringing a turnaround expert on board would \u201cinstill confidence\u201d in the integrity of the case. An attorney for the archdiocese\u2019s affiliates \u2013 including local Catholic schools \u2013 expressed reluctance, asking whether the consultant in effect would be paid handsomely to complete tasks Grabill should carry out. Grabill responded to those remarks with a rebuke, sarcastically calling it \u201crich\u201d that the church was suddenly concerned with the cost of the bankruptcy. The judge hasn\u2019t ruled on whether to remove financial control of the archdiocese from Aymond. \u2018We got a special relationship\u2019 The Journal report recounted how Meghji \u201cprofessionally and personally\u201d knew Jones. Not only had Meghji and his M3 Partners worked on some of the bankruptcies overseen by Jones in Houston\u2019s bankruptcy court, but the Journal also reported how, in April 2022, they distributed invitations to \u201ca private soiree at the swanky New York restaurant Le Bernardin\u201d, touting Jones and his colleague on the Houston bankruptcy court bench, Christopher Lopez, as guests of honor. Meghji and his associates then hosted Jones, Lopez and the party in their honor at the restaurant, which has previously advertised a chef\u2019s tasting menu with wine pairings at $282 per person. Rosen said Meghji\u2019s use of the invitation was ethically improper. \u201cWhat Mo Meghji did was he was announcing to the world, \u2018Hey, if you got a case in Texas, we\u2019re the restructuring people that you should be talking to, because we got a special relationship with these two judges,\u2019\u201d he said. Rosen \u2013 the author of a Bloomberg article on how lawyers can ethically network with bankruptcy judges \u2013 contended it would also be improper for Jones and Lopez to have given Meghji permission to use their names as he did. But Rosen said it was unclear whether the judges had done that. Meghji\u2019s familiarity with Jones came into play when, amid financial and legal distress, the San Diego-based Sorrento decided to file for bankruptcy in February 2023. As its chief restructuring officer, Meghji joined other advisers in telling Sorrento to file for bankruptcy in Houston, even though the company had never done business there. The primary reason was that Jones had a reputation of favoring law firms representing bankrupt corporations in his court, the Journal reported. A shell company belonging to Sorrento then rented a Houston mailbox and also opened a local bank account to be able to file for bankruptcy in the Texas city as well as end up in front of Jones.

The implicated attorney, Elizabeth Freeman, was a partner for the Jackson Walker law firm, which Sorrento had hired, too. Sorrento\u2019s bankruptcy was reassigned to Lopez. And the drugmaker \u2013 which entered its bankruptcy with a reported $1bn in assets \u2013 was all but disassembled. Lopez shot down attempts by Sorrento\u2019\u2019s shareholders to investigate Freeman. Then he refused to dismiss Sorrento\u2019s bankruptcy, concluding that the drugmaker got its case to Houston as a result of resourceful legal jockeying rather than fraud, the Wall Street Journal noted. The judge reached that conclusion after Meghji and Latham\u2019s lead lawyer on the case each provided sworn statements that they denied knowing of Jones and Freeman\u2019s affair before it erupted into public view in October 2023. \u2018Screwed once again?\u2019 Some of the names at the center of Sorrento\u2019s bankruptcy saga bring discomfort to those who are owed by the bankrupt New Orleans archdiocese. For one, Grabill has agreed to pay Meghji, M3 Partners and Latham &amp; Watkins up to $350,000 for two months of work \u2013 $100,000 of which has already been paid out. Grabill defended her decision by saying she was willing to spend \u201ca little\u201d more of the archdiocese\u2019s money, out of which would come a settlement for clergy abuse survivors, because she believed in \u201cthe value\u201d of having someone like Meghji weigh whether there would be more than a \u201ccarcass\u201d to divvy up at the end of the church\u2019s bankruptcy. Grabill selected Meghji after rejecting a proposal for the same job from a New Orleans-area business turnaround expert named Vincent Liuzza. Liuzza admitted to Grabill in court that his godson was a Catholic priest within the New Orleans archdiocese. And Grabill said she was opting to hire someone else because she needed to bring in someone without ties to the local community or the Catholic church. Though the judge didn\u2019t explicitly mention it, one of Meghji\u2019s top search results on Google is a May 2023 news release recounting how a family trust that he helms made a $1m donation to establish a Shia Islam studies professorship at Florida International University. Yet Jones\u2019s association to Meghji leaves it unclear how much of an outsider the latter man truly is. Jones had a role in one of the more controversial rulings Grabill made during the bankruptcy, to the detriment of a group of abuse survivors whose attorney has been one of the church\u2019s most strident critics. That attorney, Richard Trahant, advised the principal of a Catholic high school in New Orleans \u2013 who happened to be his cousin \u2013 that its chaplain had a substantial stain in his past. As would later be revealed by the news media, yet not by Trahant because of a confidentiality order governing many records pertaining to the church bankruptcy, the chaplain had admitted molesting a 17-year-old girl in the 1990s. But, citing technicalities in church law which set the age of adulthood at 16 at the time of the abuse, the archdiocese largely spared the chaplain from punishment. Aymond, as the archbishop of New Orleans, later stationed the clergyman at Trahant\u2019s cousin\u2019s school. Grabill ordered an investigation into how the information had made news headlines despite having been in sealed bankruptcy records. And though Trahant at one point testified \u2013 without contradiction \u2013 that the investigation failed to blame him for knowingly or willfully violating the bankruptcy\u2019s confidentiality order, Grabill fined him $400,000, a sanction the lawyer has since been trying to overturn on appeal. Furthermore, Grabill expelled four clergy abuse claimants represented by Trahant and two of his co-counsels from being involved with a committee advocating on behalf of molestation victims\u2019 interests in the church bankruptcy. Many legal commentators \u2013 including several who won\u2019t speak publicly to avoid possibly upsetting Grabill and then drawing a case in front of her \u2013 regarded those punishments as highly unusual. A publicly available transcript of a status conference held by Grabill before she handed down the sanctions shows she first consulted with two judges. One of them, she said, was Jones. The archdiocese didn\u2019t comment when sent a copy of the Journal\u2019s article on Meghji. But another party in the church reorganization said: \u201cAfter reading of the Sorrento bankruptcy \u2026 and seeing many of the same players now involved with the New Orleans archdiocese bankruptcy, isn\u2019t it reasonable to be anxious that survivors may be screwed once again?\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 October 2024 because the loan worth tens of millions of dollars that one of the two judges, David Jones, authorized was not to Mohsin Meghji\u2019s M3 Partners as an earlier version said.",

      "body": "<p>It was only meant to be for a year. The restaurant was my husband Avi\u2019s dream, not mine. As a time-poor novelist and mother of three, the very last thing I needed was another commitment to take me away from my desk. But I also knew that my comfortable London life as a freelance writer and stay-at-home mother was only possible because Avi was our family\u2019s main bread winner. So when, in 2006, he was made redundant from his detested job in IT, I felt I owed it to him to help make his dream a reality.</p> <p>It was the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/anthony-bourdain\">Anthony Bourdain</a> who declared that the desire to be a restaurateur was \u201ca strange and terrible affliction\u201d, but it was one which I, thankfully, had been spared. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I liked restaurants as much as the next foodie and I could appreciate the provocative plainness and simplicity of Italian cuisine, which left the dishonest cook nowhere to hide. But I was also a child of the 70s and had been brought up in London by a restless Tuscan mother who not only didn\u2019t cook, but who believed the very worst fate that could befall a woman was to be tied to the stove. As a result, we didn\u2019t eat especially well when I was growing up and it was only when I moved to Rome in my 20s and met Avi that I started to understand the beauty and transcendence of sitting around a table.</p> <p>\u201cWhy go to all that trouble just for family?\u201d I used to think as I watched the food emerging from the tiny galley kitchen overlooking the courtyard. What could there be left to say after years of breaking bread among the same familiar faces? And yet meals at my future mother-in-law Ida\u2019s house \u2013 even a simple midweek lunch \u2013 always felt like an event. The conversation never seemed to flag and there was a palpable moment of excitement as each dish was placed on the table: vincisgrassi, the lasagne of the Marche, which took an entire day to prepare; stock fish cooked <em>in umido </em>with tomatoes and potatoes; a bag of yellow Ravenna cherries from the market in a chipped majolica bowl.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The women of the family I married into spoke \u2018food\u2019 as though it were a real language</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The women of the family I married into spoke food as though it were a real language, showing their love for each other through the dishes they cooked. We wanted to channel something of that spirit in the restaurant we named after Avi\u2019s mother, even though, ironically, she disliked \u2013 and even distrusted \u2013 food prepared outside the home. There were few things Ida Zanni couldn\u2019t produce to restaurant standard, while her copy of<em> Il </em><em>Talismano Della </em><em>Felicit\u00e0 </em>(The Talisman of Happiness),<em> </em>the 1,000-page tome of recipes by Ada Boni which was given to all new brides, and which we now have, was well-thumbed and spattered with stains.</p> <p>After the war, Ida was reunited with her fianc\u00e9, an \u00e9migr\u00e9 Jewish doctor, Bernardo Reichenbach, whom she hadn\u2019t seen since 1939 when he had been deported back to Poland as a consequence of Mussolini\u2019s racial laws. The couple eventually emigrated to Israel, where I like to imagine that, homesick for Italy, the tagliatelle she rolled every day on her kitchen table in Haifa were a link to the little hilltop town of Cupramontana she\u2019d left behind. Nostalgia is hard-wired into our restaurant\u2019s DNA: Avi, her son, was an exile twice over when we opened our doors in spring 2007.</p> <p>We were piteously unprepared for what awaited us. The reality of serving 50 people in one evening, the knowledge that a single mistake \u2013 the wrong timings on a baked sea bass, a crema pasticcera that had split, a table waiting too long for their mains \u2013 would tarnish our reputation in the neighbourhood like a stain. London was a city where, I was told, 19 out of 20 food businesses folded in the first year; with no experience whatsoever in hospitality, we would have to learn on the job.</p> <p>Bug-eyed with tiredness, home and family life began to feel like yet another arena of conflict. Cortisol and adrenaline pulsed through our veins as Avi and I barked instructions at each other about packed lunches and after-school clubs, while our three children, who until then had been the lights of our lives and the centre of our world, started to feel like yet another logistical problem that needed managing.</p> <p>Yet, as the months passed, we all started to grow accustomed to this strange, people-filled new life. Ida began to feel like a second home to all of us and the children would often drop by for an early supper with their father. My mother, Ornella, looked after them for a few evenings a week, while to my surprise I discovered that in some ways running Ida was actually enriching my life as a writer. Being a restaurateur was like being a London cab driver: you never knew who would walk through your door. Looking around the candle-lit dining room, I would overhear snatches of conversation and my imagination would go into overdrive, trying to work out whether the couple in the corner were married or lovers, whether the quiet girl in a group knew that the others were talking over her, or if the man who insisted on ordering for his date was overcompensating for something.</p> <p>In hindsight, Ida\u2019s success came too early for us. We were full every night, which meant we rarely had a free moment to take stock or plan ahead, and sometimes when I saw groups of well-dressed diners ambling up Kilburn Lane towards our doors, I felt so overwhelmed I would mutter under my breath: \u201cDon\u2019t you lot have homes to go to?\u201d<em> </em>We struggled with managing chefs, some of whom took advantage of our inexperience to run rings around us, which meant that when the 2008 recession struck, we found ourselves woefully unprepared. Almost overnight, it seemed, bookings fell off a cliff. People started to cut back on eating out, while the restaurants that continued to do well were those that offered customers real value for money. In contrast, Ida felt down-at-heel and unloved, and some nights we didn\u2019t have a single booking. Haemorrhaging money just to cover our overheads, we started talking seriously about locking the door and posting the keys through the letterbox.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My involvement in Ida was only to have been for a year, yet when the recession struck, I was in too deep to walk away</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My involvement in Ida was only ever meant to have been for a year, yet when the recession struck, I was in too deep to walk away. It wasn\u2019t just pride or stubbornness; I genuinely believed that there was something in our restaurant worth saving. We hadn\u2019t always got things right and nobody could have foreseen a global downturn that decimated far more established restaurants than ours, but I had a feeling that if we paid off our debts and started over, with Avi back in the kitchen and me full-time as front of house, we could turn things around.</p> <p>If ever we needed affirmation that we made the right decision, the 2020 pandemic showed us the true communality of a neighbourhood restaurant. Almost at once, we partnered up with a local charity and began producing hot meals for shielding and vulnerable residents, which were delivered by volunteers, many of whom were Ida customers. A pay-it-forward crowdfunder raised an astonishing \u00a326,000 in 72 hours, which allowed us to keep going throughout all the various lockdowns, while our wonderful customers continued to drop by our Sunday markets and buy working-from-home lunches from our hole-in-the wall deli.</p> <p><em>Ida at My Table </em>was originally conceived as a cookbook, accompanied by charming vignettes about Ida\u2019s life in Cupramontana. But I knew that there was another story to be told. A conventional cookbook could never do justice to the journey we\u2019d been on as a family. Nor would it explain the strange liminal place I inhabited as a restaurateur who didn\u2019t cook herself. Who lived in the shadow of a woman whose presence, like a hologram, was everywhere. \u201cI didn\u2019t come all the way to London to make grandma food,\u201d one new chef grumbled when he was presented with a folder of Ida\u2019s recipes.</p> <p>Opening a restaurant may have taken me away from my desk, but it also filled our lives with colour and wonder. Our world became bigger, more outward-facing, while in a fast-paced capital city, we have somehow managed to put down roots. During the really hard times, our children begged us not to sell Ida; they grew up within those four walls and, while both the recession and the pandemic had been difficult for them, their energy and enthusiasm gave the restaurant a new lease of life. Today, all three are clear-eyed problem-solvers, nimble on their feet and sanguine about the twists and turns life can take. I wonder what their grandmother, Ida, would have made of it all. I hope she would have been glad.</p> <p><em>Ida at My Table: A Story of Food, Family and Finding Home by Simonetta Wenkert is published by Bedford Square at \u00a320, or \u00a318 from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/ida-at-my-table-9781835011096/\">guardianbookshop.com</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "It was only meant to be for a year. The restaurant was my husband Avi\u2019s dream, not mine. As a time-poor novelist and mother of three, the very last thing I needed was another commitment to take me away from my desk. But I also knew that my comfortable London life as a freelance writer and stay-at-home mother was only possible because Avi was our family\u2019s main bread winner. So when, in 2006, he was made redundant from his detested job in IT, I felt I owed it to him to help make his dream a reality. It was the late Anthony Bourdain who declared that the desire to be a restaurateur was \u201ca strange and terrible affliction\u201d, but it was one which I, thankfully, had been spared. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I liked restaurants as much as the next foodie and I could appreciate the provocative plainness and simplicity of Italian cuisine, which left the dishonest cook nowhere to hide. But I was also a child of the 70s and had been brought up in London by a restless Tuscan mother who not only didn\u2019t cook, but who believed the very worst fate that could befall a woman was to be tied to the stove. As a result, we didn\u2019t eat especially well when I was growing up and it was only when I moved to Rome in my 20s and met Avi that I started to understand the beauty and transcendence of sitting around a table. \u201cWhy go to all that trouble just for family?\u201d I used to think as I watched the food emerging from the tiny galley kitchen overlooking the courtyard. What could there be left to say after years of breaking bread among the same familiar faces? And yet meals at my future mother-in-law Ida\u2019s house \u2013 even a simple midweek lunch \u2013 always felt like an event. The conversation never seemed to flag and there was a palpable moment of excitement as each dish was placed on the table: vincisgrassi, the lasagne of the Marche, which took an entire day to prepare; stock fish cooked in umido with tomatoes and potatoes; a bag of yellow Ravenna cherries from the market in a chipped majolica bowl. The women of the family I married into spoke food as though it were a real language, showing their love for each other through the dishes they cooked. We wanted to channel something of that spirit in the restaurant we named after Avi\u2019s mother, even though, ironically, she disliked \u2013 and even distrusted \u2013 food prepared outside the home. There were few things Ida Zanni couldn\u2019t produce to restaurant standard, while her copy of Il Talismano Della Felicit\u00e0 (The Talisman of Happiness), the 1,000-page tome of recipes by Ada Boni which was given to all new brides, and which we now have, was well-thumbed and spattered with stains. After the war, Ida was reunited with her fianc\u00e9, an \u00e9migr\u00e9 Jewish doctor, Bernardo Reichenbach, whom she hadn\u2019t seen since 1939 when he had been deported back to Poland as a consequence of Mussolini\u2019s racial laws. The couple eventually emigrated to Israel, where I like to imagine that, homesick for Italy, the tagliatelle she rolled every day on her kitchen table in Haifa were a link to the little hilltop town of Cupramontana she\u2019d left behind. Nostalgia is hard-wired into our restaurant\u2019s DNA: Avi, her son, was an exile twice over when we opened our doors in spring 2007. We were piteously unprepared for what awaited us. The reality of serving 50 people in one evening, the knowledge that a single mistake \u2013 the wrong timings on a baked sea bass, a crema pasticcera that had split, a table waiting too long for their mains \u2013 would tarnish our reputation in the neighbourhood like a stain. London was a city where, I was told, 19 out of 20 food businesses folded in the first year; with no experience whatsoever in hospitality, we would have to learn on the job. Bug-eyed with tiredness, home and family life began to feel like yet another arena of conflict. Cortisol and adrenaline pulsed through our veins as Avi and I barked instructions at each other about packed lunches and after-school clubs, while our three children, who until then had been the lights of our lives and the centre of our world, started to feel like yet another logistical problem that needed managing. Yet, as the months passed, we all started to grow accustomed to this strange, people-filled new life. Ida began to feel like a second home to all of us and the children would often drop by for an early supper with their father. My mother, Ornella, looked after them for a few evenings a week, while to my surprise I discovered that in some ways running Ida was actually enriching my life as a writer. Being a restaurateur was like being a London cab driver: you never knew who would walk through your door. Looking around the candle-lit dining room, I would overhear snatches of conversation and my imagination would go into overdrive, trying to work out whether the couple in the corner were married or lovers, whether the quiet girl in a group knew that the others were talking over her, or if the man who insisted on ordering for his date was overcompensating for something. In hindsight, Ida\u2019s success came too early for us. We were full every night, which meant we rarely had a free moment to take stock or plan ahead, and sometimes when I saw groups of well-dressed diners ambling up Kilburn Lane towards our doors, I felt so overwhelmed I would mutter under my breath: \u201cDon\u2019t you lot have homes to go to?\u201d We struggled with managing chefs, some of whom took advantage of our inexperience to run rings around us, which meant that when the 2008 recession struck, we found ourselves woefully unprepared. Almost overnight, it seemed, bookings fell off a cliff. People started to cut back on eating out, while the restaurants that continued to do well were those that offered customers real value for money. In contrast, Ida felt down-at-heel and unloved, and some nights we didn\u2019t have a single booking. Haemorrhaging money just to cover our overheads, we started talking seriously about locking the door and posting the keys through the letterbox. My involvement in Ida was only ever meant to have been for a year, yet when the recession struck, I was in too deep to walk away. It wasn\u2019t just pride or stubbornness; I genuinely believed that there was something in our restaurant worth saving. We hadn\u2019t always got things right and nobody could have foreseen a global downturn that decimated far more established restaurants than ours, but I had a feeling that if we paid off our debts and started over, with Avi back in the kitchen and me full-time as front of house, we could turn things around. If ever we needed affirmation that we made the right decision, the 2020 pandemic showed us the true communality of a neighbourhood restaurant. Almost at once, we partnered up with a local charity and began producing hot meals for shielding and vulnerable residents, which were delivered by volunteers, many of whom were Ida customers. A pay-it-forward crowdfunder raised an astonishing \u00a326,000 in 72 hours, which allowed us to keep going throughout all the various lockdowns, while our wonderful customers continued to drop by our Sunday markets and buy working-from-home lunches from our hole-in-the wall deli. Ida at My Table was originally conceived as a cookbook, accompanied by charming vignettes about Ida\u2019s life in Cupramontana. But I knew that there was another story to be told. A conventional cookbook could never do justice to the journey we\u2019d been on as a family. Nor would it explain the strange liminal place I inhabited as a restaurateur who didn\u2019t cook herself. Who lived in the shadow of a woman whose presence, like a hologram, was everywhere. \u201cI didn\u2019t come all the way to London to make grandma food,\u201d one new chef grumbled when he was presented with a folder of Ida\u2019s recipes. Opening a restaurant may have taken me away from my desk, but it also filled our lives with colour and wonder. Our world became bigger, more outward-facing, while in a fast-paced capital city, we have somehow managed to put down roots. During the really hard times, our children begged us not to sell Ida; they grew up within those four walls and, while both the recession and the pandemic had been difficult for them, their energy and enthusiasm gave the restaurant a new lease of life. Today, all three are clear-eyed problem-solvers, nimble on their feet and sanguine about the twists and turns life can take. I wonder what their grandmother, Ida, would have made of it all. I hope she would have been glad. Ida at My Table: A Story of Food, Family and Finding Home by Simonetta Wenkert is published by Bedford Square at \u00a320, or \u00a318 from guardianbookshop.com",

Up until that point, four months into the war, none of his relatives had died. And his parents, who remained behind, had managed to stay alive.

Since 7 October, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker\">more than 42,000 Palestinian people</a> have been killed. At least 96,000 have been injured, with more than 22,500 people sustaining \u201clife-changing injuries\u201d, including amputations and traumatic brain injuries, <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154241\">according to the United Nations</a>.</p> \n<p>Abusalim spoke plainly about the war that killed his father and so many of his neighbors and friends, and the airstrikes that have flattened his home town of Deir al Balah, a quaint, farming town in the Gaza Strip. He sometimes tilted towards dry humor as he recounted the past year. At other moments, he spoke with shock and frustration, expressing genuine alarm<strong> </strong>about how the war continues a year later with no end in sight.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I think of October 7 this year,\u201d Abusalim said, sighing deeply, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to wrap my head around how it is still happening.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018This stuff breaks people\u2019</h2> \n<p>Abusalim is not a \u201ccrier\u201d, he said. He hasn\u2019t joined a traditional grief group or sought out counseling. He\u2019s had spurts of \u201ccathartic\u201d journaling, but his preferred way of processing grief has been action.</p> \n<p>\u201cPart of my grieving has been my big mouth and loud advocacy,\u201d he said. Abusalim speaks on educational panels and <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/palestinian-living-in-u-s-describes-struggle-to-contact-family-in-gaza\">to reporters</a> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67096634\">about</a> the <a href=\"https://x.com/kaitlancollins/status/1717003773451592118\">war</a>. He\u2019s lobbied congressional staff to push for a ceasefire resolution. \u201cI\u2019m doing the best that I can,\u201d he said, \u201cor the least that I can, by talking about what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> \n<p>Abusalim and other Palestinians in the Washington metropolitian area have also testified to DC\u2019s local council, sharing their personal experiences. And if there\u2019s a protest happening, they\u2019ll go together.</p> \n<p>His friendships with other local Palestinians and Arabs pre-date the war, he said, but have gotten stronger over the past year. \u201cIt\u2019s reassuring, reinforcing and helpful that we\u2019re not alone in this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that there is a lot of work ahead, and that\u2019s precisely why our lives have to keep going.\u201d</p> \n<p>Abusalim\u2019s family is at once a bedrock of support and a reminder of the ongoing anguish in Gaza. When he speaks to relatives in Palestine, he tries to take their minds off the war around them. But many are preoccupied, as the country contends <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/gaza-palestine-israel-blocked-humanitarian-aid-blinken\">with mass starvation</a>. \u201cMy 50-year-old cousin, a grown man, was crying [on the phone] because he can\u2019t provide food and he\u2019s hungry,\u201d Abusalim said. \u201cThis stuff breaks people. It\u2019s really quite evil that it\u2019s happening by design.\u201d</p> \n<p>Every morning, Abusalim FaceTimes with his mother Mudallala, as she was able to evacuate from Gaza to Cairo via the Rafah crossing after her husband\u2019s death. \u201cA nightmare trip\u201d, Mudallala, who is blind, told her son. They catch up while he eats a breakfast of halloumi cheese with thyme and olive oil or hummus and eggs with sumac \u2013 Palestinian cuisine that serves as a \u201clittle reminder of home\u201d for Abusalim.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor the past year,\u201d he said, \u201cour calls have revolved around all the news and the developments and what\u2019s going on.\u201d On Monday, they spoke about Israel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/28/world-of-horrors-families-huddle-on-beiruts-streets-amid-the-bombs\">bombing of Lebanon</a>, which they likened to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/jul/01/lebanon-israel-1982-war-deaths-invasion\">Israel\u2019s invasion of the country</a> in the 1980s. They both are avid viewers of Al Jazeera for updates, piecing together information across a seven-hour time difference.</p> \n<p>Oftentimes, they\u2019ll talk about Sameer. \u201cYou bring up dad, she\u2019ll cry.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018He was older than the state of Israel\u2019</h2> \n<p>Only eight people attended the burial of Sameer Abusalim, mostly complete strangers and Mudallala. Members of the extended family could not travel, Abusalim said, fearing that they would be bombed on the journey over.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was all done very, very quickly,\u201d Abusalim said of the funeral, which happened only hours after Sameer\u2019s death, as opposed to typical Islamic memorial services which take place over multiple days. \u201cDad deserved a whole lot more than that,\u201d Abusalim said. \u201cWe have Israel to thank for messing this up for us.\u201d</p> \n<p>A pillar of his community, Sameer was known for helping squash disputes between neighbors and sponsoring local schools. He was fiercely protective of his family and \u201cvery in love\u201d with his wife, Abusalim said. \u201cOh God, they were so cheesy together,\u201d he said, recalling how Sameer once wrote Mudallala a four-page love letter. The note is one of only two possessions Abusalim has from his father; the other is a simple, gold ring.</p> \n<p>Born in 1943 (\u201cHe was older than the <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/creation-israel#:~:text=On%20May%2014%2C%201948%2C%20David,nation%20on%20the%20same%20day.\">state of Israel</a>,\u201d Abusalim said), Sameer worked as a farmer, growing sprawling rows of olive and orange trees on the family\u2019s land. Later in life, he suffered a series of strokes, leaving him partially paralyzed and reliant on a wheelchair. Well before 7 October, Sameer\u2019s family had to navigate his health conditions as they took shelter from Israeli bombardments. In 2014, the last time that Abusalim was in Gaza, the family house was hit with a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/07/15/israel/palestine-unlawful-israeli-airstrikes-kill-civilians\">\u201croof knock\u201d bomb</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/multimedia/100000002997212/video-shows-israeli-knock-on-the-roof-bombing-tactic-in-gaza.html\">warning missile</a> launched by the Israeli military before a larger strike. Abusalim had minutes to transport his father, mother, two sisters and nephew to safety.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/04/israel-gaza-war-international-law\">\u2018Palestinians are taking the stand\u2019: can legal challenges to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza stop the continuing onslaught? </a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d Abusalim recalled, \u201cand I just freeze for a minute thinking, \u2018If we\u2019re seen fleeing, are they gonna hit the car?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>On 26 December 2023, Abusalim\u2019s family home was bombed again. An airstrike had completely destroyed the doors and windows, this time making the home uninhabitable. The family escaped to a nearby aunt\u2019s house with minor injuries. But Sameer, who had been wounded with shards of glass, wasn\u2019t healing well.</p> \n<p>Less than three weeks later, he was gone.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat haunts me is the fact that I may never be able to visit his grave and pay my respects,\u201d Abusalim said, voicing concern that Israel may attempt to permanently <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/06/israel-occupation-50-years-of-dispossession/\">occupy Gaza</a>. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a day that goes by without me thinking of [his death]. He passed away, paralyzed, a displaced man. The indignity of not dying in your own home, at that age, is just something that pisses me off.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018You go back, but what\u2019s next?\u2019</h2> \n<p>The third of September would have been Sameer\u2019s 81st birthday. \u201cMy sister in Egypt had prepared a cake with a photo of him printed on it,\u201d Abusalim said. \u201cMy family does cheesy things.\u201d</p> \n<p>After his father died, Abusalim traveled to Canada for an informal celebration of Sameer\u2019s life with his siblings. He later traveled to Egypt for a month to be with Mudallala, who now lives with her daughter. \u201cShe\u2019s very, very eager to go back home,\u201d Abusalim said. \u201c[But] our question to Mom has been, \u2018You go back, but what\u2019s next?\u2019 There is no life there.\u201d</p> \n<p>Abusalim also wants to return, nostalgic for the \u201cthe old Gaza, before the days of genocide reduced [it] to rubble\u201d. But within that hope is the reality that the \u201cold Gaza\u201d was still a site of violence because of Israel, he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t normal that we only had eight hours of electricity. It wasn\u2019t normal that we were not allowed an airport or a seaport or freedom of movement. It wasn\u2019t normal that our resources were controlled by others,\u201d he said, calling it the \u201csick strategy of Israeli occupation\u201d.</p> \n<p>But even with his disdain and frustration, he was firm in the knowledge that his people are strong.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf there is anything I know about us Palestinians, [it] is that we\u2019re quite stubborn. We\u2019re going to keep at it until our rights and dignity and sovereignty and independence are achieved.\u201d</p>",

At other moments, he spoke with shock and frustration, expressing genuine alarm about how the war continues a year later with no end in sight. \u201cWhen I think of October 7 this year,\u201d Abusalim said, sighing deeply, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to wrap my head around how it is still happening.\u201d \u2018This stuff breaks people\u2019 Abusalim is not a \u201ccrier\u201d, he said. He hasn\u2019t joined a traditional grief group or sought out counseling. He\u2019s had spurts of \u201ccathartic\u201d journaling, but his preferred way of processing grief has been action. \u201cPart of my grieving has been my big mouth and loud advocacy,\u201d he said. Abusalim speaks on educational panels and to reporters about the war. He\u2019s lobbied congressional staff to push for a ceasefire resolution. \u201cI\u2019m doing the best that I can,\u201d he said, \u201cor the least that I can, by talking about what\u2019s going on.\u201d Abusalim and other Palestinians in the Washington metropolitian area have also testified to DC\u2019s local council, sharing their personal experiences. And if there\u2019s a protest happening, they\u2019ll go together. His friendships with other local Palestinians and Arabs pre-date the war, he said, but have gotten stronger over the past year. \u201cIt\u2019s reassuring, reinforcing and helpful that we\u2019re not alone in this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that there is a lot of work ahead, and that\u2019s precisely why our lives have to keep going.\u201d Abusalim\u2019s family is at once a bedrock of support and a reminder of the ongoing anguish in Gaza. When he speaks to relatives in Palestine, he tries to take their minds off the war around them. But many are preoccupied, as the country contends with mass starvation. \u201cMy 50-year-old cousin, a grown man, was crying [on the phone] because he can\u2019t provide food and he\u2019s hungry,\u201d Abusalim said. \u201cThis stuff breaks people. It\u2019s really quite evil that it\u2019s happening by design.\u201d Every morning, Abusalim FaceTimes with his mother Mudallala, as she was able to evacuate from Gaza to Cairo via the Rafah crossing after her husband\u2019s death. \u201cA nightmare trip\u201d, Mudallala, who is blind, told her son. They catch up while he eats a breakfast of halloumi cheese with thyme and olive oil or hummus and eggs with sumac \u2013 Palestinian cuisine that serves as a \u201clittle reminder of home\u201d for Abusalim. \u201cFor the past year,\u201d he said, \u201cour calls have revolved around all the news and the developments and what\u2019s going on.\u201d On Monday, they spoke about Israel\u2019s bombing of Lebanon, which they likened to Israel\u2019s invasion of the country in the 1980s. They both are avid viewers of Al Jazeera for updates, piecing together information across a seven-hour time difference. Oftentimes, they\u2019ll talk about Sameer. \u201cYou bring up dad, she\u2019ll cry.\u201d \u2018He was older than the state of Israel\u2019 Only eight people attended the burial of Sameer Abusalim, mostly complete strangers and Mudallala. Members of the extended family could not travel, Abusalim said, fearing that they would be bombed on the journey over. \u201cIt was all done very, very quickly,\u201d Abusalim said of the funeral, which happened only hours after Sameer\u2019s death, as opposed to typical Islamic memorial services which take place over multiple days. \u201cDad deserved a whole lot more than that,\u201d Abusalim said. \u201cWe have Israel to thank for messing this up for us.\u201d A pillar of his community, Sameer was known for helping squash disputes between neighbors and sponsoring local schools. He was fiercely protective of his family and \u201cvery in love\u201d with his wife, Abusalim said. \u201cOh God, they were so cheesy together,\u201d he said, recalling how Sameer once wrote Mudallala a four-page love letter. The note is one of only two possessions Abusalim has from his father; the other is a simple, gold ring. Born in 1943 (\u201cHe was older than the state of Israel,\u201d Abusalim said), Sameer worked as a farmer, growing sprawling rows of olive and orange trees on the family\u2019s land. Later in life, he suffered a series of strokes, leaving him partially paralyzed and reliant on a wheelchair. Well before 7 October, Sameer\u2019s family had to navigate his health conditions as they took shelter from Israeli bombardments. In 2014, the last time that Abusalim was in Gaza, the family house was hit with a \u201croof knock\u201d bomb, a warning missile launched by the Israeli military before a larger strike. Abusalim had minutes to transport his father, mother, two sisters and nephew to safety. \u201cI\u2019m in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d Abusalim recalled, \u201cand I just freeze for a minute thinking, \u2018If we\u2019re seen fleeing, are they gonna hit the car?\u2019\u201d On 26 December 2023, Abusalim\u2019s family home was bombed again. An airstrike had completely destroyed the doors and windows, this time making the home uninhabitable. The family escaped to a nearby aunt\u2019s house with minor injuries. But Sameer, who had been wounded with shards of glass, wasn\u2019t healing well. Less than three weeks later, he was gone. \u201cWhat haunts me is the fact that I may never be able to visit his grave and pay my respects,\u201d Abusalim said, voicing concern that Israel may attempt to permanently occupy Gaza. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a day that goes by without me thinking of [his death]. He passed away, paralyzed, a displaced man. The indignity of not dying in your own home, at that age, is just something that pisses me off.\u201d \u2018You go back, but what\u2019s next?\u2019 The third of September would have been Sameer\u2019s 81st birthday. \u201cMy sister in Egypt had prepared a cake with a photo of him printed on it,\u201d Abusalim said. \u201cMy family does cheesy things.\u201d After his father died, Abusalim traveled to Canada for an informal celebration of Sameer\u2019s life with his siblings. He later traveled to Egypt for a month to be with Mudallala, who now lives with her daughter. \u201cShe\u2019s very, very eager to go back home,\u201d Abusalim said. \u201c[But] our question to Mom has been, \u2018You go back, but what\u2019s next?\u2019 There is no life there.\u201d Abusalim also wants to return, nostalgic for the \u201cthe old Gaza, before the days of genocide reduced [it] to rubble\u201d. But within that hope is the reality that the \u201cold Gaza\u201d was still a site of violence because of Israel, he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t normal that we only had eight hours of electricity. It wasn\u2019t normal that we were not allowed an airport or a seaport or freedom of movement. It wasn\u2019t normal that our resources were controlled by others,\u201d he said, calling it the \u201csick strategy of Israeli occupation\u201d. But even with his disdain and frustration, he was firm in the knowledge that his people are strong. \u201cIf there is anything I know about us Palestinians, [it] is that we\u2019re quite stubborn. We\u2019re going to keep at it until our rights and dignity and sovereignty and independence are achieved.\u201d",

But my home record is bloody good\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe way Ben [Stokes] led in that series was phenomenal,\u201d said Ollie Pope, who stands in as England captain for the opening Test in Multan, which starts in the early hours of Monday morning. \u201cHe took a big risk in that first Test, which paid off, and the nature of the pitch dictated that if there was going to be a result, there was going to have to be a play made like that.\u201d</p> <p>Pakistan are belatedly trying to adopt key parts of that team\u2019s approach. \u201cWe are always playing our best cricket when we\u2019re not giving too much about the result and we\u2019re playing an exciting brand of cricket when it is fearless, taking the game to the opposition,\u201d Masood, their captain, said. \u201cThe best thing England did is realise there are other perspectives and things that might suit you. The key is to find new ways of doing things. That is how the world has always progressed and cricket is no different. You try and evolve and create new ways and England have been pioneers in that.\u201d</p> <p>This year England have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/25/england-refine-bazball-approach-to-play-smarter-and-avoid-recklessness\">spoken about a \u201crefinement\u201d of their style</a>, but on Sunday Brendon McCullum insisted this was a misunderstanding. \u201cWhen I was talking about refinement I was talking about some of the personnel in our group,\u201d the England head coach said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about the approach. The approach has never changed.\u201d</p> <p>England are aware that the path to success in this series may look very different to the trail they blazed in 2022. \u201cThe key to the tactics a couple of years ago was identifying you needed plenty of time to take 20 wickets in each Test, so we needed to force the run rate,\u201d McCullum said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what unfolds over the next few weeks. If that\u2019s the tactic we need we\u2019ll go all in on it. If not we\u2019ll hopefully be smart enough to adjust [tactics] and go all in on those.\u201d</p> <p>One key difference between England\u2019s last visit and this one is that it happened in December. Two months earlier, in McCullum\u2019s words, \u201cconditions are a little bit more extreme ... it\u2019s rocking hot, for a start. I guess we\u2019ve just got to be quite malleable with our plans and adapt as quickly as we can. That\u2019s how the game rolls, right?\u201d</p> <p>McCullum praised Stokes\u2019s ultimately futile efforts to get himself fit for the start of this series \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a professional athlete train as hard. I think most human beings wouldn\u2019t have been anywhere near\u201d \u2013 and defended the decision of his fast bowling coach, Jimmy Anderson, to miss the first six days of the tour to play a pro-am golf tournament. \u201cHe\u2019s been in regular contact with the guys and it\u2019s an incredible sign that two months after taking up the role everyone\u2019s desperately missing him,\u201d he said of Anderson, who is due to arrive on Tuesday. \u201cJimmy\u2019s allowed to live his life, as everyone is. We\u2019re always looking to ensure people can enjoy themselves, to tap into their family life, their hobbies and fun. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big issue.\u201d</p> <p>Pakistan are dealing with a few serious issues of their own, having lost all five of the Tests they have played over the past year, their first under Masood\u2019s captaincy, going down 3-0 in Australia and, more painfully, 2-0 at home to Bangladesh. \u201cWe kept getting into winning positions but the game slipped from our hands,\u201d Masood said. \u201cThose are things we need to learn from. The challenge is to make sure that we finish games off. There is a lot of hurt within the players. 2024 has not been a good year for Pakistan cricket all over and we like to see our fans happy. We are hurt. The answer is to be positive. We let the past go.\u201d</p>",

They topped out at 7.36 in the second innings of the first Test, a figure unmatched in the history of cricket until India rattled off 285 at 8.22 against Bangladesh last month. \u201cThe way Ben [Stokes] led in that series was phenomenal,\u201d said Ollie Pope, who stands in as England captain for the opening Test in Multan, which starts in the early hours of Monday morning. \u201cHe took a big risk in that first Test, which paid off, and the nature of the pitch dictated that if there was going to be a result, there was going to have to be a play made like that.\u201d Pakistan are belatedly trying to adopt key parts of that team\u2019s approach. \u201cWe are always playing our best cricket when we\u2019re not giving too much about the result and we\u2019re playing an exciting brand of cricket when it is fearless, taking the game to the opposition,\u201d Masood, their captain, said. \u201cThe best thing England did is realise there are other perspectives and things that might suit you. The key is to find new ways of doing things. That is how the world has always progressed and cricket is no different. You try and evolve and create new ways and England have been pioneers in that.\u201d This year England have spoken about a \u201crefinement\u201d of their style, but on Sunday Brendon McCullum insisted this was a misunderstanding. \u201cWhen I was talking about refinement I was talking about some of the personnel in our group,\u201d the England head coach said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about the approach. The approach has never changed.\u201d England are aware that the path to success in this series may look very different to the trail they blazed in 2022. \u201cThe key to the tactics a couple of years ago was identifying you needed plenty of time to take 20 wickets in each Test, so we needed to force the run rate,\u201d McCullum said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what unfolds over the next few weeks. If that\u2019s the tactic we need we\u2019ll go all in on it. If not we\u2019ll hopefully be smart enough to adjust [tactics] and go all in on those.\u201d One key difference between England\u2019s last visit and this one is that it happened in December. Two months earlier, in McCullum\u2019s words, \u201cconditions are a little bit more extreme ... it\u2019s rocking hot, for a start. I guess we\u2019ve just got to be quite malleable with our plans and adapt as quickly as we can. That\u2019s how the game rolls, right?\u201d McCullum praised Stokes\u2019s ultimately futile efforts to get himself fit for the start of this series \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a professional athlete train as hard. I think most human beings wouldn\u2019t have been anywhere near\u201d \u2013 and defended the decision of his fast bowling coach, Jimmy Anderson, to miss the first six days of the tour to play a pro-am golf tournament. \u201cHe\u2019s been in regular contact with the guys and it\u2019s an incredible sign that two months after taking up the role everyone\u2019s desperately missing him,\u201d he said of Anderson, who is due to arrive on Tuesday. \u201cJimmy\u2019s allowed to live his life, as everyone is. We\u2019re always looking to ensure people can enjoy themselves, to tap into their family life, their hobbies and fun. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big issue.\u201d Pakistan are dealing with a few serious issues of their own, having lost all five of the Tests they have played over the past year, their first under Masood\u2019s captaincy, going down 3-0 in Australia and, more painfully, 2-0 at home to Bangladesh. \u201cWe kept getting into winning positions but the game slipped from our hands,\u201d Masood said. \u201cThose are things we need to learn from. The challenge is to make sure that we finish games off. There is a lot of hurt within the players. 2024 has not been a good year for Pakistan cricket all over and we like to see our fans happy. We are hurt. The answer is to be positive. We let the past go.\u201d",

The efforts promote values like <a href=\"https://provost.harvard.edu/sites/hwpi.harvard.edu/files/provost/files/open_inquiry_constructive_dialogue_report_october_2024.pdf\">\u201copen inquiry\u201d and \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d</a>, while often staying vague on the issue at the heart of the matter \u2013 Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.</p> <p>Just as peace talks in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast\">Middle East</a> have never achieved much, universities\u2019 efforts at dialogue have often faltered.

      "bodyText": "A year after the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel and Tel Aviv\u2019s response to them sparked months-long protests and inflamed divisions on campuses across the US, some university administrations have turned to \u201cdialogue\u201d as the way forward. They\u2019re hoping that getting students talking to each other will serve as a salve for the turbulence of the last year, with its dramatic resignations, canceled graduations and thousands of arrests \u2013 as well as a deep disillusion among students with their universities\u2019 ability to provide direction at a time of crisis. Since then, universities have organized town halls, working groups and listening sessions, offered coursework on de-escalation and training for faculty. The efforts promote values like \u201copen inquiry\u201d and \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d, while often staying vague on the issue at the heart of the matter \u2013 Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Just as peace talks in the Middle East have never achieved much, universities\u2019 efforts at dialogue have often faltered. At times that has been because of administrations\u2019 fears and capitulation to outside pressure, and other times because of backlash from students who see the initiatives as out-of-touch attempts to placate them and normalize campus life amid a raging war. That\u2019s not to say students aren\u2019t trying \u2013 in fact, they have often been more nuanced, curious and willing to engage in frank discussions than universities have made room for. At Harvard, for example, a group of undergraduates last spring organized a meeting between students who were participating in a protest encampment and others who had concerns about it. The sit-down, on a grassy patch of Harvard yard near the encampment but not in it \u2013 because some students feared the consequences of being associated with the protest \u2013 came after months of escalating tensions on campus. In the fall, a rightwing group had funded a billboard truck that doxed pro-Palestinian students and branded them \u201cantisemites\u201d. In January, the university\u2019s president, Claudine Gay, had resigned, weeks after a congressional hearing that had sparked cascading backlash. Anger and fear were rampant; dialogue virtually nonexistent. \u201cThere was just a really intense stifling of conversation, people had really intense and often complex feelings about October 7 and about Israel\u2019s response, and yet there was really only space to express kind of simple perspectives,\u201d Noah Kassis, a senior at the university who described himself as a religious Jew with \u201ccrunchy, granola\u201d views, said. \u201cThe environment felt so incredibly tense.\u201d So Kassis and some friends organized the sit-down near the encampment, one in a series of initiatives they launched to create a space for nuance and critique they felt had been badly missing. A couple dozen people participated, many of them Jewish students critical of Israel and curious but hesitant about the encampment. There were no Palestinians, and only a handful of students who were involved in the protest itself \u2013 an indication that such spaces might hold more appeal for students who are searching than those already entrenched on a side. As each student spoke, some talked about being inspired by their classmates at the protest; others said that every time they walked by the tents they thought of their friends killed on 7 October. Nearly all condemned Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, but they debated over the words \u201cintifada\u201d and \u201cgenocide\u201d and the phrase \u201cfrom the river to the sea\u201d. Some students left the meeting in tears, disappointed and feeling unheard. Others felt the conversation was the most \u201cin good faith\u201d they had had in months, and asked for more.

I have lost friends, I have lost job opportunities and, most of all, I have lost my faith in humanity.</p> <p>But, before I get into that, let me fulfil my duty as a good diaspora Palestinian and recite the obligatory incantation: I condemn Hamas, I condemn Hamas, I condemn Hamas. We Palestinians, you see, are not allowed to open our mouths without someone demanding we denounce violence and condemn Hamas. And then we are told to shut our mouths, to stay silent, while the very same people demanding we decry violence salivate over our deaths and celebrate murder on an <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/daily-death-rate-gaza-higher-any-other-major-21st-century-conflict-oxfam\">unimaginable scale</a>. Anyone an Israeli kills is an act of self-defence. Anyone an Arab kills is an act of terrorism. These are the rules we must all abide by.</p> <p>The US has never been shy about how much it hates Arabs. But ever since 7 October that hatred has shot to such disturbing new levels that I no longer feel at home in this country. Were it not for the fact that I have built a life and a family here, I would get the hell out.

I have lost friends, I have lost job opportunities and, most of all, I have lost my faith in humanity. But, before I get into that, let me fulfil my duty as a good diaspora Palestinian and recite the obligatory incantation: I condemn Hamas, I condemn Hamas, I condemn Hamas. We Palestinians, you see, are not allowed to open our mouths without someone demanding we denounce violence and condemn Hamas. And then we are told to shut our mouths, to stay silent, while the very same people demanding we decry violence salivate over our deaths and celebrate murder on an unimaginable scale. Anyone an Israeli kills is an act of self-defence. Anyone an Arab kills is an act of terrorism. These are the rules we must all abide by. The US has never been shy about how much it hates Arabs. But ever since 7 October that hatred has shot to such disturbing new levels that I no longer feel at home in this country. Were it not for the fact that I have built a life and a family here, I would get the hell out. Why would I want to stay in a country where Palestinians are so dehumanised that elected officials such as Senator Lindsey Graham can fantasise about dropping an atomic bomb on Gaza \u2013 a place where half of the population are children \u2013 without facing any meaningful censure? Where John Fetterman, who is my senator, openly mocks pro-Palestinian protesters and seems to take immense joy in our pain? And then there\u2019s the fact that, simply by paying my taxes, I am complicit in the slaughter and starvation of my own people. Increasingly I can\u2019t rationalise living in a country where such a large portion of my taxpayer dollars is spent on funding war and what Kamala Harris has gleefully described as the \u201cmost lethal fighting force in the world\u201d.

Last Thursday Labour, Tory and Lib Dem councillors voted to <a href=\"https://x.com/JimSlaven/status/1841840749383467118\">keep it shut</a> for seven months \u2013 with an \u201cupdate\u201d in December \u2013 so they can try to pare down costs across the city\u2019s museums and galleries: a small but very symbolic element of a drive to put through \u00a326m in spending cuts across the council\u2019s budgets.</p> <p>The museum\u2019s supporters now fear the worst. One of them is Jim Slaven, an energised community activist and <a href=\"https://edinburghdetours.com/about/\">Edinburgh tour guide</a> specialising in social history, who well knows what is afoot. \u201cThey\u2019ve turned the city centre into a citadel for the rich,\u201d he recently said, \u201cand now they\u2019re trying to write us out of the history of the city as well.\u201d</p> <p>Here, once again, is a bafflingly overlooked story. Local councils have long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/03/rising-cost-of-social-services-in-england-putting-arts-and-youth-services-at-risk-say-councils\">been squeezed</a> by the rising need for adult and children\u2019s social care, the damage inflicted by post-2010 austerity and the plain fact that the huge financial gaps have still not been filled. The resulting crises are usually reported in terms of their effects on youth clubs, children\u2019s centres, parks and libraries. But we also need to talk about museums, whose opening times are constantly being hacked back, while staff numbers are falling away.

      "bodyText": "The People\u2019s Story Museum in Edinburgh is a part of the city\u2019s cultural fabric whose name says it all: a museum and archive, opened in 1989 and located in the 16th-century Canongate Tolbooth, that takes in just about every aspect of working-class life in the Scottish capital from the 18th century to the late 20th century. Its exhibits include recreations of a bookbinder\u2019s workshop, a wartime kitchen and a jail cell; the artefacts it looks after span work, leisure, politics, protest and more.

Insane asylums and, of course, \u201cthe late, great Hannibal Lecter\u201d.</p> <p>These are just a few of the recent remarks made by one of two major candidates for president of the United States. Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has spent years saying the unsayable to entertain, goad and grab attention. But his pronouncements over the past few weeks have plumbed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/24/donald-trump-mental-fitness-campaign\">new depths of absurdity and incoherence</a>.</p> <p>Trump, 78, increasingly slurs or stumbles over his words, raising fears over cognitive decline. He is slipping in polls against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a> and knows that defeat could lead to criminal trials and even prison. After a decade of dominating American politics, critics say, Trump could be in the throes of a final meltdown.</p> <p>His verbal output now is \u201cabsolute batshittery\u201d, according to <a href=\"https://www.tarasetmayer.com/\">Tara Setmayer</a>, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill. \u201cThese are not the musings of a well-adjusted adult. He demonstrates daily how unfit he is to have the most powerful position in the world.<em>\u201d</em></p> <p>Trump was mostly given a pass by the mainstream media, Setmayer added, because of the intense focus on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/05/biden-aging-recent-months/\">Joe Biden\u2019s age and mental acuity</a> when he was still running. \u201cNow the focus is solely on him because he is the oldest candidate in this race. His kookery is even more highlighted now than before because he is alone on an island with his deterioration.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has always thrown dead cats on tables, as the metaphor goes, offering his fans the thrill of transgression and watching with glee as liberals howl with outrage. His run for president in 2016 was characterised by racially divisive rhetoric and a constant stream of controversies that dominated news cycles and forced rival Hillary Clinton into reactive mode.</p> <p>A Guardian analysis of <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?416977-1/presidential-candidate-donald-trump-rally-greensboro-north-carolina\">a campaign rally Trump held</a> in Greensboro, North Carolina, in October 2016 found references to \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and the assertion: \u201cFor what she\u2019s done, they should lock her up.\u201d Even then, Trump was obsessed with crowd sizes, media lies \u201cpoisoning\u201d the minds of the electorate and the fantasy that \u201cthis whole election is being rigged\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>He has definitely lost a step, as they say. He is less coherent than he was certainly four years ago</p> <footer> <cite>Elaine Kamarc, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the Trump of eight years ago also brought a more disciplined and focused message. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/trump-clinton-free-trade-policies-tpp\">railed against bad trade deals</a> and reeled off a list of policy priorities: the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, eliminating regulations, defending religious liberty, supporting law enforcement, repealing and replacing Obamacare, saving the second amendment, and appointing \u201cgreat justices\u201d to the supreme court.</p> <p>Perhaps most strikingly, Trump asked independents and Democrats to join a fight against the \u201ccorrupt establishment\u201d that would give government back to the people. He decried national divisions, promised that \u201cwe\u2019re going to be a unified nation, a nation of love\u201d and wrapped up in a relatively tight 40 minutes.</p> <p>Today Trump\u2019s rallies tend to sprawl for an hour and a half or two hours which, as Harris noted in their debate, means some people leave before the end. He has sought to defend his rhetorical meanderings as \u201cthe weave\u201d, claiming the threads all come back together to make sense.</p> <p>But at a recent stop in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, \u201cTrump shifted from topic to topic so quickly that it was hard to keep track of what he meant at times,\u201d <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-wisconsin-immigration-visit-arrest-0810efccefc8b094756d0c46f927b7dc\">the Associated Press reported</a>. There were digressions about the climate crisis, Harris\u2019s father, how his beach body was better than Biden\u2019s, and a fly that was buzzing near him. \u201cI wonder where the fly came from,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo years ago, I wouldn\u2019t have had a fly up here.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump of 2024 also strikes a darker tone as he struggles to define Harris with a nickname or brand. In Prairie du Chien he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/29/trump-republicans-mentally-disabled-comments-harris\">tested a new insult</a>: \u201cJoe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way. She was born that way. And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country. Anybody would know this.\u201d</p> <p>At another rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/trump-crime-the-purge-speech\">painted a lurid picture of crime</a> spiralling out of control, which he said could be ended \u201cimmediately\u201d with one \u201creal rough, nasty day\u201d, or \u201cone rough hour\u201d. Some critics compared the idea to the dystopian horror film The Purge.</p>    <p>At a press conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, \u201cTrump at times interrupted his own asides with even further asides,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/us/politics/trump-speech-wisconsin.html\">according to the New York Times</a>. He mixed up Iran with North Korea and struggled to pronounce the name of the United Arab Emirates.

      "bodyText": "A \u201cbeautiful\u201d beach body and a \u201cmentally disabled\u201d opponent. \u201cOne rough hour\u201d of police retaliation to stop criminals. \u201cA million Rambos\u201d in Afghanistan. Haitian immigrants \u201ceating the dogs\u201d and \u201ceating the cats\u201d. Death by electrocution versus death by shark. Insane asylums and, of course, \u201cthe late, great Hannibal Lecter\u201d. These are just a few of the recent remarks made by one of two major candidates for president of the United States. Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has spent years saying the unsayable to entertain, goad and grab attention. But his pronouncements over the past few weeks have plumbed new depths of absurdity and incoherence. Trump, 78, increasingly slurs or stumbles over his words, raising fears over cognitive decline. He is slipping in polls against Kamala Harris and knows that defeat could lead to criminal trials and even prison. After a decade of dominating American politics, critics say, Trump could be in the throes of a final meltdown. His verbal output now is \u201cabsolute batshittery\u201d, according to Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill. \u201cThese are not the musings of a well-adjusted adult. He demonstrates daily how unfit he is to have the most powerful position in the world.\u201d Trump was mostly given a pass by the mainstream media, Setmayer added, because of the intense focus on Joe Biden\u2019s age and mental acuity when he was still running. \u201cNow the focus is solely on him because he is the oldest candidate in this race. His kookery is even more highlighted now than before because he is alone on an island with his deterioration.\u201d Trump has always thrown dead cats on tables, as the metaphor goes, offering his fans the thrill of transgression and watching with glee as liberals howl with outrage. His run for president in 2016 was characterised by racially divisive rhetoric and a constant stream of controversies that dominated news cycles and forced rival Hillary Clinton into reactive mode. A Guardian analysis of a campaign rally Trump held in Greensboro, North Carolina, in October 2016 found references to \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and the assertion: \u201cFor what she\u2019s done, they should lock her up.\u201d Even then, Trump was obsessed with crowd sizes, media lies \u201cpoisoning\u201d the minds of the electorate and the fantasy that \u201cthis whole election is being rigged\u201d. But the Trump of eight years ago also brought a more disciplined and focused message. He railed against bad trade deals and reeled off a list of policy priorities: the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, eliminating regulations, defending religious liberty, supporting law enforcement, repealing and replacing Obamacare, saving the second amendment, and appointing \u201cgreat justices\u201d to the supreme court. Perhaps most strikingly, Trump asked independents and Democrats to join a fight against the \u201ccorrupt establishment\u201d that would give government back to the people. He decried national divisions, promised that \u201cwe\u2019re going to be a unified nation, a nation of love\u201d and wrapped up in a relatively tight 40 minutes. Today Trump\u2019s rallies tend to sprawl for an hour and a half or two hours which, as Harris noted in their debate, means some people leave before the end. He has sought to defend his rhetorical meanderings as \u201cthe weave\u201d, claiming the threads all come back together to make sense. But at a recent stop in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, \u201cTrump shifted from topic to topic so quickly that it was hard to keep track of what he meant at times,\u201d the Associated Press reported. There were digressions about the climate crisis, Harris\u2019s father, how his beach body was better than Biden\u2019s, and a fly that was buzzing near him. \u201cI wonder where the fly came from,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo years ago, I wouldn\u2019t have had a fly up here.\u201d The Trump of 2024 also strikes a darker tone as he struggles to define Harris with a nickname or brand. In Prairie du Chien he tested a new insult: \u201cJoe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way. She was born that way. And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country. Anybody would know this.\u201d At another rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, Trump painted a lurid picture of crime spiralling out of control, which he said could be ended \u201cimmediately\u201d with one \u201creal rough, nasty day\u201d, or \u201cone rough hour\u201d. Some critics compared the idea to the dystopian horror film The Purge. At a press conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, \u201cTrump at times interrupted his own asides with even further asides,\u201d according to the New York Times. He mixed up Iran with North Korea and struggled to pronounce the name of the United Arab Emirates. He spoke glowingly of fighters in Afghanistan: \u201cThey could take a knife, they were like Rambos, just like putting a million Rambos \u2013 good old Sylvester Stallone was my friend. But it\u2019s like putting a million Rambos.\u201d The campaign has also been punctuated by bizarre riffs about the 30-year-old fictional character Hannibal Lecter and whether it would be better to be electrocuted or eaten by a shark. Trump used a debate watched by tens of million of people to push the dangerous lie that Haitian immigrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. This week Trump was the subject of a withering takedown on Comedy Central\u2019s satirical news programme The Daily Show. Host Jon Stewart played a clip of an interview asking Trump for the specific mechanics of how prices would come down. His reply: \u201cFirst of all, she can\u2019t do an interview.

      "body": "<p>Hurricane Helene unleashed record rainfall in parts of Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, and Tennessee, becoming one of the deadliest hurricanes in modern times and setting up the affected regions to face years of health challenges.</p> <p>Some of the effects, like the flooded manufacturing plant that produces 60% of the nation\u2019s IV supply, will reverberate throughout the entire country.</p> <p>In western North Carolina, the mountains molted. The rains fell on the already-sodden clay soil and sloughed off mud and rocks and houses, sending it all \u2013 buildings, cars, roads, water pipes \u2013 into churning rivers swollen beyond residents\u2019 imaginations.</p> <p>Jerry McNeely\u2019s house in Swannanoa, North Carolina, stood, miraculously, as five nearby homes were swept away in a 75-yard (70-meter) mudslide.</p> <p>\u201cI had to do something,\u201d he said. He rushed out to help. After 45 minutes of digging through mud and debris in one neighbor\u2019s collapsed home, McNeely spotted a toe, painted purple, shining like a beacon. Other neighbors arrived, and they staged a heroic rescue of the woman, who\u2019d been pinned under a beam.</p> <p>It took 18 hours to evacuate his neighbor for leg injuries and head trauma, but she\u2019s now in stable condition, McNeely said. Another neighbor, a man who was thrown from his mobile home in the slide, suffered a broken back and died of his injuries before medical help arrived; his wife had been killed instantly.</p> <p>The immediate health concerns in the wake of the disaster have included complications from injuries, a lack of clean water and safe food, and challenges accessing <a href=\"https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2024/09/30/asheville-no-water-residents-fear-for-health/75444555007/\">medical supplies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/helene-cancer-survivor-desperately-searches-medical-supplies-rcna173136\">treatments</a> like insulin, oxygen and <a href=\"https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2024/10/04/dialysis-challenges-after-helene/\">dialysis</a>, especially given power outages and closed roads.</p> <p>In a crisis like this, \u201cyou can\u2019t separate yourself from people\u201d, which raises risks for infectious disease, said Melody Gardner, a former nurse who lives in Black Mountain, North Carolina, with her mother and manages rental homes in Swannanoa.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very, very concerned about flu and Covid,\u201d she said. Covid continues circulating at high levels throughout the country, with another winter surge expected, while flu season is nigh \u2013 yet few people usually get vaccinated against either this early in the respiratory season, she said.</p> <p>Asthma flare-ups and breathing issues will also likely increase with mold and standing water. And in Conyers, Georgia, residents were told to shelter in place after a fire at the BioLab chemical company.</p> <p>Rescuers have delivered truckloads of drinking water, but in areas like western North Carolina, where water lines were washed away, McNeely believes it may be months before the region has running water again.</p>    <p>That raises concerns for sanitation, including the spread of viruses like hepatitis A and stomach bugs, particularly if people don\u2019t have enough water to wash their hands regularly and don\u2019t have access to functioning toilets.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re used in the mountains to losing our power, but losing your water service is uncommon. It\u2019s unprecedented, really,\u201d McNeely said.</p> <p>In places that were spared some of the worst of Helene\u2019s fury, there\u2019s a different threat: online rumors. Officials in Columbia, South Carolina, have repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNnQi_yVOPQ\">debunked</a> rumors about the safety of drinking water after rumors <a href=\"https://www.thestate.com/news/weather-news/article293250084.html#storylink=cpy\">circulated</a> that the water service would soon shut down due to contamination.</p> <p>The pharmaceutical company Baxter has closed its plant in Marion, North Carolina \u2013 the largest manufacturer of IV and dialysis solutions in the nation \u2013 following floods and damaged infrastructure, leading to nationwide shortages of IV fluids.</p> <p>In the longer term, the region will probably suffer from worst access to medical care and the lingering effects of stress and trauma, according to new <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07945-5\">research</a> published in Nature on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cThe mortality impacts of hurricanes extend way beyond the immediate aftermath of the storm, and we find that it actually persists for up to 15 years,\u201d said Rachel Young, an environmental economist at University of California, Berkeley, and one of the authors of the study.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Hurricanes and tropical storms are a far greater public health concern than anyone previously thought</p> <footer> <cite>Rachel Young, University of California</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The researchers studied 500 hurricanes and tropical storms in the US over the past 60 years, and they estimated that 7,000 to 11,000 excess deaths happen after storms like these \u2013 about 300 times more mortality than official counts.</p> <p>\u201cHurricanes and tropical storms are a far greater public health concern than anyone previously thought,\u201d Young said.

Stress can lead to heart attacks and other long-term health issues.</p> <p>\u201cDuring the recovery time period, there is an increase in things like stress and depression, and we often see an increase in suicide,\u201d said Samantha Montano, author of Disasterology and assistant professor of emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy.

      "bodyText": "Hurricane Helene unleashed record rainfall in parts of Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, and Tennessee, becoming one of the deadliest hurricanes in modern times and setting up the affected regions to face years of health challenges. Some of the effects, like the flooded manufacturing plant that produces 60% of the nation\u2019s IV supply, will reverberate throughout the entire country. In western North Carolina, the mountains molted. The rains fell on the already-sodden clay soil and sloughed off mud and rocks and houses, sending it all \u2013 buildings, cars, roads, water pipes \u2013 into churning rivers swollen beyond residents\u2019 imaginations. Jerry McNeely\u2019s house in Swannanoa, North Carolina, stood, miraculously, as five nearby homes were swept away in a 75-yard (70-meter) mudslide. \u201cI had to do something,\u201d he said. He rushed out to help. After 45 minutes of digging through mud and debris in one neighbor\u2019s collapsed home, McNeely spotted a toe, painted purple, shining like a beacon. Other neighbors arrived, and they staged a heroic rescue of the woman, who\u2019d been pinned under a beam. It took 18 hours to evacuate his neighbor for leg injuries and head trauma, but she\u2019s now in stable condition, McNeely said. Another neighbor, a man who was thrown from his mobile home in the slide, suffered a broken back and died of his injuries before medical help arrived; his wife had been killed instantly. The immediate health concerns in the wake of the disaster have included complications from injuries, a lack of clean water and safe food, and challenges accessing medical supplies and treatments like insulin, oxygen and dialysis, especially given power outages and closed roads. In a crisis like this, \u201cyou can\u2019t separate yourself from people\u201d, which raises risks for infectious disease, said Melody Gardner, a former nurse who lives in Black Mountain, North Carolina, with her mother and manages rental homes in Swannanoa. \u201cI\u2019m very, very concerned about flu and Covid,\u201d she said. Covid continues circulating at high levels throughout the country, with another winter surge expected, while flu season is nigh \u2013 yet few people usually get vaccinated against either this early in the respiratory season, she said. Asthma flare-ups and breathing issues will also likely increase with mold and standing water. And in Conyers, Georgia, residents were told to shelter in place after a fire at the BioLab chemical company. Rescuers have delivered truckloads of drinking water, but in areas like western North Carolina, where water lines were washed away, McNeely believes it may be months before the region has running water again. That raises concerns for sanitation, including the spread of viruses like hepatitis A and stomach bugs, particularly if people don\u2019t have enough water to wash their hands regularly and don\u2019t have access to functioning toilets. \u201cWe\u2019re used in the mountains to losing our power, but losing your water service is uncommon. It\u2019s unprecedented, really,\u201d McNeely said. In places that were spared some of the worst of Helene\u2019s fury, there\u2019s a different threat: online rumors. Officials in Columbia, South Carolina, have repeatedly debunked rumors about the safety of drinking water after rumors circulated that the water service would soon shut down due to contamination. The pharmaceutical company Baxter has closed its plant in Marion, North Carolina \u2013 the largest manufacturer of IV and dialysis solutions in the nation \u2013 following floods and damaged infrastructure, leading to nationwide shortages of IV fluids. In the longer term, the region will probably suffer from worst access to medical care and the lingering effects of stress and trauma, according to new research published in Nature on Wednesday. \u201cThe mortality impacts of hurricanes extend way beyond the immediate aftermath of the storm, and we find that it actually persists for up to 15 years,\u201d said Rachel Young, an environmental economist at University of California, Berkeley, and one of the authors of the study. The researchers studied 500 hurricanes and tropical storms in the US over the past 60 years, and they estimated that 7,000 to 11,000 excess deaths happen after storms like these \u2013 about 300 times more mortality than official counts. \u201cHurricanes and tropical storms are a far greater public health concern than anyone previously thought,\u201d Young said. These effects even extend to the health of babies born after the crisis, pointing to the need for greater prenatal and postpartum support. And the fallout from these tragedies is often unequal. \u201cBlack populations are much more likely to die \u2013 about three times greater than white populations,\u201d Young said. Rebuilding lives and homes will draw down people\u2019s savings, if they had any to begin with \u2013 so if they have a medical issue years down the line, they may not be able to afford care, she said. State and local governments may also be strapped for cash after rebuilding, which means they\u2019re not able to invest as much in public health and health infrastructure. Pollution can also have long-term health effects. Everyone responding to the crisis has been doing \u201cheroic work\u201d, said Young. \u201cWe don\u2019t want those efforts to be in vain, and we can\u2019t forget about these communities. There\u2019s going to be longer-term repair and recovery that needs to occur \u2013 far longer than anyone had previously thought before.\u201d There\u2019s also the immense stress of surviving events like this and rebuilding in their wake. Stress can lead to heart attacks and other long-term health issues. \u201cDuring the recovery time period, there is an increase in things like stress and depression, and we often see an increase in suicide,\u201d said Samantha Montano, author of Disasterology and assistant professor of emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. Yet mental health providers may be displaced themselves, making it harder for them to offer services, she said. McNeely noted there will be a need for long-term wellness counseling as there was \u201calready an existing need for expanded mental health services in western North Carolina, and this is just going to put more burden on an already struggling system\u201d. It\u2019s also difficult for people to access medical care \u2013 and that\u2019s compounded in rural areas, where it was already a challenge. \u201cIt looks like there were hospitals and other medical facilities that were significantly damaged,\u201d said Montano. Fifty patients and staff were rescued from a flooded hospital in Tennessee. Although all hospitals in western North Carolina managed to stay open, staff have struggled to get to work on washed-out roads. Few people in the area had flood insurance. \u201cOne of the main drivers of an increase in stress during recovery is the inability to find resources to rebuild your life, and based on just flood insurance numbers alone, it would not be surprising to see particularly high rates of stress in many of these communities,\u201d said Montano. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a 10-, 15-, 20-year recovery here, easily, for the communities that were most significantly impacted.\u201d Making sure attention stays on these communities \u2013 and resources continue flowing in \u2013 will be critical to the recovery of the region and the people who call it home, Montano said. As soon as it was safe to do so, McNeely\u2019s wife and son left Swannanoa to stay with family, but he was compelled to stay. He formed a band of \u201cdoor knockers\u201d to go all over the mountain and check on neighbors.

      "body": "<p>In an elegant early Victorian building called the Organ Factory in London\u2019s East End, <a href=\"https://gilesduley.com/\">Giles Duley</a>, the photographer, presenter, chef and charity CEO, is addressing an event to mark his 53rd birthday and what should have been the visit of Olive Musetsamfura, a survivor of the Rwandan genocide.</p> <p>\u201cOlive is unable to be here because immigration decided to revoke her visa,\u201d he explains to around 100 people, wryly observing that her rejection is \u201ca story that is somewhat appropriate\u201d to the times.</p> <p>The positive news, he adds, is that she <em>was</em> able to secure a US visa and the following day he would fly to meet her in Las Vegas, where she was to speak to a convention of travel agents on what would be her first journey outside of Rwanda. \u201cShe\u2019s going to have the time of her life,\u201d he announces, \u201cas am I.\u201d</p> <p>Two days earlier, Duley had been documenting life on the frontline in Ukraine, and, after Las Vegas, he and Musetsamfura were flying to New York, where she was to address UN Women. His is a schedule that would exhaust many able-bodied people half his age, but Duley, who lost both his legs, an arm and very nearly his life in an explosion in Afghanistan, says he is \u201cinvigorated\u201d by the energy in the hall.</p> <p>Like one of those hypothetical perpetual energy machines, he is himself the cause of the buzz in the room from which he draws energy. I\u2019m sitting opposite the young photojournalist <a href=\"https://www.emilygarthwaite.com/\">Emily Garthwaite</a>, who spent six years living in Iraq, looking at humanitarian and environmental issues. She describes Duley as \u201cinspirational\u201d and her \u201cmentor\u201d.</p> <p>A number of the people gathered are involved in <a href=\"https://www.legacyofwarfoundation.com/\">Legacy of War</a>, the charity Duley set up after suffering his injuries. Others, like Garthwaite, have experience of working in conflict zones. All of them listen to Duley with rapt attention, which is understandable, because he is an impressive speaker. He talks a little about the charity and a project called <a href=\"https://www.legacyofwarfoundation.com/land-for-women\">Land for Women</a> that buys land for war-affected women to set up collectives that they then own and control themselves. Olive is one such beneficiary, but the key thing for Duley is that she is now able to determine her own direction. Self-empowerment is central to his philosophy.</p>    <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you can empower anyone else,\u201d he tells the audience. \u201cI learned that the hard way through my recovery in hospital. I was supported by the most amazing people, my family, doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists, but none of them empowered me. What they did is they broke down the barriers that stopped me from carrying myself.\u201d</p> <p>He tells a story about the first two people to help him directly after he was blown up. He was almost certain at the time that he was going to die, but he was still conscious and able to speak. He told the two medics who got him on to a helicopter and took him back to Kandahar that if by some miracle he survived, he would take them both out for a drink.</p> <p>Eighteen months later, having come through a hellish recovery, he was just learning to walk with prosthetic legs, and he decided it was time to honour his promise. He flew to Chicago and went to the bar where he had arranged to meet the two men. He was racked with nerves, he tells the audience, because the medics were from the 101st Airborne and as tough as they come and he, after all, is an anti-war photographer. Plus the first time they met, he says, was \u201ckind of hectic\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>What gives me strength is that I tell the story to inspire people</p> <footer> <cite>Olive Musetsamfura</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the men tearfully embraced one another like lost brothers and immediately embarked on an epic drinking session. At some point, one of the medics decided it would be a good idea for all three of them to get tattooed with the date of Duley\u2019s rescue, as he\u2019d never seen anyone as badly injured survive.</p> <p>\u201cI did say to them,\u201d he deadpans, \u201cthat I didn\u2019t actually need a visual reminder of that day.\u201d</p> <p>It feels a little odd to be laughing at the comic travails of a man with only one limb. But to Duley, it\u2019s vital to locate the humanity in misfortune, no matter how raw, and in humanity there is almost always humour, which, after all, is a form of resilience.</p> <p>\u201cI believe resilience is life\u2019s gift for the hard times we go through,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more extreme our experience, the more resilience we have. And the most resilient woman I know is Olive.\u201d</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>A few days later, Duley is sitting next to Musetsamfura in an Airbnb in New York. She is proud-looking, wearing a bright patterned dress with her hair pulled back in a tight top-knot. Although she has come from a modest suburb of Kigali, and arrived first in the casino capital of the world, then the city that never sleeps, she seems unaffected by any cultural dislocation.</p> <p>They had driven past the Sphere, the giant $2.3bn immersive auditorium that is the latest addition to Las Vegas\u2019s outlandish entertainment spots. Everyone drew Musetsamfura\u2019s attention to this hi-tech marvel, and her underwhelmed response was: \u201cYes, it\u2019s just like the Kigali conference centre.\u201d</p> <p>But then she has seen sights that most of us could not begin to imagine. She met Duley seven years ago when he was doing a project on survivors, a sector of society in whom he has an abiding fascination. The charity Humanity &amp; Inclusion put the pair together and Duley interviewed Musetsamfura in what he describes as a \u201cformal\u201d manner.</p>    <p>Between 7 April and 19 July 1994, upwards of 500,000 Rwandans \u2013 by the Rwandan government\u2019s own estimate, more than 1 million \u2013 were slaughtered when the majority Hutu ethnic group set about killing the minority Tutsis and their moderate Hutu defenders.</p> <p>Musetsamfura barely survived the horror and her story was suitably harrowing, but Duley got the sense in that first interview that there was more to it. The following day, her birthday, he returned to her house with a birthday cake, and they cooked together and had a couple of beers.</p> <p>A few years ago, Duley made a series for Vice, the US cable channel, in which he visited places blasted by war and cooked food with families he met. He believes that food is the antithesis of war, the means of bringing people together rather than breaking them apart.</p> <p>As they cooked, Musetsamfura saw something in Duley that she recognised. \u201cShe told me she could see the sadness in my eyes,\u201d he says. At the end of the evening, she told him that she would tell him her \u201creal story now\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s the same story, give or take a few details, that she recounted to the convention in Las Vegas and to UN Women, and the same story that she now shares with me.</p> <p>On 6 April, 30 years ago, Musetsamfura was in hospital, giving birth to her third child, a son. A few miles away, a plane carrying Rwanda\u2019s president, Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana, and neighbouring Burundi\u2019s president, Cyprien Ntaryamira, both Hutu, was shot down. The identity of the culprits still remains the subject of dispute.</p> <p>The ethnic distinctions between Hutus and Tutsis were largely the invention of Belgian colonisers, but that didn\u2019t stop them from being exploited by those seeking to use Habyarimana\u2019s assassination as the reason to target the minority Tutsis. Musetsamfura is Tutsi, but she had been accompanied to hospital by her best friend, Immacul\u00e9e, a Hutu, and that night she lay in bed listening to the radio as Hutu leaders broadcast instructions to rise up and kill the \u201ccockroaches\u201d.</p> <p>The following day the killing began, mostly by machete. Rape, too, was widespread. In hospital, Musetsamfura soon learned that her village had been attacked and her other two children killed, along with her husband and her parents, her siblings and her in-laws. As she tried to absorb this incomprehensible news, from beyond the hospital she could hear the Hutu gangs scraping their machetes on the ground and demanding that the Tutsis come out.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why a person would kill someone just based on their ethnicity,\u201d she says, recalling the shock she was in.</p> <p>For a while, the nuns who ran the hospital held out against Hutu militias marauding around the city. But after a few days the militia stormed the hospital, separated the Tutsis \u2013 in Rwanda at that time everyone carried identity cards that specified whether they were Tutsi or Hutu \u2013 and dragged them out.</p> <p>In the mayhem Musetsamfura had little choice but to leave her son, Jonathan, as she was manhandled to a market where other young Tutsi mothers and their children were taken, along with the sick and elderly. Before Musetsamfura\u2019s eyes they were indiscriminately hacked to death. She feigned her own death as bodies fell on top of her, and lay beneath the corpses for three days. Of the 1,200 people gathered in the market, only 15 survived.</p> <p>When she finally managed to free herself from this waking nightmare, she hid in a river during the day and on its banks at night. Constantly trying to avoid passing gangs, she was powerless to prevent insects from burrowing into her legs. After several days of this purgatory, she somehow made it back to her village, where she was saved from the mob by her uncle by marriage, a Hutu. She soon learned, however, that this uncle had also been instrumental in the murder of her family (a vital detail that, in their first interview, she held back from Duley). She stayed in hiding for several weeks under his precarious protection, witnessing more hideous crimes that he committed, before she once again took refuge in the woods.</p> <p>Eventually she was rescued by the Rwandan Patriotic Front and taken to hospital. But her ordeal was far from over. Once the Hutu militias had been defeated by the RPF, she returned once more to her village and found six orphaned children who were either part of her extended family or were the children of friends who had been murdered. She decided to adopt them all and move to the capital, Kigali.</p> <p>Lacking family support, she was forced to turn to sex work, where her clients seemed to her indistinguishable from the killers. She once described to Duley how she felt about herself at this time: \u201cI was not human, I was a dustbin. Every man that slept with me felt like a perpetrator. But I didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>The one bright piece of news in this bottomlessly dark period was that her old friend Immacul\u00e9e managed to track her down, and brought her Jonathan, her then almost four-year-old son who survived the genocide thanks to lacking an identity card in hospital.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Why would you fight to stay alive when you\u2019ve lost everything?</p> <footer> <cite>Giles Duley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Through an interpreter, Musetsamfura recounts these details to me in a calm voice with an almost emotionless expression, but stops occasionally to wipe tears from her eyes. It\u2019s the only sign that her story is not just a testament but a scar \u2013 psychological and physical (the insects that bore into her as she hid in the river had to be surgically removed) \u2013 that can never entirely heal. To revisit such searing trauma is undoubtedly an act of courage.</p> <p>\u201cIt can feel like I\u2019m back to the 7 April and it\u2019s all happening again,\u201d she says. \u201cBut what gives me strength is that I tell the story to inspire people, and that makes me feel safe each time I revisit it.\u201d</p> <p>I ask what it was like to speak to a convention room full of people in a strange city on her first trip abroad.</p> <p>\u201cI felt strong,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Perhaps more impressive still was the talk she gave to UN Women at the UN Headquarters, which was seen online around the world.</p> <p>\u201cIt made me feel like an important person,\u201d she says.</p> <p>One aspect of Musetsamfura\u2019s survival and recovery that she thinks is critical is the role of forgiveness. How was she able to come to any kind of reconciliation with her uncle, the man who oversaw the murder of her children, her husband and parents?</p> <p>\u201cI took it as a way to be able to forgive myself,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Although by all sane standards of justice, she had nothing to forgive herself for, she nevertheless carried around survivor\u2019s guilt for many years, the belief that her children had been killed because she was not with them, and then the guilt for the sex work she was forced into to feed her adopted family, and for the alcohol she drank to numb the pain.</p> <p>Forgiving the killers, she explains, enabled her to reach a kind of peace within herself. Her uncle served 15 years in prison and was then released under the terms of the national reconciliation process. Despite admitting his guilt, he has never fully apologised for his role in her family\u2019s murder. Rather, says Duley, who has met him, the uncle thinks of himself as a victim, someone who was misled by those in authority.</p> <p>Duley doesn\u2019t buy that excuse, not least because the uncle, who was also a photographer, was relatively well educated, someone who prided himself on reading Nelson Mandela. Still, his self-exculpation is not really the point.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve discussed this before with Olive,\u201d Duley says \u201cand in many ways I think it was about releasing the power these men in her community held over her. I think she released herself to live her life.\u201d</p> <p>In Duley\u2019s case, although he was mutilated by an anti-personnel mine, he never took it personally, as it were, so there were no identifiable culprits to forgive. And as for the device itself that robbed him of his limbs, he\u2019s even photographed similar IEDs in the manner of found objects, transforming weapons of savage destruction into disturbingly beautiful artworks. Yet he still had to find a way to get through days that would crush most of us, including the 46 laid up in hospital during which he could only communicate by blinking his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it,\u201d he asks, \u201cthat keeps you wanting to survive? Why would you fight to stay alive when you\u2019ve lost everything?\u201d</p>    <p>He\u2019s in a well-informed position to pose the question, but he\u2019s not referring to himself. He\u2019s speaking about survivors in general, everyone who has managed to endure the unendurable. Musetsamfura herself has told Duley that she didn\u2019t want to live after her children were killed, and yet she remained perfectly still when she was trapped under the bodies, and held on in the river as insects feasted on her, when she could have just let go.</p> <p>Duley, who experienced his own moments in which he would have welcomed nothingness, thinks survival is an instinct that transcends rational thought, but one that produces a greater understanding of what we\u2019re capable of. At the same time, he emphasises that it doesn\u2019t mean that survivors can cope with everything. Loneliness, despair and the memories of what they\u2019ve been through can all crowd in at any point.</p> <p>He had some low periods during Covid lockdowns. And he\u2019s fully aware that not everyone will respond to catastrophic events by feeling stronger and more focused, as he does. Resilience, he says, is also about accepting what has happened, and that there will be bad days.</p> <p>For Musetsamfura, these are now the good days. Her son recently graduated from university with a degree in cooperative management, and she regularly sees two of her adopted daughters. In Rwanda, she says, ethnicity is no longer to be found on identity cards and they are all Rwandans, not Tutsis or Hutus.</p> <p>\u201cI think about the events of 30 years ago every day,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I have a life beyond the tragedy.\u201d</p> <p>She says she wants to travel to more countries, and to share her story with people from around the world. It\u2019s an extraordinary tale, one that deserves to be heard, especially by other survivors, but also by everyone who could do with being reminded of the human potential to overcome the most devastating setbacks. Who knows, perhaps one day this amazing woman from the country to which the last government wanted to send asylum seekers may even be allowed to travel to this country.</p> <ul> <li><p>For more information about Land for Women, including details of how to support the organisation, <a href=\"https://landforwomen.org/support/\">click here</a></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "In an elegant early Victorian building called the Organ Factory in London\u2019s East End, Giles Duley, the photographer, presenter, chef and charity CEO, is addressing an event to mark his 53rd birthday and what should have been the visit of Olive Musetsamfura, a survivor of the Rwandan genocide. \u201cOlive is unable to be here because immigration decided to revoke her visa,\u201d he explains to around 100 people, wryly observing that her rejection is \u201ca story that is somewhat appropriate\u201d to the times. The positive news, he adds, is that she was able to secure a US visa and the following day he would fly to meet her in Las Vegas, where she was to speak to a convention of travel agents on what would be her first journey outside of Rwanda. \u201cShe\u2019s going to have the time of her life,\u201d he announces, \u201cas am I.\u201d Two days earlier, Duley had been documenting life on the frontline in Ukraine, and, after Las Vegas, he and Musetsamfura were flying to New York, where she was to address UN Women. His is a schedule that would exhaust many able-bodied people half his age, but Duley, who lost both his legs, an arm and very nearly his life in an explosion in Afghanistan, says he is \u201cinvigorated\u201d by the energy in the hall. Like one of those hypothetical perpetual energy machines, he is himself the cause of the buzz in the room from which he draws energy. I\u2019m sitting opposite the young photojournalist Emily Garthwaite, who spent six years living in Iraq, looking at humanitarian and environmental issues. She describes Duley as \u201cinspirational\u201d and her \u201cmentor\u201d. A number of the people gathered are involved in Legacy of War, the charity Duley set up after suffering his injuries. Others, like Garthwaite, have experience of working in conflict zones. All of them listen to Duley with rapt attention, which is understandable, because he is an impressive speaker. He talks a little about the charity and a project called Land for Women that buys land for war-affected women to set up collectives that they then own and control themselves. Olive is one such beneficiary, but the key thing for Duley is that she is now able to determine her own direction. Self-empowerment is central to his philosophy. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you can empower anyone else,\u201d he tells the audience. \u201cI learned that the hard way through my recovery in hospital. I was supported by the most amazing people, my family, doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists, but none of them empowered me. What they did is they broke down the barriers that stopped me from carrying myself.\u201d He tells a story about the first two people to help him directly after he was blown up. He was almost certain at the time that he was going to die, but he was still conscious and able to speak. He told the two medics who got him on to a helicopter and took him back to Kandahar that if by some miracle he survived, he would take them both out for a drink. Eighteen months later, having come through a hellish recovery, he was just learning to walk with prosthetic legs, and he decided it was time to honour his promise. He flew to Chicago and went to the bar where he had arranged to meet the two men. He was racked with nerves, he tells the audience, because the medics were from the 101st Airborne and as tough as they come and he, after all, is an anti-war photographer. Plus the first time they met, he says, was \u201ckind of hectic\u201d. But the men tearfully embraced one another like lost brothers and immediately embarked on an epic drinking session. At some point, one of the medics decided it would be a good idea for all three of them to get tattooed with the date of Duley\u2019s rescue, as he\u2019d never seen anyone as badly injured survive. \u201cI did say to them,\u201d he deadpans, \u201cthat I didn\u2019t actually need a visual reminder of that day.\u201d It feels a little odd to be laughing at the comic travails of a man with only one limb. But to Duley, it\u2019s vital to locate the humanity in misfortune, no matter how raw, and in humanity there is almost always humour, which, after all, is a form of resilience. \u201cI believe resilience is life\u2019s gift for the hard times we go through,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more extreme our experience, the more resilience we have. And the most resilient woman I know is Olive.\u201d *** A few days later, Duley is sitting next to Musetsamfura in an Airbnb in New York. She is proud-looking, wearing a bright patterned dress with her hair pulled back in a tight top-knot. Although she has come from a modest suburb of Kigali, and arrived first in the casino capital of the world, then the city that never sleeps, she seems unaffected by any cultural dislocation. They had driven past the Sphere, the giant $2.3bn immersive auditorium that is the latest addition to Las Vegas\u2019s outlandish entertainment spots. Everyone drew Musetsamfura\u2019s attention to this hi-tech marvel, and her underwhelmed response was: \u201cYes, it\u2019s just like the Kigali conference centre.\u201d But then she has seen sights that most of us could not begin to imagine. She met Duley seven years ago when he was doing a project on survivors, a sector of society in whom he has an abiding fascination. The charity Humanity &amp; Inclusion put the pair together and Duley interviewed Musetsamfura in what he describes as a \u201cformal\u201d manner. Between 7 April and 19 July 1994, upwards of 500,000 Rwandans \u2013 by the Rwandan government\u2019s own estimate, more than 1 million \u2013 were slaughtered when the majority Hutu ethnic group set about killing the minority Tutsis and their moderate Hutu defenders. Musetsamfura barely survived the horror and her story was suitably harrowing, but Duley got the sense in that first interview that there was more to it. The following day, her birthday, he returned to her house with a birthday cake, and they cooked together and had a couple of beers. A few years ago, Duley made a series for Vice, the US cable channel, in which he visited places blasted by war and cooked food with families he met. He believes that food is the antithesis of war, the means of bringing people together rather than breaking them apart. As they cooked, Musetsamfura saw something in Duley that she recognised. \u201cShe told me she could see the sadness in my eyes,\u201d he says. At the end of the evening, she told him that she would tell him her \u201creal story now\u201d. It\u2019s the same story, give or take a few details, that she recounted to the convention in Las Vegas and to UN Women, and the same story that she now shares with me. On 6 April, 30 years ago, Musetsamfura was in hospital, giving birth to her third child, a son. A few miles away, a plane carrying Rwanda\u2019s president, Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana, and neighbouring Burundi\u2019s president, Cyprien Ntaryamira, both Hutu, was shot down. The identity of the culprits still remains the subject of dispute. The ethnic distinctions between Hutus and Tutsis were largely the invention of Belgian colonisers, but that didn\u2019t stop them from being exploited by those seeking to use Habyarimana\u2019s assassination as the reason to target the minority Tutsis. Musetsamfura is Tutsi, but she had been accompanied to hospital by her best friend, Immacul\u00e9e, a Hutu, and that night she lay in bed listening to the radio as Hutu leaders broadcast instructions to rise up and kill the \u201ccockroaches\u201d. The following day the killing began, mostly by machete. Rape, too, was widespread. In hospital, Musetsamfura soon learned that her village had been attacked and her other two children killed, along with her husband and her parents, her siblings and her in-laws. As she tried to absorb this incomprehensible news, from beyond the hospital she could hear the Hutu gangs scraping their machetes on the ground and demanding that the Tutsis come out. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why a person would kill someone just based on their ethnicity,\u201d she says, recalling the shock she was in. For a while, the nuns who ran the hospital held out against Hutu militias marauding around the city. But after a few days the militia stormed the hospital, separated the Tutsis \u2013 in Rwanda at that time everyone carried identity cards that specified whether they were Tutsi or Hutu \u2013 and dragged them out. In the mayhem Musetsamfura had little choice but to leave her son, Jonathan, as she was manhandled to a market where other young Tutsi mothers and their children were taken, along with the sick and elderly. Before Musetsamfura\u2019s eyes they were indiscriminately hacked to death. She feigned her own death as bodies fell on top of her, and lay beneath the corpses for three days. Of the 1,200 people gathered in the market, only 15 survived. When she finally managed to free herself from this waking nightmare, she hid in a river during the day and on its banks at night. Constantly trying to avoid passing gangs, she was powerless to prevent insects from burrowing into her legs. After several days of this purgatory, she somehow made it back to her village, where she was saved from the mob by her uncle by marriage, a Hutu. She soon learned, however, that this uncle had also been instrumental in the murder of her family (a vital detail that, in their first interview, she held back from Duley). She stayed in hiding for several weeks under his precarious protection, witnessing more hideous crimes that he committed, before she once again took refuge in the woods. Eventually she was rescued by the Rwandan Patriotic Front and taken to hospital. But her ordeal was far from over. Once the Hutu militias had been defeated by the RPF, she returned once more to her village and found six orphaned children who were either part of her extended family or were the children of friends who had been murdered. She decided to adopt them all and move to the capital, Kigali. Lacking family support, she was forced to turn to sex work, where her clients seemed to her indistinguishable from the killers. She once described to Duley how she felt about herself at this time: \u201cI was not human, I was a dustbin. Every man that slept with me felt like a perpetrator. But I didn\u2019t care.\u201d The one bright piece of news in this bottomlessly dark period was that her old friend Immacul\u00e9e managed to track her down, and brought her Jonathan, her then almost four-year-old son who survived the genocide thanks to lacking an identity card in hospital. Through an interpreter, Musetsamfura recounts these details to me in a calm voice with an almost emotionless expression, but stops occasionally to wipe tears from her eyes. It\u2019s the only sign that her story is not just a testament but a scar \u2013 psychological and physical (the insects that bore into her as she hid in the river had to be surgically removed) \u2013 that can never entirely heal. To revisit such searing trauma is undoubtedly an act of courage. \u201cIt can feel like I\u2019m back to the 7 April and it\u2019s all happening again,\u201d she says. \u201cBut what gives me strength is that I tell the story to inspire people, and that makes me feel safe each time I revisit it.\u201d I ask what it was like to speak to a convention room full of people in a strange city on her first trip abroad. \u201cI felt strong,\u201d she says. Perhaps more impressive still was the talk she gave to UN Women at the UN Headquarters, which was seen online around the world. \u201cIt made me feel like an important person,\u201d she says. One aspect of Musetsamfura\u2019s survival and recovery that she thinks is critical is the role of forgiveness. How was she able to come to any kind of reconciliation with her uncle, the man who oversaw the murder of her children, her husband and parents? \u201cI took it as a way to be able to forgive myself,\u201d she says. Although by all sane standards of justice, she had nothing to forgive herself for, she nevertheless carried around survivor\u2019s guilt for many years, the belief that her children had been killed because she was not with them, and then the guilt for the sex work she was forced into to feed her adopted family, and for the alcohol she drank to numb the pain.

Her uncle served 15 years in prison and was then released under the terms of the national reconciliation process.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/arlie-hochschild\">Arlie Russell Hochschild</a> has spent decades studying the relationships between work, identity and emotion. The sociologist has a knack for coining terms that gain social currency \u2013 including \u201cemotional labor\u201d, in 1983, to describe the need for certain professionals, like flight attendants and bill collectors, to manage their emotions, and \u201cthe second shift\u201d, in 1989, to describe women\u2019s household labor.</p> <p>Her new book, Stolen Pride: Loss, Shame, and the Rise of the Right, explores what Hochschild calls the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/how-great-paradox-american-politics-holds-secret-trumps-success\">pride paradox</a>\u201d: because conservative Americans value personal responsibility, they feel proud when they do well, and blame themselves when they don\u2019t. Yet, her thinking continues, conservative regions often have worse economies and fewer opportunities than so-called blue states, so people feel ashamed of circumstances that aren\u2019t really their fault.</p> <p>Stolen Pride hits shelves just weeks before a monumental presidential election that will hinge in part on competing visions of identity. The book is an attempt to understand how that pride paradox finds political expression, drawing on several years of field research in mountainous eastern Kentucky, a Donald Trump stronghold.</p> <p>Hochschild believes progressives need to learn to better hear \u201cthe powerful messages that are being communicated from a charismatic leader to a followership, and potentially intercept and understand them and speak to an alienated sector of the population\u201d, she tells me on a recent evening, speaking by Zoom from a book-filled office in Berkeley, and peering at the screen through thin, red-framed eyeglasses.</p>    <p>In recent years, Hochschild\u2019s work has investigated how cultural identity influences politics. Her 2016 book Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right studied conservative Tea Party supporters in Lake Charles, Louisiana, a region where the petrochemical industry is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/cancer-town\">linked</a> to serious environmental and health problems. Hochschild was interested in why the people she met were hostile to government regulation even when they might personally benefit from state intervention. The book, embraced by progressives anxious to understand Donald Trump\u2019s appeal, became a bestseller.</p> <p>Hochschild began researching Stolen Pride in 2017. The book applies a similar ethnographic method to an equally conservative, but in other ways very different, region: Appalachia. It focuses on Kentucky\u2019s fifth congressional district, which is the United States\u2019 whitest and second poorest voting district, with high unemployment, poor health metrics and many people, especially men, who are subject to the so-called diseases of despair \u2013 drug addiction, alcoholism, suicide. While Hochschild\u2019s interest in the American white working class is hardly new, her book offers some interesting new theories and angles of understanding.</p> <p>One of the book\u2019s central events is a march that white supremacists held in Pikeville, Kentucky, in April 2017 \u2013 a test run for their more famous and deadly march in Charlottesville, Virginia, a few months later. These neo-Nazis, Klansmen and other extremists saw Pikeville as an ideal place to preach; in addition to being overwhelmingly white, eastern Kentucky had suffered a \u201cperfect storm\u201d, Hochschild says: \u201cCoal jobs were out, opiates were in. It was a distressed area, and the white supremacists were coming to speak to that distress, to say, <em>Hey, we\u2019ve got answers for you</em>,\u201d in the form of violent fascism and white separatism.</p> <p>Hochschild discovered that Pikeville rejected the white supremacists\u2019 pitch. \u201cAnd I compared it to another kind of appeal, which was that of Donald Trump. One appeal didn\u2019t work, and one did.\u201d Her book, based on interviews with a number of local residents as well as white supremacists, wrestles with the complicated question of why.</p> <p>Hochschild argues that a \u201cpride economy\u201d coexists with the material economy and is almost as important. It also helps to explain Trump\u2019s popularity in many rural and blue-collar areas.</p> <p>For more than a century, eastern Kentucky was one of the centers of the American coal industry. Though back-breaking and sometimes deadly for its workers, the sector employed thousands of people, lifted many out of poverty, and brought railways and other infrastructure into the region. Men took pride in their work, which required courage and knowhow, and the people of the region were proud that their coal fueled America.</p> <p>\u201c[People could] proudly say, \u2018We kept the lights on in this country; we won world war one, world war two by digging coal,\u2019 and the coalminer was kind of like a decorated soldier \u2013 he faced danger. Many died young, of black lung. But it was like a trade passed down from generation to generation for men, and then suddenly it was cut off.\u201d</p> <p>Many Appalachians blame Barack Obama\u2019s environmental regulations for the loss of coal jobs, though that decline was decades in the making and had more to do with the rise of natural gas and automation that made the coal industry less reliant on human labor. The job losses contributed to people leaving, exacerbating a depopulation already endemic in rural America. Men who remained were humiliated, Hochschild notes, and forced to accept \u201c\u2018girly jobs\u2019 \u2013 waiting tables or scooping ice-cream, jobs that young teenagers took that couldn\u2019t support a family\u201d.</p> <p>Add to this OxyContin, which Purdue falsely marketed as a non-addictive painkiller for people recovering from work injuries. Some liberal states required three copies of every prescription, with one going to a government-controlled substances monitor; in conservative, regulation-averse states such as Kentucky, which required only two, OxyContin distribution was 50% <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/137/2/1139/6427381\">higher</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/27/a-kentucky-mining-disaster-killed-dozens-and-destroyed-homes-will-a-lawsuit-bring-change\">Two years after deadly floods in Appalachia, a community hopes lawsuit will bring change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSo many people succumbed to drug addiction,\u201d Hochschild says, \u201cand that became [another] kind of shame, because once you did that, you lost your family, custody of your kids, you might be stealing from Grandma\u2019s purse, or you\u2019re on the dole, and great shame in this area was attached to accepting government services, although many people did.\u201d</p> <p>Like many blue-collar, formerly Democratic areas of the US, eastern Kentucky has a history of leftwing populism.

But while construction has started on 246 homes, the rest are stalled.</p> <p>L&amp;Q,<strong> </strong>the housing association which owns the section, has planning permission. What it doesn\u2019t have is cash. \u201cWe\u2019ve got plots for 22,000 homes across London with permission and are ready to go: we just don\u2019t have the capital,\u201d says its chief executive, Fiona Fletcher-Smith.</p> <p>In the last decade, L&amp;Q has built 3,549 social rent homes (defined as those rented at about 50% of market rate). That is the second highest number in the sector.

A series of rent cuts and caps over the last decade have compounded this, they say.</p> <p>But these pressures are building up at a time when the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, is reiterating her promise to provide \u201cthe biggest boost to social and affordable housing in a generation\u201d, as she did at last month\u2019s Labour party conference.</p> <p>Labour has promised to build 1.5m homes over the course of this parliament, but has not put a figure on social homes. </p> <p>The National Housing Federation (NHF) and the homelessness charity Shelter <a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/6sxvmndnpn0s/3I2QWYU8mo9Trpy1G104zD/604a28221ecbfef2a05a880eacd067cd/Cebr_report_summary.pdf\">believe that 90,000 social homes a year are needed</a><strong> </strong>\u2013 a huge increase on the 9,500 delivered last year.</p> <p>Labour has the ambition, but can it deliver?</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"a5be47b2-410c-443a-9cc0-3861139d3da3\" data-type=\"subhead\">The scale of the challenge</h2> <p>The last time the UK was building more than 300,000 homes a year \u2013 the rate that would be needed to hit the 1.5m homes goal \u2013 was in 1970, a figure that was falling from a peak of more than 400,000 in the late 1960s. Council social rented homes made up about half of the total&nbsp;supply.</p> <p>However, funding cuts and restrictions on borrowing introduced in the 1980s were such that councils\u2019 ability to build was weakened, which has meant they have not supplied more than 2% of new homes for more than 40 years. </p> <p>The bulk of development has been taken on by housing associations, which now deliver 78% of all affordable homes.<strong> </strong>This is done through direct delivery, but also by buying blocks from private builders through \u201csection 106\u201d agreements, and is funded by rents, government grants and, increasingly, private borrowing.</p> <p>While for decades social rent was the main type of tenure delivered by housing associations and councils, in 2011 the coalition government stopped funding this type of housing altogether, with landlords only able to access grants for \u201caffordable rent\u201d homes \u2013 that is, those rented at 80% of market rate. This policy ended five years later, but the number of social rent homes being built plummeted, to as low as 5,900 in 2016-17, with providers having to use their own funds to build them.</p>    <p>Labour has promised to reverse the decline, accusing the Tories of \u201ctaking a sledgehammer\u201d to affordable housing.

      "bodyText": "In the London borough of Harrow sits the site of the old Kodak factory. Built in the 1890s, it employed 6,000 workers at its peak in the 1950s before it closed in 2016. But after producing photographs and rolls of film for more than a century, the site now provides a telling snapshot of the challenges facing the social housing sector. The Harrow View East section of the huge 2,000-home \u201cEastman Village\u201d development will have nearly 750 much-needed affordable homes when completed. But while construction has started on 246 homes, the rest are stalled. L&amp;Q, the housing association which owns the section, has planning permission. What it doesn\u2019t have is cash. \u201cWe\u2019ve got plots for 22,000 homes across London with permission and are ready to go: we just don\u2019t have the capital,\u201d says its chief executive, Fiona Fletcher-Smith. In the last decade, L&amp;Q has built 3,549 social rent homes (defined as those rented at about 50% of market rate). That is the second highest number in the sector. However, Fletcher-Smith says it has now largely stopped buying land. Councils and housing associations dealing with increased borrowing costs \u2013 as well as huge bills to fix ageing stock, remediate fire safety issues and decarbonise homes by installing heat pumps and improving insulation \u2013 are facing a financial squeeze. A series of rent cuts and caps over the last decade have compounded this, they say. But these pressures are building up at a time when the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, is reiterating her promise to provide \u201cthe biggest boost to social and affordable housing in a generation\u201d, as she did at last month\u2019s Labour party conference. Labour has promised to build 1.5m homes over the course of this parliament, but has not put a figure on social homes. The National Housing Federation (NHF) and the homelessness charity Shelter believe that 90,000 social homes a year are needed \u2013 a huge increase on the 9,500 delivered last year. Labour has the ambition, but can it deliver? The scale of the challenge The last time the UK was building more than 300,000 homes a year \u2013 the rate that would be needed to hit the 1.5m homes goal \u2013 was in 1970, a figure that was falling from a peak of more than 400,000 in the late 1960s. Council social rented homes made up about half of the total supply. However, funding cuts and restrictions on borrowing introduced in the 1980s were such that councils\u2019 ability to build was weakened, which has meant they have not supplied more than 2% of new homes for more than 40 years. The bulk of development has been taken on by housing associations, which now deliver 78% of all affordable homes. This is done through direct delivery, but also by buying blocks from private builders through \u201csection 106\u201d agreements, and is funded by rents, government grants and, increasingly, private borrowing. While for decades social rent was the main type of tenure delivered by housing associations and councils, in 2011 the coalition government stopped funding this type of housing altogether, with landlords only able to access grants for \u201caffordable rent\u201d homes \u2013 that is, those rented at 80% of market rate. This policy ended five years later, but the number of social rent homes being built plummeted, to as low as 5,900 in 2016-17, with providers having to use their own funds to build them. Labour has promised to reverse the decline, accusing the Tories of \u201ctaking a sledgehammer\u201d to affordable housing. A spokesperson for the government said: \u201cThis government will deliver the biggest increase in social housing in a generation, to help provide the affordable and secure homes our country needs.\u201d But with the current challenges facing the sector, is that practicable? \u201cI\u2019ve been working in housing now for 35 years, and there has never been a time when housing-association capacity is so decimated,\u201d says Paul Hackett, chief executive of Southern Housing. The association, which owns 80,000 homes, has put a block on buying new sites. \u201cIn simple terms, the cash we receive from our rents is insufficient to cover all of our costs,\u201d he says. Social landlords in England were promised a 10-year rent settlement in 2012 that would have meant rents rising with inflation, but this was reversed in 2015, with rents cut by 1% for four years. Subsequent inflation-linked rent rises have been capped during the pandemic and cost of living crisis. While this has kept rents down for tenants, it has left holes in the finances of councils and housing associations. Reports suggest the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, could commit to an annual rise in rents of consumer price inflation plus 1% across the next decade in her autumn budget. \u201cPredictability in rent policy is probably the No 1 thing that could help,\u201d says Steve Partridge, director at Savills\u2019 housing consultancy, adding that a 10-year deal would give landlords the confidence to invest. However, Suzanne Muna, the secretary of the Social Housing Action Campaign (Shac), warns the move could force more tenants into arrears. \u201cTwo years ago, rents rose by 7.7% and those inflated rents then went up by another 7% last year. People are already stretched to their limit,\u201d she says. The smaller pool of available cash for development is partly being eroded by the urgent need to spend it on existing homes, to make them safer and improve the terrible conditions some tenants face. Existing homes Since the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire in London in 2017, nearly 2,000 social housing blocks over 11 metres (36ft) in height have been found to have \u201clife-critical fire safety defects\u201d. The fallout has raised questions about safety, with tens of thousands of tenants housed in potential death traps, while criticism has been levelled at councils and housing associations over the slow pace of remediation. The NHF estimates fixing all housing association homes could cost \u00a36bn, while the Local Government Association has put the bill for councils at \u00a37.7bn. But this is not the only scandal that has shifted funds away from new-builds to existing homes. Investigations by campaigners have exposed the terrible conditions some social housing tenants have to endure. The death of Awaab Ishak, a two-year-old boy who died in 2020 after prolonged exposure to damp and mould in his social home in Rochdale, has further pushed the case for improvements. This has led to increased scrutiny, more stringent regulations and added costs. \u201cAwaab\u2019s law\u201d now compels landlords to fix health hazards more quickly, while a review of the decent homes standard, which applies to social housing, is also likely to push landlords to make more improvements. Savills has estimated the sector will need to invest up to \u00a350,000, on average, in every social home over the next three decades to ensure they are safe, high-quality and decarbonised. Robert Colvile, director at the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank, says this has led to a \u201cfinancial crunch\u201d, with providers being asked to renovate and repair existing stock and reduce emissions, while not being able to pass on inflationary costs through rents. \u201cNow, on top of this, the government is saying, \u2018we want you to build more houses\u2019, which they just don\u2019t have the money to do,\u201d he says. Muna at Shac questions the idea that housing associations are facing a cash crisis, pointing to the \u00a33.8bn surplus the sector collectively holds. While associations argue the money is reinvested, Muna says widespread conditions of disrepair show this is not true. \u201cThis idea that it is an impoverished sector ploughing all of its money into supporting its tenants and residents is just not borne out by the facts,\u201d she says, highlighting the significant salaries housing association bosses receive. The average salary of a chief executive at the 100 largest associations is \u00a3164,589, according to Inside Housing. However, it is clear that there has been a slowdown in affordable housing delivery from associations and councils. Government figures show that they started 13,900 homes in England in the three months to July, down 52% year-on-year, and the lowest across the period, excluding the pandemic year, since 2016. Section 106 sales, where affordable housing providers buy stock from private builders, and which account for more than half of all new homes, have also dried up. The Home Builders Federation has said that tens of thousands of new homes are being held up because of a lack of appetite from housing associations to pick up these deals. Partridge believes the promised ramp-up in development could be challenging. \u201cWe are starting from a low base,\u201d he says. To try to turn the tide, Rayner has put forward a complete overhaul of housing policy that is aimed at reinvigorating housebuilding, with a focus on affordable homes. This includes new mandatory housing targets for councils as well as plans to review and release green belt and \u201cgrey belt\u201d land for development. Developments on green belt land will have to meet \u201cgolden rules\u201d that stipulate 50% of the homes built are affordable. Colvile says that while he welcomes Labour\u2019s ambitions, he has concerns that the rules may hit overall numbers. \u201cThat\u2019s great in theory but it could reduce the amount of houses being built, because 50% affordable reduces your profit margins on projects quite substantially and could make some developments unviable.\u201d The government has asked Homes England, its housing delivery body, to prioritise funding social rent homes through its remaining affordable housing budget.

With what Reeves has described as a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances, it will not be able to bear the cost alone. So, are there other untapped sources of investment that could help? Private sector money Jane (not her real name), a 32-year-old single parent, lives with her three children in a three-bedroom house in Oxford. When her youngest son, now three, was born with cerebral palsy and a health official told her that her privately rented house was not suitable for his needs, she went on the council waiting list. \u201cI always assumed that social housing was off the cards just because it would take so long,\u201d she says, but considered herself \u201cquite lucky\u201d to wait just one and a half years. But Jane does not live in a council or a housing association home \u2013 her home was delivered by the pensions provider Legal &amp; General (L&amp;G). In recent years, investment companies, led by L&amp;G and the US asset manager Blackstone, have spotted an opportunity in social and affordable housing, which offers a steady, predictable income stream from rents. L&amp;G set up an affordable housing division five years ago and has built or committed to a total of 8,000 homes, including 9% at social rent. This year, it expects that just under 20% of its new homes to be for social rent. Blackstone\u2019s vehicle Sage Homes, set up in 2017, has a portfolio of 22,500 properties across England bought through section 106 deals, making it England\u2019s largest provider of affordable new homes, it says.

For-profit providers currently own just under 30,000 affordable homes \u2013 less than 1% of affordable housing stock, according to the estate agent Knight Frank, but it expects this figure to hit 86,000 by 2029.

Kick-off at Accor Stadium in Sydney is 7:30pm.</strong></p> <p>Seven months after Daly Cherry-Evans hoisted the season into life in Las Vegas, the two best sides in professional rugby league have made themselves known. And it\u2019s hardly a surprise.</p> <p>The Broncos imploded, the Sharks found their ceiling, and the Roosters were undone by late-season injuries, but throughout, this pair of modern day titans always looked set to collide on the biggest day on the NRL calendar.</p> <p>A fifth grand final appearance in a row might make Penrith\u2019s presence appear foregone, but this was a season that showcased the resilience, as much as the brilliance, of the mountain men. At no point in 2024 did the three-time defending premiers top the ladder, the product of a slow start, a challenging Origin period, and the loss of inspirational halfback Nathan Cleary for long spells.</p> <p>Many other outfits would have found all this too much and used the opportunity to reflect on former glories. Not this group. Instead they crafted a \u201clast dance\u201d narrative around the end-of-season departures of James Fisher-Harris, Sunia Turuva, and Jarome Luai, with the latter instrumental in keeping the Panthers afloat during Cleary\u2019s absence.</p> <p>It\u2019s foolish to question the future of a side about to appear in a fifth consecutive premiership decider, but losing such a crucial trio, after already losing a host of stars from that initial 2020 grand final, means Penrith will start next season as vulnerable as they have in many years. History may well regard this evening as one last hurrah for Ivan Cleary\u2019s masterpiece.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/04/nrl-grand-final-penrith-panthers-fans\">How do we say goodbye to this immortal Panthers team? The only way we know how | James Colley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Standing in the way of a four-peat is the Melbourne Storm machine. Craig Bellamy and the most efficient organisation in rugby league have done it again.</p> <p>But this season, more than any other in this seemingly endless story of 21st century success, has not been about the showstoppers. Cameron Munster and Ryan Papenhuyzen have shown flashes of brilliance, and Harry Grant has been industrious, but it\u2019s been a season built on the work of men in lower salary brackets: the indefatigable Trent Loiero and Josh King, the understated Nick Meaney and Tyran Wishart, and breakout stars Eliesa Katoa and Will Warbrick.</p> <p>Knitting it all together has been Jahrome Hughes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/02/jahrome-hughes-beats-james-tedesco-by-one-point-to-win-nrls-dally-m\">the walk-up Dally M Medallist</a>, who has enjoyed a season of consistency, leadership, bravery, and an unerring ability to rise to the big occasion. It seems inevitable a halfback will win today\u2019s Clive Churchill medal and the outcome of Hughes v Cleary will be decisive in determining the 2024 premiers.</p> <p>I\u2019ll be back with squads and more shortly.

      "bodyText": "As Simply The Best (what else?) blares out around Accor Stadium, I\u2019ll take my leave for the night. And what a night it was, another demonstration of this extraordinary Penrith dynasty. Read more about it here from Angus Fontaine, and stay tuned for plenty of reaction tomorrow and through the week. Thanks for joining me this evening. Catch you in Vegas. The catwalk of champions ends with Nathan Cleary and Isaah Yeo. The latter takes the mic to thank fans and sponsors. The pair then accept the Provan-Summons Trophy from Andrew Abdo and Peter V\u2019landys, taking it over to their teammates and raising it to the sky for the fourth time in a row! A dejected Harry Grant says the right things when he\u2019s invited to speak. Then it\u2019s over to the most heartwarming passage of the night, when the massive footballers accept their premiership rings from kids barely a quarter of their mass. The big Panther is a popular choice, and his curly mop top gets well ruffled by teammates as he makes his way to the dais to accept his award. Nathan Cleary goes around the Melbourne team slapping backs and shaking hands. The Storm were below par tonight, a reflection perhaps of the lack of experience on the biggest of stages? Crucial errors, especially in the first half from the kind of players that drove them throughout the season, proved extremely costly and left too much to do when energy reserves were low. Penrith, by contrast, relished the big stage, upping the intensity as fatigue set in, backing their skills in clinch moments, and their capacity not to make errors made life too difficult for the Storm. Leota, Martin, Edwards, Yeo, and Cleary all excelled, powering their footy club into immortality. Jahrome Hughes is barely audible he\u2019s so dejected. \u201cJust a bit loose in our contact,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cThey got too many quick play-the-balls and you can\u2019t give a team like Penrith anything or they run. \u201cThey\u2019re the best and we\u2019ve seen that the last couple of years. They\u2019re so hard to beat. I don\u2019t know, you need to be on your game for the full 80 to beat them and if you\u2019re not they\u2019re too good and they showed that tonight. \u201cIt was a tough game. Obviously, they\u2019re a great team and they\u2019ve been the best the last couple of years for a reason.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d beams Liam Martin \u2013 a Clive Churchill contender. \u201cIt is a dream come true with this bunch. I\u2019m still pinching myself. Can\u2019t believe it. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just unspoken, I guess. Like, that was tough. That was so hard but we kept turning up for one another and that is it the character of the boys we have here and so special to be part of a group like this.\u201d \u201cLeft on a good note. Left on a good note,\u201d exhales a dazed Jarome Luai. \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re soaking up this moment. Just to win one grand final is so special. This group of guys, no-one works harder than these boys and we got what we deserved. We did it brah.\u201d \u201cWhat an incredible club. Not so long ago the Roosters were lauded for winning two in a row after so many years of single season winners. And that is now 4 in a row for this incredible Panthers club. Sensational stuff.\u201d Hear hear HarryofOz. Astonishing. They rarely hit top gear during the premiership season. They had to cope without their star man for long periods. That star man played hurt during the finals \u2013 and he ran for 200m in the decider! Set after set in attack and defence they were relentless for 80 minutes. What a team. Four NRL premierships in a row for the peerless Penrith Panthers! 79 mins: Penrith win a set restart 5m from Melbourne\u2019s line. Smith then drops a soda, not that it matters. 77 mins: Penrith are going to win a fourth premiership in a row. Incredible dedication and resilience from everyone at the football club. 76 mins: Penrith are turning the screw now. Relentless in possession, offering Melbourne nothing. Then fast off the line in defence, suffocating the Storm at source. Melbourne try to go through hands deep in their own half, but nothing is materialising in broken play with purple jerseys exhausted and pink ones in full flight. 75 mins: A rare break in play for the bunker to determine if Munster, the ball carrier, bit Alamoti, the tackler, while the pair were in close contact on the ground. There\u2019s no clear cut evidence but the Storm half is put on report. 74 mins: Penrith go down the other end and Smith travels a long way after contact to force Melbourne to scramble. Storm barely make halfway, let alone the 95m they need to score a try. 72 mins: The Panthers grind either side of halfway and Coates accepts the kick 10m out and runs to the 20. Can his ball-players unlock this Penrith defence? Nope. Katoa and Loiero run hard, but there\u2019s no creativity or inspiration, then on the last Munster kicks high and the ball dribbles into touch. Storm challenge and replays indicate Alamoti might have got a finger to the ball before it hit touch \u2013 only for the TMO to determine Coates knocked the ball on. The bunker have come up Penrith\u2019s way a couple of times this half at crucial moments. 70 mins: Storm come again from 20m, but it\u2019s all very narrow and linear. Grant almost dives over from dummy half but Melbourne need to expand. Still it\u2019s all one-out stuff \u2013 until tackle four \u2013 and Howarth, who is not having a great grand final, tries to go outside Tago, only to be scragged and then bundled into touch by Alamoti and Cleary. That felt like a real show of force from the Panthers defence. 69 mins: Yes! Harry Grant dashes from dummy half and earns a set restart 40m out. Lazarus Vaalepu carries strongly just after coming on and nears the try line. Is there an opening? Not yet: Munster\u2019s grubber is blocked out of play by Cleary. 67 mins: Storm need a miracle at the other end though, but one does not appear forthcoming as they gasp for air running one-out then kicking on the last. It\u2019s meat and drink for Penrith who absorb the pressure in midfield and grind their way downfield. Every set is draining fuel from the Melbourne tank. Can they find a spark? 66 mins: Storm withstand another full Penrith set in their own defensive territory. Kenny, Martin, Sorensen, all went close, but Melbourne\u2019s miraculous defence holds. 64 mins: Far from To\u2019o\u2019s absence causing an issue, it was his replacement, Alamoti, moving from left centre to right wing, who finished superbly to put Penrith in a dominant position. Just as I type that, To\u2019o is back on the bench ready to return\u2026 and Munster spills the ball. Storm need a serious game changing moment soon if they\u2019re going to remain alive in this grand final. From one of those ding-dong sets starting the wrong side of halfway Penrith score! Cleary launches a bomb on the last. Martin takes Coates and ball in the air, lands, finds Leota, who hurls a beautiful pass to his right for Alamoti to dab the ball into the right corner in full flight, parallel to the ground. That feels significant. Cleary hangs the touchline conversion out to the right, but his side is in very good shape with not long to go in Sydney. 60 mins: Set after set threatens to break open. Warbrick wins another aerial contest but a swarm of pink is waiting for him on the ground. Cleary then breaks the line but can\u2019t streak clear. Melbourne are growing into the contest with every minute, establishing field position and setting themselves up for one final assault. To\u2019o\u2019s injury is a knee complaint. 59 mins: The pace remains relentless and fatigue is sure to kick in soon, but for now, the match has settled into a arm wrestle either side of halfway \u2013 but To\u2019o is leaving the field for the Panthers \u2013 not sure why yet, but that could create an opening for Melbourne. 57 mins: Excellent contested mark from Warbrick after another trademark Penrith set. Melbourne respond with a tidy set of their own, but there\u2019s nothing expansive on the last and no chaser gets within sniffing difference of Edwards. 56 mins: Katoa sets up Melbourne with two superb runs and a neat offload. Storm reach 30m and Blore gets his hands free for Howarth on his outside\u2026 but he spills under pressure. 55 mins: Yeo and Leota bust Melbourne open through the middle forcing Papenhuyzen to scramble, but he does well, and earns a penalty for some needless face-rubbing from Tago on the ground. Silly indiscipline from the Panther letting Storm off the hook. 53 mins: Garner improves what was turning out to be another modest set, allowing Cleary to kick high from 40 that Coates deals with safely. But Melbourne continue to spark! Papenhuyzen and Coates link well on the short side, the left, but Tago tackles well. Hughes then picks the wrong option, grubbering into touch on the right with Warbrick on the chase. 51 mins: Brad Fittler disagrees with Johns, and adds that the bunker has access to many more angles than we see on TV. The game goes on, and Melbourne are renewed, keeping Penrith to a modest set and returning fire on halfway. Hughes goes high on the last, and not for the first time tonight the Panthers don\u2019t contest in the air, simply wrapping up Coates on his return to dry land 10m from home. 50 mins: Melbourne enjoy some rare possession inside Penrith\u2019s half and on the last Munster hoists a bomb to the left corner. Xavier Coates does Xavier Coates things, marking and offloading in mid-air in one move. Howarth is front and square to gather and dive over \u2013 with four pink jerseys hanging off him\u2026 does he get the ball down? Ashley Klein says no. What does the TMO say? No try! Channel 9 was convinced Steeden touched turf. \u201cI\u2019m sure the ball is down!\u201d asserts Andrew Johns. Wow. That will be talked about for a long time. 48 mins: But not quite yet. Katoa tackles Edwards by the fullback\u2019s right arm in the act of passing to force a loose carry. Katoa backs that up with a bullocking run off the back of the scrum. 47 mins: So close for Penrith! A straightforward set ends with a Cleary bomb that Turuva marks majestically over the flat-footed Papenhuyzen. He offloads infield and Henry is held up inches from the line! Storm make it barely 25m before Hughes is forced to kick. The Panthers are relentless. At some point soon they are going to bust this game wide open and streak away into history. 45 mins: Better from Melbourne with Munster, Meaney, and Wishart all making decent ground, allowing Hughes to send up a rare attacking kick. Coates competes \u2013 and Edwards knocks on! The Panthers are challenging, for the second time tonight, and it\u2019s a successful one, with replays showing a clear Coates knock-on in mid-air. 43 mins: Storm survive the first sortie when Munster gathers the grubber on the last, but already Melbourne\u2019s middle forwards look gassed. Hughes tries to give them a chop out, and Munster kicks dangerously, but the minor premiers are attacking in quicksand. The Panthers by contrast are hitting every line on the burst and working their foes over like Floyd Mayweather. 42 mins: \u2026 but it\u2019s another error from Melbourne and the youngster Howarth, who was at fault for the try just before half-time and now he\u2019s stripped one-on-one by Martin coming out of defence. The pink siege resumes. 41 mins: Straightforward restart set from the Panthers, who haven\u2019t lost a finals match after leading at the break for 20 years. The sides are back out for the final 40 minutes of the 2024 season. Nathan Cleary, the flashy halfback with the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 shoulder, leads all comers with 148m running metres from a game high 20 hit-ups. Brilliance comes in many forms, but such bloody mindedness is magnificent. It\u2019s happening very differently to last year\u2019s grand final, but another Clive Churchill medal is on the cards. Both sides completed 17/20 sets, but Penrith dominated time in possession 17 minutes to 13, and averaged almost 20m per set more than Melbourne. It was only some desperate defence that kept the Storm in touching distance but that effort would have taken an awful lot out of them, especially the middle forwards. That was an extraordinarily fast half of footy. There was barely a stoppage and both sides were fast at the ruck. Penrith deservedly lead but Melbourne will be delighted they\u2019re still in touching distance. Still all to play for. Hughes and Munster make ground with neat darts but Warbrick makes a mess of a tap back on the last tackle and the Panthers are not forced into any defensive uncertainty. Back they come up the guts with serious intent, and Cleary again carrying the ball into the line. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s doing it to prove a point. And it works a treat. On the last, Cleary jogs into the line, steps outside Blore on the right, draws in Howarth with his eyes, and slips Martin through a massive hole and over the line. From 20m right of the posts, Cleary adds the extras and sends Penrith to the sheds four points to the good. 38 mins: So much fatigue on the field as Cleary again runs the ball into contact. The Penrith schemer is back on his feet to bomb on the last, but it\u2019s unthreatening and the Storm\u2019s magnificent defence does its job once again. 36 mins: Storm are treading water in possession, waiting for the next pink wave to crash over them. But Penrith lack penetration for a set and Coates is strong under the high ball on the last. Even so, they only make it 30m before Hughes is forced to kick \u2013 but what a kick it is! Long and shallow and behind Turuva, allowing his chasers to lay a tackle on the 20m line. 34 mins: Penrith are going through the gears. Cleary again accepts contact, drawing bodies to him on the right allowing Luai to almost feed Sorensen through a hole. Melbourne continue their extraordinary defence and are fortunate to see Coates spill a bomb backwards to Munster when a knock-on looked a possible call. 32 mins: Melbourne with a rare straightforward set, but Penrith\u2019s speed at the ruck sees them hurtle downfield in a hurry. Cleary runs on the last again and unlocks the right edge with Tago almost sending To\u2019o over in the corner. Storm\u2019s scramble defence has been incredible, and it\u2019s needed to be. You can sense the dam bursting soon though, the Panthers have all the run. 31 mins: Penrith are soon at the 10m line and on the last Luai dabs through the line for the chasing Turuva\u2026 he gathers, and looks certain to score \u2013 only for Katoa to land a potentially match-saving tackle! Unbelievable effort from the second-rower, slapping the ball out of the Penrith winger\u2019s grasp while executing the hit. Storm are in desperate need of a breather. 29 mins: Papenhuyzen with his second poor kick of the night \u2013 this time belting the restart out on the full. \u201cThat is such a bad error,\u201d bemoans Andrew Johns on TV. \u201cYou just can\u2019t get that wrong.\u201d Storm immediately back under the pump after a three-set effort just moments ago. Storm repel almost a full set with more superb defence, but there\u2019s a set restart on tackle five as the Panthers try to keep the ball alive in broken play. Surely Penrith score here \u2013 and they do! A couple of hit-ups under the crossbar allows Cleary time and space to hit Alamoti, who catches, spins, and passes in one motion, freeing Luai who has Turuva on his outside to fly over with a strong low dive in the left corner. Superb hands, and an unsurprising score. Cleary tugs his touchline conversion to the near side of the uprights. 25 mins: Melbourne do little with the restart set but once again reveal Blore targeting Cleary on Storm\u2019s left edge. Penrith risk little in their set but the dynamism of their pack and speed of the play-the-ball ensures there\u2019s plenty of intent. And the crowd raises many decibels when Warbrick makes an absolute mess of Luai\u2019s bomb on the last to invite another full red zone set. 24 mins: Hughes had little to do with the attacking set that led to the opening score of the night, but the Dally M medallist\u2019s massive kick was the catalyst. And from that unexpected attacking set Melbourne score! Blore with the hit-up on the 10m line, drawing two markers, allowing Grant to snipe from dummy-half, step outside the slow Fisher-Harris, and inside the labouring Martin, and over the line. Classic Harry Grant. Meaney swings over a tidy conversion midway between the posts and the left touchline. 22 mins: Papenhuyzen loses possession in contact. Klein awards a penalty. Penrith challenge \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 but the TMO considers insufficient evidence to make a call so the Panthers retain their challenge. Hughes bombs fully 50m downfield to set up a surprise attacking set inside 30m! 21 mins: Yes! That was a superb defensive set from the Storm, following runners left and right and laying crucial tackles at the right times, ending with Munster wrapping up Cleary as Penrith went all Harlem Globetrotters. 20 mins: Melbourne have been doing well to just hang on in defence over the past few minutes with Penrith runners almost breaking the line \u2013 Edwards the latest. In the red zone, the Panthers recycle possession well and a neat Tago kick on the list forces Coates to concede a line drop-out. Papenhuyzen\u2019s kick is too wide and the triple-premiers will have a full set under the crossbar. Can the Storm hold out? 18 mins: Penrith reach Melbourne\u2019s 30 on tackle four but a connection goes awry in midfield and Melbourne survive. Not for long though as McDonald, just on for Kamakamica, spills his first carry. This game is ready to open up. Tired bodies making errors all over the place. 16 mins: Hughes kicks long to release the pressure but every Penrith runner gains metres after contact to march downfield. Cleary bombs to Coates to who is unceremoniously pummelled by Martin. Melbourne look gassed. Fortunately Munster is having a day out and he interchanges with Grant and Hughes to reach halfway. Storm try to break down the right but the handling is sloppy and the Panthers retake possession. After a much needed breather. 14 mins: Alamoti is almost fed through the line. Then Martin. Leota finds an offload with three men hanging off him and the Panthers are 5m out under the posts on the last. Edwards kicks to the right corner \u2013 somehow the ball is tapped backwards and is not knocked forward despite a couple of pink fumbles. Yeo almost wriggles through a gap in broken field\u2026 but he\u2019s hauled in. This is so fast and intense. A crucial mistake is surely imminent with fatigue starting to set in. 12 mins: Howarth coughs it up! Tackle four, on the left edge, and Blore does well to find an offload but Howarth is stripped in contact by Martin. That error is then compounded by King interfering on the ground and a long spell of Melbourne pressure is released. 11 mins: Melbourne counter with intensity. Munster \u2013 superb early \u2013 earns a six-again on halfway and Storm hurl into the Panthers only to find Edwards well placed on the last and strong enough to withstand Warbrick one-on-one on the line. Penrith try to run clear but Meaney steals one-on-one on the 40m line! 9 mins: For the second set in a row Munster is busy with ball in hand and a Melbourne jumper \u2013 Meaney \u2013 claims an uncontested mark only to be immediately smothered by pink jerseys. Penrith are again dynamic through the middle, reaching halfway before Cleary tries to run on the last. He\u2019s scragged and offloads into broken field that the Panthers use to attack down the left, but the chip and chase is easily dealt with. 7 mins: Munster is lively sending Melbourne deep into Penrith territory but after a Storm flyer plucks the bomb out the sky the Panthers deny the offload and we\u2019re back on an even keel. The Panthers are then back into their attacking work quickly, getting quick ruck ball creating space for Luai to almost bust through. This is being played at a blistering pace. 5 mins: Yeo almost! With a full set inside Melbourne\u2019s 40, Penrith don\u2019t show their hand but still manage to send Leota into the line 10m from home with space to find an offload \u2013 but as he\u2019s falling to the ground the pass to Yeo just misses the mark and Melbourne escape. It\u2019s a double escape too with Cleary pinged for a lazy high clothesline on Papenhuyzen. 4 mins: Melbourne gain little ground on their second set courtesy of a strong gang tackle on Coates. Katoa does well to drive Storm near halfway and allow Hughes to bomb to Edwards. The Panthers get a series of quick play-the-balls \u2013 and on the last get a set restart with Storm trying to slow things down! 2 mins: Excellent first hit-up from Kamikamica. Katoa then hits the line, followed by a long couple of passes to Blore to allow him to test Cleary\u2019s shoulder early. The set is completed without scare for either side. Penrith then return safely with no frills. Annnnd breathe. The 2024 NRL grand final is under way\u2026 Welcome to Country and Advance Australia Fair taken care of the two sides move into huddles, Penrith brimming with intent, Melbourne much more circumspect. The camera follows the most significant protagonist, Nathan Cleary. Here we go! Now come the Storm, to the soundtrack of plenty of boos. Harry Grant leads the way with a nervous smile on his face. AC/DC on the PA system tells us kick-off is imminent. With fireworks and pyrotechnics and smoke machines and noise turning Accor Sydney into a frenzy, out come the Panthers, led by Isaah Yeo. Ooof! That was a superb entrance. The Penrith players looked hyped! These sides have met twice already this season, with Storm coming out on top on both occasions. The first was way back in round one when the Panthers were caught cold following their trip to the UK for the World Club Challenge, then later in round 24 when Nick Meaney\u2019s boot sealed a narrow victory after a ding-dong affair. There\u2019s unlikely to be much in it again this evening. I\u2019m not a fan of the actor-narrated pregame hype movie, but Channel Nine have just nailed tonight\u2019s, featuring Ben Mendelsohn stroking a pub in Huddersfield. Superb delivery. It\u2019s been a warm spring day in Sydney, giving way to a mild and dry evening. There\u2019s a whisper of a westerly breeze but it shouldn\u2019t cause either fullback any concern under the high ball. From one kid to another a 45-year-old with male pattern baldness. For the third time in his career Ashley Klein will referee an NRL grand final. Klein also refereed all three State of Origins this year and recently celebrated his 400th game in the middle. The Kid Laroi: 6/10. Lad\u2019s got presence. Good luck to him. The Kid Laroi has moved away from his identical-sounding synth-pop hits and moved into a cover of Never Tear Us Apart by INXS. He\u2019s got decent pipes, but the arrangement around him is pants, and his voice is lost in the mix. If someone half my age could email in and tell me if this is any good or not, I\u2019d be grateful. To my middle-age ears, it\u2019s perfectly fine mid-tempo FM radio noise. And he gets the benefit of any doubt from me because he\u2019s a Sydneysider (and a rugby league fan). You can guess how I felt about Katy Perry in Melbourne last week. Pregame entertainment headliner The Kid Laroi is now in the middle of Accor Stadium, being all young and cool. As he prepares for his record-equalling 10th grand final Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy has flagged he might only have a few years left in first grade. If the man who made Melbourne does bow out sooner rather than later, where does he stand in the Australian coaching hall of fame? If one Jarome is responsible for the Panthers reaching the grand final, another Ja[h]rome deserves equivalent praise for the Storm. This has been a defining season for the Kiwi halfback. Yet the NRL career of the 29-year-old (he turns 30 next week) was never a sure thing when he struggled to crack first grade at Gold Coast and North Queensland. His first tentative steps at the Storm were at fullback but, since locking down the No 7 jersey in 2019, he has steadily risen to become the team\u2019s most dangerous player. Given that his side includes Cam Munster, Ryan Papenhuyzen and Grant, and are widely considered an even chance against the Panthers this Sunday, reaching that status is not insignificant. In Cleary\u2019s absence, Jarome Luai stepped up for the Panthers, showing a maturity and game management his army of critics did not think he was capable of. Luai is the most misunderstood man in rugby league. His competitive personality and determination to defend his teammates has meant he has become the NRL\u2019s chief villain. The Panthers\u2019 dominance has cultivated envy around the league, and the No 6\u2019s tendency to live life on the edge has made him an easy figure to hate. \u201cGood afternoon Jonathan,\u201d great to have you on board HarryofOz. \u201cWell here we are just 45 minutes or so away from the kick-off. I\u2019m really looking forward to the clash of the two best teams in the comp this season. Cleary v Hughes and the battle of the spines - should be a cracker. And don\u2019t ask me to pick a winner, this is just too close to call. What do you think?\u201d I think if Nathan Cleary plays 80 minutes Penrith win. He\u2019s too clutch, and the Panthers spine is too strong in a one-off contest. However, Melbourne are clearly going to target the No. 7, and if they land a big shot early, or Cleary slips awkwardly off a tackle, like he did against the Sharks, then he might not see the game out. In which case, I\u2019d edge towards the Storm. Nathan Cleary missed State of Origin, sat out large chunks of the season, and has had to play through pain all year, but the game\u2019s greatest modern player will still be the most crucial participant tonight. The 26-year-old has played just 12 games this season, his lowest tally across nine seasons in the NRL. The knee injury he suffered in last season\u2019s grand final affected his off season, and then a serious hamstring complaint meant he played just two games between rounds three and 20. His shoulder injury a month later kept him out for another three weeks, but he has returned and managed it during the finals. Yet Cleary\u2019s left shoulder remains one of the grand final\u2019s major talking points. He was taken off in the final minutes in the preliminary final against Cronulla after appearing to aggravate it in a tackle, and respected NRL injury analyst Brian Seeney has described the problem \u2013 which makes a recurrence more likely \u2013 as a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d. Looking at those two powerful line-ups, here\u2019s where Angus Fontaine sees the game being won and lost. The Cameron Munster v Liam Martin sideshow promises to be particularly interesting. Munster said this week that he and Martin \u201cdidn\u2019t like each other\u201d even when they were teammates for Australia. \u201cI thought we were fine, but obviously that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Martin responded. \u201cIf he feels like that, then that\u2019s his problem. It won\u2019t change anything on Sunday.\u201d The toss has just been made and the Panthers will kick off. Hopefully Tui Kamikamica or Eliesa Katoa walk away from that first collision unscathed. Ivan Cleary\u2019s starting 13 is his best available, but Brad Schneider\u2019s presence on the bench is testament Nathan Cleary will not start at 100% fitness following a recurrence of his shoulder injury last week. Scott Sorensen has been passed fit to start following a late fitness test. Matt Eisenhuth is the unlucky 18th man. 1. Dylan Edwards 2. Sunia Turuva 3. Izack Tago 4. Paul Alamoti 5. Brian To\u2019o 6.

Luke Garner Reserve: 17. Matt Eisenhuth Craig Bellamy can call on 16 of his preferred 17 squad members this evening, but the man missing out is a big loss \u2013 literally, and metaphorically - with Nelson Asofa-Solomona suspended for his hit on Lindsay Collins in the opening minute of the preliminary final. We\u2019ve seen the imposing Panthers pack strongarm sides in big finals, and it will be up to Lazarus Vaalepu to withstand that heat in only his seventh first grade appearance. The Penrith-born prop only debuted in round 20. 1. Ryan Papenhuyzen 2. Will Warbrick 3. Jack Howarth 4. Nick Meaney 5. Xavier Coates 6. Cameron Munster 7. Jahrome Hughes 8. Tui Kamikamica 9.

Grant Anderson As fans take their seats, the Olympic Stadium is playing host to a tribute to this year\u2019s retirees. Among them, Dale Finucane, Shaun Johnson, and Wade Graham. As the nominal away side, Penrith will be in their iconic pink change jersey. As the home team, Melbourne will run out this evening in their traditional navy and purple with lightning accents. Jack Snape sets the scene for a grand final that could determine just whose era this really is. Four years ago the Storm won the only grand final between the pair, watched by half a stadium due to Covid, but only narrowly. The Panthers\u2019 roaring 20-point comeback left them just short, and they departed Homebush with all the momentum but without a trophy. They would sustain the excellence of that second half for three years, their run of premierships securing them the loftiest status in the sport. But their dynasty will not look the same if Melbourne win on Sunday. The Panthers would leave this half decade of grand final appearances three from five, but with two losses to the Storm. The murmurs would be immediate: perhaps this is just as much Melbourne\u2019s era as it is Penrith\u2019s. Indeed, the Storm were minor premiers in 2021 before the Panthers narrowly beat them in the preliminary final. They were on top of the table in 2022 until injuries curtailed their season which ended with three straight losses. The Panthers\u2019 dominance over the Storm last year, culminating in a preliminary final walloping, has been a key part of Melbourne\u2019s motivation this year: the impact of the 2020 grand final, but in reverse. Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of Melbourne Storm v Penrith Panthers in the 2024 NRL grand final. Kick-off at Accor Stadium in Sydney is 7:30pm. Seven months after Daly Cherry-Evans hoisted the season into life in Las Vegas, the two best sides in professional rugby league have made themselves known. And it\u2019s hardly a surprise. The Broncos imploded, the Sharks found their ceiling, and the Roosters were undone by late-season injuries, but throughout, this pair of modern day titans always looked set to collide on the biggest day on the NRL calendar. A fifth grand final appearance in a row might make Penrith\u2019s presence appear foregone, but this was a season that showcased the resilience, as much as the brilliance, of the mountain men. At no point in 2024 did the three-time defending premiers top the ladder, the product of a slow start, a challenging Origin period, and the loss of inspirational halfback Nathan Cleary for long spells. Many other outfits would have found all this too much and used the opportunity to reflect on former glories. Not this group. Instead they crafted a \u201clast dance\u201d narrative around the end-of-season departures of James Fisher-Harris, Sunia Turuva, and Jarome Luai, with the latter instrumental in keeping the Panthers afloat during Cleary\u2019s absence. It\u2019s foolish to question the future of a side about to appear in a fifth consecutive premiership decider, but losing such a crucial trio, after already losing a host of stars from that initial 2020 grand final, means Penrith will start next season as vulnerable as they have in many years. History may well regard this evening as one last hurrah for Ivan Cleary\u2019s masterpiece. Standing in the way of a four-peat is the Melbourne Storm machine. Craig Bellamy and the most efficient organisation in rugby league have done it again. But this season, more than any other in this seemingly endless story of 21st century success, has not been about the showstoppers. Cameron Munster and Ryan Papenhuyzen have shown flashes of brilliance, and Harry Grant has been industrious, but it\u2019s been a season built on the work of men in lower salary brackets: the indefatigable Trent Loiero and Josh King, the understated Nick Meaney and Tyran Wishart, and breakout stars Eliesa Katoa and Will Warbrick. Knitting it all together has been Jahrome Hughes, the walk-up Dally M Medallist, who has enjoyed a season of consistency, leadership, bravery, and an unerring ability to rise to the big occasion. It seems inevitable a halfback will win today\u2019s Clive Churchill medal and the outcome of Hughes v Cleary will be decisive in determining the 2024 premiers. I\u2019ll be back with squads and more shortly. If you\u2019d like to get in touch while I\u2019m on, please fire all communication to jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com.",

Any sensible politician would want the relationship between the UK and the EU to be as cordial as possible. There were plenty of warm words from von der Leyen, too.</p> <p>Whether the warm words will amount to much in practical terms is another matter entirely. Starmer has made it clear there are red lines he will not cross. He has no intention of taking Britain back into the single market or the customs union, and he is also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/eu-pushes-keir-starmer-to-open-door-to-youth-mobility-scheme-as-pm-heads-to-brussels\">resisting EU pressure for a youth mobility deal</a>.</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s caution is understandable.

But, as a new academic paper shows, it will be important if the government is to make good on its pledge that the benefits of more rapid growth are to be shared equally across the regions of the UK.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://fothergillandgore.wordpress.com/\">study</a>, by Steve Fothergill and Tony Gore of the Centre for Regional Economic and Social Research at Sheffield Hallam University, looks at job creation in the former coalfields of England and Wales between the two most recent censuses of 2011 and 2021. This period was chosen because it is only census data that provides detailed information about what is happening to local labour markets.

      "bodyText": "Politics is hard because it invariably involves making choices between conflicting objectives. As Keir Starmer is discovering, the need to prioritise means you can\u2019t please all of the people all of the time. Labour wants faster growth, sounder public finances, decarbonisation, prosperity to be shared more evenly between the regions, tougher controls on migration and a reset of Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU. Doing all these things simultaneously is near to impossible. An example of the dilemmas these conflicting policy objectives can create was on show last week when the prime minister travelled to Brussels for talks with the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. Starmer stressed that he wanted a more constructive approach, to \u201cturn the page\u201d, and to do business in a more \u201crespectful way\u201d \u2013 all of which is easy to say. Any sensible politician would want the relationship between the UK and the EU to be as cordial as possible. There were plenty of warm words from von der Leyen, too. Whether the warm words will amount to much in practical terms is another matter entirely. Starmer has made it clear there are red lines he will not cross. He has no intention of taking Britain back into the single market or the customs union, and he is also resisting EU pressure for a youth mobility deal. Starmer\u2019s caution is understandable. He is reluctant to make concessions on mobility at a time when public concern about migration is running so high. Better relations with the EU is one objective but they come lower down the prime minister\u2019s list of priorities than controlling the number of people coming to Britain from overseas. Limiting net migration is a highly charged political issue and particularly troublesome for parties of the left. But, as a new academic paper shows, it will be important if the government is to make good on its pledge that the benefits of more rapid growth are to be shared equally across the regions of the UK. The study, by Steve Fothergill and Tony Gore of the Centre for Regional Economic and Social Research at Sheffield Hallam University, looks at job creation in the former coalfields of England and Wales between the two most recent censuses of 2011 and 2021. This period was chosen because it is only census data that provides detailed information about what is happening to local labour markets. Scotland was excluded because it held its latest census in 2022, but the authors believe their conclusions hold true there also. What the study shows is that while 184,000 jobs were created over that decade in the parts of England and Wales hit hardest by deindustrialisation, almost half of them (46%) went to workers born outside the UK. In Yorkshire, where employment growth was the strongest, only 42% of the new jobs went to UK-born workers. The argument in favour of free movement \u2013 that without the migrant workers the economy would have grown more slowly and fewer jobs created \u2013 does not apply to the former coalfields, where much of the job creation has been in warehousing. Growth of this sector in places such as Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire has been driven by easy access to Britain\u2019s transport network and by the availability of big areas of flat land, often former pits. \u201cIf there had been no supply of migrant workers from outside the UK the growth in warehousing would probably still have gone ahead in these places but the employers would have had to recruit locally, perhaps with better pay and conditions, and perhaps with a higher degree of automation too rather than just a reliance on cheap labour,\u201d Fothergill and Gore conclude. They say that if international migration had been lower it would have meant lower levels of unemployment and economic inactivity, fewer coalfield residents commuting to find work, and less of a brain drain as people left to take up job opportunities in other parts of Britain. There is evidence that some employers have made recruiting outside the UK their first choice. Employers preferred non-UK workers because they were young, fit, and prepared to accept low wages and poor conditions. Between 2011 and 2021, considerable work on regeneration was under way. There was money for training, infrastructure, business support and reclamation of old collieries. Fothergill and Gore note the real progress made but say \u2013 quite rightly \u2013 that the fact that 46% of job creation was accounted for by non-UK-born workers is a poor rate of return for the effort, energy and funding. Starmer is aware of the devastating and lasting impact of deindustrialisation on parts of Britain that boasted thriving local economies half a century ago. Only last week, he recalled how as a lawyer he tried to help the families of miners as the pits were being closed down. \u201cI worked with families and communities who were going to lose their jobs in a really important industry, and I therefore know first-hand what this country lost when we ended coal in that way.\u201d The mines are never coming back but if the government is serious about levelling up, Fothergill and Gore say it needs to invest more in regeneration, do more to tackle the skills deficit, clamp down on bad employers, and step up attempts to help the long-term sick back into the labour market. They also say the evidence of their study supports Starmer\u2019s insistence that there should be no return to free movement and a tightening up of migration rules.

Asked whether the plans could be delayed, the Treasury issued a statement from a government spokesman that did not address the question directly: \u201cWe want to ensure all children have the best chance in life to succeed. Ending tax breaks on private schools will help to raise the revenue needed to fund our education priorities for next year, such as recruiting 6,500 new teachers. \u201cThe government has carefully considered representations on this policy and will publish a response to the consultation at the budget.\u201d Sources said only that the plans would be introduced \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. In its submission to the Treasury consultation, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the leading professional UK body on aspects of taxation, said: \u201cWe are concerned that neither HMRC [HM Revenue and Customs] nor the private schools will be ready to implement the change in VAT liability effectively with a commencement date of 1 January 2025. \u201cAs there is currently no tax information and impact note or published guidance, with an implementation date of 1 January 2025 that is effectively shortened by schools closing mid-December, we recommend that the implementation date be delayed accordingly.\u201d The Association of Taxation Technicians said: \u201cThe proposed commencement date of 1 January does not give sufficient time for schools or HMRC to adequately prepare and deliver the proposed changes. Commencing partway through an academic year could also introduce additional difficulties for schools and pupils. Consideration should be given to deferring commencement to September 2025.\u201d Julie Robinson, chief executive of the Independent Schools Council, said: \u201cEven those who are in favour of imposing VAT on the independent sector are saying that January 1 is not feasible.\u201d \u2022 This article, first published on 5 October 2024, was amended on 6 October 2024 to reflect that, after publication, the Treasury said that it would be sticking to its original 1 January 2025 deadline for the imposition of VAT on private school fees.",

When the person first started using these vapes, they described the effects as \u201cstrong but enjoyable\u201d, says Craft, but after a while, they started developing stomach cramps and irritability. \u201cThen when they tried to stop, they started experiencing symptoms that are really consistent with synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal.

Peace\u2019s lab <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9564187/\">has studied the contents of vapes</a> seized from a person who was arrested after experiencing schizophrenia-like symptoms. Her lab found the vapes contained semi-synthetic cannabinoids like THC-O.</p> <p>Jim Crotty, a former DEA deputy chief of staff, says that SCs are appealing to illicit manufacturers because they are incredibly cheap to make and to sell. Instead of growing fields, manufacturers can make SC vapes with packets of powders they buy online.</p> <p>Crotty says these products could be appealing to \u201cvulnerable populations with limited income like youth and unhoused people\u201d, who might find legal dispensary products unaffordable.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear how big this problem is, partly because consumers themselves are unlikely to know they are using contaminated products. Peace says most consumers will \u201cwalk into any store\u201d and assume that someone has made sure whatever they are buying has been tested for safety. But there is not yet federal regulation for the legal hemp market \u2013 \u201cnobody\u2019s watching\u201d, what manufacturers put in their products, says Peace.</p> <p>Crotty adds that cannabis is an easy drug to fake, because it\u2019s so unpredictable.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fall neatly into any one of the drug categories, right? Because depending on the amount, the potency, the individual that\u2019s using it, it could lead to different effects,\u201d he explained, adding that cannabis can feel like a stimulant, a depressant, a hallucinogen, or a little bit of all three.</p> <p>Craft says that SCs can seem similar to natural cannabis, especially in very small doses, like in the vaporizers they studied. But, he said, the risk of \u201ccardiovascular problems, the lack of consciousness and the acute psychotic symptoms are going to be far higher\u201d.</p> <p>At the moment, it is very difficult to tell if unregulated hemp products are labeled accurately in the US. Peace says that if you live in a state with legal recreational cannabis, you are much safer buying products from an authorized dispensary, although these <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-06-14/the-dirty-secret-of-californias-legal-weed\">are not entirely without risk</a> either.</p> <p>Legal and industry efforts are under way to bring safety standards for currently unregulated hemp products at least up to par with the state-legal cannabis industry.

      "bodyText": "A new study from the University of Bath revealed that seven vaporizers claiming to contain cannabis actually contained a much more dangerous \u201csynthetic cannabinoid\u201d (SC) compound. Earlier this year, the same lab published a study showing that over one in six vaporizers confiscated from schoolchildren across the UK also contained SCs. Sam Craft, an author on both studies, says his team decided to investigate the contents of seven vapes that one person presented to a drug and alcohol service after experiencing strange effects. The person \u201cwas an experienced cannabis smoker\u201d, says Craft, and they had decided to switch to vaping because they thought it would be less harmful. Cannabis is illegal in the UK without a prescription, but this person got the vaporizers from a friend who sourced them from the US. When the person first started using these vapes, they described the effects as \u201cstrong but enjoyable\u201d, says Craft, but after a while, they started developing stomach cramps and irritability. \u201cThen when they tried to stop, they started experiencing symptoms that are really consistent with synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal. Panic attacks, severe anxiety, things like that.\u201d Analysis of the vapes revealed that all of them contained the SC 5F-MDMB-PICA. There are hundreds of different SCs \u2013 officially named with these letter-number combinations, and referred to colloquially as \u201cK2\u201d, \u201cSpice\u201d and other slang terms. Unlike natural cannabis, they are frequently associated with severe negative outcomes, including seizures and fatal overdoses. In England and Wales, SCs were responsible for nearly half of unnatural prison deaths from 2015-2020. SCs are also illegal in the UK and the US. Still, they are showing up in the unregulated US hemp market that emerged as the result of the 2018 Farm bill, which inadvertently legalized all cannabis-derived products containing less than .3% delta 9 THC, cannabis\u2019s most well-known psychoactive component. SCs are distinct from semi-synthetic cannabinoids, like THC-O, and sometimes HHC and Delta-8 THC, which can be made by combining natural cannabis extracts with synthetic materials, and which are legal in much of the US. That doesn\u2019t mean they are without risk, according to Michelle Peace, a professor in the department of forensic science at Virginia Commonwealth University. Peace\u2019s lab has studied the contents of vapes seized from a person who was arrested after experiencing schizophrenia-like symptoms. Her lab found the vapes contained semi-synthetic cannabinoids like THC-O. Jim Crotty, a former DEA deputy chief of staff, says that SCs are appealing to illicit manufacturers because they are incredibly cheap to make and to sell. Instead of growing fields, manufacturers can make SC vapes with packets of powders they buy online. Crotty says these products could be appealing to \u201cvulnerable populations with limited income like youth and unhoused people\u201d, who might find legal dispensary products unaffordable. It\u2019s unclear how big this problem is, partly because consumers themselves are unlikely to know they are using contaminated products. Peace says most consumers will \u201cwalk into any store\u201d and assume that someone has made sure whatever they are buying has been tested for safety. But there is not yet federal regulation for the legal hemp market \u2013 \u201cnobody\u2019s watching\u201d, what manufacturers put in their products, says Peace. Crotty adds that cannabis is an easy drug to fake, because it\u2019s so unpredictable. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t fall neatly into any one of the drug categories, right? Because depending on the amount, the potency, the individual that\u2019s using it, it could lead to different effects,\u201d he explained, adding that cannabis can feel like a stimulant, a depressant, a hallucinogen, or a little bit of all three. Craft says that SCs can seem similar to natural cannabis, especially in very small doses, like in the vaporizers they studied. But, he said, the risk of \u201ccardiovascular problems, the lack of consciousness and the acute psychotic symptoms are going to be far higher\u201d. At the moment, it is very difficult to tell if unregulated hemp products are labeled accurately in the US. Peace says that if you live in a state with legal recreational cannabis, you are much safer buying products from an authorized dispensary, although these are not entirely without risk either. Legal and industry efforts are under way to bring safety standards for currently unregulated hemp products at least up to par with the state-legal cannabis industry. The Cannabinoid Safety and Regulation act, introduced in Congress in September, would empower the FDA to regulate hemp products. Some cannabis brands are taking it upon themselves to ensure products only contain what they say they do. The recreational cannabis brand Wana launched a direct-to-consumer platform that sells vetted hemp products, and also educates consumers on what products are safe. \u201cWe apply the same rigor of testing, transparency and ingredients to the hemp side as we are to the regulated markets,\u201d says Joe Hodas, the Wana CEO. But, he says, \u201cit\u2019s a tough and lonely road\u201d, in a side of the industry that seems largely unconcerned with safety.",

      "body": "<p>After keeping vigil all night, Jason Fesperman, 32, decided it was finally safe to sleep. By 6am last Friday, he figured that the worst of the rain from Hurricane Helene had passed. Jonathan Creek, the normally ankle-deep stream that runs through his backyard in Maggie Valley, North Carolina, had stayed within its banks \u2013 though barely.</p> <p>Just over two hours later, his wife Dan woke him in a panic. Heavy rain continued past 9am in Maggie Valley, and by 8.30am, floodwaters were rising fast. Their home was underwater up to the windows.</p> <p>\u201cWater was filling up, I would say, probably about an inch a minute,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it was pouring in, from the toilets, the windows, both doors.\u201d</p> <p>Blindly stuffing clean laundry into a bag, he joined his wife and seven-year-old son outside and somehow managed to start the Jeep, which was underwater to the hood. Now, the family is staying at an evacuation shelter with 30 other storm survivors, wondering what comes next.</p> <p>Fesperman and his family are some of the lucky ones \u2013 they made it out with their lives. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/03/hurricane-helene-death-toll-power-outages\">More than 200 people</a> have now been confirmed dead, both in Florida where the hurricane first made landfall and across a five-state region in the southern Appalachians that includes North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia. That number continues to rise as search and rescue efforts remain ongoing. The disaster has destroyed towns, inflicted billions of dollars in damage, and prompted Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to visit the stricken region.</p>    <p>The catastrophe has unfolded in an area that was not meant to bear the brunt of Helene\u2019s power, unleashing effects worse than the fabled flood of 1916. But the climate crisis has upended traditional models of hurricane season \u2013 generating storms that are faster, wetter and more powerful.</p> <p>Already a powerful storm on its own, Helene\u2019s impact was bolstered by record-setting rains in the days preceding its arrival. Western North Carolina, which saw some of the worst effects, had been grappling with <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2024/07/11/north-carolina-drought-conditions-worsen-extreme\">drought</a> for over two months before the storm\u2019s arrival. But heavy rains on Wednesday and Thursday saturated the soils and swelled the rivers. A weather station at the Asheville airport reported nearly 10 inches of rain over that two-day period.</p> <p>Helene made landfall on the Florida Gulf coast as a category 4 hurricane and moved rapidly north. Hurricane-force winds and tornadoes swept through many of the affected communities, toppling trees and power lines, but water was by far the more destructive force.</p> <p>Average rainfall varies widely within the mountain region, but in many places it falls somewhere between 40in and 100in annually. Between 8am last Thursday and 8am on Monday, <a href=\"https://x.com/NWSGSP/status/1840088090184167431\">rainfalls north of 10in</a> were common across western North Carolina. Hendersonville and Spruce Pine saw more than 20in, and Busick, an unincorporated community an hour north-east of Asheville, recorded an unprecedented 30.78in. These totals are in line with the forecast, said Steve Wilkinson, meteorologist-in-charge for the National Weather Service forecast office in Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina. But it was difficult to comprehend the scale of devastation such a storm would unleash.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you start talking about really specific impacts, it\u2019s hard to have imagination ahead of time that something this extreme could have the impact it did,\u201d he said.</p> <p>When rain falls on the coast, it\u2019s able to spread out over flat land, absorb into coastal marshes, and eventually drain back into the ocean. But in the mountains, water must follow topography, searching for the path of least resistance as it charges downhill. Heavy rains in the upper elevations gather force as they descend, converging with runoff from other swollen tributaries to turn creeks and rivers into roaring oceans.</p> <p>The water rushed through with devastating force, realigning riverbeds, ripping out roads, and obliterating entire communities. Wind gusts, in many places between 50 and 70mph, toppled trees and power lines already unsteady in the saturated soil. High flow on the Broad River combined with heavy local runoff to all but wipe the tourist town of Chimney Rock off the map. Just over the state line in Erwin, Tennessee, a raging Nolichucky River destroyed the town\u2019s hospital and industrial park, also tearing out part of nearby Interstate 26.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re just a mourning community,\u201d said Erwin\u2019s mayor, Glenn White. \u201cWe are just heartbroken that our friends lost their lives. That\u2019s the biggest issue for all of us.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s been a week since the storm hit, and the scale of damage is still unknown.</p>    <p>The death toll continues to rise as first responders search for the missing and make their way into communities rendered unreachable. Helene caused near-complete cellphone and internet outages throughout the region, and some services have yet to be restored. Many people remain without power or potable water \u2013 in many cases with no definitive timeline for restoration. Some neighborhoods are accessible only by air.</p> <p>Entire sections of Interstate 40 through the Pigeon River Gorge, a critical commercial corridor connecting Tennessee and Haywood county just west of Asheville, have been ripped away. I-26 is impassable where the Nolichucky blasted through it at Erwin. There is no estimated timeframe for rebuilding these roads, but it will take months, at least.</p> <p>For many, it\u2019s hard to imagine a way forward. But this is not the first time Zeb Smathers, mayor of the town of Canton, 15 minutes west of Asheville, has had to find the path. In 2021, <a href=\"https://smokymountainnews.com/news/item/32032-as-deadly-floodwaters-recede-haywood-grapples-with-enormous-loss\">catastrophic flooding from Tropical Storm Fred</a> ravaged the tiny upstream community of Cruso before ripping through Canton. Smathers worked hard to convince Canton businesses to stay in town and help the community rebuild from this \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d storm \u2013 which came just 17 years after another extensive flood, delivered by hurricanes Frances and Ivan. The town was still recovering from the onslaught when Helene arrived.</p> <p>\u201cGoing to the businesses in this district, three years ago, there was an expectation of, \u2018Hey, this is once in a lifetime. We\u2019ll get you back up,\u2019\u201d Smathers said. \u201cI\u2019m not doing that this time. If they want to leave and say, \u2018This is too much. We can\u2019t do this time and time again,\u2019 I\u2019ll support them. If they want to stay, I\u2019ll support them. That\u2019s different this time, but it\u2019s also reality. We have to operate and lead in the world that is, not the world we wish that was.\u201d</p> <p>As Jonathan Ammons, 39, surveys the wreckage of his home town of Asheville, he finds recovery hard to fathom. Asheville, a popular tourist destination known for its food, beer, music, art, and idyllic mountain setting, has been transformed. Music venues, breweries, restaurants, artist studios \u2013 all ravaged by the flood.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine an environment where this city recovers in a year, even five,\u201d Ammons said. \u201cThe landscape isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s been changed. All of the independent businesses have been crushed and wiped off the map. All of the small towns people would visit when they are coming here are just gone. I did aid work after Katrina in St Louis and New Orleans, and this is on that level of destruction.\u201d</p> <p>Ammons and his girlfriend Claire Winkler, 51, count themselves lucky to be alive. They left Winkler\u2019s apartment along the Swannanoa River \u2013 \u201cthe most beautiful and idyllic place you would ever see\u201d, as Ammons described it \u2013 at 4.30am on Friday, wading through waist-deep water to ensure they would be able to make it out to feed a cat owned by Winkler\u2019s daughter, who was out of town. They weathered the rest of the storm at her house, safe from the floods, and were not prepared for the sight that awaited them when they returned to the apartment later that day.</p>    <p>As the river rose, most people in the apartment complex moved their cars uphill to the nearby Root Bar for safekeeping. But that building was demolished, a tree shoved through the middle of the two walls and roof that remained.</p> <p>\u201cWe hiked up the hill and walked across that lot, and we could kind of see it rising up on the horizon of the apartment, and there was an entire building gone,\u201d Ammons said.</p> <p>The missing building had smashed against a bridge, reduced to little more than a pile of sticks. The couple waded through the 6in of mud coating the stairwell to Winkler\u2019s third-floor apartment, which looked \u201cas though you just put an entire living room in a washing machine and turned it on\u201d. Winkler, a bartender, is out of both a job and a home. Ammons, a freelance food journalist who supplements his income managing catering and craft cocktail events, is missing out on the busiest months of the year. But these hardships feel small compared with the suffering of others.</p> <p>The day after the flood, Ammons saw a woman standing to the side of the rubble. He remembered seeing her two small kids around the apartments. The woman said she was looking for her ex-husband, who lived in the complex\u2019s first building.</p> <p>\u201cI pointed to the bridge, and I said, \u2018That is the first building,\u2019\u201d Ammons recalled. Cadaver dogs were sniffing through the wreckage as he spoke.</p> <p>In the face of such tragic loss, it\u2019s hard for local leaders to even think about the logistics of rebuilding infrastructure, economy, community. But, said White: \u201cWe know that issue\u2019s coming and coming fast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have to keep going,\u201d said Smathers. \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative? Do we abandon home, or do we fight for it?\u201d</p> <p>For Smathers, White, Ammons, and so many others who call the southern Appalachians home, the answer is clear.</p> <p>\u201cI have no intention of leaving,\u201d Ammons said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "After keeping vigil all night, Jason Fesperman, 32, decided it was finally safe to sleep. By 6am last Friday, he figured that the worst of the rain from Hurricane Helene had passed. Jonathan Creek, the normally ankle-deep stream that runs through his backyard in Maggie Valley, North Carolina, had stayed within its banks \u2013 though barely. Just over two hours later, his wife Dan woke him in a panic. Heavy rain continued past 9am in Maggie Valley, and by 8.30am, floodwaters were rising fast. Their home was underwater up to the windows. \u201cWater was filling up, I would say, probably about an inch a minute,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it was pouring in, from the toilets, the windows, both doors.\u201d Blindly stuffing clean laundry into a bag, he joined his wife and seven-year-old son outside and somehow managed to start the Jeep, which was underwater to the hood. Now, the family is staying at an evacuation shelter with 30 other storm survivors, wondering what comes next. Fesperman and his family are some of the lucky ones \u2013 they made it out with their lives. More than 200 people have now been confirmed dead, both in Florida where the hurricane first made landfall and across a five-state region in the southern Appalachians that includes North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia. That number continues to rise as search and rescue efforts remain ongoing. The disaster has destroyed towns, inflicted billions of dollars in damage, and prompted Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to visit the stricken region. The catastrophe has unfolded in an area that was not meant to bear the brunt of Helene\u2019s power, unleashing effects worse than the fabled flood of 1916. But the climate crisis has upended traditional models of hurricane season \u2013 generating storms that are faster, wetter and more powerful. Already a powerful storm on its own, Helene\u2019s impact was bolstered by record-setting rains in the days preceding its arrival. Western North Carolina, which saw some of the worst effects, had been grappling with drought for over two months before the storm\u2019s arrival. But heavy rains on Wednesday and Thursday saturated the soils and swelled the rivers. A weather station at the Asheville airport reported nearly 10 inches of rain over that two-day period. Helene made landfall on the Florida Gulf coast as a category 4 hurricane and moved rapidly north. Hurricane-force winds and tornadoes swept through many of the affected communities, toppling trees and power lines, but water was by far the more destructive force. Average rainfall varies widely within the mountain region, but in many places it falls somewhere between 40in and 100in annually. Between 8am last Thursday and 8am on Monday, rainfalls north of 10in were common across western North Carolina. Hendersonville and Spruce Pine saw more than 20in, and Busick, an unincorporated community an hour north-east of Asheville, recorded an unprecedented 30.78in. These totals are in line with the forecast, said Steve Wilkinson, meteorologist-in-charge for the National Weather Service forecast office in Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina. But it was difficult to comprehend the scale of devastation such a storm would unleash. \u201cWhen you start talking about really specific impacts, it\u2019s hard to have imagination ahead of time that something this extreme could have the impact it did,\u201d he said. When rain falls on the coast, it\u2019s able to spread out over flat land, absorb into coastal marshes, and eventually drain back into the ocean. But in the mountains, water must follow topography, searching for the path of least resistance as it charges downhill. Heavy rains in the upper elevations gather force as they descend, converging with runoff from other swollen tributaries to turn creeks and rivers into roaring oceans. The water rushed through with devastating force, realigning riverbeds, ripping out roads, and obliterating entire communities. Wind gusts, in many places between 50 and 70mph, toppled trees and power lines already unsteady in the saturated soil. High flow on the Broad River combined with heavy local runoff to all but wipe the tourist town of Chimney Rock off the map. Just over the state line in Erwin, Tennessee, a raging Nolichucky River destroyed the town\u2019s hospital and industrial park, also tearing out part of nearby Interstate 26. \u201cWe\u2019re just a mourning community,\u201d said Erwin\u2019s mayor, Glenn White. \u201cWe are just heartbroken that our friends lost their lives. That\u2019s the biggest issue for all of us.\u201d It\u2019s been a week since the storm hit, and the scale of damage is still unknown. The death toll continues to rise as first responders search for the missing and make their way into communities rendered unreachable. Helene caused near-complete cellphone and internet outages throughout the region, and some services have yet to be restored. Many people remain without power or potable water \u2013 in many cases with no definitive timeline for restoration. Some neighborhoods are accessible only by air. Entire sections of Interstate 40 through the Pigeon River Gorge, a critical commercial corridor connecting Tennessee and Haywood county just west of Asheville, have been ripped away. I-26 is impassable where the Nolichucky blasted through it at Erwin. There is no estimated timeframe for rebuilding these roads, but it will take months, at least. For many, it\u2019s hard to imagine a way forward. But this is not the first time Zeb Smathers, mayor of the town of Canton, 15 minutes west of Asheville, has had to find the path. In 2021, catastrophic flooding from Tropical Storm Fred ravaged the tiny upstream community of Cruso before ripping through Canton. Smathers worked hard to convince Canton businesses to stay in town and help the community rebuild from this \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d storm \u2013 which came just 17 years after another extensive flood, delivered by hurricanes Frances and Ivan. The town was still recovering from the onslaught when Helene arrived. \u201cGoing to the businesses in this district, three years ago, there was an expectation of, \u2018Hey, this is once in a lifetime. We\u2019ll get you back up,\u2019\u201d Smathers said. \u201cI\u2019m not doing that this time. If they want to leave and say, \u2018This is too much. We can\u2019t do this time and time again,\u2019 I\u2019ll support them. If they want to stay, I\u2019ll support them. That\u2019s different this time, but it\u2019s also reality. We have to operate and lead in the world that is, not the world we wish that was.\u201d As Jonathan Ammons, 39, surveys the wreckage of his home town of Asheville, he finds recovery hard to fathom. Asheville, a popular tourist destination known for its food, beer, music, art, and idyllic mountain setting, has been transformed. Music venues, breweries, restaurants, artist studios \u2013 all ravaged by the flood. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine an environment where this city recovers in a year, even five,\u201d Ammons said. \u201cThe landscape isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s been changed. All of the independent businesses have been crushed and wiped off the map. All of the small towns people would visit when they are coming here are just gone. I did aid work after Katrina in St Louis and New Orleans, and this is on that level of destruction.\u201d Ammons and his girlfriend Claire Winkler, 51, count themselves lucky to be alive. They left Winkler\u2019s apartment along the Swannanoa River \u2013 \u201cthe most beautiful and idyllic place you would ever see\u201d, as Ammons described it \u2013 at 4.30am on Friday, wading through waist-deep water to ensure they would be able to make it out to feed a cat owned by Winkler\u2019s daughter, who was out of town. They weathered the rest of the storm at her house, safe from the floods, and were not prepared for the sight that awaited them when they returned to the apartment later that day. As the river rose, most people in the apartment complex moved their cars uphill to the nearby Root Bar for safekeeping. But that building was demolished, a tree shoved through the middle of the two walls and roof that remained. \u201cWe hiked up the hill and walked across that lot, and we could kind of see it rising up on the horizon of the apartment, and there was an entire building gone,\u201d Ammons said. The missing building had smashed against a bridge, reduced to little more than a pile of sticks. The couple waded through the 6in of mud coating the stairwell to Winkler\u2019s third-floor apartment, which looked \u201cas though you just put an entire living room in a washing machine and turned it on\u201d. Winkler, a bartender, is out of both a job and a home. Ammons, a freelance food journalist who supplements his income managing catering and craft cocktail events, is missing out on the busiest months of the year. But these hardships feel small compared with the suffering of others. The day after the flood, Ammons saw a woman standing to the side of the rubble. He remembered seeing her two small kids around the apartments. The woman said she was looking for her ex-husband, who lived in the complex\u2019s first building. \u201cI pointed to the bridge, and I said, \u2018That is the first building,\u2019\u201d Ammons recalled. Cadaver dogs were sniffing through the wreckage as he spoke. In the face of such tragic loss, it\u2019s hard for local leaders to even think about the logistics of rebuilding infrastructure, economy, community. But, said White: \u201cWe know that issue\u2019s coming and coming fast.\u201d \u201cWe have to keep going,\u201d said Smathers. \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative? Do we abandon home, or do we fight for it?\u201d For Smathers, White, Ammons, and so many others who call the southern Appalachians home, the answer is clear. \u201cI have no intention of leaving,\u201d Ammons said.",

Republicans feared October would bring the release of American hostages held in Iran since the previous year, thereby boosting Carter, perhaps enough to recover from the humiliating failure of the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/05/the-desert-one-debacle/304803/\">Desert One rescue mission</a>.

This has been part of our history that we are loth to acknowledge, and I think we really have to if America\u2019s to be a real democracy. This is one of those things that was denied, denied, denied, again and again and again.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Unger has pursued the story of the October surprise for <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2024/10/craig-unger-den-of-spies-book-on-reagan-carter-october-surprise/680104/\">more than 30 years</a>, often to his own cost. He discovered it in 1991, in a New York Times column by Gary Sick, once of Carter\u2019s national security council, headlined \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/15/opinion/the-election-story-of-the-decade.html\">The Election Story of the Decade</a>\u201d. Unger worked on the story for Esquire and Newsweek but as the brewing scandal threatened to ensnare George HW Bush, Reagan\u2019s vice-president and White House successor, and amid congressional investigations Unger deems woefully inadequate, news outlets abruptly dropped the story, declaring it all a hoax. Unger was sued for $10m by one player in the affair, labelled a conspiracy theorist by others. Nevertheless, he persisted.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to acknowledge the dark parts of American history,\u201d he insists, \u201cif we\u2019re to be truly honest.\u201d</p>    <p>Most of the darkest parts of Den of Spies concern William Casey, Reagan\u2019s campaign manager who worked for the predecessor of the CIA during the second world war, then led the agency once Reagan took power. Asked about the congenitally unreliable characters who populate his book \u2013 embittered CIA veterans, Mossad operatives, Iranian arms dealers turned double agents among them \u2013 Unger says: \u201cI think no one put together really [that] even before the Iran hostage crisis, Bill Casey \u2026 had a network of intelligence operatives.\u201d</p> <p>Describing Casey as \u201ca mix of James Bond and Mr Magoo\u201d, Unger continues: \u201cHe was the kind of guy who spit when he talked, he was going in a dozen directions at once, he was fairly tall but he looked always stooped over, and when he ate, he would spill food all over himself. But he was dazzlingly brilliant in his way. Casey was a master spy during world war two \u2026 [and] he didn\u2019t get back in officially in the intelligence game until 1981 when he became head of the CIA, and yet, during that whole time, he had a sort of a secret network, and he was able to plug them in appropriately, to deal arms to Iran, without anyone getting caught. I mean, it was amazing. Think how difficult it is. It\u2019s hard enough to run a presidential campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Den of Spies is peppered with amazing details. One is an attendance ledger for a conference at the Imperial War Museum in London in which marks in pen or pencil seem to indicate confirmed attendance or not, on which hinges the feasibility of Casey flitting to and from meetings in Madrid on which, Unger argues, the whole plot turns.</p> <p>That Unger has finally been able to tell the story at book length owes much to Bob Parry, another investigative journalist who got on to the trail of the October surprise. After Parry <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/robert-parry-associated-press-reporter-who-covered-iran-contra-affair-dies-at-68/2018/01/29/c0eb3d80-0506-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html\">died</a>, in 2018, Unger inherited his files.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/president-jimmy-carter-turns-100\">Jimmy Carter becomes the first former US president to turn 100</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe\u2019d gotten a lot of information. He called them The X Files, and now I have them. They were only digitized after Bob\u2019s death, and that enables you to search through 23 gigabytes of data, which is millions of pages. I knew the aliases that the [Iranian] arms dealers used. Jamshid Hashemi was one of them, and he had, I think, 10 aliases, so I was able to search using his aliases. And when I did that, I came upon some documents that had been given to me and to Congress and Bob Parry as well by former [Iranian] president Abolhassan Banisadr [who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/11/abolhassan-banisadr-obituary\">died</a> in 2021, aged 88], and I don\u2019t think even Banisadr realized the context, but the invoices he gave me for the arms they were receiving, some of them went right back to Bill Casey\u2019s operative: Jamshid Hashemi.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Den of Spies is full of such tales, dizzying in their turns and switchbacks. Unger is well aware some may see him as obsessed, so relentless is his pursuit. \u201cI did not need to be reminded that things had ended badly for Captain Ahab,\u201d he writes, of the anti-hero of Herman Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick. Unger\u2019s chapter titles duly include \u201cMy White Whale\u201d. But as he says, though Jimmy Carter still lives, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/president-jimmy-carter-turns-100\">turned 100</a> on publication day, Den of Spies comes out in a world where dark machinations to win power no longer seem so unthinkable as in the days of Carter, Reagan and Bush.</p> <p>The October surprise of 1980, Unger says, \u201cis very much a prequel to what we\u2019re going through with Donald Trump, who does commit some of the same crimes. This was, I believe, a treasonous covert operation to sabotage an American presidential election. And today we see Trump with very, very close allies, Benjamin Netanyahu and Vladimir Putin and MBS [Mohammed bin Salman, of Saudi Arabia], all of whom may somehow, one way or another, interfere with this election.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Den of Spies is published <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/untitled-210-anon210/20908482\">in the US</a> and <a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/den-of-spies-9780008730215/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">UK</a> by Harper</em><em>Collins</em></p></li> </ul>",

Nevertheless, he persisted. \u201cWe have to acknowledge the dark parts of American history,\u201d he insists, \u201cif we\u2019re to be truly honest.\u201d Most of the darkest parts of Den of Spies concern William Casey, Reagan\u2019s campaign manager who worked for the predecessor of the CIA during the second world war, then led the agency once Reagan took power. Asked about the congenitally unreliable characters who populate his book \u2013 embittered CIA veterans, Mossad operatives, Iranian arms dealers turned double agents among them \u2013 Unger says: \u201cI think no one put together really [that] even before the Iran hostage crisis, Bill Casey \u2026 had a network of intelligence operatives.\u201d Describing Casey as \u201ca mix of James Bond and Mr Magoo\u201d, Unger continues: \u201cHe was the kind of guy who spit when he talked, he was going in a dozen directions at once, he was fairly tall but he looked always stooped over, and when he ate, he would spill food all over himself. But he was dazzlingly brilliant in his way. Casey was a master spy during world war two \u2026 [and] he didn\u2019t get back in officially in the intelligence game until 1981 when he became head of the CIA, and yet, during that whole time, he had a sort of a secret network, and he was able to plug them in appropriately, to deal arms to Iran, without anyone getting caught. I mean, it was amazing. Think how difficult it is. It\u2019s hard enough to run a presidential campaign.\u201d Den of Spies is peppered with amazing details. One is an attendance ledger for a conference at the Imperial War Museum in London in which marks in pen or pencil seem to indicate confirmed attendance or not, on which hinges the feasibility of Casey flitting to and from meetings in Madrid on which, Unger argues, the whole plot turns. That Unger has finally been able to tell the story at book length owes much to Bob Parry, another investigative journalist who got on to the trail of the October surprise. After Parry died, in 2018, Unger inherited his files. \u201cHe\u2019d gotten a lot of information. He called them The X Files, and now I have them. They were only digitized after Bob\u2019s death, and that enables you to search through 23 gigabytes of data, which is millions of pages. I knew the aliases that the [Iranian] arms dealers used. Jamshid Hashemi was one of them, and he had, I think, 10 aliases, so I was able to search using his aliases. And when I did that, I came upon some documents that had been given to me and to Congress and Bob Parry as well by former [Iranian] president Abolhassan Banisadr [who died in 2021, aged 88], and I don\u2019t think even Banisadr realized the context, but the invoices he gave me for the arms they were receiving, some of them went right back to Bill Casey\u2019s operative: Jamshid Hashemi.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Den of Spies is full of such tales, dizzying in their turns and switchbacks. Unger is well aware some may see him as obsessed, so relentless is his pursuit. \u201cI did not need to be reminded that things had ended badly for Captain Ahab,\u201d he writes, of the anti-hero of Herman Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick. Unger\u2019s chapter titles duly include \u201cMy White Whale\u201d. But as he says, though Jimmy Carter still lives, having turned 100 on publication day, Den of Spies comes out in a world where dark machinations to win power no longer seem so unthinkable as in the days of Carter, Reagan and Bush. The October surprise of 1980, Unger says, \u201cis very much a prequel to what we\u2019re going through with Donald Trump, who does commit some of the same crimes. This was, I believe, a treasonous covert operation to sabotage an American presidential election. And today we see Trump with very, very close allies, Benjamin Netanyahu and Vladimir Putin and MBS [Mohammed bin Salman, of Saudi Arabia], all of whom may somehow, one way or another, interfere with this election.\u201d Den of Spies is published in the US and UK by HarperCollins",

      "body": "<p>Paul Rudolph, the US\u2019s greatest brutalist, had a career in four overlapping acts. First, starting in the 1950s, he designed private houses, delightful Florida getaways where modernist glassiness was tempered by screens and shutters. In the next decade he designed monumental concrete fortresses, majestic and sometimes monstrous, for universities, corporations and gigantic urban renewal programmes. Then came inward and intricate homes in Manhattan such as the Hirsch house, eventually owned by the fashion designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jun/05/halston-70s-disco-designer-rise-fall-bianca-jagger-iman-studio-54\">Halston</a>, where the likes of Andy Warhol, Liza Minnelli and Bianca Jagger would go to Studio 54 afterparties, later again bought by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/tom-ford\">Tom Ford</a> for $18m (\u00a313.55m).

      "body": "<p>Adam Pearson has a longstanding argument with his mother, Marilyn, about how well-known he is. The tension is most likely to surface when they are at home in Croydon and Marilyn asks the 39-year-old actor to do some menial household chore. For example: \u201cWe\u2019ve recently put up a new shed, and tomorrow morning I\u2019ve got to carry all the heavy stuff down to it,\u201d says Pearson, with a weary shake of his head. \u201cThere\u2019s literally a bag of cement. I said to her, \u2018Why have we got a bag of cement?\u2019 And she said, \u2018We might need it one day.\u2019 Fine! What day are we going to wake up and be like, \u2018Oh, thank God we kept that bag of cement!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>So, a do-you-know-who-I-am moment then?</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t fly well in Pearson Towers,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI may have said it once. It ended horribly.\u201d</p> <p>The debate, though, took a bit of a turn earlier this year when Pearson invited Marilyn and his twin brother, Neil, to the European premiere of his new film, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/17/a-different-man-review-adam-pearson-shines-in-oddball-doppelganger-parable\">A Different Man</a></em>, at the Berlin film festival. The satirical drama, in which Pearson stars alongside Sebastian Stan (of the Marvel universe and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/02/pam-tommy-review-sex-tape-compassion-fun-90s-scandal-fallout\">Pam &amp; Tommy</a></em> renown) and Renate Reinsve (from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/08/the-worst-person-in-the-world-review-cannes-2021\">The Worst Person in the World</a></em>), had already been a breakout hit at Sundance and was now expected to make a determined awards push.</p> <p>\u201cFor years my mum has been like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Adam, I don\u2019t believe you are famous,\u2019\u201d says Pearson. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018OK, let\u2019s kick this argument straight in the knackers.\u2019 And in Berlin, she was just killing herself laughing on the red carpet. She\u2019s like, \u2018People have printed photos of you off the internet and they are yelling your name.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018So do you realise I\u2019m famous now?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The premiere and the escalating acclaim for <em>A Different Man</em> has also settled his since-birth rivalry with his brother, Pearson believes. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no more competition, my friend,\u201d he says, mimicking a conversation with his twin. \u201cYou\u2019re a <a href=\"https://www.royalmarsdenschool.ac.uk/why-study-royal-marsden/about-school/staff-profiles/student-support-team/neil-pearson\">library assistant</a>. And I\u2019m a soon-to-be-Oscar-nominated actor and he works in the Royal Marsden and unless he actually cures cancer, this is over!\u201d</p>    <p>This exchange pretty well sums up Pearson, who is confident, funny and doesn\u2019t do false modesty. For years, the opening line of his CV read: \u201cMy name is Adam Pearson and I\u2019m the best in the world at what I do.\u201d He laughs, \u201cGranted, that\u2019s a little bit braggadocious, but people hold a CV for seven seconds on average\u2026 Also, not being coy, I\u2019m saying that sincerely.\u201d</p> <p>Pearson\u2019s CV is stacking up rather nicely these days. Born with <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/neurofibromatosis-type-1/\">neurofibromatosis type 1</a>, a genetic condition that produces benign skin tumours all over his face, he didn\u2019t immediately consider a career in entertainment. He studied business management at Brighton university, and after graduating landed a six-month contract at the BBC working for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ouch/200606/bbc_appoints_new_diversity_exe.html\">Mary FitzPatrick</a>, editorial executive of diversity. Pearson went on a networking frenzy, which led to production jobs at the BBC and Channel 4, where he helped cast reality show <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-undateables\">The Undateables</a></em> and the documentary series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2010/aug/26/beauty-beast-channel-4\">Beauty and the Beast</a></em>. \u201cWell, don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t get,\u201d he says, summing up his approach. \u201cThat\u2019s in the <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%204%3A2&amp;version=NIV\">Bible</a>. So who am I to question that wisdom?\u201d</p> <p>But Pearson\u2019s big break \u2013 or certainly the role he is most recognised for \u2013 came in 2013 when he was picked by the director Jonathan Glazer for the film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/13/under-the-skin-scarlett-johansson-peter-bradshaw\">Under the Skin</a></em>. At the time, he had zero acting experience, literally none. But Pearson received an email from <a href=\"https://www.changingfaces.org.uk/about-changing-faces/contact-us/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw6c63BhAiEiwAF0EH1G-OwpTEbmh3jqvLdES2BNycU2xKlp44Xo36t_jD05tX2LvdQsDibRoCPioQAvD_BwE\">Changing Faces</a>, a charity that works with people with visible differences on their faces, hands or bodies, about a casting call and decided to send off that punchy CV. Glazer was impressed and Pearson found himself heading to Elstree Studios in Borehamwood to meet his co-star.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d done a bit of Googling by then and knew it was a Film Four thing,\u201d Pearson recalls. \u201cAnd Olivia Colman had just done <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/06/tyrannosaur-film-review\">Tyrannosaur</a></em> and killed it, so in my head, I was like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s Olivia Colman.\u2019 Then I walk in, put some bass in my voice to establish dominance, and go, \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Adam.\u2019 And this lady comes up and goes, \u2018Oh, hi, I\u2019m Scarlett.\u2019 Then I freak out a little bit and go, \u2018Yes! Yes! You are.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/scarlettjohansson\">Scarlett Johansson</a> by the way, if you didn\u2019t know. <em>Under the Skin</em> had a curious premise about a sexy alien known only as the Female (Johansson) who finds men on the edge of society in Glasgow, seduces them and then harvests their bodies after luring them naked through black goo. Pearson was hired to play one of these misfits, a loner who initially knocks back Johansson because he is more intent on getting to Tesco before it closes.</p>    <p>Pearson knew about Glazer\u2019s reputation as an advertising savant \u2013 the director has since gone on to win a pair of Baftas for 2023\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/feb/04/the-zone-of-interest-jonathan-glazer-brutal-auschwitz-drama-sandra-huller-christian-friedel-martin-amis\">The Zone of Interest</a></em> \u2013 but he was sceptical that <em>Under the Skin</em> would land with an audience. He has been proved not to be correct: it placed fourth in the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s list of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/13/100-best-films-movies-of-the-21st-century\">100 best films</a> of the 21st century in 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s aged so well,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cI thought it would be in cinemas for two weeks and that would be it. I just went, \u2018This will be a flash in the goddamn pan.\u2019 And then nope, turns out it\u2019s a masterpiece. Oh well!\u201d</p> <p><em>Under the Skin</em> also became a calling card for Pearson. He improvised much of the dialogue with Johansson \u2013 including the line about Tesco \u2013 and their scenes together, where the alien shows some nascent empathy, were the emotional heart of the film. \u201cI just thought, \u2018I\u2019ve done it, it\u2019s on the CV, it\u2019s part of the Pearson story,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll buy a copy of it on Blu-ray, add it to the shrine of Adam, and we can all get back to normal, right? And then things never really did.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Pearson was always </strong></em>an extrovert growing up. He only realised he had neurofibromatosis when, aged five, he banged his head on a windowsill, probably trying to re-create a pro-wrestling move he\u2019d seen on TV, he thinks. The bump didn\u2019t go away and he also started having an intense allergic reaction to certain foods. His brother Neil was diagnosed at the same time, but he experiences short-term memory loss rather than the skin tumours. Pearson has since had 39 surgical procedures to, in his words, \u201cdebulk\u201d the tumours and there will be more to come. After his 40th, he plans to throw a party.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to be a standup comic,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cBecause I grew up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/01/joe-pasquale-looks-back\">Joe Pasquale</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/kenny-everett\">Kenny Everett</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/apr/22/tommy-cooper-the-best-quotes\">Tommy Cooper</a>. And everyone likes the funny guy. Whether at the time it was just a thinly veiled defence mechanism I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s all too cod psychology for eight-year-old me to comprehend. But yeah, I was a real comedy buff from a really young age.\u201d</p>    <p>Secondary school was rough for Pearson: he was bullied \u2013 verbally more than physically \u2013 and his response was to lash back with insults of his own, which would then land him in trouble. \u201cI was miserable and didn\u2019t exactly cover myself in glory with how I behaved,\u201d he reflects. \u201cIt was a noble anger, it was all a very righteous endeavour. But equally a very misguided righteous endeavour.\u201d</p> <p>Pearson didn\u2019t pursue comedy or acting, because he couldn\u2019t see the point. \u201cI didn\u2019t think disabled people were allowed in films, because I didn\u2019t see any,\u201d he says. \u201cUp until quite recently, only two disabled actors have won Oscars playing disabled characters.\u201d These are a supporting-actor win for Harold Russell in <em><a href=\"https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1947\">The Best Years of Our Lives</a></em> in 1947 and <a href=\"https://aframe.oscars.org/news/post/marlee-matlin-historic-1987-oscar-win-exclusive\">Marlee Matlin</a> in 1987 for <em>Children of a Lesser God</em>; Troy Kotsur, who is deaf, joined the list with a best supporting actor win for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/troy-kotsur-wins-best-supporting-actor-oscar-for-coda\">Coda</a></em> in 2022. Pearson adds, \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s pretty fucked up, right?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The portrayal of disability onscreen is at the heart of Pearson\u2019s new film <em>A Different Man</em>. The action starts with Edward, who looks a lot like Pearson, but is actually Stan under prosthetics. Edward is an actor, but an unsuccessful one: the only part he has managed to land is a schlocky public-service commercial about how to treat co-workers with craniofacial conditions. Then, out of the blue, Edward\u2019s luck seems to change. A doctor offers him a place on an experimental trial to treat his neurofibromatosis. It works; Edward literally peels off his old face and is reborn as Guy, now played by Stan without prosthetics. Guy, initially, has a great time: he lands a well-paid job as an estate agent; he starts dating his old nextdoor neighbour, the playwright Ingrid (Reinsve), after bagging the lead role in her new play.</p> <p>It\u2019s then that Pearson, as Oswald, shows up. Oswald and the old Edward may look alike, but in every other respect they are unrecognisably different. Oswald is charismatic, brash, a masterful karaoke performer, popular with women. And, without seeming to mean to, he starts methodically dismantling Guy\u2019s hard-won new life. \u201cIt becomes a really dark comedy, almost,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cIt\u2019s this bizarre one-sided rivalry between Oswald and Guy, where Oswald\u2019s just unknowingly kicking Guy down this really long flight of stairs.\u201d</p> <p>Written and directed by Aaron Schimberg, <em>A Different Man</em> is a lot to take in and a lot to watch \u2013 comparisons have been made to the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/charlie-kaufman\">Charlie Kaufman</a>, best-known for writing 1999\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/17/1\">Being John Malkovich</a></em> \u2013 but it is definitely worth sticking with. Schimberg wrote the part of Oswald with Pearson in mind (they had previously worked together on the 2019 film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/24/chained-for-life-review-aaron-schimberg-jess-weixler\">Chained for Life</a></em>) and he excels in it. Peter Bradshaw in the <em>Guardian</em> described it as an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/17/a-different-man-review-adam-pearson-shines-in-oddball-doppelganger-parable\">exhilarating performance</a>\u201d.</p>    <p>\u201cYou turn up to every gig and try to nail it,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cBut particularly with this one, because it was written for me, I was like, \u2018I need to make my point here.\u2019 There\u2019s always Sebastian Stan and Renate Reinsve, so it would be very easy just to get lost in the shuffle and become the third guy in that film. And I was like, no, no. I rocked up with the full intention to steal this movie. I\u2019m taking this to the bank. Every step of the way.\u201d</p> <p>For Pearson, <em>A Different Man</em> is a revelatory film for its depiction of disability. Too often on film, he feels, a person with a disfigurement is presented as a problem that needs fixing. Here, Edward is sent into a tailspin when he receives his magical cure. \u201cPeople always think of the tragedy of going from being non-disabled to disabled,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cAnd no one really talks about it going the other way. I often say that my disability does a lot of heavy lifting for my awful, awful personality. But it also means I can get away with so much. I can behave thoroughly awfully and, at the end of the day, hold my hands up and go, \u2018I\u2019m disabled, I don\u2019t know any better.\u2019 And the whole world goes, \u2018You\u2019re right, you\u2019re an inspiration and a hero. You go, girlfriend!\u2019 So if I had to operate within these new confines, I\u2019d be like, \u2018I don\u2019t like playing by the rules one bit!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Pearson is also clearly gleeful to play a character that\u2019s not introverted or a loner. One, in fact, that\u2019s much closer to his own personality. He was especially pleased to unleash his karaoke skills, which he normally reserves for <a href=\"https://www.memoryboxcroydon.co.uk/\">Memory Box</a> in Croydon on a Wednesday night, banging out Journey\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k8craCGpgs\">Don\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwpn14IE7E\">Danger Zone</a> by Kenny Loggins.</p> <p>\u201cA<strong> </strong>lot of my friends will accuse me of just turning up to work and being myself on camera,\u201d Pearson says, with a chuckle. \u201cThe charm and flamboyance are absolutely me. But the whole saxophone, jiujitsu stuff? Hell no! That\u2019s not who I am. I\u2019ve never been so scared as the day we had to do that fight scene on stage between Oswald and Guy. Because he\u2019s Sebastian Stan, he\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/captain-america-the-winter-soldier\">Winter Soldier</a>! And I\u2019m 5ft 4in and made of Oreo cookies and broken dreams.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Pearson wants to keep </strong></em>the run going: he\u2019s attached to a film role he can\u2019t talk about and on the shortlist for a big theatre part; he\u2019s also made a documentary about \u201cwhy representation in film matters\u201d that he\u2019s submitted to Sundance. \u201cI want to get to a point where we can have guys like me in a film and I\u2019m just there,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere the disability isn\u2019t the raison d\u2019etre for me being there. Because I often say, \u2018My disability is the least interesting thing about me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s still pretty goddamn interesting. But there\u2019s more to me than that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Still, Pearson is going to keep some time aside in February and March next year in case the Baftas and the Academy Awards come calling. Who would he take as his guest to the ceremony? A long pause, \u201cI\u2019d probably have to take the missus.\u201d He\u2019s talking about his girlfriend of three years. \u201cShe\u2019s quite a private person. I don\u2019t really talk about her much. I don\u2019t want her to be part of this three-ring circus. Or I might just flex and take another actor: here\u2019s my plus one, Jamie Lee Curtis!

I want to go to the Oscars and clean up. At the beginning I just wanted to be in the conversation.

      "bodyText": "Adam Pearson has a longstanding argument with his mother, Marilyn, about how well-known he is. The tension is most likely to surface when they are at home in Croydon and Marilyn asks the 39-year-old actor to do some menial household chore. For example: \u201cWe\u2019ve recently put up a new shed, and tomorrow morning I\u2019ve got to carry all the heavy stuff down to it,\u201d says Pearson, with a weary shake of his head. \u201cThere\u2019s literally a bag of cement. I said to her, \u2018Why have we got a bag of cement?\u2019 And she said, \u2018We might need it one day.\u2019 Fine! What day are we going to wake up and be like, \u2018Oh, thank God we kept that bag of cement!\u2019\u201d So, a do-you-know-who-I-am moment then? \u201cThat doesn\u2019t fly well in Pearson Towers,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI may have said it once. It ended horribly.\u201d The debate, though, took a bit of a turn earlier this year when Pearson invited Marilyn and his twin brother, Neil, to the European premiere of his new film, A Different Man, at the Berlin film festival. The satirical drama, in which Pearson stars alongside Sebastian Stan (of the Marvel universe and Pam &amp; Tommy renown) and Renate Reinsve (from The Worst Person in the World), had already been a breakout hit at Sundance and was now expected to make a determined awards push. \u201cFor years my mum has been like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Adam, I don\u2019t believe you are famous,\u2019\u201d says Pearson. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018OK, let\u2019s kick this argument straight in the knackers.\u2019 And in Berlin, she was just killing herself laughing on the red carpet. She\u2019s like, \u2018People have printed photos of you off the internet and they are yelling your name.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018So do you realise I\u2019m famous now?\u2019\u201d The premiere and the escalating acclaim for A Different Man has also settled his since-birth rivalry with his brother, Pearson believes. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no more competition, my friend,\u201d he says, mimicking a conversation with his twin. \u201cYou\u2019re a library assistant. And I\u2019m a soon-to-be-Oscar-nominated actor and he works in the Royal Marsden and unless he actually cures cancer, this is over!\u201d This exchange pretty well sums up Pearson, who is confident, funny and doesn\u2019t do false modesty. For years, the opening line of his CV read: \u201cMy name is Adam Pearson and I\u2019m the best in the world at what I do.\u201d He laughs, \u201cGranted, that\u2019s a little bit braggadocious, but people hold a CV for seven seconds on average\u2026 Also, not being coy, I\u2019m saying that sincerely.\u201d Pearson\u2019s CV is stacking up rather nicely these days. Born with neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic condition that produces benign skin tumours all over his face, he didn\u2019t immediately consider a career in entertainment. He studied business management at Brighton university, and after graduating landed a six-month contract at the BBC working for Mary FitzPatrick, editorial executive of diversity. Pearson went on a networking frenzy, which led to production jobs at the BBC and Channel 4, where he helped cast reality show The Undateables and the documentary series Beauty and the Beast. \u201cWell, don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t get,\u201d he says, summing up his approach. \u201cThat\u2019s in the Bible. So who am I to question that wisdom?\u201d But Pearson\u2019s big break \u2013 or certainly the role he is most recognised for \u2013 came in 2013 when he was picked by the director Jonathan Glazer for the film Under the Skin. At the time, he had zero acting experience, literally none. But Pearson received an email from Changing Faces, a charity that works with people with visible differences on their faces, hands or bodies, about a casting call and decided to send off that punchy CV. Glazer was impressed and Pearson found himself heading to Elstree Studios in Borehamwood to meet his co-star. \u201cI\u2019d done a bit of Googling by then and knew it was a Film Four thing,\u201d Pearson recalls. \u201cAnd Olivia Colman had just done Tyrannosaur and killed it, so in my head, I was like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s Olivia Colman.\u2019 Then I walk in, put some bass in my voice to establish dominance, and go, \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Adam.\u2019 And this lady comes up and goes, \u2018Oh, hi, I\u2019m Scarlett.\u2019 Then I freak out a little bit and go, \u2018Yes! Yes! You are.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s Scarlett Johansson by the way, if you didn\u2019t know. Under the Skin had a curious premise about a sexy alien known only as the Female (Johansson) who finds men on the edge of society in Glasgow, seduces them and then harvests their bodies after luring them naked through black goo. Pearson was hired to play one of these misfits, a loner who initially knocks back Johansson because he is more intent on getting to Tesco before it closes. Pearson knew about Glazer\u2019s reputation as an advertising savant \u2013 the director has since gone on to win a pair of Baftas for 2023\u2019s The Zone of Interest \u2013 but he was sceptical that Under the Skin would land with an audience. He has been proved not to be correct: it placed fourth in the Guardian\u2019s list of the 100 best films of the 21st century in 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s aged so well,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cI thought it would be in cinemas for two weeks and that would be it. I just went, \u2018This will be a flash in the goddamn pan.\u2019 And then nope, turns out it\u2019s a masterpiece. Oh well!\u201d Under the Skin also became a calling card for Pearson. He improvised much of the dialogue with Johansson \u2013 including the line about Tesco \u2013 and their scenes together, where the alien shows some nascent empathy, were the emotional heart of the film. \u201cI just thought, \u2018I\u2019ve done it, it\u2019s on the CV, it\u2019s part of the Pearson story,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll buy a copy of it on Blu-ray, add it to the shrine of Adam, and we can all get back to normal, right? And then things never really did.\u201d Pearson was always an extrovert growing up. He only realised he had neurofibromatosis when, aged five, he banged his head on a windowsill, probably trying to re-create a pro-wrestling move he\u2019d seen on TV, he thinks. The bump didn\u2019t go away and he also started having an intense allergic reaction to certain foods. His brother Neil was diagnosed at the same time, but he experiences short-term memory loss rather than the skin tumours. Pearson has since had 39 surgical procedures to, in his words, \u201cdebulk\u201d the tumours and there will be more to come. After his 40th, he plans to throw a party. \u201cI wanted to be a standup comic,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cBecause I grew up on Joe Pasquale, Kenny Everett, Tommy Cooper. And everyone likes the funny guy. Whether at the time it was just a thinly veiled defence mechanism I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s all too cod psychology for eight-year-old me to comprehend. But yeah, I was a real comedy buff from a really young age.\u201d Secondary school was rough for Pearson: he was bullied \u2013 verbally more than physically \u2013 and his response was to lash back with insults of his own, which would then land him in trouble. \u201cI was miserable and didn\u2019t exactly cover myself in glory with how I behaved,\u201d he reflects. \u201cIt was a noble anger, it was all a very righteous endeavour. But equally a very misguided righteous endeavour.\u201d Pearson didn\u2019t pursue comedy or acting, because he couldn\u2019t see the point. \u201cI didn\u2019t think disabled people were allowed in films, because I didn\u2019t see any,\u201d he says. \u201cUp until quite recently, only two disabled actors have won Oscars playing disabled characters.\u201d These are a supporting-actor win for Harold Russell in The Best Years of Our Lives in 1947 and Marlee Matlin in 1987 for Children of a Lesser God; Troy Kotsur, who is deaf, joined the list with a best supporting actor win for Coda in 2022. Pearson adds, \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s pretty fucked up, right?\u2019\u201d The portrayal of disability onscreen is at the heart of Pearson\u2019s new film A Different Man.

Guy, initially, has a great time: he lands a well-paid job as an estate agent; he starts dating his old nextdoor neighbour, the playwright Ingrid (Reinsve), after bagging the lead role in her new play. It\u2019s then that Pearson, as Oswald, shows up. Oswald and the old Edward may look alike, but in every other respect they are unrecognisably different.

Ask him how he was and he would tell you how many titles he had in the bestseller list.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s 13 years since Christopher Wheeldon\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.rbo.org.uk/tickets-and-events/alices-adventures-in-wonderland-details\">Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland</a></strong> first tiptoed across the stage of the Royal Ballet before tumbling down a rabbit hole. In that time, this retelling of Lewis Carroll\u2019s episodic adventure story, a cross between a hallucinogenic dream and a gentle coming-of-age narrative, has become a favourite across the world.</p> <p>In part that\u2019s thanks to Bob Crowley\u2019s inventive designs, full of strong colour, using every trick in the visual book from projections to puppets to lavish costume. But it\u2019s also due to Wheeldon\u2019s ability to blend demanding classical dance steps with comedy and Broadway razzle dazzle.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to resist a ballet where the Caterpillar is depicted by a chorus line of blue-spangled legs, and the Queen of Hearts dances a manic Tart Adage (in direct tribute to the famous Rose Adagio in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/mar/03/birmingham-royal-ballet-the-sleeping-beauty-birmingham-hippodrome-review-tour-dimitris-papaioannou-ink-sadlers-wells\">The Sleeping Beauty</a>) with four terrified suitors sticking jam tarts in their open mouths and ducking her pointed feet as she approaches with menace.</p> <p>Each character, from bouncing footmen to floating Cheshire Cat, has a distinctive flavour and purpose, all emphasised by Joby Talbot\u2019s richly textured score. It\u2019s a dream for a big company and you can feel the Royal Ballet\u2019s dancers stretching into its different shades with pleasure as they begin a long run in the repertory.</p>    <p>At the matinee performance I saw, first artist Viola Pantuso made a charming debut as Alice, full of wide-eyed excitement; Marcelino Samb\u00e9, as her nascent love interest Jack, partnered with tender care and exhilarating joy. In the evening, Francesca Hayward and William Bracewell were utterly lovely, their relationship flecked with warmth and growing delight, their dancing easy, expansive and musical.</p> <p>Lauren Cuthbertson, the first Alice, graduated to the Queen of Hearts with aplomb, exhibiting a steely technique and venomously precise comic timing. Steven McRae returned from long injury to dazzle as the tap-dancing Mad Hatter.</p> <p>Returning to the UK for the first time since 2013, The National Ballet of Canada has brought <strong><a href=\"https://www.sadlerswells.com/whats-on/the-national-ballet-of-canada/\">Frontiers</a></strong>, a chamber bill of ballets by Canadian choreographers, culminating in the UK premiere of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/18/crystal-pite-betroffenheit-best-dance-21st-century\">Crystal Pite</a>\u2019s astounding <em>Angels\u2019 Atlas</em>, another work where design is utterly crucial to effect. Designer Jay Gower Taylor and lighting designer Tom Visser create a wall of reflected white light, constantly shifting and changing, sometimes looking like the trails of fireworks, sometimes like cracking ice. In front of it, the dancers move in large scale groupings, or spin and fall in pairs.</p>    <p>The movement is constantly surprising \u2013 great swirls of turns, patterns of hearts beating, bodies rising and falling as breath seems to be passed from one dancer to the next in a graceful canon. The theme is fragility and endurance and, underpinned by a keening score of Tchaikovsky and Morten Lauridsen, it is overwhelmingly moving.</p> <p>The two other works make less impact. <em>Passion</em> by James Kudelka, sets a contemporary couple amid the formalities of traditionally romantic classical dancing, while Islands, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/sep/29/choreographer-emma-portner-islands-sadlers-wells-interview\">rising star Emma Portner</a>, is a thoughtful examination of dependency and separation, explored by attaching two dancers together and then setting them apart. All are danced with commitment, by a company it is a pleasure to watch.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)</em><br><em>Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland</em> <strong>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br></strong><em>Frontiers: Choreographers of Canada</em> <strong>\u2605\u2605\u2605</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.rbo.org.uk/tickets-and-events/alices-adventures-in-wonderland-details\">Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland</a></em> is at Royal Ballet and Opera until 1 November and from 13 June-6 July 2025</p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.sadlerswells.com/whats-on/the-national-ballet-of-canada/\">Frontiers: Choreographers of Canada</a></em> is at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London until 6 October</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 13 years since Christopher Wheeldon\u2019s Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland first tiptoed across the stage of the Royal Ballet before tumbling down a rabbit hole. In that time, this retelling of Lewis Carroll\u2019s episodic adventure story, a cross between a hallucinogenic dream and a gentle coming-of-age narrative, has become a favourite across the world. In part that\u2019s thanks to Bob Crowley\u2019s inventive designs, full of strong colour, using every trick in the visual book from projections to puppets to lavish costume. But it\u2019s also due to Wheeldon\u2019s ability to blend demanding classical dance steps with comedy and Broadway razzle dazzle. It\u2019s hard to resist a ballet where the Caterpillar is depicted by a chorus line of blue-spangled legs, and the Queen of Hearts dances a manic Tart Adage (in direct tribute to the famous Rose Adagio in The Sleeping Beauty) with four terrified suitors sticking jam tarts in their open mouths and ducking her pointed feet as she approaches with menace. Each character, from bouncing footmen to floating Cheshire Cat, has a distinctive flavour and purpose, all emphasised by Joby Talbot\u2019s richly textured score. It\u2019s a dream for a big company and you can feel the Royal Ballet\u2019s dancers stretching into its different shades with pleasure as they begin a long run in the repertory. At the matinee performance I saw, first artist Viola Pantuso made a charming debut as Alice, full of wide-eyed excitement; Marcelino Samb\u00e9, as her nascent love interest Jack, partnered with tender care and exhilarating joy. In the evening, Francesca Hayward and William Bracewell were utterly lovely, their relationship flecked with warmth and growing delight, their dancing easy, expansive and musical. Lauren Cuthbertson, the first Alice, graduated to the Queen of Hearts with aplomb, exhibiting a steely technique and venomously precise comic timing. Steven McRae returned from long injury to dazzle as the tap-dancing Mad Hatter. Returning to the UK for the first time since 2013, The National Ballet of Canada has brought Frontiers, a chamber bill of ballets by Canadian choreographers, culminating in the UK premiere of Crystal Pite\u2019s astounding Angels\u2019 Atlas, another work where design is utterly crucial to effect. Designer Jay Gower Taylor and lighting designer Tom Visser create a wall of reflected white light, constantly shifting and changing, sometimes looking like the trails of fireworks, sometimes like cracking ice. In front of it, the dancers move in large scale groupings, or spin and fall in pairs. The movement is constantly surprising \u2013 great swirls of turns, patterns of hearts beating, bodies rising and falling as breath seems to be passed from one dancer to the next in a graceful canon. The theme is fragility and endurance and, underpinned by a keening score of Tchaikovsky and Morten Lauridsen, it is overwhelmingly moving. The two other works make less impact. Passion by James Kudelka, sets a contemporary couple amid the formalities of traditionally romantic classical dancing, while Islands, by rising star Emma Portner, is a thoughtful examination of dependency and separation, explored by attaching two dancers together and then setting them apart. All are danced with commitment, by a company it is a pleasure to watch. Star ratings (out of five) Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Frontiers: Choreographers of Canada \u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2022 Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland is at Royal Ballet and Opera until 1 November and from 13 June-6 July 2025 \u2022 Frontiers: Choreographers of Canada is at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London until 6 October",

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s an old saying that the perfect walk has \u201csomething to see, somewhere to pee, and somewhere to get a cup of tea\u201d. While those things do indeed make for a respectable hike, scientists have discovered that aspects of nature will turn a good walk into a great one, in intriguing ways.</p> <p>Over recent years, it has become apparent that interacting with the great outdoors does wonders for our health, not only because it keeps our bodies physically fit but our brains, too. Last year, a long-term study of 2.3 million people in Wales revealed that <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(23)00212-7/fulltext#app-1\">the closer you live to nature, the lower your chances of having a mental health condition</a>. \u201cIf people interacted with nature every day, it would be a gamechanger in terms of mental health,\u201d says Michele Antonelli, a doctor at the Azienda Unit\u00e0 Sanitaria Locale (local health authority) for Reggio Emilia in Italy.</p> <p>It has been found that certain natural elements \u2013 particular flowers, landscapes and scents \u2013 can boost the brain more than others. Using these new insights, I scoured the UK to find the ultimate mental health walk. It is around 24km (15 miles), needs no orienteering skills and begins at 8.15am in Kielderhead national nature reserve, three miles from the Scottish border near Kielder, one of the most remote villages in England.</p> <p>Our hike begins early, not just because of its length, but because bright light first thing in the morning is a key step in ultimate wellbeing. Light affects our circadian rhythms, the internal metronomes that anchor us to our 24-hour day, and studies show that getting a good dose of sunshine in the morning helps us sleep at night.</p> <p>The walk starts at Blakehopeburnhaugh farm, where a short detour into the nearby woods will lead you to Hindhope Linn, a small but enchanting waterfall that, despite being adequately signposted, is described by the Kielder forest park trail guide as one of the area\u2019s best kept secrets. Nestled in a glen of glistening moss and under a canopy of Scots pine, the waterfall is easy to find, for those who want to dip a toe. I had more in mind \u2013 a 6ft rock provides the perfect spot to change into my swimsuit before I plunge into the waist-deep pool.</p>    <p>An avid fan of outdoor swimming, I\u2019m used to the rush of adrenaline as I sink under the water, but it never fails to surprise me how good it feels. It\u2019s September, so I\u2019m not in for long, but I don\u2019t need to be. Studies show that five minutes of cold-water immersion <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9953392/#B13-biology-12-00211\">triggers physiological reactions</a> that reduce fatigue, lessen symptoms of depression and elevate mood. The hormone cortisol, a key regulator of stress, decreases after swimming and can remain low for hours. These benefits can be gained from a single dip, so a pool of water was a non-negotiable start for my mental health hike.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Looking at the walls of pine that line our path, I wonder why their power over our mental health is not better utilised</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stepping back out on to Forest Drive we enter an ancient woodland. Looking at the symmetrical walls of pine that line our path, I wonder why their power over our mental health is not better utilised. Years of research shows how green spaces lower stress and increase our ability to perform, yet we don\u2019t take advantage, says Antonelli. Children who look out of a window and see greenery during a test score higher and are faster to recover from the stress of the exam than those who look out on a brick wall, for instance. \u201cHow easy would it be for schools to grow ivy up their walls,\u201d remarks Kathy Willis, professor of biodiversity at the University of Oxford and author of <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/good-nature-9781526664891/\">Good Nature:The New Science of How Nature Improves Our Health</a></em>.</p> <p>The power of nature to focus our attention and decrease our stress levels is not just about its pleasing aesthetics but ties in with an idea known as attention restoration theory. During the day, we direct our attention to a number of tasks \u2013 reading emails, writing reports, scheduling meetings, all the while ignoring distractions. It\u2019s what\u2019s known as \u201ctop-down attention\u201d \u2013 our thoughts direct our actions. But this attention is cognitively exhausting so we can\u2019t sustain it for long and quickly lose focus and self-control. Nature triggers what\u2019s known as \u201csoft fascination\u201d. It contains stimuli that catch our attention and are less cognitively demanding \u2013 creating what\u2019s known as \u201cbottom-up attention\u201d; this gives the brain a chance to recover.</p>    <p>Forests are the ideal environment for a mental minibreak, but this particular one offers a lot more. The tall walls of Sitka spruce and Scots pine are bordered by tufted hairgrass. Together, they form the perfect palette, not just in their beauty, but because small studies suggest that yellows and greens have the strongest effect on <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1420326X16638711\">neuronal activity associated with a calm state</a>.</p> <p>The forest\u2019s scent is also significant. Crouching low, I pick a small amount of pine needles from a nearby tree, crush them and inhale deeply. The smell triggers happy memories of Christmas. Yet it offers more than nostalgia.</p> <p>Trees release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to ward off parasites, but their odour activates nerves that influence human hormones and other physiological processes.

Fractals are of interest because it turns out that we prefer to look at landscapes with a D-value of around 1.3. \u201cThese types of landscapes tend to be open savannahs with a few dotted trees,\u201d says Willis. We may be drawn to these savannah-type landscapes because they were once a place where you could easily spot danger, while still providing some shelter, although it\u2019s hard to find strong evidence to support this idea, says Willis. What we do know is that these landscapes generate brainwaves associated with relaxation and focus, while dampening those associated with fatigue, making them ideal for mental wellbeing.</p> <p>\u201cIt really does make you feel more relaxed,\u201d says my walking partner Jess, staring out at the scene from Blakehope Nick, a large sculpture created as a beacon from which to observe the dramatic open landscape.</p>    <p>I thought a lot about whether to walk alone or with a friend.

Blue spaces, with their soft sounds and changing patterns, help us achieve that bottom-up attention that gently draws our brains away from rumination and towards a more restful mindset.</p> <p>It is as the sun sets, however, that we discover why this walk is truly special.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s an old saying that the perfect walk has \u201csomething to see, somewhere to pee, and somewhere to get a cup of tea\u201d. While those things do indeed make for a respectable hike, scientists have discovered that aspects of nature will turn a good walk into a great one, in intriguing ways. Over recent years, it has become apparent that interacting with the great outdoors does wonders for our health, not only because it keeps our bodies physically fit but our brains, too. Last year, a long-term study of 2.3 million people in Wales revealed that the closer you live to nature, the lower your chances of having a mental health condition. \u201cIf people interacted with nature every day, it would be a gamechanger in terms of mental health,\u201d says Michele Antonelli, a doctor at the Azienda Unit\u00e0 Sanitaria Locale (local health authority) for Reggio Emilia in Italy. It has been found that certain natural elements \u2013 particular flowers, landscapes and scents \u2013 can boost the brain more than others. Using these new insights, I scoured the UK to find the ultimate mental health walk. It is around 24km (15 miles), needs no orienteering skills and begins at 8.15am in Kielderhead national nature reserve, three miles from the Scottish border near Kielder, one of the most remote villages in England. Our hike begins early, not just because of its length, but because bright light first thing in the morning is a key step in ultimate wellbeing. Light affects our circadian rhythms, the internal metronomes that anchor us to our 24-hour day, and studies show that getting a good dose of sunshine in the morning helps us sleep at night. The walk starts at Blakehopeburnhaugh farm, where a short detour into the nearby woods will lead you to Hindhope Linn, a small but enchanting waterfall that, despite being adequately signposted, is described by the Kielder forest park trail guide as one of the area\u2019s best kept secrets. Nestled in a glen of glistening moss and under a canopy of Scots pine, the waterfall is easy to find, for those who want to dip a toe. I had more in mind \u2013 a 6ft rock provides the perfect spot to change into my swimsuit before I plunge into the waist-deep pool. An avid fan of outdoor swimming, I\u2019m used to the rush of adrenaline as I sink under the water, but it never fails to surprise me how good it feels. It\u2019s September, so I\u2019m not in for long, but I don\u2019t need to be. Studies show that five minutes of cold-water immersion triggers physiological reactions that reduce fatigue, lessen symptoms of depression and elevate mood. The hormone cortisol, a key regulator of stress, decreases after swimming and can remain low for hours. These benefits can be gained from a single dip, so a pool of water was a non-negotiable start for my mental health hike. Stepping back out on to Forest Drive we enter an ancient woodland. Looking at the symmetrical walls of pine that line our path, I wonder why their power over our mental health is not better utilised. Years of research shows how green spaces lower stress and increase our ability to perform, yet we don\u2019t take advantage, says Antonelli. Children who look out of a window and see greenery during a test score higher and are faster to recover from the stress of the exam than those who look out on a brick wall, for instance. \u201cHow easy would it be for schools to grow ivy up their walls,\u201d remarks Kathy Willis, professor of biodiversity at the University of Oxford and author of Good Nature:The New Science of How Nature Improves Our Health. The power of nature to focus our attention and decrease our stress levels is not just about its pleasing aesthetics but ties in with an idea known as attention restoration theory. During the day, we direct our attention to a number of tasks \u2013 reading emails, writing reports, scheduling meetings, all the while ignoring distractions. It\u2019s what\u2019s known as \u201ctop-down attention\u201d \u2013 our thoughts direct our actions. But this attention is cognitively exhausting so we can\u2019t sustain it for long and quickly lose focus and self-control. Nature triggers what\u2019s known as \u201csoft fascination\u201d. It contains stimuli that catch our attention and are less cognitively demanding \u2013 creating what\u2019s known as \u201cbottom-up attention\u201d; this gives the brain a chance to recover. Forests are the ideal environment for a mental minibreak, but this particular one offers a lot more. The tall walls of Sitka spruce and Scots pine are bordered by tufted hairgrass. Together, they form the perfect palette, not just in their beauty, but because small studies suggest that yellows and greens have the strongest effect on neuronal activity associated with a calm state. The forest\u2019s scent is also significant. Crouching low, I pick a small amount of pine needles from a nearby tree, crush them and inhale deeply. The smell triggers happy memories of Christmas. Yet it offers more than nostalgia. Trees release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to ward off parasites, but their odour activates nerves that influence human hormones and other physiological processes. They are also absorbed through the lungs into our blood. \u201cSmell is the most fascinating sense when it comes to the impact of nature on your wellbeing,\u201d says Willis. \u201cSmell directly influences your blood in a way that sight and sound cannot.\u201d I chose a walk with plenty of pine and spruce because they release two particularly interesting VOCs: pinene and limonene. Studies show that these chemicals reduce cortisol, lower blood pressure and boost mood. Spending at least 20 minutes in the woods will have an effect, but Antonelli recommends longer. \u201cSpend six hours among the trees and you\u2019ll see beneficial effects for days,\u201d he says. \u201cSpend days in the forest and the effects can last a month.\u201d We spend two and half hours walking along this path, absorbing its sensory gifts.

Initially a bit leaden, Harington\u2019s performance evolves into a fine turn (equal parts entitled, needy and numb).</p> <p>Elsewhere, haring through eight high-octane episodes, it\u2019s a pitiless whirl of disaster, disintegration, tragedy, jaded asides (\u201cWe\u2019re all just chimps in a hierarchy\u201d), vicious put-downs (\u201cYou look like a TM Lewin wanker\u201d), sexual kinks (including urine: \u201cPiss and think of England\u201d), and unsubtle swipes at corporate ethical eco-hypocrisy (\u201cPoster children for a new kind of capitalism\u201d).</p> <p>Regular <em>Industry</em> viewers probably won\u2019t be surprised that there\u2019s a fight between Yasmin and Harper, culminating in slaps. As I suspected \u2013 millennial <em>Dynasty</em>. Though, in all seriousness, it isn\u2019t. The writing and performances here are the equal of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/04/succession-final-episode-finale-review-the-gallows-pole-shane-meadows-changing-ends-alan-carr-university-challenge-jeremy-paxman\">Succession</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/06/the-week-in-tv-the-white-lotus-sas-rogue-heroes-jimmy-akingbola-handle-with-care-and-more-reviews\">The White Lotus</a></em>. <em>Industry</em> has always been a good (sharp, audacious) show. Now it\u2019s great.</p>    <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81591296\">Nobody Wants This</a></strong> is a new romcom sitcom sashaying up a storm on Netflix. Created by Erin Foster, it stars Adam Brody as \u201chot rabbi\u201d Noah, and Kristen Bell as Joanne, a non-Jewish woman who hosts a sex podcast with her sister, Morgan. They fall for each other, but not everyone is happy about it (\u201cNow you explain to me how this woman got her claws into my beautiful, beautiful son\u201d). Noah can\u2019t become head rabbi unless Joanne converts, and his ex-girlfriend lurks like a bad fairy.</p> <p><em>Nobody Wants This</em> feels very classic (with that <em>When Harry Met Sally</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/10/when-harry-met-sally-rerelease-film-review-nora-ephron\">talky quality</a>), but it also nudges boundaries (\u201cYour little blond friend who can\u2019t stop talking about ass play on her podcast\u201d). Over 10 episodes, the initially bumpy relationship (\u201cYou can\u2019t friend-zone me because I already friend-zoned you\u201d) is tested in a temple, in a sex shop, at a batmitzvah, and at a Judaism camp where Joanne is slammed by teenagers (\u201cYou girls harshly judging me actually helped\u201d).</p> <p>It\u2019s not perfect: the opener is clunky and the podcast element could be funnier. Still, it\u2019s witty and naughty (\u201cAre all guys medically stupid?\u201d) and the huge cast, including <em>Veep</em>\u2019s Timothy Simons, are uniformly excellent (Lupe is a riot as snarky Morgan). <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/15/the-week-in-tv-colin-from-accounts-season-2-two-in-vogue-the-90s-disney-documentary-anna-wintour-trump-should-we-be-scared-trump-vs-harris-the-us-presidential-debate-grand-designs-25-years-and-counting-review\">Colin From Accounts</a></em> just got itself some competition.</p> <p>Also on Netflix, Alice Oseman\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81059939\">Heartstopper</a></strong> returns for a third eight-part series. The hit drama about a relationship between teenage boys, Charlie (Joe Locke) and Nick (Kit Connor), still wields sweetness as its superpower: peak-mushy texting rallies; the signature cartoon graphics (butterflies; flowers); the now sixth form-aged cohort that includes a lesbian couple, a transgender girl, an asexual character and so on.</p>    <p><em>Heartstopper</em> isn\u2019t just about idealised teens, it\u2019s about an idealised Britain. It\u2019s the show where cynicism is crushed to death beneath an avalanche of Love Hearts sweets. However, this time, there\u2019s also everything from prejudice to sexual awakening (Bail out now, if you want the characters sticking to holding hands and overdoing the emojis). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/aug/17/i-lived-with-an-eating-disorder-tv-almost-never-got-it-right-until-heartstopper\">Charlie\u2019s eating disorder</a> also comes to the fore, his turmoil (\u201cLove can\u2019t cure mental illness\u201d) manifesting in dark, slashing graphics.</p> <p>Olivia Colman (Nick\u2019s mum) is awol, replaced with his aunt (Hayley Atwell); Eddie Marsan plays an insightful therapist.

Elsewhere, haring through eight high-octane episodes, it\u2019s a pitiless whirl of disaster, disintegration, tragedy, jaded asides (\u201cWe\u2019re all just chimps in a hierarchy\u201d), vicious put-downs (\u201cYou look like a TM Lewin wanker\u201d), sexual kinks (including urine: \u201cPiss and think of England\u201d), and unsubtle swipes at corporate ethical eco-hypocrisy (\u201cPoster children for a new kind of capitalism\u201d). Regular Industry viewers probably won\u2019t be surprised that there\u2019s a fight between Yasmin and Harper, culminating in slaps. As I suspected \u2013 millennial Dynasty. Though, in all seriousness, it isn\u2019t. The writing and performances here are the equal of Succession and The White Lotus. Industry has always been a good (sharp, audacious) show. Now it\u2019s great. Nobody Wants This is a new romcom sitcom sashaying up a storm on Netflix. Created by Erin Foster, it stars Adam Brody as \u201chot rabbi\u201d Noah, and Kristen Bell as Joanne, a non-Jewish woman who hosts a sex podcast with her sister, Morgan. They fall for each other, but not everyone is happy about it (\u201cNow you explain to me how this woman got her claws into my beautiful, beautiful son\u201d). Noah can\u2019t become head rabbi unless Joanne converts, and his ex-girlfriend lurks like a bad fairy. Nobody Wants This feels very classic (with that When Harry Met Sally talky quality), but it also nudges boundaries (\u201cYour little blond friend who can\u2019t stop talking about ass play on her podcast\u201d). Over 10 episodes, the initially bumpy relationship (\u201cYou can\u2019t friend-zone me because I already friend-zoned you\u201d) is tested in a temple, in a sex shop, at a batmitzvah, and at a Judaism camp where Joanne is slammed by teenagers (\u201cYou girls harshly judging me actually helped\u201d). It\u2019s not perfect: the opener is clunky and the podcast element could be funnier. Still, it\u2019s witty and naughty (\u201cAre all guys medically stupid?\u201d) and the huge cast, including Veep\u2019s Timothy Simons, are uniformly excellent (Lupe is a riot as snarky Morgan). Colin From Accounts just got itself some competition. Also on Netflix, Alice Oseman\u2019s Heartstopper returns for a third eight-part series. The hit drama about a relationship between teenage boys, Charlie (Joe Locke) and Nick (Kit Connor), still wields sweetness as its superpower: peak-mushy texting rallies; the signature cartoon graphics (butterflies; flowers); the now sixth form-aged cohort that includes a lesbian couple, a transgender girl, an asexual character and so on. Heartstopper isn\u2019t just about idealised teens, it\u2019s about an idealised Britain. It\u2019s the show where cynicism is crushed to death beneath an avalanche of Love Hearts sweets. However, this time, there\u2019s also everything from prejudice to sexual awakening (Bail out now, if you want the characters sticking to holding hands and overdoing the emojis). Charlie\u2019s eating disorder also comes to the fore, his turmoil (\u201cLove can\u2019t cure mental illness\u201d) manifesting in dark, slashing graphics. Olivia Colman (Nick\u2019s mum) is awol, replaced with his aunt (Hayley Atwell); Eddie Marsan plays an insightful therapist. So, it\u2019s business as usual, but rather more besides. Heartstopper seems determined to grow up.

Only 5.9% of new vans sold in 2023 were electric, and last week the car industry said it was also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/04/carmakers-ramp-up-pressure-on-chancellor-for-ev-sales-subsidies\">struggling to sell electric cars</a> without government incentives. The growth in home deliveries has seen carbon emissions from vans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/22/carbon-emissions-vans-rising-uk-drivers-diesel\">rise by 63%</a> since 1990, while emissions from cars has fallen over the same period.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/04/carmakers-ramp-up-pressure-on-chancellor-for-ev-sales-subsidies\">Carmakers ramp up pressure on chancellor for EV sales subsidies </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many of the businesses signing an open letter to Sadiq Khan \u2013 who are backed by Clean Cities, the environmental campaign group, and the Federation of Small Businesses \u2013 have invested in electric fleets. They say the current system, where they pay \u00a310 a year to register each vehicle as exempt, played a \u201cfundamental role\u201d in those investments and that the decision to end the exemption will inflict an \u201castronomical cost\u201d of \u00a35,500 per vehicle per year on the firms that have already made the switch away from diesel. Abolishing the exemption would undermine firms who have \u201ctaken on debt to invest in the air we breathe\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTen years ago, it was common to blow your nose and find black \u00adparticulates on your handkerchief,\u201d said Edmund King, president of the AA. \u201cThis has thankfully changed. Cutting the discount for electric vans is a detrimental policy which could backfire on the health of Londoners and the economy of London. We still need to encourage zero emission transport rather than deter it.\u201d The mayor has previously defended his decision saying that the congestion charge was originally created to relieve traffic in central London while electric vehicles have increased from 20,000 six years ago to 112,000.</p> <p>Fewer than 3% of vans registered in London are electric, and when the mayor offered a \u00a3100m scrappage scheme for people affected by the Ulez expansion, just 2% of vans were replaced with an electric version.</p> <p>Part of the lack of enthusiasm is because electric vans are more \u00adexpensive to buy than diesel vans, and can be difficult to charge as they are&nbsp;too large to fit in some public charging points.</p> <p>Electric van sales in the Netherlands are twice as high as the UK and, last week, a Clean Cities report showed that 20 Dutch cities are creating zero emission zones where all delivery vehicles must be powered by a battery or hydrogen.

      "bodyText": "More than 40 businesses including Ocado, the AA and Openreach have called on the mayor of London to abandon plans to extend the congestion charge to electric vans. On Christmas Day 2025, drivers of electric vehicles will start having to pay the same \u00a315 a day charge as those driving petrol and diesel vehicles in central London. This will hinder the already sluggish take-up of electric vans, the businesses say. Only 5.9% of new vans sold in 2023 were electric, and last week the car industry said it was also struggling to sell electric cars without government incentives. The growth in home deliveries has seen carbon emissions from vans rise by 63% since 1990, while emissions from cars has fallen over the same period. Many of the businesses signing an open letter to Sadiq Khan \u2013 who are backed by Clean Cities, the environmental campaign group, and the Federation of Small Businesses \u2013 have invested in electric fleets. They say the current system, where they pay \u00a310 a year to register each vehicle as exempt, played a \u201cfundamental role\u201d in those investments and that the decision to end the exemption will inflict an \u201castronomical cost\u201d of \u00a35,500 per vehicle per year on the firms that have already made the switch away from diesel. Abolishing the exemption would undermine firms who have \u201ctaken on debt to invest in the air we breathe\u201d. \u201cTen years ago, it was common to blow your nose and find black particulates on your handkerchief,\u201d said Edmund King, president of the AA. \u201cThis has thankfully changed. Cutting the discount for electric vans is a detrimental policy which could backfire on the health of Londoners and the economy of London. We still need to encourage zero emission transport rather than deter it.\u201d The mayor has previously defended his decision saying that the congestion charge was originally created to relieve traffic in central London while electric vehicles have increased from 20,000 six years ago to 112,000. Fewer than 3% of vans registered in London are electric, and when the mayor offered a \u00a3100m scrappage scheme for people affected by the Ulez expansion, just 2% of vans were replaced with an electric version. Part of the lack of enthusiasm is because electric vans are more expensive to buy than diesel vans, and can be difficult to charge as they are too large to fit in some public charging points. Electric van sales in the Netherlands are twice as high as the UK and, last week, a Clean Cities report showed that 20 Dutch cities are creating zero emission zones where all delivery vehicles must be powered by a battery or hydrogen. The mayor has dropped plans for a zero emissions zone in London. Oliver Lord, UK head of Clean Cities, said that Khan\u2019s decision was \u201cat odds with his track record and his commitment on climate\u201d. \u201cUltimately, small businesses are those set to suffer the most, with the progress towards a cleaner, electric future choked off in an economic situation already fraught with challenges,\u201d Lord said. \u201cHow is it right that a dirty diesel van pays the same as a cleaner electric vehicle in the most polluted part of the UK?\u201d Laura Timm, Federation of Small Businesses London Policy Chair said: \u201cSmall firms all over London have faced a \u2018cost of doing business crisis\u2019 for the best part of a decade and many have \u2018done the right thing\u2019 and invested in green initiatives within their business.\u201d A spokesperson for the Mayor said that the Cleaner Vehicle Discount was ending because the increase in electric vehicles had reduced the impact of the congestion charge. \u201cHowever, the Mayor recognises the issues raised relating to electric vans, including the importance of supporting those businesses who have done the right thing and moved to cleaner vehicles. \u201cWe are working with TfL to see what more could be done to mitigate the effect of this phasing out and further incentivise businesses to make the switch to cleaner vehicles.

The aim is unworkable in theory and practice, engendering a series of disasters ranging from monetarism to the Truss budget.</p> <p>Instead, Britain must strike out anew. The project must be a high-investment, high-productivity economy. The state does not crowd out business investment: public investment crowds it in. Inequality and social division are not prices worth paying for growth; they actively impair it. The mission should be to build a \u201cwe society\u201d, incorporating not just an income safety net but decent housing, nutrition, transport and provision of health and social care, ladders of opportunity and the creation of a purpose-driven, innovative stakeholder capitalism. An agile state would lead the charge.</p> <p>The hope was that a newly elected Labour government might take heed, especially if it won a landslide. But after making more mistakes in its first 100 days \u2013 a milestone it reaches this week \u2013 than any postwar government, the title sounds like a cry into the void. Audiences around the country don\u2019t spare me their sense of intense disappointment at the never-ending stories from \u201cfreebie-gate\u201d, made more intense by the outcry over removing pensioners\u2019 winter fuel allowance, scrapping the cap on social care bills and voting to retain the two-child limit on benefit payments. Double standards can be expected of the Tory party \u2013 but not Labour. Why does a rich country, notwithstanding 14 years of misgovernance, face such self-imposed \u201ctough\u201d choices? What is Labour\u2019s vision for the country?</p> <p>Part of the problem is that the party\u2019s leadership relegates the importance of ideas and political philosophy because, allegedly, they do not constitute good \u201cretail politics\u201d, don\u2019t play well in focus groups and open up the threat of attack for being of the left. It is safer&nbsp;to duck argument over ideas and be a managerial party focusing on delivery. It is a first order mistake&nbsp;Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson or Tony Blair did not make \u2013 and certainly not Margaret Thatcher. Ideas are the lifeblood of politics. Without a philosophy, the politician blows in the wind and has no definition. </p> <p>Blair might have been the quintessential centrist, but he knew that as a Labour leader he had to house it in a distinctive philosophy that had leftwing roots. He declared that it was not socialism that endured, but its <em>ethic</em> \u2013 of acting together to promote better outcomes for every individual. We must have one another\u2019s backs. But that ethic of socialism had to be combined with a demand that individuals (and firms) accepted reciprocal social responsibilities, so \u201cthe rights we enjoy reflect the duties we owe\u201d \u2013 as his rewritten <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/09/clause-iv-of-labour-party-constitution-what-is-all-the-fuss-about-reinstating-it\">clause IV</a>, which used to commit Labour to common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange, now states. It was a \u201cthird way\u201d for which he was prepared consistently to argue despite the brickbats from right and left. It might not have lived up to its potential promise \u2013 although he left British public services in much better shape than he found them \u2013 but he handed on to his successors a viable political framework on which to build.</p> <p>Combining an ethic of socialism with a hard-headed social liberalism&nbsp;is progressive gold. The&nbsp;former is what drives the creation of strong societal foundations; the latter informs the building of ladders of opportunity. To complete the \u201cwe&nbsp;society\u201d there needs to be a state committed to the&nbsp;high public and private investment without which there is neither the wherewithal nor growth to fulfil the ambition.</p> <p>It is hard to properly gauge the intent of a philosophy-light government. It was quick to freeze infrastructure projects around the country for all their evident need, but 100 days in it has yet to grip multiple social crises. Thus one of the totemic policies of the failed \u201cme society\u201d decades was the sale of council houses at aggressive discounts to incumbents without an explicit requirement that any sale must be matched by a newly built replacement. To reward the current generation of tenants while neglecting the next by shrinking the council house stock by 4.4m over 45&nbsp;years has been social vandalism. It should be stopped.</p> <p>But there are signs of a progressive philosophy emerging. Keir Starmer\u2019s speech at the Labour conference, restating his commitment to economic growth and investment, as well as cultural pleasures, echoed Anthony Crosland, the archetypal liberal social democrat. His <em>The Future of Socialism</em>, now nearly 70 years old, was as radical a critique of Labour\u2019s clause IV as Tony Blair\u2019s. His vision was of public investment-led growth that would deliver not only wellbeing for all but more \u201cgaiety and liberty in private life\u201d. A few days later, Starmer said that he believes in borrowing for public investment.</p> <p>It is a refrain being taken up by Rachel Reeves, although the jury is out until the 30 October budget. \u201cInvest, invest, invest\u201d is her commitment, she told the <em>Financial Times</em>. In Liverpool to promote a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/04/labour-to-commit-almost-22bn-to-fund-carbon-capture-and-storage-projects\">25-year \u00a322bn commitment</a> to invest in carbon capture and storage technologies, she attacked Tory spending plans that leave public investment falling to a derisory 1.6% of GDP by the end of the parliament.</p> <p>The open question is how much any rewrite of the famed fiscal rules in the forthcoming budget will allow public investment to be lifted to a benchmark 3% of GDP, making a real impact on growth. A review of the pension system to promote more British investment is in full swing. Taxation will rise to relieve the worst pressure on public service delivery. This Thursday\u2019s employment rights bill, marking Labour\u2019s first 100 days, with commitments to offer better sick and maternity pay, and more protection against unfair dismissal, is a decisive improvement in Britain\u2019s workplace settlement.</p> <p>There have been too many avoidable mistakes since Labour came to power. Now it is beginning to roll out progressive policies \u2013 but they would have more purpose if part of an overarching philosophy. The party does aim to build a strong social floor, ladders of opportunity and a high-investment economy, combining socialism and social liberalism. It is a compelling vision, and to argue for it would reveal the government\u2019s direction of travel. It could even mean fewer mistakes.</p> <p>\u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist.

What is Labour\u2019s vision for the country? Part of the problem is that the party\u2019s leadership relegates the importance of ideas and political philosophy because, allegedly, they do not constitute good \u201cretail politics\u201d, don\u2019t play well in focus groups and open up the threat of attack for being of the left. It is safer to duck argument over ideas and be a managerial party focusing on delivery. It is a first order mistake Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson or Tony Blair did not make \u2013 and certainly not Margaret Thatcher. Ideas are the lifeblood of politics. Without a philosophy, the politician blows in the wind and has no definition. Blair might have been the quintessential centrist, but he knew that as a Labour leader he had to house it in a distinctive philosophy that had leftwing roots. He declared that it was not socialism that endured, but its ethic \u2013 of acting together to promote better outcomes for every individual. We must have one another\u2019s backs. But that ethic of socialism had to be combined with a demand that individuals (and firms) accepted reciprocal social responsibilities, so \u201cthe rights we enjoy reflect the duties we owe\u201d \u2013 as his rewritten clause IV, which used to commit Labour to common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange, now states. It was a \u201cthird way\u201d for which he was prepared consistently to argue despite the brickbats from right and left. It might not have lived up to its potential promise \u2013 although he left British public services in much better shape than he found them \u2013 but he handed on to his successors a viable political framework on which to build. Combining an ethic of socialism with a hard-headed social liberalism is progressive gold. The former is what drives the creation of strong societal foundations; the latter informs the building of ladders of opportunity. To complete the \u201cwe society\u201d there needs to be a state committed to the high public and private investment without which there is neither the wherewithal nor growth to fulfil the ambition. It is hard to properly gauge the intent of a philosophy-light government. It was quick to freeze infrastructure projects around the country for all their evident need, but 100 days in it has yet to grip multiple social crises. Thus one of the totemic policies of the failed \u201cme society\u201d decades was the sale of council houses at aggressive discounts to incumbents without an explicit requirement that any sale must be matched by a newly built replacement. To reward the current generation of tenants while neglecting the next by shrinking the council house stock by 4.4m over 45 years has been social vandalism. It should be stopped. But there are signs of a progressive philosophy emerging. Keir Starmer\u2019s speech at the Labour conference, restating his commitment to economic growth and investment, as well as cultural pleasures, echoed Anthony Crosland, the archetypal liberal social democrat. His The Future of Socialism, now nearly 70 years old, was as radical a critique of Labour\u2019s clause IV as Tony Blair\u2019s. His vision was of public investment-led growth that would deliver not only wellbeing for all but more \u201cgaiety and liberty in private life\u201d. A few days later, Starmer said that he believes in borrowing for public investment. It is a refrain being taken up by Rachel Reeves, although the jury is out until the 30 October budget. \u201cInvest, invest, invest\u201d is her commitment, she told the Financial Times. In Liverpool to promote a 25-year \u00a322bn commitment to invest in carbon capture and storage technologies, she attacked Tory spending plans that leave public investment falling to a derisory 1.6% of GDP by the end of the parliament. The open question is how much any rewrite of the famed fiscal rules in the forthcoming budget will allow public investment to be lifted to a benchmark 3% of GDP, making a real impact on growth. A review of the pension system to promote more British investment is in full swing. Taxation will rise to relieve the worst pressure on public service delivery. This Thursday\u2019s employment rights bill, marking Labour\u2019s first 100 days, with commitments to offer better sick and maternity pay, and more protection against unfair dismissal, is a decisive improvement in Britain\u2019s workplace settlement. There have been too many avoidable mistakes since Labour came to power. Now it is beginning to roll out progressive policies \u2013 but they would have more purpose if part of an overarching philosophy. The party does aim to build a strong social floor, ladders of opportunity and a high-investment economy, combining socialism and social liberalism. It is a compelling vision, and to argue for it would reveal the government\u2019s direction of travel. It could even mean fewer mistakes. \u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist.

      "body": "<p>It started with a boiled egg. Last year, Chloe Day, 25, kept seeing it all over social media. She was intrigued. It wasn\u2019t the kind of egg you\u2019d have for breakfast. There was a smiley face on the bright yellow yolk and little legs descending from the egg white. At 14cm tall, it was adorable \u2013 the egg part soft and fluffy and the legs made out of brown corduroy.</p> <p>What Day was seeing, on social media and in shops, was an \u201camuseable\u201d boiled egg by Jellycat, a brand that specialises in cute soft toys with smiley faces. \u201cI remember it so clearly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt kept cropping up. I thought: I have to have one of those.\u201d Eventually, she bought one.</p>    <p>Since getting her first Jellycat in June last year, Day\u2019s collection has grown substantially \u2013 she now has 252. This summer, she and her boyfriend bought their first home and one of the spare rooms will be dedicated to Jellycats, with floor-to-ceiling shelves to house her ever-expanding collection.</p> <p>Day is part of a growing community of Jellycat enthusiasts. While the privately owned brand has been going since 1999, its popularity has soared in recent years. Founded in London by brothers Thomas and William Gatacre, this year marks 25 years since Jellycat first launched \u2013 and its range keeps expanding. Its offering of soft toys (also known as plushies), includes classic cuddly animals like bears and bunnies, but it also has the amuseables line (launched in 2018), which includes random objects \u2013 a baguette and a tennis ball, a cactus and a boiled egg \u2013 all with a smiley faces and legs (or, occasionally, arms). Some of the toys appeal to children. Others seem geared towards an adult audience, like the amuseable coffee-to-go, a fuzzy takeaway cup in neutral tones of cream and beige, with dangly legs and a smiley face. You can even get Jellycat bags, which are \u201cwearable\u201d versions of the toys, and come in a variety of designs, including a croissant, a takeaway coffee and a sausage dog. Jellycat\u2019s toys range in size and price, too \u2013 the smaller ones start at \u00a311, but the \u201cgigantic\u201d toys can cost between \u00a3750 and \u00a31,200.</p> <p>The company doesn\u2019t share sales figures or offer interviews, saying they prefer to let the \u201cJellycat fans do the talking.\u201d But in a rare interview in 2021 with MBS group, William Gatacre said the brand is all about \u201ctrying to be uplifting\u201d, and that when they launched, they wanted to refresh the toy market, saying: \u201cIt felt tired, bare and a little bit taxidermy.\u201d The company name was a suggestion from Thomas Gatacre\u2019s seven-year-old son, who apparently loved jelly and cats.</p>    <p>As well as the Jellycat online store, the toys are stocked in shops all over the UK, including department stores like John Lewis and Selfridges as well as upmarket lifestyle stores such as the White Company. According to Selfridges, Jellycat is now the department store\u2019s fastest-selling toy brand and its sales of Jellycat products are up 189% from last year. It\u2019s not just in the UK \u2013 Jellycats are sold in stores across 80 countries. The company is global. In 2001, it expanded and formed a US arm, Jellycat Inc. It now has offices in London, Minneapolis, Shanghai and Seoul.</p> <p>In 2018, the Gatacre brothers hit the <em>Sunday Times</em> Rich List, when the company was valued at \u00a3155m. Since then, it has gone from strength to strength. According to 2022 statements for Jellycat Limited (the brand\u2019s UK arm), the company\u2019s annual revenue increased by 72% to \u00a3146m.</p> <p>The rise of Jellycat\u2019s fans in recent years is partly down to social media, where people showcase their collections and connect with other enthusiasts. On TikTok there are 113,000 posts with the Jellycat hashtag. There are more than 729,000 on Instagram. Search for the hashtag and you\u2019ll be bombarded with videos of people unboxing their latest purchase, or sharing their collection and dedicated Jellycat display shelves stacked with colourful toys.</p>    <p>The brand has a slick social media strategy, too, regularly posting Jellycat memes and news about \u201cJelly drops\u201d on Instagram and TikTok, where it has 841,000 followers and 466,000 followers, respectively. Day says she has always loved collecting things \u2013 as a child, it was vintage Barbie dolls and Charlie Bears \u2013 but she says Jellycats are \u201cThe only one that\u2019s really stuck.\u201d That\u2019s down to the variety of toys, the new product launches (four times a year) and being able to hunt down rare items. Some designs have been \u201cretired\u201d, making them more valuable. \u201cThere\u2019s always something new to choose, and iIt\u2019s exciting when you manage to get one that you\u2019ve been after for a long time,\u201d she says.</p> <p>While Jellycat has been making cuddly toys for decades, it\u2019s the newer toys she loves. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that some of the old Jellycats have the same appeal, unless you\u2019re a diehard collector. I like the newer models, like the baked bean, the olive and the marshmallow. There\u2019s nothing else like that.\u201d Each of these has the signature smiley face and legs \u2013 the baked bean is a single orange bean, the olives are a pair, joined by a dark green stalk, and the marshmallow comes in a set of two, one pastel pink, one white. Day likes the aesthetic of the newer toys, like the amuseables, which bring inanimate objects to life, often in bright colours, compared to the more traditional older toys, such as bears and bunnies, in more neutral tones. She creates different displays of her Jellycats in her home, which often have a theme, like outer space.</p> <p>Andrew Elliott, 25, has also enjoyed collecting toys throughout his life. But the draw he feels towards Jellycats is on another level. \u201cJellycats are the only thing that\u2019s ever come into my life where I\u2019ll see one in a shop window and think: I have to get that,\u201d says Elliott, who lives in London. \u201cI find it difficult to walk into a shop where I can see them and walk out without any.\u201d He has been collecting Jellycats for about four years and has 43 of them displayed on shelves above his bed. His girlfriend bought him his first \u2013 a donkey, which is still his favourite. \u201cI have a particular emotional attachment to that one,\u201d he says.</p>    <p>His love for Jellycats has continued to grow ever since, along with his collection. \u201cThey\u2019ve made a toy of pretty much anything you could imagine. They\u2019re really fun to collect,\u201d says Elliott. \u201cThey\u2019re sort of like a modern day Beanie Baby, but not just animals.\u201d Since many of the toys are inanimate household objects, he sometimes swaps the real thing for a Jellycat. \u201cI like to replace stuff in the house with them every now and again. I put Jellycat fruit and veg in the fruit bowl. At work, I used to replace my colleague\u2019s office supplies with Jellycats, things like rulers and pencils.\u201d</p> <p>At home, they spark joy. \u201cThey make me happy when I see them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t live in the most fun and friendly times, so I think surrounding your house with smiley faces is a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>But for some,<em><strong> </strong></em>collecting Jellycats goes beyond their pleasing aesthetic and cute, smiling faces and offers a form of self-care. Nell Richards, 40, who lives in Dorset, started her collection nine months ago. She has severe anxiety after leaving an abusive relationship, and has also been left paralysed down one side after having two strokes aged 33. \u201cI was given a Jellycat as a present to help with my anxiety, and I fell in love with them,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about them before. The first one I got was a Bartholomew Bear. It\u2019s lived on my bed ever since.\u201d</p>    <p>Over the last few months, Richards\u2019s collection has grown and she now has 23. They all share the bed with Bartholomew Bear, though she\u2019s looking at getting a dedicated shelf for them. \u201cThey make me feel calm,\u201d she says. \u201cThey help with my anxiety. If I\u2019m anxious, I\u2019ll sit on my bed with them. I like stroking the rabbit\u2019s ears \u2013 it takes the edge off things.\u201d Because of her disability, Richards has carers who come into the house, and they\u2019ve also witnessed how beneficial her Jellycat collection can be. \u201cI have carers every morning. If I\u2019m feeling anxious, they bring one to me and it helps.\u201d Richards is totally new to collecting toys and she\u2019s been surprised at the impact her Jellycats have had on her. \u201cAs a 40-year-old, I never expected to collect something like this.\u201d</p> <p>Neither Day or Elliott set out to collect Jellycats either, but they also have found comfort in them. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect my collection to balloon like it has,\u201d says Elliott. \u201cBut I like the fact I can look at them and remember where each one came from and how I felt when I bought them. I wouldn\u2019t have envisioned collecting Jellycat toys at this point in my life, but I\u2019m glad I have something that makes me so happy.\u201d</p>    <p>While we might not expect adults to find cuddly toys appealing, psychotherapist Susie Masterson says it makes sense. \u201cWhen we feel anxious, it can help to focus on an area of our lives that brings us joy. As adults, life can be overwhelming. The stress surrounding things like work, family, politics and climate change can lead to feelings of dysregulation and a sense of being unsafe,\u201d she explains. \u201cJellycat makes the kind of toys that we would have had in our cots. If you think about the world of a baby, it is usually a safe place where we are surrounded by smiling faces \u2013 whether in human or toy form.\u201d According to Masterson, the combination of the colours, soft fur and cute facial expressions is likely to make people feel soothed, whatever age they are.</p> <p>That said, it can be hard to get past the idea that toys are for kids. This is something that Day struggled with at first. \u201cIf you tell people you collect cuddly toys, it can feel as if you\u2019re going to be judged, because it feels like a children\u2019s hobby,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut then when you go on TikTok and see all these people the same age as you \u2013 women and men \u2013 it encourages you to not hold yourself back.\u201d</p> <p>This sense of community on social media is what inspired Day to set up her Jellycat TikTok account. She also wanted to show others that Jellycats aren\u2019t just for kids. Interestingly, she has people of all ages engaging with her content. \u201cTikTok shows you all the different age brackets of people watching. There are people in the 40 to 50 age bracket and even collectors who are 60 to 70. That was a nice surprise. It proves that it\u2019s for adults as well.\u201d</p>    <p>Both Day and Elliott have Jellycat TikTok accounts, while Richards is part of a Jellycat Facebook group. \u201cI\u2019ve been surprised by the number of adults who collect them,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought I was a weirdo for collecting them and then I discovered a whole community online.\u201d Unlike many spaces online, they all say the Jellycats community is hugely positive. People often comment on Day\u2019s videos, asking for advice about which Jellycat to buy and she\u2019s always happy to help and swap tips.</p> <p>Similarly, Elliott has found the online Jellycat community to be refreshingly positive. \u201cThere\u2019s not any toxicity in the community because, at the end of the day, it\u2019s a group of people interested in collecting toys. Nobody\u2019s saying: \u2018My collection is better than yours\u2019. As someone who\u2019s a football fan and a gamer, I often find myself in quite toxic communities, but the Jellycat community is a reprieve from that.\u201d</p> <p>This idea of connecting with others with a shared interest is important, says Masterson. \u201cCollecting things with others is about a sense of belonging. If we can see ourselves in others and vice versa, we feel less isolated. Research demonstrates that people who feel a sense of belonging report higher levels of self-esteem,\u201d she says.</p>    <p>In some ways, perhaps collecting Jellycats isn\u2019t so different from the ways that adults have always collected toys \u2013 it\u2019s just that people have swapped model cars and porcelain dolls for soft toys shaped like an avocado with a smiley face. This is something that chimes with Elliott. \u201cI can trace my love of collecting things back to my late grandmother. She collected porcelain dolls and had a whole room dedicated to them. They freaked me out \u2013 they were all just staring blankly. My way of improving that is having things with smiley faces,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Richards recently got the amuseables sandcastle for her 40th birthday this year, while Day hopes to try to complete a few of her collections, including the sports balls set and, of course, the boiled eggs (as well as the classic egg, there\u2019s a scuba diving egg, a graduation egg, bride and groom eggs, and more). Elliott says he can\u2019t see himself stopping collecting any time soon. \u201cMy collection will only grow, not shrink,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re just these silly little things that exist purely to make you smile. That\u2019s the strongest part of it.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It started with a boiled egg. Last year, Chloe Day, 25, kept seeing it all over social media. She was intrigued. It wasn\u2019t the kind of egg you\u2019d have for breakfast. There was a smiley face on the bright yellow yolk and little legs descending from the egg white. At 14cm tall, it was adorable \u2013 the egg part soft and fluffy and the legs made out of brown corduroy. What Day was seeing, on social media and in shops, was an \u201camuseable\u201d boiled egg by Jellycat, a brand that specialises in cute soft toys with smiley faces. \u201cI remember it so clearly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt kept cropping up. I thought: I have to have one of those.\u201d Eventually, she bought one. Since getting her first Jellycat in June last year, Day\u2019s collection has grown substantially \u2013 she now has 252. This summer, she and her boyfriend bought their first home and one of the spare rooms will be dedicated to Jellycats, with floor-to-ceiling shelves to house her ever-expanding collection. Day is part of a growing community of Jellycat enthusiasts. While the privately owned brand has been going since 1999, its popularity has soared in recent years. Founded in London by brothers Thomas and William Gatacre, this year marks 25 years since Jellycat first launched \u2013 and its range keeps expanding. Its offering of soft toys (also known as plushies), includes classic cuddly animals like bears and bunnies, but it also has the amuseables line (launched in 2018), which includes random objects \u2013 a baguette and a tennis ball, a cactus and a boiled egg \u2013 all with a smiley faces and legs (or, occasionally, arms). Some of the toys appeal to children. Others seem geared towards an adult audience, like the amuseable coffee-to-go, a fuzzy takeaway cup in neutral tones of cream and beige, with dangly legs and a smiley face. You can even get Jellycat bags, which are \u201cwearable\u201d versions of the toys, and come in a variety of designs, including a croissant, a takeaway coffee and a sausage dog. Jellycat\u2019s toys range in size and price, too \u2013 the smaller ones start at \u00a311, but the \u201cgigantic\u201d toys can cost between \u00a3750 and \u00a31,200. The company doesn\u2019t share sales figures or offer interviews, saying they prefer to let the \u201cJellycat fans do the talking.\u201d But in a rare interview in 2021 with MBS group, William Gatacre said the brand is all about \u201ctrying to be uplifting\u201d, and that when they launched, they wanted to refresh the toy market, saying: \u201cIt felt tired, bare and a little bit taxidermy.\u201d The company name was a suggestion from Thomas Gatacre\u2019s seven-year-old son, who apparently loved jelly and cats. As well as the Jellycat online store, the toys are stocked in shops all over the UK, including department stores like John Lewis and Selfridges as well as upmarket lifestyle stores such as the White Company. According to Selfridges, Jellycat is now the department store\u2019s fastest-selling toy brand and its sales of Jellycat products are up 189% from last year. It\u2019s not just in the UK \u2013 Jellycats are sold in stores across 80 countries. The company is global. In 2001, it expanded and formed a US arm, Jellycat Inc. It now has offices in London, Minneapolis, Shanghai and Seoul. In 2018, the Gatacre brothers hit the Sunday Times Rich List, when the company was valued at \u00a3155m. Since then, it has gone from strength to strength. According to 2022 statements for Jellycat Limited (the brand\u2019s UK arm), the company\u2019s annual revenue increased by 72% to \u00a3146m. The rise of Jellycat\u2019s fans in recent years is partly down to social media, where people showcase their collections and connect with other enthusiasts. On TikTok there are 113,000 posts with the Jellycat hashtag. There are more than 729,000 on Instagram. Search for the hashtag and you\u2019ll be bombarded with videos of people unboxing their latest purchase, or sharing their collection and dedicated Jellycat display shelves stacked with colourful toys. The brand has a slick social media strategy, too, regularly posting Jellycat memes and news about \u201cJelly drops\u201d on Instagram and TikTok, where it has 841,000 followers and 466,000 followers, respectively. Day says she has always loved collecting things \u2013 as a child, it was vintage Barbie dolls and Charlie Bears \u2013 but she says Jellycats are \u201cThe only one that\u2019s really stuck.\u201d That\u2019s down to the variety of toys, the new product launches (four times a year) and being able to hunt down rare items. Some designs have been \u201cretired\u201d, making them more valuable. \u201cThere\u2019s always something new to choose, and iIt\u2019s exciting when you manage to get one that you\u2019ve been after for a long time,\u201d she says. While Jellycat has been making cuddly toys for decades, it\u2019s the newer toys she loves. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that some of the old Jellycats have the same appeal, unless you\u2019re a diehard collector. I like the newer models, like the baked bean, the olive and the marshmallow. There\u2019s nothing else like that.\u201d Each of these has the signature smiley face and legs \u2013 the baked bean is a single orange bean, the olives are a pair, joined by a dark green stalk, and the marshmallow comes in a set of two, one pastel pink, one white. Day likes the aesthetic of the newer toys, like the amuseables, which bring inanimate objects to life, often in bright colours, compared to the more traditional older toys, such as bears and bunnies, in more neutral tones. She creates different displays of her Jellycats in her home, which often have a theme, like outer space. Andrew Elliott, 25, has also enjoyed collecting toys throughout his life.

Early on, it looked like we were in for a tight match, before the Roosters completely broke it open and dominated the first half. The Sharks looked absolutely down and out, I think we all really doubted their ability to come back from a first half performance like that. But to their enormous credit, they played a sensational second half and nearly came away with a premiership. Emma Tonegato and Tiana Penitani took the lead, with Ellie Johnston and Holli Wheeler putting on enormous pressure in the front row and Tayla Preston keeping things ticking over with her pinpoint accurate kicks.</p> <p>But in the end, the Roosters recovered from their shell shock to make important decisions at key times \u2013 the penalty goal in the 52nd minute was probably the key moment of the match, as that buffer proved to be vital when the Sharks scored with two minutes remaining.</p> <p>Importantly, the win gave Bremner a well-deserved fairytale ending and puts Elliott up with the great Glenn Lazarus as the only two players to win premierships with three different clubs. It has been an absolute treat of rugby league so far today, so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing if the NRLM grand final can live up to the excitement served up by the other two games. That match doesn\u2019t kick off until 7:30pm, but you can enjoy the build up right now, with Jonathan Howcroft.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/oct/06/nrl-grand-final-2024-melbourne-storm-v-penrith-panthers-live-update-scores-results-kick-off-time-start-team-lists-accor-stadium-sydney\">NRL grand final 2024: Melbourne Storm v Penrith Panthers \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019ll leave you there, but thanks for spending the afternoon with me and witnessing that incredible game!

I think we\u2019ve built something really special. This was our time to shine. Everyone individually was outstanding this season. The girls that didn\u2019t get to play today got us to where we needed to be. Thank you everybody for turning up. Thank you to the fans.

Captain Tiana Penitani also adds a great deal of attacking smarts and speed. The Roosters remain the favourites, but the Sharks have the ability to cause the upset. </p>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670213b08f08ca4137e0b718\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-06T04:39:51.861Z\">5.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Roosters\u2019 Sammy Bremner is retiring after today\u2019s game \u2013 what a trailblazer she has been for women\u2019s rugby league.

There\u2019s so much to look forward to in today\u2019s game \u2013 both teams are fielding exciting line ups with stars as far as the eye can see. Will it be the Sydney Roosters walking away with their second premiership, or can (relatively) new kids on the block Cronulla take it in their first attempt? The experienced Roosters are the favourites, but the Sharks came out of the blocks firing this season and if they can hold on to some of that form, they\u2019re in with a great shot.</p> <p>When the two teams last met, it was the Roosters with a huge win \u2013 defeating the Sharks 40-0, but I wouldn\u2019t expect the Sharks to just roll over and accept their fate, they will have learnt a lot from that disappointing loss and will be prepared to play things very differently in this meeting.</p> <p>After a bumper year for women\u2019s rugby league, featuring the first ever three game State of Origin series, which broke crowd records off the field and delivered an incredible amount of excitement on the field, this game will draw plenty of attention. With two more teams joining the competition in 2025, the talent will again be drawn in different directions as the new teams look to build their rosters and secure experienced players. Both these teams know this is their best chance to win a premiership before their stars are lured elsewhere, so expect plenty of heart and passion on the field as they give it their all to make sure that happens.</p> <p>I\u2019m sensing a classic game of hard-fought rugby league is coming our way this afternoon and I can\u2019t wait. Let\u2019s get into it!</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "How exactly can I summarise that game? Early on, it looked like we were in for a tight match, before the Roosters completely broke it open and dominated the first half. The Sharks looked absolutely down and out, I think we all really doubted their ability to come back from a first half performance like that. But to their enormous credit, they played a sensational second half and nearly came away with a premiership. Emma Tonegato and Tiana Penitani took the lead, with Ellie Johnston and Holli Wheeler putting on enormous pressure in the front row and Tayla Preston keeping things ticking over with her pinpoint accurate kicks. But in the end, the Roosters recovered from their shell shock to make important decisions at key times \u2013 the penalty goal in the 52nd minute was probably the key moment of the match, as that buffer proved to be vital when the Sharks scored with two minutes remaining. Importantly, the win gave Bremner a well-deserved fairytale ending and puts Elliott up with the great Glenn Lazarus as the only two players to win premierships with three different clubs. It has been an absolute treat of rugby league so far today, so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing if the NRLM grand final can live up to the excitement served up by the other two games. That match doesn\u2019t kick off until 7:30pm, but you can enjoy the build up right now, with Jonathan Howcroft. I\u2019ll leave you there, but thanks for spending the afternoon with me and witnessing that incredible game! So long and happy rugby league Christmas!! There was so much excitement in that game, I think it\u2019s pretty clear you need to go back and re-live a lot of those moments. Fortunately the fabulous Jack Snape has you covered from live at the ground with a match report that encapsulates all the thrills of the game. The St Clair Comets Junior Rugby League Club get the honour of presenting the Roosters with their premiership rings. Isabelle Kelly comes to the mic to make her premiership speech. \u201cI\u2026want to thank the Sharks girls. I believe that you girls individually have all inspired so many young girls in the next generation to play Rugby League. What you\u2019ve been able to do in your second season is incredible. So thank you so much for really tough game today. To my girls, to Strangey and our coaching staff, the whole Roosters club, I love what we built here. I think we\u2019ve built something really special. This was our time to shine. Everyone individually was outstanding this season. The girls that didn\u2019t get to play today got us to where we needed to be. Thank you everybody for turning up. Thank you to the fans. Let\u2019s go and have some fun, hey.\u201d Tiana Penitani takes the stage to give her runners\u2019 up speech. \u201cLook how far how game has come in the last how many years. The game is in the best place it\u2019s ever been. I\u2019m so proud to be part of this game\u2026I want to thank Strangy, Izzy and the Roosters. You guys have been placed the benchmark all season. So many of you as individuals are changing this game and aspiring a new generation. And lastly, to my staff, Tony, Herman, Crossy, Isaac, all of our staff, the club, thank you so much for believing in us. And giving us all the opportunities that we have. I\u2019m so proud. And to my girls, everyone wrote us off. We had absolutely no right to come back in that second-half. I\u2019m so proud of the season that we\u2019ve had. So proud of you girls. I wouldn\u2019t want to win or lose with any other team of girls. I love you guys. Congrats Chooks.\u201d Aiken controlled the game this afternoon, so no surprise that she comes away with the player of the match medal. She looks a little surprised as she comes up to receive it though! She keeps her speech short and sweet. \u201cI\u2019d like to say I\u2019m honoured to receive this award named after Murph. I\u2019d like to say thank you to Sharky girls. You were unreal today. You had incredible season\u2026to my girls I couldn\u2019t ask for better teammates. So glad to get it done. Thank you.\u201d I don\u2019t feel like words can do justice to this Johnston try, so it\u2019s definitely one worth watching if you didn\u2019t get a chance to see it happen! Emma Tonegato is disappointed that the Sharks couldn\u2019t finish with the premiership, but she\u2019s proud of the effort they put in. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to come back with a deficit like that that and to get that close. So proud of the girls. Congratulations to the Roosters. They\u2019ve been a great team all year. Well-deserved for them. Couldn\u2019t be prouder of my Sharkies.\u201d The Sharks threw everything at that final set after deciding not to take the conversion attempt, but the Roosters held them out to take the win by four points. Tiana Davison pounced on a loose ball from an offload attempt to seal the premiership for the Roosters. Desperation gets them over the line, after a six again call on the last tackle and the captain makes the dive over the line. They\u2019ve given up their conversion attempt for another go at the try line. 68 mins: The Sharks are seeing this match slip away now, after giving themselves some hope to cling to with a sensational second half performance. They put up a short kick off an get an attacking set to give themselves a chance. The extra two points provides an important buffer with less than three minutes left on the clock. A frenetic finish to the Roosters\u2019 set, putting the ball through hands on the fifth, with Hall making a break, getting the ball away to Aiken and a desperate play for the line. The Sharks got a hand on it before it went dead, so the Roosters get another set. Hall goes close to the line, but is held out, before Kernick throws a sensational dummy that fools everyone and goes over for the Roosters\u2019 first try this half. 64 mins: The Sharks are on the front foot and what a comeback this has been! Preston puts up a big kick to finish the set, but it\u2019s too big and goes dead in goal for a Roosters\u2019 seven tackle set, releasing all the pressure the Sharks were building. Another simple shot for Preston and she makes no mistake. The Roosters are ruled to knock the ball on. They challenge, but there\u2019s no evidence to support overruling the on field decision. The Sharks get another chance close to the line and Johnston makes a strong spin over the line. 60 mins: The Sharks need to stand strong in defence now and they manage to do just that. With some good pressure on Kelleher\u2019s kick, the ball goes dead in goal and the Sharks get a seven tackle set to try to close this gap even further. 58 mins: Wheeler looks like scoring, but Hall puts on a HUGE hit to put a stop to that. The Sharks can\u2019t score, but an error from the Roosters soon after gives them the scrum feed and another set in good position. The Sharks get a penalty midway through the set, but the Roosters have put in a captain\u2019s challenge. The challenge is successful and the Roosters get a scrum feed. 56 mins: An error in the play the ball from Parker gives the ball straight back to the Sharks \u2013 Parker loses her bearings and plays the ball sideways, which looks very strange! The Sharks get an opportunity to start a set within the Roosters\u2019 half. 55 mins: Hall looks to spark something for the Roosters to bring them back into this game, and she makes a mini break through the middle, but the Sharks manage to bring her down. Kelleher puts up another excellent bomb, but Staples takes it so strongly and holds her ground right on the sideline. Preston puts in a brilliant searching kick to end their set, forcing the Roosters to start deep in their own territory. Kelleher makes that kick look easy and gives the Roosters a little bit of breathing room as the Sharks keep coming at them. 52 mins: An exciting period of play has closed the gap between these teams \u2013 I would LOVE to know what was said the Sharks shed at half time. It must have been one hell of a speech to turn their game around. However an unnecessary penalty offers the Roosters a buffer and slows their momentum. Another accurate kick from Preston and this game is getting very exciting now! Well, a very exciting set with lots of fast hands from the Sharks and attacking dominance from Tonegato sets up yet another try and Cronulla is right back in this game! 48 mins: A good kick from Preston ends the Sharks\u2019 set and it almost looks like they may force a repeat set, but the experience of Bremner gets the Roosters out of trouble as she shadows the ball over the dead ball line and gets her side a seven tackle set. They make their way down the field, but Bremner can\u2019t quite get her pass away and the knock on gives the Sharks a scrum feed. 46 mins: There is a lot more belief shining out of the Sharks now and they are looking much more dangerous. Tonegato makes another mini break and the Roosters are not looking quite so comfortable. An easy attempt for Preston and she nails it. A silly penalty from the Roosters \u2013 putting a hit on a player without the ball \u2013 gives the Sharks the field position they\u2019ve been looking for. Tonegato is brilliant in finding the space, losing the defenders and putting in a deft little pass to Dodd who crosses the line. 43 mins: The Roosters have been able to control the speed of the ruck and haven\u2019t allowed the Sharks to get quick play the balls and that last set was no exception. The Roosters again drive down the field \u2013 there is no panic from them yet, despite the Sharks hitting the scoreboard. Kelleher puts up another great kick, but Ravics is up to the challenge. 41 mins: The Sharks look up and about after scoring, but a silly error in the play the ball hands the ball back to the Roosters deep in Sharks\u2019 territory. Tonegato puts strong pressure on and forces a rare error from Aiken and the Sharks get back on the attack. Preston\u2019s kick looks great, hits the upright and bounces back over the post to add the two points. The Sharks get a penalty early in the set, to give them some much-needed field position. Penitani gets within a couple of metres of the tryline before the Sharks nearly cough the ball up, but recover to make another run at the line and on her second attempt, Penitani is able to use her footwork to step around the defence and score. 37 mins: The Sharks have a bit of spark in their first set of the second half, powering down the field to be able to put in an attacking kick, but Bremner fields it to keep them off the scoreboard. The Roosters play a conservative set, keeping the pressure on. The Roosters kick off and here we go! The teams are getting back out on the field and the second half is almost underway. Can the Sharks bring things back, or are we in for more Roosters dominance? And this Jess Sergis special on the stroke of half time tore out the last shreds of hope from hearts all over Cronulla. This try from Parker epitomised the Sharks\u2019 defensive woes. There was a LOT going on in that half, so let\u2019s re-live some of those tries. First up, we had Dally M winner Kernick getting things underway for the Roosters. Well, what a half! I can safely say that was not what I was expecting leading into the game, or even after the first few minutes. The Roosters have been absolutely dominant and the Sharks do not seem to have any answers to their attack. There will be some tough conversations had in the sheds for them and teams have certainly turned scores like this around in the past, but it will take a lot to really dig deep and find massive improvements in attack and defence. The Roosters will be delighted with their first half, but they are not a team to rest on their laurels. They\u2019ll be pushing for more points in the second half and the Sharks will have a fight on their hands. Finally Kelleher gets a shot in front and she easily knocks it over. On the stroke of half-time, the Roosters can\u2019t resist adding more points \u2013 this time it\u2019s Sergis with a strong run after a fifth tackle pass. 34 mins: A good, pressure-building set from the Roosters is followed by another attempt by the Sharks to get down the field, but they can\u2019t get themselves into position to score and it looks like they may have to head to the sheds scoreless. 32 mins: Finally something falls the Sharks\u2019 way, with Preston\u2019s kick bouncing in the in goal and brushing Bremner\u2019s hand before going dead in goal. The Sharks are in the best attacking position they\u2019ve had in quite some time and they\u2019re desperate for some points. Tonegato tries her best to set something up, but Staples can\u2019t hold it and it\u2019s back to the Roosters. 30 mins: Again Kelleher can\u2019t add the two points \u2013 her team really needs to give her a break and stop scoring in the corner. In all seriousness, the Roosters have been basically flawless, playing beautiful rugby league and there\u2019s not much the Sharks can do to stop them right now. Even when they get a set, every metre is a struggle through the tough Roosters\u2019 defence. A double for Brydie Parker! Off the back of that penalty, the Roosters galivanted back down field and created the two-on-one on the right and a fantastic pass from Aiken sets up the try. 26 mins: Staples makes a strong take under Kelleher\u2019s kick this time, which should provide her with a bit more confidence. The Sharks finally get a set in attack, but they can only manage a 34m gain. They put up a decent kick, but Byers is penalised for a crusher tackle and the Roosters get a piggyback down the field to start their next set. 24 mins: Kelleher has had two tough conversion attempts from either sideline, so she Roosters hasn\u2019t been able to add the extra points either time. The Sharks need to find a way back into this game, they\u2019re currently looking quite fatigued in defence and the Roosters don\u2019t look like they\u2019re finished coming at them just yet. They are dominating possession right now. Fressard makes a mini break, but the Sharks rally well enough to bring her down on the halfway line. Staples makes another error in attempting to take the kick and the Roosters come up with it close to the line once again. They get it out to Parker on the right and she dives over for another four points. Another Sharks error, another Roosters try. Aiken set this one up brilliantly, creating space on the left and getting the ball out there quickly for an easy try for Fressard. 18 mins: The Roosters have a spring in their step after that opening try and continue their relentless march down the middle of the field before going wide late in the set. Another fantastic kick from Kelleher forces an error from Staples, who drops it and the Roosters have another scrum feed very close to the line. Kelleher adds the extra two points with a simple kick. A knock on by the Sharks on their own 20m line gives the Roosters their best attacking position so far in this game. Hall gets very close and it takes three defenders to bring her down, which gives the Roosters the opportunity to swing it to the right and Dally M medallist Olivia Kernick crashes over. 14 mins: The Roosters make an uncharacteristic error, looking to have miscounted their tackles and finishing the set with an innocuous run at the defenders before having to hand the ball over. A HUGE tackle from Hall early in the Sharks\u2019 set sparks some excitement in the Roosters\u2019 camp \u2013 lets see what it can lead to for them. The Sharks have made an early interchange, with the experienced Holli Wheeler coming on in the front row. 12 mins: The sun is across half the field at the moment, which makes things quite challenging for both teams, as it becomes easy to lose the ball. The Sharks aren\u2019t able to take advantage of the repeat set, giving away an offside penalty early in the set. 10 mins: It feels like this game is about to break open one way or another \u2013 both teams have come close to scoring and whoever manages the first points will take a huge mental advantage in the game. An attacking kick from the Sharks looks like it might yield points, but they manage to get a repeat set out of it at least. 8 mins: A beautiful, spiralling kick from Kelleher almost leads to the first points of the match, but Tonegato lets it bounce and a chasing Bremner nearly gets to it before it crosses the dead ball line. She gets a little touch on it, which is a get out of jail free card for the Sharks, as it gives them a seven tackle set to try to get further into Roosters\u2019 territory than they\u2019ve managed so far. A huge run by Ravics almost gets them over the try line, but a tackle by Bremner saves the day before a knock on by the Sharks. 6 mins: Kelleher mixes things up with a pass on the fifth tackle instead of a kick, but unfortunately Kernick couldn\u2019t hold on to it and the Sharks get the scrum feed. The Sharks get just into the Roosters\u2019 territory and put up a good kick, but the Roosters are on top of it and begin their march back up the field, continuing to push hard through the middle. 4 mins: The Roosters are following a settled game plan, with strong contact from the forwards up the middle early in this game. Another great kick from Kelleher and the Sharks can\u2019t field this one, but they manage to knock it back and Tonegato turns it into an opportunity, finding some space for Penitani, but Aiken takes her down. The Roosters play another good set and no one has stamped their dominance on this match just yet. 2 mins: Strong defence from the kick off from the Sharks \u2013 they are the competition\u2019s best defensive team, so will look to take advantage of that today. A good kick from the Roosters\u2019 Kelleher to finish the set, but Tonegato takes it easily, despite the sun in her eyes. Each team settles the nerves with a completed set to start the game. The Sharks have kicked off and we\u2019re underway! A quick interview with Roosters\u2019 coach John Strange before we get underway \u2013 his final message to the team was to play for each other. The teams are heading down the tunnel now and emerging out to on the field. The crowd is quite scattered, but I\u2019d expect it to build during the game. Kick off is only minutes away, so now is the time to pick your bandwagon if you\u2019re not a follower of either of these clubs. There is glitz and glamour in both camps, so it really depends on whether you want to support the underdogs in the Sharks or the established Roosters. Get on board now, grab your sky blue or your tricolore and get ready to cheer the house down! While the Roosters have history on their side \u2013 and that drive for Bremner\u2019s fairytale ending \u2013 the Sharks will be desperate to spoil the party. They burst into this season with a surprising run of form, that shocked experts and tipsters across the competition. They have a lot of firepower, most notably through fullback Emma Tonegato \u2013 an Olympic gold medallist in rugby sevens. Captain Tiana Penitani also adds a great deal of attacking smarts and speed. The Roosters remain the favourites, but the Sharks have the ability to cause the upset. The Roosters\u2019 Sammy Bremner is retiring after today\u2019s game \u2013 what a trailblazer she has been for women\u2019s rugby league. Not just on the field, but also helping pave the way for women to return to the sport after having children. Bremner has achieved a lot in the game, but she has yet to win a premiership, so she is hoping to finish with a fairytale ending today. It\u2019s not something granted to many players, but Bremner will leave nothing out there in her pursuit of that trophy. A little bit of pre-match entertainment happening now \u2013 it\u2019s strangely low key, with a very small stage on the 10m line where Coterie is playing Slice of Heaven. It\u2019s been 25 years of rugby league grand finals at Stadium Australia \u2013 I was at the very first one, back in 1999. I will opt to say nothing about the result of that game, but it felt pretty cool to be in that crowd. The stadium was in its Olympic configuration back then, so there were just under 108,000 people in and it was loud and intense. We\u2019re under 30 mins until kick off now \u2013 which team will add their name to this trophy? The State Championship grand final, between NSW Cup winners the Newtown Jets and Queensland Cup winners Norths Devils, has just wrapped up and it was the Devils who took it in a thriller, winning 20-18. Only one player in NRLM/W history has won premierships with three different clubs before \u2013 Glenn Lazarus, who won with Canberra, Brisbane and Melbourne. But the Roosters\u2019 Millie Elliott has a chance to join Lazarus in that exclusive club today, having previously won premierships with Brisbane and Newcastle. 1. Samantha Bremner 2.

Nakia Davis-Welsh While you\u2019re waiting for the game, if you\u2019re not too enthralled with the close battle in the NSW Cup v Queensland Cup grand final, you can read this great preview from our reporter Jack Snape! Sydney has put on a classic beach day for the battle of these two beachside teams. But will it be Icebergs or Northies partying tonight? It\u2019s not too much longer until we find out! Hello and welcome to women\u2019s rugby league Christmas! There\u2019s so much to look forward to in today\u2019s game \u2013 both teams are fielding exciting line ups with stars as far as the eye can see. Will it be the Sydney Roosters walking away with their second premiership, or can (relatively) new kids on the block Cronulla take it in their first attempt? The experienced Roosters are the favourites, but the Sharks came out of the blocks firing this season and if they can hold on to some of that form, they\u2019re in with a great shot. When the two teams last met, it was the Roosters with a huge win \u2013 defeating the Sharks 40-0, but I wouldn\u2019t expect the Sharks to just roll over and accept their fate, they will have learnt a lot from that disappointing loss and will be prepared to play things very differently in this meeting. After a bumper year for women\u2019s rugby league, featuring the first ever three game State of Origin series, which broke crowd records off the field and delivered an incredible amount of excitement on the field, this game will draw plenty of attention. With two more teams joining the competition in 2025, the talent will again be drawn in different directions as the new teams look to build their rosters and secure experienced players. Both these teams know this is their best chance to win a premiership before their stars are lured elsewhere, so expect plenty of heart and passion on the field as they give it their all to make sure that happens. I\u2019m sensing a classic game of hard-fought rugby league is coming our way this afternoon and I can\u2019t wait. Let\u2019s get into it!",

      "body": "<p>Last night my mum came round to help me release the ladybirds. We\u2019d been messaging abstractly for some time about our parallel plant issues \u2013 I\u2019d noticed small clusters of what looked like cottonwool or bath foam, collecting at the base of the leaves on my favourite plant. This is not just any plant, I should explain, this is a plant that\u2019s more of a fairytale, more of a fable. Its leaves are large and sprawling and, after teasing for some time with finger-length pink buds, it will flower at dusk, each bud opening like a huge water-lily and emitting a deep, sweet smell like expensive vanilla. By morning the flowers are dead, rubbery and obscene, dangling limply from the stalk.

She was the headteacher of Randal Cremer primary school in Hackney for 11 years before it was forced to close at the end of August due to falling pupil numbers. \u201cNot being there in September is one of the hardest things,\u201d said Riley. \u201cI had to run away from London at the start of term.

      "body": "<p>Last week two magnificent exhibitions opened in London. Both have as their theme the idea of the Silk Road, an \u00adoverland trade route said to stretch ever since antiquity all the way across Asia from China to&nbsp;Turkey and hence to Mediterranean Europe.</p> <p>The show at the British Library is entitled <em><a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/whats-on/\">A Silk Road Oasis: Life in Ancient Dunhuang</a> </em>and focuses on the extraordinary haul of ancient documents found in the Mogao Buddhist cave temples by a Chinese Daoist priest and sold by him to the explorer and archaeologist Aurel Stein in 1907.</p> <p>Its treasures include the \u00adcelebrated ninth-century Diamond Sutra, the earliest clearly dated and complete printed book in the world, as well as the Dunhuang star chart, the earliest known atlas of the night sky from any civilisation. The show is imaginatively mounted, with some of the documents read out in wonderful audio clips. There are not many places in the world today where you can hear ancient Sogdian love poetry read out in the original, but the British Library has risen to the challenge.</p>    <p>The British Museum\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/silk-roads\">Silk Roads</a></em> show is even more spectacular, unquestionably the most fabulous array of treasures to be seen in London in recent times. It guides us all the way from Japan and Korea to East Anglia and even Rhynie in Aberdeenshire, dazzling us with rare treasures of gold, jade, Chinese silk and exquisitely carved ivories gathered from collections around the world.</p> <p>On the way we see miniature wooden pagodas, stunning ceramic figurines of musicians and \u00adcamels and grooms, engraved gold cups rescued from shipwrecks and \u00adgorgeous fragments of Buddhist wall paintings. The exhibition has rightly received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/sep/24/silk-roads-review-british-museum-london\">glowing reviews</a>.</p> <p>Both exhibitions promote the idea of the Silk Road as an east-west network of superhighways linking eastern Asia with western Europe in a free-flowing movement of goods and ideas. It is a deeply romantic idea, evoking camel caravans crossing the Pamir mountains, then swaying their way over the sand dunes of the Gobi desert.</p> <p>It is also an idea that breaks open \u00adnationalistic silos and encourages us to think about the surprising \u00adinterconnectedness of the world in a period millennia before we expect to encounter globalisation. But for all that, the \u00adseductively Sinocentric concept of the Silk Roads is still&nbsp;problematic.</p> <p>Despite its modern popularity the notion of a Silk Road was unknown before the 19th century. Marco Polo, the man now most closely \u00adassociated with the road, never once mentions the term, even though it was during his lifetime that travel became easiest through the borderless Mongol empire.</p> <p>Instead the term was popularised by a Prussian geographer, Baron von Richthofen, as late as 1877. While engaged in a survey of China, the baron was charged with \u00addreaming up a route for a railway linking Berlin to Beijing. This he named <em>die Seidenstrassen</em>, the Silk Roads. It was not until 1938 that the term Silk Road appeared in English, as the title of a popular book by a Nazi-sympathising Swedish explorer, Sven Hedin.</p>    <p>Since then, the term has \u00adcaptured the global imagination, and the \u201creopening\u201d of the Silk Road has been announced by President Xi Jinping of China as part of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer\">belt and road initiative</a>. In this way, the idea has been mobilised as part of Chinese foreign policy, partly to obfuscate its economic and military projections of power.</p> <p>Yet silk was never the main \u00adcommodity imported to the west from the east. Instead, it was always far exceeded in value by imports of Indian pepper, spices, ivory, cotton, gems, teak and sandalwood. When in AD408 Alaric the Visigoth held Rome to ransom, his terms were significant: in addition to 5,000 pounds of gold, he demanded not silk but 3,000 pounds of Indian black pepper.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea has been mobilised as part of Chinese foreign policy, partly to obfuscate its economic and military projections of power </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nor was China, the alleged \u00adterminus of the Silk Roads in most versions of its conception, ever the main destination of east-west trade in ancient or early medieval times. Indeed, the Roman empire and China actually had only the \u00adhaziest notions of each other\u2019s \u00adexistence \u2013 vaguely aware of each other, but almost never in direct \u00adcontact.</p> <p>In reality, goods from China largely reached Rome merely as an exotic supplement to its thriving \u00adcommerce with India, and passed through Indian ports: the fullest early guide to the commerce of Asia, a first-century merchants\u2019 \u00admanual, specifically says the best place to buy silk are the ports of Gujarat, where much of the silk that reached the west was manufactured.</p> <p>It is also clear that sea travel was the fastest, most \u00adeconomical and safest way to move people and goods in the pre-modern world, costing about a fifth of the price of equivalent land transport. Shipping routes that cut across political and topographical boundaries were always more important than the slow-moving caravan trails, and the overland trade routes always carried much less trade than the sea roads: ships, after all, could carry vastly larger cargoes \u2013 often amounting to several hundred tonnes \u2013 and travel much more quickly than donkeys or camels. They could also sail around wars, instability and ambushes.</p>    <p>Western trading manuals reveal a real, practical familiarity, even \u00adintimacy, with the ports of India, especially those on the west coast, with detailed descriptions that clearly derive from first-hand experience and direct observation, the author commenting, for example, on the taste for singing boys in Gujarat. If China and the west ever came face to face, they did so here in the quays, ports and bazaars of coastal India.</p> <p>Indeed in the crucial period between the end of antiquity and the high middle ages, you can make at least as good a case for India being the cultural and intellectual centre of Asia, influencing and changing the course of religious, artistic and cultural life in the regions around it, not least China itself.</p> <p>In this period, India was the \u00adcentre of the Buddhist world and the main destination of Buddhist \u00adpilgrims seeking their holy places. This was why, for example, the \u00adcelebrated seventh-century Chinese monk Xuanzang, and many \u00adothers like him, risked their lives to make the dangerous journey to what was then the Oxford of ancient Asia: the great Buddhist university of Nalanda in the middle of north India\u2019s Gangetic plain, with its tens of thousands of learned monks. Its magnificent library was the greatest repository of Buddhist texts; works revered, copied and carried eastwards by generations of Chinese, Korean and Japanese monks.</p>    <p>\u201cPeople of distant places, with diverse customs,\u201d wrote Xuanzang, \u201cgenerally designate the land they most admire as India.\u201d The account he wrote of that journey, <em>The Great Tang Records on the Western Regions</em><em>,</em> makes it clear that the world he had just passed through, from Chang\u2019an in western China to Kanchipuram in southern India, and back, was largely dominated by Indic ideas, art, science, languages and religions.</p> <p>During the period covered by these shows, India was a confident exporter of its own diverse civilisation, creating around it an empire of ideas which developed into a \u00adtangible \u201cIndosphere\u201d where its cultural influence was predominant. During this period, the rest of Asia was the willing and even eager recipient of a startlingly comprehensive mass transfer of Indian soft power, in religion, art, music, dance, textiles, technology, astronomy, mathematics, medicine, mythology, language and literature.</p> <p>Sanskrit became the lingua franca in much of Asia and left a \u00adpermanent mark on the map from Balkh to Singapore. Indeed, so deeply immersed in Sanskritic culture did the elites of south-east Asia become that they began renaming towns and settlements after the most \u00adcelebrated places of Indian mythology. To this day, the ancient capital of Thailand is named Ayutthaya after Ayodhya, Lord Rama\u2019s capital in the great epic poem the <em>Ramayana</em>, while the national airline of Indonesia is Garuda, named after the god Vishnu\u2019s mount. The spread of Sanskrit brought all of Indian literature, arts and sciences in&nbsp;its wake.</p>    <p>Yet in the catalogue of the British Library show, the map highlights the network of roads running east to west through the deserts of western China, but leaves the lands south of the Himalayas in routeless, cityless darkness inscribed merely \u201cIndian Kingdoms\u201d. Equally, although the British Museum show opens with a Gandharan Buddha smelted in the Swat valley of what is now Pakistan and brought to Sweden by Vikings, and ends with a scattering of Rajasthani garnets found in the Sutton Hoo ship burial in Suffolk, India is still oddly absent from the exhibition, appearing only glancingly in displays focusing on other regions, and completely ignored as a major centre of trade and ideas in its own right. I longed for more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/sep/24/silk-roads-review-british-museum-london\">Silk Roads review \u2013 mesmerising show turns world history upside down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>British institutions have a \u00adpainfully long tradition of \u00adminimising the importance and influence of India and its extraordinary civilisation ever since Macaulay declared that \u201ca single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\u201d.

Since then, the term has captured the global imagination, and the \u201creopening\u201d of the Silk Road has been announced by President Xi Jinping of China as part of his belt and road initiative. In this way, the idea has been mobilised as part of Chinese foreign policy, partly to obfuscate its economic and military projections of power. Yet silk was never the main commodity imported to the west from the east. Instead, it was always far exceeded in value by imports of Indian pepper, spices, ivory, cotton, gems, teak and sandalwood. When in AD408 Alaric the Visigoth held Rome to ransom, his terms were significant: in addition to 5,000 pounds of gold, he demanded not silk but 3,000 pounds of Indian black pepper. Nor was China, the alleged terminus of the Silk Roads in most versions of its conception, ever the main destination of east-west trade in ancient or early medieval times. Indeed, the Roman empire and China actually had only the haziest notions of each other\u2019s existence \u2013 vaguely aware of each other, but almost never in direct contact. In reality, goods from China largely reached Rome merely as an exotic supplement to its thriving commerce with India, and passed through Indian ports: the fullest early guide to the commerce of Asia, a first-century merchants\u2019 manual, specifically says the best place to buy silk are the ports of Gujarat, where much of the silk that reached the west was manufactured. It is also clear that sea travel was the fastest, most economical and safest way to move people and goods in the pre-modern world, costing about a fifth of the price of equivalent land transport. Shipping routes that cut across political and topographical boundaries were always more important than the slow-moving caravan trails, and the overland trade routes always carried much less trade than the sea roads: ships, after all, could carry vastly larger cargoes \u2013 often amounting to several hundred tonnes \u2013 and travel much more quickly than donkeys or camels. They could also sail around wars, instability and ambushes. Western trading manuals reveal a real, practical familiarity, even intimacy, with the ports of India, especially those on the west coast, with detailed descriptions that clearly derive from first-hand experience and direct observation, the author commenting, for example, on the taste for singing boys in Gujarat. If China and the west ever came face to face, they did so here in the quays, ports and bazaars of coastal India. Indeed in the crucial period between the end of antiquity and the high middle ages, you can make at least as good a case for India being the cultural and intellectual centre of Asia, influencing and changing the course of religious, artistic and cultural life in the regions around it, not least China itself. In this period, India was the centre of the Buddhist world and the main destination of Buddhist pilgrims seeking their holy places. This was why, for example, the celebrated seventh-century Chinese monk Xuanzang, and many others like him, risked their lives to make the dangerous journey to what was then the Oxford of ancient Asia: the great Buddhist university of Nalanda in the middle of north India\u2019s Gangetic plain, with its tens of thousands of learned monks. Its magnificent library was the greatest repository of Buddhist texts; works revered, copied and carried eastwards by generations of Chinese, Korean and Japanese monks. \u201cPeople of distant places, with diverse customs,\u201d wrote Xuanzang, \u201cgenerally designate the land they most admire as India.\u201d The account he wrote of that journey, The Great Tang Records on the Western Regions, makes it clear that the world he had just passed through, from Chang\u2019an in western China to Kanchipuram in southern India, and back, was largely dominated by Indic ideas, art, science, languages and religions. During the period covered by these shows, India was a confident exporter of its own diverse civilisation, creating around it an empire of ideas which developed into a tangible \u201cIndosphere\u201d where its cultural influence was predominant. During this period, the rest of Asia was the willing and even eager recipient of a startlingly comprehensive mass transfer of Indian soft power, in religion, art, music, dance, textiles, technology, astronomy, mathematics, medicine, mythology, language and literature. Sanskrit became the lingua franca in much of Asia and left a permanent mark on the map from Balkh to Singapore. Indeed, so deeply immersed in Sanskritic culture did the elites of south-east Asia become that they began renaming towns and settlements after the most celebrated places of Indian mythology. To this day, the ancient capital of Thailand is named Ayutthaya after Ayodhya, Lord Rama\u2019s capital in the great epic poem the Ramayana, while the national airline of Indonesia is Garuda, named after the god Vishnu\u2019s mount. The spread of Sanskrit brought all of Indian literature, arts and sciences in its wake. Yet in the catalogue of the British Library show, the map highlights the network of roads running east to west through the deserts of western China, but leaves the lands south of the Himalayas in routeless, cityless darkness inscribed merely \u201cIndian Kingdoms\u201d. Equally, although the British Museum show opens with a Gandharan Buddha smelted in the Swat valley of what is now Pakistan and brought to Sweden by Vikings, and ends with a scattering of Rajasthani garnets found in the Sutton Hoo ship burial in Suffolk, India is still oddly absent from the exhibition, appearing only glancingly in displays focusing on other regions, and completely ignored as a major centre of trade and ideas in its own right. I longed for more. British institutions have a painfully long tradition of minimising the importance and influence of India and its extraordinary civilisation ever since Macaulay declared that \u201ca single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\u201d. We may laugh at Macaulay today, but the odd India-shaped hole in these otherwise wonderful Silk Roads shows suggests that the tendency to underrate India and its civilisation persists.

But Kingsolver had little idea of this at the time \u2013 at least, in the beginning. She was working in Tucson as a scientific writer, and cutting her teeth as a freelance journalist in her spare time. Her mission on this occasion was simply to report for several news outlets on the strike that was taking place in a constellation of remote copper mining towns in the south of the state. She wasn\u2019t, in other words, supposed to stay out there for very long.</p>    <p>She soon found, however, that she couldn\u2019t look away; the drive to Clifton, the town where she was mostly based, was three-and-a-half hours from Tucson, and in the end she did it so often, she wore the tread from her tyres. The strike had begun as a straightforward dispute between a mining company, Phelps Dodge, and its unionised workforce; copper prices had fallen, Phelps Dodge was losing money, people were being laid off. When, during contract negotiations, the company insisted it required wages to be frozen, thousands of miners elected to strike.</p> <p>Most commentators believed the dispute would be conventional and relatively brief, but within a month, things had shifted dramatically: squads of armoured men with teargas and automatic weapons were storming tiny, bucolic main streets; people were being jailed for nothing more than calling a neighbour a scab. It lasted from June 1983 until December 1984. By the time it was over, the trade union that represented the workers had been decertified, and half a century of organised labour in Arizona was at an end.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Appalachian people felt betrayed by JD Vance\u2019s book a long time before he became a Republican politician</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kingsolver is speaking to me from her home in Virginia: a farm in a hollow surrounded by deciduous forests, to which she moved with her husband and two daughters in 2004. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/barbara.kingsolver/?hl=en\">On Instagram</a>, she often posts photos of her abundant homegrown crops, sometimes before mammoth pickling and bottling sessions in her kitchen: tomatoes, cardoons, padr\u00f3n peppers, sweet potatoes. I can\u2019t see any of these things on my screen now; only a bookcase is on offer. But rightly or wrongly, I feel I know all about her particular contentment: happy, productive hours at her desk followed by equally happy, productive hours outdoors. We\u2019re very far indeed from dusty Arizona, where her 28-year-old self once spent her days carefully interviewing the women who kept the show on the road during the strike (they staffed the picket lines when the men travelled to other states in search of a wage), sitting with them on the \u201csqueaky porch-swings of [their] slant-frame houses\u201d. These days, after all, her characters belong only to her imagination, no Dictaphone required.</p> <p>In 1983, she struggled to maintain the dispassion she believed was required of a good journalist. It was impossible not to take sides, and having won their trust, the people of Clifton began to refer to her fondly as the \u201cgal\u201d who was writing a book about them. Back in Tucson, her interview tapes began to pile up in what she describes as an \u201cimpugning\u201d way; in the end, she wrote <em>Holding the Line</em> because she saw \u201cno other decent option\u201d. Only later did it occur to her that the story had historic implications: \u201cThis was the moment when the forces of capital teamed with governments to crush labour. A lot of it turned [in the US] on the <a href=\"https://lhrp.georgetown.edu/collections/the-1981-patco-strike/\">air traffic controller strike [of 1981]</a>. Reagan broke that strike overnight. He fired 11,000 unionised controllers in a single morning and then \u2013 this is the really shocking part \u2013 he banned them from working in the federal service ever again. It felt, in a weird way, like a military coup. We didn\u2019t understand that the president had the power to destroy so many lives at once, and it terrified [workers]. Your working life \u2013 your professional life \u2013 could end by edict.\u201d</p> <p>Has she been back to Clifton recently? \u201cI did for years, but [not recently], no. The women in my book mostly moved to other places. Ajo, Clifton and Morenci were classic mining towns, and once those closed, there was nothing else in them. They\u2019re something like ghost towns now, I\u2019d say.\u201d But she hardly needs to take a long drive to grasp how these things play out. In Virginia, where coal mining was once king, she has seen with her own eyes what happens when stable jobs disappear.</p>    <p>\u201cThe mines kept out other factories and mills that might have come in. They owned everything: the land, the courthouse, the politics. When coal left this region, it left an enormous void, which created a kind of hopelessness. I love Appalachian culture. It\u2019s community-based. It\u2019s very self-sufficient. But you have this hopelessness that [makes people] vulnerable to politicians who say: I\u2019m on your side. When someone comes along who says: I see you, I hear you, and what I especially hear is that the government has abandoned you, because look at your schools, your hospitals, your unemployment rates\u2026 Populist politicians have tapped into this sense that we\u2019re on our own, that government can\u2019t help us.\u201d</p> <p>This brings us inevitably to JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate who rose to prominence on the back of his hit 2016 memoir, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/07/hillbilly-elegy-by-jd-vance-review\">Hillbilly Elegy</a></em>, in which he describes the values of his family, who came originally from rural Kentucky, and the socioeconomic travails of Middletown, Ohio, to which his mother\u2019s parents moved after the second world war. When the book was first published, it enthralled many urban liberals, who took it at face value, glad to be instructed about a world they didn\u2019t know and possibly feared. But what did Kingsolver think? Did she hate it? And if so, how did she feel about the attention \u2013 even the acclaim \u2013 it received?</p> <p>Drawing breath, she seems to grow a little taller in her seat. \u201cI can tell you that Appalachian people felt betrayed by that book a <em>long</em> time before he became a Republican politician. I\u2019ll begin by saying: anyone is entitled to write a memoir. That\u2019s his story, fine. But for him to say that his story explains <em>all</em> of us \u2013 I say, no, I resent that, because it\u2019s very condescending. There\u2019s this subtext all the way through it that suggests we\u2019re in a boat that\u2019s sinking because we\u2019re lazy, unambitious and uncreative, which I resent.\u201d</p>    <p>The positive responses to the book, she believes, were born of the fact that it simply confirmed well-worn stereotypes. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with this condescension, this anti-hillbilly bigotry for a lot of my life. I didn\u2019t realise it was a problem until I left Kentucky and went to college [she went to university in Indiana] and people made fun of my accent, and said things like: \u2018Look at you, you\u2019re wearing shoes, ha ha!\u2019\u201d She pauses. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s more insidious than that. Even as a writer, I feel like my whole life until <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/16/demon-copperhead-by-barbara-kingsolver-review-appalachian-saga-in-the-spirit-of-dickens\">Demon Copperhead</a></em> [her Pulitzer prize-winning 2022 novel, which is set in modern Appalachia] I was snubbed because I\u2019m rural, I\u2019m from this place that\u2019s considered backward. I\u2019m quite used to it. But it [Vance\u2019s book] really made a lot of us angry that this became the explanation for us.\u201d</p> <p>Her neighbours, she says, saw through him immediately: \u201cThe hollowness, the fact that he isn\u2019t really one of us.\u201d And perhaps this only increased her determination to write a book like <em>Demon Copperhead</em>, which tackles head on the agonising effects of the opioid crisis in Appalachia: \u201cWe have to talk about history. This was done <em>to</em> us. This region has been treated as a kind of internal colony exploited by the outside. It was just so personal for him [Vance]. There was no analysis, and no compassion. It was just: if I can survive, anyone can survive.\u201d</p> <p>How does she think Vance is working out for Donald Trump, who picked him as his running mate? She is scornful. \u201cThe bottom line is: Trump doesn\u2019t want a vice-president. I don\u2019t think it was a thoroughly considered decision. He\u2019s entirely about himself. He\u2019s not even interested in the presidency. He\u2019s only interested in winning.\u201d Is she anxious about the election? \u201cOf course I\u2019m nervous. But I\u2019ll tell you this: I\u2019m a lot less nervous than I was. I have immense respect for Joe Biden, he has done so much. But the image of an old man at the helm\u2026 I have enormous respect for his decision to turn over the keys to a younger generation. Almost all my friends are younger than me. I have millennial daughters. They\u2019re so enthusiastic about a [potential] new administration, and how it will represent them.\u201d</p> <p>It goes without saying that Kingsolver\u2019s career was stellar long before <em>Demon Copperhead</em> was published. Novels such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/11/book-club-barbara-kingsolver-poisonwood\">The Poisonwood Bible</a>, </em>about a family of Baptist missionaries in Congo, and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/08/the-lacuna-barbara-kingsolver\">The Lacuna</a></em><em>, </em>which pieces together the story of a man whose friends include Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, were acclaimed, prizewinning bestsellers. But even she seems to feel that <em>Demon Copperhead</em>, her most recent book, a retelling of Charles Dickens\u2019s <em>David Copperfield</em> that won her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/14/barbara-kingsolver-wins-the-womens-prize-for-fiction-for-second-time\">a second Women\u2019s prize for fiction</a> as well a Pulitzer, is special \u2013 not least because it has changed perceptions of Appalachia.</p> <p>\u201cI know that it has,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I hear that from people every day. It broke the \u2013 I don\u2019t know what to call it \u2013 grassroots ceiling.\u201d Starting out, she tells me, there were male writers at the top of the pile, women\u2019s literature in a special category, and then, far below both of these, rural writers \u2013 where they remain to this day. \u201cThey\u2019re just not respected, I\u2019ve always known that. I\u2019ve felt it, in interviews, time and time again. But I long ago gave up the expectation of that kind of approval, I guess I\u2019m just a rebel \u2013 and this book [<em>Demon Copperhead</em>] broke through that. It won the big prizes, and it got all the attention, <em>and</em> it stayed on the <em>New York Times </em>bestseller list for over a year. And this seems important to me because it looks straight at the bigotry rural people face.\u201d</p> <p>Identity politics has helped people like her, she says: it has chipped away at the parameters of what subjects are deemed acceptable. For readers, <em>Demon Copperhead</em> is a bridge over the urban-rural divide; a \u201cwindow on a world\u201d in which doctors are in such short supply that women commonly have to drive to another state to have their babies, as happened to Kingsolver\u2019s own daughter. </p> <p>She had wanted to write such a book \u2013 her great Appalachian novel \u2013 for a long time, but the project seemed daunting, maybe impossible. On a book tour in England in 2018, however, she stayed at Bleak House in Broadstairs, where Dickens wrote <em>David Copperfield</em> (it\u2019s now a B&amp;B), and everything became clear. Alone, late at night, in the writer\u2019s former study, she felt \u201cthe presence of his outrage\u201d, and his voice urging her to \u201clet the child tell the story\u201d.</p>    <p>On the flight home, she reread his great tale of an orphan, the book of his own that he loved best of all, and saw how she could rework it to write about the \u201clost boys\u201d of Appalachia, where 40% of children have parents who have either died as a result of opioid addiction, are incapacitated by one, or are in prison. Mr Creakle\u2019s boarding school would become a tobacco farm, and the blacking factory, a meth lab; Uriah Heep would be transformed into a soccer coach called U-Haul, and David\u2019s friend Steerforth into Demon\u2019s pal, Fast Forward.</p> <p>It\u2019s almost outrageous, I tell her: a woman from Kentucky taking on Dickens. She laughs. Her career as a writer, she says, still amazes her \u2013 \u201cI get up surprised every day that I do this for a living\u201d \u2013 perhaps because her path towards it wasn\u2019t entirely straightforward. The daughter of a doctor, she spent part of her childhood in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an experience she later drew on for <em>The Poisonwood Bible</em>; at university, she began by studying classical piano on a music scholarship before \u2013 on the realisation that she didn\u2019t want to spend her life \u201cplaying Blue Moon in a hotel lobby\u201d \u2013 switching to biology. \u201cI had a wild childhood. I was always catching bugs and lizards and learning the names of things, so science was natural for me. But it also seemed practical. I was lucky to get to college; a lot of my friends had babies by the time they were 17. I had this sense, almost like having been shot into space, of needing to make good use of my time.\u201d</p>    <p>She professes herself \u2013 somewhat unconvincingly, I would say \u2013 to be \u201ca hermit\u201d nowadays, her longstanding introversion intact, even if she has mastered her shyness. \u201cI live in a beautiful place, and I want to stay here for ever. My family jokes about it, they keep a record of how long it is since I have left the hollow\u2026\u201d Sometimes, though, there\u2019s nothing for it. \u201cI have to move in the world to know what I want to write about. The currency of my fiction is human interaction, but that does not exist without a sense of place \u2013 my characters are not just people doing people things among, you know, objects made by people. There are trees overhead. A river comes roaring through the town. In <em>Holding the Line</em>, you smell the honeysuckle. So much of the world is not made by people, and paying attention to that is important to me.\u201d</p> <p>Her books are so replete, somehow: so bright and so big. Does she ever worry that they will go out of fashion? That the internet is making novels smaller: more colourless and inward-looking? \u201cAre we discussing Sally Rooney?\u201d she asks, with sudden and unexpected waspishness. But no, she isn\u2019t worried at all. \u201cI\u2019ve seen minimalism come and go,\u201d she tells me, in the moments before she disappears (I picture a scrubbed kitchen table, laden with immaculate veg). \u201cI mean, take <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/08/the-overstory-richard-powers-review\">The Overstory</a></em> [a Booker prize shortlisted novel] by Richard Powers. There\u2019s a book about trees, and people loved it!\u201d She nods her head, a silver curl flashing. \u201cGive them something bigger than a conversation in a room and they\u2019re going to eat it up.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Holding the Line: Women in the Great Arizona Mine Strike</em><em> </em>is published by Faber (\u00a316.99).

Kingsolver is speaking to me from her home in Virginia: a farm in a hollow surrounded by deciduous forests, to which she moved with her husband and two daughters in 2004. On Instagram, she often posts photos of her abundant homegrown crops, sometimes before mammoth pickling and bottling sessions in her kitchen: tomatoes, cardoons, padr\u00f3n peppers, sweet potatoes. I can\u2019t see any of these things on my screen now; only a bookcase is on offer. But rightly or wrongly, I feel I know all about her particular contentment: happy, productive hours at her desk followed by equally happy, productive hours outdoors. We\u2019re very far indeed from dusty Arizona, where her 28-year-old self once spent her days carefully interviewing the women who kept the show on the road during the strike (they staffed the picket lines when the men travelled to other states in search of a wage), sitting with them on the \u201csqueaky porch-swings of [their] slant-frame houses\u201d. These days, after all, her characters belong only to her imagination, no Dictaphone required. In 1983, she struggled to maintain the dispassion she believed was required of a good journalist. It was impossible not to take sides, and having won their trust, the people of Clifton began to refer to her fondly as the \u201cgal\u201d who was writing a book about them. Back in Tucson, her interview tapes began to pile up in what she describes as an \u201cimpugning\u201d way; in the end, she wrote Holding the Line because she saw \u201cno other decent option\u201d. Only later did it occur to her that the story had historic implications: \u201cThis was the moment when the forces of capital teamed with governments to crush labour. A lot of it turned [in the US] on the air traffic controller strike [of 1981]. Reagan broke that strike overnight. He fired 11,000 unionised controllers in a single morning and then \u2013 this is the really shocking part \u2013 he banned them from working in the federal service ever again. It felt, in a weird way, like a military coup. We didn\u2019t understand that the president had the power to destroy so many lives at once, and it terrified [workers]. Your working life \u2013 your professional life \u2013 could end by edict.\u201d Has she been back to Clifton recently? \u201cI did for years, but [not recently], no. The women in my book mostly moved to other places. Ajo, Clifton and Morenci were classic mining towns, and once those closed, there was nothing else in them. They\u2019re something like ghost towns now, I\u2019d say.\u201d But she hardly needs to take a long drive to grasp how these things play out. In Virginia, where coal mining was once king, she has seen with her own eyes what happens when stable jobs disappear. \u201cThe mines kept out other factories and mills that might have come in. They owned everything: the land, the courthouse, the politics. When coal left this region, it left an enormous void, which created a kind of hopelessness. I love Appalachian culture. It\u2019s community-based. It\u2019s very self-sufficient. But you have this hopelessness that [makes people] vulnerable to politicians who say: I\u2019m on your side. When someone comes along who says: I see you, I hear you, and what I especially hear is that the government has abandoned you, because look at your schools, your hospitals, your unemployment rates\u2026 Populist politicians have tapped into this sense that we\u2019re on our own, that government can\u2019t help us.\u201d This brings us inevitably to JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate who rose to prominence on the back of his hit 2016 memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, in which he describes the values of his family, who came originally from rural Kentucky, and the socioeconomic travails of Middletown, Ohio, to which his mother\u2019s parents moved after the second world war. When the book was first published, it enthralled many urban liberals, who took it at face value, glad to be instructed about a world they didn\u2019t know and possibly feared. But what did Kingsolver think? Did she hate it? And if so, how did she feel about the attention \u2013 even the acclaim \u2013 it received? Drawing breath, she seems to grow a little taller in her seat. \u201cI can tell you that Appalachian people felt betrayed by that book a long time before he became a Republican politician. I\u2019ll begin by saying: anyone is entitled to write a memoir. That\u2019s his story, fine. But for him to say that his story explains all of us \u2013 I say, no, I resent that, because it\u2019s very condescending. There\u2019s this subtext all the way through it that suggests we\u2019re in a boat that\u2019s sinking because we\u2019re lazy, unambitious and uncreative, which I resent.\u201d The positive responses to the book, she believes, were born of the fact that it simply confirmed well-worn stereotypes. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with this condescension, this anti-hillbilly bigotry for a lot of my life. I didn\u2019t realise it was a problem until I left Kentucky and went to college [she went to university in Indiana] and people made fun of my accent, and said things like: \u2018Look at you, you\u2019re wearing shoes, ha ha!\u2019\u201d She pauses. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s more insidious than that. Even as a writer, I feel like my whole life until Demon Copperhead [her Pulitzer prize-winning 2022 novel, which is set in modern Appalachia] I was snubbed because I\u2019m rural, I\u2019m from this place that\u2019s considered backward. I\u2019m quite used to it. But it [Vance\u2019s book] really made a lot of us angry that this became the explanation for us.\u201d Her neighbours, she says, saw through him immediately: \u201cThe hollowness, the fact that he isn\u2019t really one of us.\u201d And perhaps this only increased her determination to write a book like Demon Copperhead, which tackles head on the agonising effects of the opioid crisis in Appalachia: \u201cWe have to talk about history. This was done to us. This region has been treated as a kind of internal colony exploited by the outside. It was just so personal for him [Vance]. There was no analysis, and no compassion. It was just: if I can survive, anyone can survive.\u201d How does she think Vance is working out for Donald Trump, who picked him as his running mate? She is scornful. \u201cThe bottom line is: Trump doesn\u2019t want a vice-president. I don\u2019t think it was a thoroughly considered decision. He\u2019s entirely about himself. He\u2019s not even interested in the presidency. He\u2019s only interested in winning.\u201d Is she anxious about the election? \u201cOf course I\u2019m nervous. But I\u2019ll tell you this: I\u2019m a lot less nervous than I was. I have immense respect for Joe Biden, he has done so much. But the image of an old man at the helm\u2026 I have enormous respect for his decision to turn over the keys to a younger generation. Almost all my friends are younger than me. I have millennial daughters. They\u2019re so enthusiastic about a [potential] new administration, and how it will represent them.\u201d It goes without saying that Kingsolver\u2019s career was stellar long before Demon Copperhead was published. Novels such as The Poisonwood Bible, about a family of Baptist missionaries in Congo, and The Lacuna, which pieces together the story of a man whose friends include Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, were acclaimed, prizewinning bestsellers. But even she seems to feel that Demon Copperhead, her most recent book, a retelling of Charles Dickens\u2019s David Copperfield that won her a second Women\u2019s prize for fiction as well a Pulitzer, is special \u2013 not least because it has changed perceptions of Appalachia. \u201cI know that it has,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I hear that from people every day. It broke the \u2013 I don\u2019t know what to call it \u2013 grassroots ceiling.\u201d Starting out, she tells me, there were male writers at the top of the pile, women\u2019s literature in a special category, and then, far below both of these, rural writers \u2013 where they remain to this day. \u201cThey\u2019re just not respected, I\u2019ve always known that. I\u2019ve felt it, in interviews, time and time again. But I long ago gave up the expectation of that kind of approval, I guess I\u2019m just a rebel \u2013 and this book [Demon Copperhead] broke through that. It won the big prizes, and it got all the attention, and it stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for over a year. And this seems important to me because it looks straight at the bigotry rural people face.\u201d Identity politics has helped people like her, she says: it has chipped away at the parameters of what subjects are deemed acceptable. For readers, Demon Copperhead is a bridge over the urban-rural divide; a \u201cwindow on a world\u201d in which doctors are in such short supply that women commonly have to drive to another state to have their babies, as happened to Kingsolver\u2019s own daughter. She had wanted to write such a book \u2013 her great Appalachian novel \u2013 for a long time, but the project seemed daunting, maybe impossible. On a book tour in England in 2018, however, she stayed at Bleak House in Broadstairs, where Dickens wrote David Copperfield (it\u2019s now a B&amp;B), and everything became clear. Alone, late at night, in the writer\u2019s former study, she felt \u201cthe presence of his outrage\u201d, and his voice urging her to \u201clet the child tell the story\u201d. On the flight home, she reread his great tale of an orphan, the book of his own that he loved best of all, and saw how she could rework it to write about the \u201clost boys\u201d of Appalachia, where 40% of children have parents who have either died as a result of opioid addiction, are incapacitated by one, or are in prison. Mr Creakle\u2019s boarding school would become a tobacco farm, and the blacking factory, a meth lab; Uriah Heep would be transformed into a soccer coach called U-Haul, and David\u2019s friend Steerforth into Demon\u2019s pal, Fast Forward. It\u2019s almost outrageous, I tell her: a woman from Kentucky taking on Dickens. She laughs. Her career as a writer, she says, still amazes her \u2013 \u201cI get up surprised every day that I do this for a living\u201d \u2013 perhaps because her path towards it wasn\u2019t entirely straightforward. The daughter of a doctor, she spent part of her childhood in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an experience she later drew on for The Poisonwood Bible; at university, she began by studying classical piano on a music scholarship before \u2013 on the realisation that she didn\u2019t want to spend her life \u201cplaying Blue Moon in a hotel lobby\u201d \u2013 switching to biology. \u201cI had a wild childhood. I was always catching bugs and lizards and learning the names of things, so science was natural for me. But it also seemed practical. I was lucky to get to college; a lot of my friends had babies by the time they were 17. I had this sense, almost like having been shot into space, of needing to make good use of my time.\u201d She professes herself \u2013 somewhat unconvincingly, I would say \u2013 to be \u201ca hermit\u201d nowadays, her longstanding introversion intact, even if she has mastered her shyness. \u201cI live in a beautiful place, and I want to stay here for ever. My family jokes about it, they keep a record of how long it is since I have left the hollow\u2026\u201d Sometimes, though, there\u2019s nothing for it. \u201cI have to move in the world to know what I want to write about. The currency of my fiction is human interaction, but that does not exist without a sense of place \u2013 my characters are not just people doing people things among, you know, objects made by people. There are trees overhead. A river comes roaring through the town. In Holding the Line, you smell the honeysuckle. So much of the world is not made by people, and paying attention to that is important to me.\u201d Her books are so replete, somehow: so bright and so big. Does she ever worry that they will go out of fashion? That the internet is making novels smaller: more colourless and inward-looking? \u201cAre we discussing Sally Rooney?\u201d she asks, with sudden and unexpected waspishness. But no, she isn\u2019t worried at all. \u201cI\u2019ve seen minimalism come and go,\u201d she tells me, in the moments before she disappears (I picture a scrubbed kitchen table, laden with immaculate veg). \u201cI mean, take The Overstory [a Booker prize shortlisted novel] by Richard Powers. There\u2019s a book about trees, and people loved it!\u201d She nods her head, a silver curl flashing. \u201cGive them something bigger than a conversation in a room and they\u2019re going to eat it up.\u201d Holding the Line: Women in the Great Arizona Mine Strike is published by Faber (\u00a316.99).

The problem is the risk: only two weeks ago, a 33-year-old British woman called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/26/tributes-to-woman-thought-to-be-first-to-die-from-suspected-brazilian-butt-lift-in-uk\">Alice Webb</a> died after reportedly undergoing a non-surgical Brazilian butt lift, with a coroner stating further investigation is needed to confirm the cause of death. According to her mother, hospital staff were unable to resuscitate her following the procedure, which had taken place at another location. Last week, another apparent plastic surgery tragedy <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/woman-dies-after-putting-body-33800102\">hit the news</a> \u2013 Viviane Lira Monte, 24, died after undergoing six cosmetic procedures during an eight-hour operation in Brazil.</p> <p>It is a concern, then, that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-65099476\">rates are soaring</a>. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons reports an <a href=\"https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/press-releases/american-society-of-plastic-surgeons-reveals-2022s-most-sought-after-procedures\">increase in custom</a> every year. There has been a boom in Britain too: rates of plastic surgery exploded after the pandemic to higher levels than before it began. The all-party parliamentary group on beauty, aesthetics and wellbeing has said that there was also \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/18/cosmetic-surgeon-botox-fillers-instagram-generation-safety-concerns\">rapid growth</a>\u201d in non-surgical treatments such as Botox and filler, which can also be dangerous. Meanwhile, Britons are going abroad in droves to places such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/18/obesity-surgery-to-butt-lifts-uk-concern-over-unregulated-plastic-surgery-expo#:~:text=According%20to%20data%20from%20the%20Foreign%20Office%2C%20six%20Britonsa%20died,abroad%20increased%20by%2094%25%20in\">Turkey</a> for cheaper breast implants and liposuction.</p> <p>Why is this happening? Surprisingly, for such a pertinent problem, the answer remains rather vague. Two phrases we often hear are \u201cunrealistic body standards\u201d and&nbsp;\u201cbeauty culture\u201d. The idea is that patriarchal forces have \u2013 via the&nbsp;mass media, models and airbrushed celebrities \u2013 set a \u201cstandard\u201d, which women are then pressured to live up to. But is that really what is happening?</p> <p>Let\u2019s examine it. First, the timing doesn\u2019t fit. Plastic surgery rates have rocketed over the past decade or two, but in that period body standards in the mass media have actually relaxed. The 00s, remember, was a time of open and relentless female fat shaming in films and TV \u2013 \u201cfat Monica\u201d in <em>Friends</em>, Anne Hathaway\u2019s \u201cfat\u201d character in <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>, the nine-stone (but somehow \u201cfat\u201d) Bridget Jones.</p> <p>Or take women\u2019s magazines. In 2004, <em>Heat</em> ran a celebrity cellulite special, drawing \u201ccircles of shame\u201d around patches on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s and Martine McCutcheon\u2019s legs \u2013 typical for the time. But now that sort of thing would cause a backlash. When, two years ago, <em>First for Women </em>magazine<em>&nbsp;</em>ran a feature titled \u201cDrop 48lbs by Christmas\u201d, there was a social media outcry. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women-body-dysmorphia-image-b2248744.html\">I thought that was from 1997 or something!</a>\u201d one social media user wrote.</p> <p>It was once unthinkable that fashion designers would send anyone over size zero down the runway. Not now. In Hollywood, older actresses are sweeping awards&nbsp;categories and expanding their roles, and on TV we see many more older female newsreaders and programme hosts. And when, in 2023, <em><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-12428381/Vogue-slammed-readers-dreadful-representation-women-prime-airbrushing-supermodels-cover-former-editor-says-no-need.html\">Vogue</a></em><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-12428381/Vogue-slammed-readers-dreadful-representation-women-prime-airbrushing-supermodels-cover-former-editor-says-no-need.html\"> airbrushed supermodels</a> Cindy Crawford, Linda&nbsp;Evangelista and Naomi Campbell, there was a huge backlash.</p> <p>So why are more people than ever signing up for plastic surgery? Could it be social media? Is it that young people are being bombarded with perfect images of their peers, pressuring them to look the same? It\u2019s likely this has some effect, but I\u2019m not convinced it is the total explanation. After all, the body positivity movement has hit Instagram too: airbrushing and filters are increasingly frowned upon, diverse body shapes accepted and even rewarded. Let\u2019s think about this another way. If we could fill Instagram with ordinary-looking&nbsp;people, would that really solve the problem? Or would people&nbsp;still want to look more&nbsp;beautiful than they are, given the chance?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Plastic surgeons who once helped patients sneak in via the back door now see them live-posting their recovery on social media</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We may have been asking the wrong question when it comes to plastic surgery. Concerned politicians and researchers ask what could <em>possibly</em> be incentivising women to want to improve their appearance \u2013 and land on \u201cbeauty culture\u201d, \u201cbody standards\u201d and the rest of it. But the incentives are already there. Beautiful people will always do better in one fundamental competition: the dating market. Who wouldn\u2019t want to look better than they do? Let\u2019s say you found a woman whose society has never heard of \u201cbeauty culture\u201d \u2013 a medieval villager, say \u2013 and offered her the chance to be prettier. Wouldn\u2019t she take it?</p> <p>There will always be demand for plastic surgery. So to address the problem, we should be looking at supply. And that\u2019s where we see the trend that fits. In the past two decades, it has become far&nbsp;easier to get plastic surgery: it is&nbsp;more affordable, more widespread&nbsp;and more advertised. Another huge&nbsp;barrier to treatment is meanwhile falling away: stigma.</p> <p>Plastic surgeons who once had to help patients sneak in via the back door now see them live-posting their recovery on social media \u2013 or requesting to feature on the surgery\u2019s Instagram feed. Since 2015, posts on RealSelf, a plastic surgery review site, <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health-news/more-people-getting-plastic-surgery\">have more than doubled</a>, with users often&nbsp;posting before and after pictures of themselves. As the stigma drops further, it is even becoming acceptable for men to get plastic surgery. Such procedures are rising.</p> <p>Celebrities are more open now: last week <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/ariana-grande-cosmetic-procedures-nose-job-b2621734.html\">Ariana Grande</a> openly admitted to having filler and Botox in 2018. Kim Kardashian has spoken about using Botox, and supermodel Bella Hadid has said that she had a nose job at 14. No doubt they think they are combating unhelpful \u201cbody standards\u201d. But they might be doing something more harmful \u2013 helping to normalise plastic surgery and encouraging more people into these risky procedures. Sometimes, stigma is a force for good.</p> <p>\u2022 Martha Gill is an Observer columnist</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Surprisingly, for such a pertinent problem, the answer remains rather vague. Two phrases we often hear are \u201cunrealistic body standards\u201d and \u201cbeauty culture\u201d. The idea is that patriarchal forces have \u2013 via the mass media, models and airbrushed celebrities \u2013 set a \u201cstandard\u201d, which women are then pressured to live up to. But is that really what is happening? Let\u2019s examine it. First, the timing doesn\u2019t fit. Plastic surgery rates have rocketed over the past decade or two, but in that period body standards in the mass media have actually relaxed. The 00s, remember, was a time of open and relentless female fat shaming in films and TV \u2013 \u201cfat Monica\u201d in Friends, Anne Hathaway\u2019s \u201cfat\u201d character in The Devil Wears Prada, the nine-stone (but somehow \u201cfat\u201d) Bridget Jones. Or take women\u2019s magazines. In 2004, Heat ran a celebrity cellulite special, drawing \u201ccircles of shame\u201d around patches on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s and Martine McCutcheon\u2019s legs \u2013 typical for the time. But now that sort of thing would cause a backlash. When, two years ago, First for Women magazine ran a feature titled \u201cDrop 48lbs by Christmas\u201d, there was a social media outcry. \u201cI thought that was from 1997 or something!\u201d one social media user wrote. It was once unthinkable that fashion designers would send anyone over size zero down the runway. Not now. In Hollywood, older actresses are sweeping awards categories and expanding their roles, and on TV we see many more older female newsreaders and programme hosts. And when, in 2023, Vogue airbrushed supermodels Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista and Naomi Campbell, there was a huge backlash. So why are more people than ever signing up for plastic surgery? Could it be social media? Is it that young people are being bombarded with perfect images of their peers, pressuring them to look the same? It\u2019s likely this has some effect, but I\u2019m not convinced it is the total explanation. After all, the body positivity movement has hit Instagram too: airbrushing and filters are increasingly frowned upon, diverse body shapes accepted and even rewarded. Let\u2019s think about this another way. If we could fill Instagram with ordinary-looking people, would that really solve the problem? Or would people still want to look more beautiful than they are, given the chance? We may have been asking the wrong question when it comes to plastic surgery. Concerned politicians and researchers ask what could possibly be incentivising women to want to improve their appearance \u2013 and land on \u201cbeauty culture\u201d, \u201cbody standards\u201d and the rest of it. But the incentives are already there. Beautiful people will always do better in one fundamental competition: the dating market. Who wouldn\u2019t want to look better than they do? Let\u2019s say you found a woman whose society has never heard of \u201cbeauty culture\u201d \u2013 a medieval villager, say \u2013 and offered her the chance to be prettier. Wouldn\u2019t she take it? There will always be demand for plastic surgery. So to address the problem, we should be looking at supply. And that\u2019s where we see the trend that fits. In the past two decades, it has become far easier to get plastic surgery: it is more affordable, more widespread and more advertised. Another huge barrier to treatment is meanwhile falling away: stigma. Plastic surgeons who once had to help patients sneak in via the back door now see them live-posting their recovery on social media \u2013 or requesting to feature on the surgery\u2019s Instagram feed. Since 2015, posts on RealSelf, a plastic surgery review site, have more than doubled, with users often posting before and after pictures of themselves. As the stigma drops further, it is even becoming acceptable for men to get plastic surgery. Such procedures are rising. Celebrities are more open now: last week Ariana Grande openly admitted to having filler and Botox in 2018. Kim Kardashian has spoken about using Botox, and supermodel Bella Hadid has said that she had a nose job at 14. No doubt they think they are combating unhelpful \u201cbody standards\u201d. But they might be doing something more harmful \u2013 helping to normalise plastic surgery and encouraging more people into these risky procedures. Sometimes, stigma is a force for good. \u2022 Martha Gill is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "bodyText": "Heavy consecutive strikes hit Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs from late Saturday into Sunday, witnesses said, while Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said 24 people were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a mosque in central Gaza early on Sunday. The strike on the mosque, near the Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, came as the war between Israel and Hamas in the Palestinian territory approaches its first anniversary on 7 October. Witnesses said the number of casualties could rise as the mosque was being used to house displaced people, while the Israeli military said it was being used as a Hamas command centre. In the Lebanese capital, the Israeli strikes sent booms across the city and sparked flashes of red and white for nearly 30 minutes visible from several kilometres away. The strikes came after days of Israeli bombing of Beirut suburbs considered strongholds for the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah, killing its leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and possibly his potential successor. A Lebanese security source said on Saturday that Hashem Safieddine, the potential successor, had been out of contact since Friday, after an Israeli airstrike near the city\u2019s international airport that was reported to have targeted him. Lebanese security sources said Israeli strikes since Friday on Dahiyeh, a residential area and Hezbollah stronghold south of central Beirut, were keeping rescue workers from scouring the site of Thursday night\u2019s attack. Safieddine\u2019s loss would be another blow to the Hezbollah and its patron Iran. Israeli strikes across the region in the past year, sharply accelerated in the past few weeks, have shattered Hezbollah\u2019s leadership. Israel has been expanding its actions in Lebanon. On Saturday, it made its first strike in the northern city of Tripoli, a Lebanese security official said, and Israeli troops launched raids in the south. At least eight strikes rocked Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs late on Saturday including close to the airport, according to Reuters witnesses, after the Israeli military warned some residents to flee. Before the recent upsurge, exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah had been mostly limited to the Israel-Lebanon border area, in parallel to Israel\u2019s year-old war in Gaza against Palestinian group Hamas. Israeli military spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari said on Saturday that Israel had killed 440 Hezbollah fighters in its ground operations in southern Lebanon and destroyed 2,000 Hezbollah targets. Hezbollah has not released death tolls. Israel says it stepped up its assault on Hezbollah to enable the safe return of tens of thousands of citizens to homes in northern Israel, bombarded by the Lebanon-based group since last 8 October. Israeli authorities said on Saturday that nine Israeli soldiers had been killed in southern Lebanon since the operation began. The Israeli assault has also killed hundreds of Lebanese civilians, Lebanese officials say, and forced 1.2 million people \u2013 almost a quarter of the population \u2013 from their homes. A Lebanese security official told Reuters that Saturday\u2019s strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Tripoli killed a member of Hamas, his wife and two children. Media affiliated with the Palestinian group said the strike killed a leader of its armed wing, naming him as Saeed Atallah. Israel said it killed two Hamas members operating in Lebanon, but did not say whether they had been in Tripoli. There was no immediate comment from Hamas. In northern Israel, air raid sirens on Saturday sent people running for shelters amid rocket fire from Lebanon. Hezbollah said it had fired missiles at what it called \u201cATA company for military industries near Sakhnin base\u201d, close to Haifa. The Israeli army said two projectiles had crossed from Lebanon, one of which was intercepted while the other landed but caused no damage. The violence came as thousands of protesters took to the streets in major cities around the world on Saturday demanding an end to bloodshed in Gaza and the wider Middle East as the start of Israel\u2019s war in the Palestinian territory approaches its first anniversary. About 40,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through central London while thousands gathered in Paris, Rome, Manila, Cape Town, New York City, Sydney and Melbourne. Demonstrations were also held near the White House in Washington, protesting against US support for its ally Israel in military campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon. The top US general for the region, Gen Michael \u201cEric\u201d Kurilla, was travelling in the Middle East, a US defence official said on Saturday, declining to specify which country or to confirm Israeli media reports that he had arrived there for consultations with Israeli military officials.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company on today\u2019s Guardian Australia news blog. Here were the major developments of the day: Pro-Palestinian rallies were held in most major cities across Australia, despite criticism from politicians and police. One man was arrested for allegedly holding a sign with a swastika at the Sydney rally. Seventy-five crew members and passengers have been rescued by Samoan emergency services and Australian defence force personnel after a New Zealand navy vessel ran aground and sank off the coast of Samoan island Upolu. Two Australian government-assisted evacuation flights from Beirut safely arrived in Cyprus. The deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, accused opposition leader, Peter Dutton, of \u201cintentionally lying\u201d about Australia\u2019s stance on the Middle East crisis. Marles said Australia was in lockstep with the United States regarding Israel\u2019s right to respond to Iran. The national council of Australia\u2019s tertiary education union has overwhelmingly endorsed the academic boycott of Israel and a long term strategy of demilitarisation of the higher education sector. There has also been plenty of tragic news to report. A child and an adult died in a buggy rollover in Victoria on Saturday night. On Sunday, a child died in a unit fire in Thorneside, in Queensland, and a 25-year-old man died following a water-skiing incident on the Hawkesbury River. We\u2019ll be back blogging the day\u2019s news again tomorrow. A man has been arrested for allegedly holding a sign with a swastika on it at the pro-Palestine rally in Sydney today. NSW police said this was the only arrest made in relation to the Sydney rally so far, and no further information was available. Any ban on young people using social media needs to be implemented as soon as possible, the NSW premier, Chris Minns, says. Ahead of a two-day summit between the NSW and South Australian governments on addressing social media issues, Minns said age restrictions for the tech platforms were more than needed. I\u2019d like to see (an age ban) done as soon as possible \u2026 ultimately, we have to draw a line in the sand,\u201d he told Sky News on Sunday. This is a big change for Australia, but I think it\u2019s warranted, given this is, in my view a global, unregulated experiment on young people and the prevalent use of social media. It comes as Anthony Albanese wrote to state and territory leaders asking for input on how an age ban on social media could be implemented. The federal government has indicated it will look to introduce legislation restricting social media use for young people, but an exact age limit has not been determined. \u2013 AAP Queensland LNP promises $250m in community sports funding The Queensland opposition leader, David Crisafulli, says the Liberal National party will establish a $250m fund to build community sports infrastructure across the state before the 2032 Olympics. But the LNP leader remains coy on its plans for major venues \u2013 saying only that it will not proceed with the existing plans to host athletics at the 80s-era Queensland Sports and Athletic Centre, and that it would not build new stadiums. We must deliver a legacy for all of Queensland, the Games must benefit our entire state and that means more local sports in more local communities. Speeches went for about an hour in Sydney\u2019s Hyde Park, before protesters began marching as part of the pro-Palestine rally. The anger and frustration in the air was palpable as the crowd was led through a number of chants, taking aim at Australia\u2019s leaders \u2013 including the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and foreign minister, Penny Wong \u2013 and the media, with shouts of \u201cshame\u201d ringing out. One chant said, \u201cFree, free Palestine, hands off Lebanon,\u201d while another was heard, \u201cGlory, glory to our martyrs.\u201d Every direction you looked across the park there were a sea of faces, protest signs and flags in the air, as people found pockets of shade amid the 26C heat. Man dies following Hawkesbury River water-skiing incident A 25-year-old man has died following a water-skiing incident on the Hawkesbury River on Sunday morning. Emergency services were called to a boat ramp in Lower Portland, north-west of Sydney. They were told a water skier had been injured after hitting the water at speed while being pulled by a boat. Paramedics treated the man, however he died at the scene. Police established a crime scene, and a report will be prepared for the information of the coroner. As investigations continue, police are urging anyone with information to contact police or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Parts of the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia can expect \u201csevere to locally extreme\u201d heatwaves this week, with the Bureau of Meteorology warning temperatures well above average will continue. The Guardian\u2019s Mike Bowers has been capturing the rally at Hyde Park. Protesters at the pro-Palestine rally in Sydney are about to start marching from Hyde Park, as speeches wrap up: The contingent is being led by a group of children, as protesters chant, \u201cFree, free Palestine.\u201d Superhuman vocals from Jimmy Barnes anchor triumphant Cold Chisel tour opener On the screens flanking the stage at Petersons Winery in Armidale, you can clearly see the scar at the top of Jimmy Barnes\u2019 big barrel chest. It\u2019s a visible legacy of the singer\u2019s second round of open-heart surgery in December last year, after a serious bout of bacterial pneumonia nearly killed him. Two months ago, he had a hip replacement that also left him fighting off an infection, which kept him tethered to a drip for weeks. You wouldn\u2019t know it. Watching him tear through Cold Chisel\u2019s 24-song set on the first official stop of their Big Five-0 tour, Barnes looks indestructible. At this rate, he\u2019ll outlive all of us and Keith Richards combined.

Samoan emergency services and Australian defence force personnel responded to the incident involving HMNZS Manawanui, with assistance from NZ Rescue Coordination Centre (RCCNZ). The incident occurred on Saturday evening while conducting a hydrographic survey 1 nautical mile from shore, according to a statement from the NZ defence force. The NZ defence force said at 6.40am Sunday, the Manawanui was listing heavily and smoke was visible from the ship and by 9am it had capsized and was below the surface. \u201cWe are very grateful for the assistance of everyone involved, from RCCNZ who coordinated rescue efforts, to the vessels which responded and took our crew and passengers from Manawanui to safety,\u201d maritime component commander commodore Shane Arndell said. More video from the Sydney rally from reporter Sanjana Jose: No arrests have been made at today\u2019s pro-Palestine rally in Sydney \u201cat this stage, that we know of\u201d, according to NSW police media. \u201cNumbers are significantly lower than was expected,\u201d the spokesperson said, but could pick up later. Melbourne protesters march towards Flinders Street station In Melbourne\u2019s CBD, where protesters are rallying outside the state library, a speaker led a chant of \u201cthere\u2019s no shopping while bombs are dropping\u201d as he directed attenders to march towards Flinders Street. The pro-Palestine rally is now well under way in Sydney\u2019s Hyde Park. Here\u2019s some video from Guardian Australia reporter Emily Wind: Kamila, who did not wish to share her last name, travelled from Westmead for today\u2019s rally, but is originally from New Zealand. She began attending the rallies in December last year and admitted she was slightly nervous the first time, but when she arrived felt \u201cnothing but love\u201d and has made lots of friends. I feel it\u2019s my duty as a human being, as someone living here on this country from another country, I feel it\u2019s my duty to speak up and give a voice to those that don\u2019t have a voice. And if the same thing was happening to Israel or to France, I would be doing the same thing. It\u2019s about humanity, and I think as humanity \u2013 as a collective humanity \u2013 I think we\u2019ve failed, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today. \u2018We are peaceful activists, we\u2019re anti-war activists, and we have a right to demonstrate\u2019 Cherish Kuehlmann, a UNSW student with the Students for Palestine group, said she started coming to the rallies one year ago, coming as often as she is able. Today\u2019s rally is being held one day before the anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel where 1,450 people were killed or kidnapped, shortly after which Israel began a retaliation campaign in Gaza that has resulted in at least 41,000 people \u2013 mostly civilians and many children \u2013 being killed. The rallies have been held in Sydney for 52 weeks now. Kuehlmann said this has grown into \u201cone of the biggest anti-war movements, definitely the most consistent anti-war movement in Australian history\u201d. It\u2019s bad to resign to what\u2019s happening. We all see it on our phones, and so growing the support \u2026 and [encouraging] more people to come out matters \u2026 I just think its the \u2026 moral crime of our generation. The student said attempts by NSW police to try to stop today\u2019s rally from happening felt like \u201cdeja vu\u201d to when the rallies first began and were denounced by certain politicians. We\u2019ve demonstrated we are peaceful activists, we\u2019re anti-war activists, and we have a right to demonstrate. A eight-year-old child has died and a woman is missing after a fire broke out in residential units in Thorneside, east of Brisbane this morning. According to ABC reports, a crime scene had been declared. Queensland police\u2019s Chief Insp Karl Hahne said: Tragically, we have located one person deceased inside the premises. One person is still unaccounted-for however, we have a strong belief that person is also in the fire scene. The blaze was brought under control just after 8am Sunday, according to a spokesperson for the Queensland Fire Department. A roof collapsed in one unit, and the fire damaged two others. Guardian Australia\u2019s Sanjana Jose has posted a video from Hyde Park in Sydney where the pro-Palestine rally is about to get under way: The pro-Palestine rally in Sydney is due to kick off at 1pm, but there\u2019s already a huge turnout at Hyde Park. Large crowds of all ages have gathered with protest signs and Palestinian flags, and dozens of police are already present. Police have placed two large LED screens in the park, telling people not to fly Hezbollah flags or imagery with slain leader Hassan Nasrallah. There is a row of market stalls with people selling their wares, and attenders have been gathering together in pockets of shade ahead of the rally, with 25C heat. Ellen Vera is attending for the first time today, having travelled from Casula, south-west of Sydney. She said she wasn\u2019t a political person, but the conflict \u201chas to stop\u201d. It\u2019s inhumane. Humanity is gone. Vera said she was walking \u201cfor the children, the women and the men who cannot get treatment because the hospitals are all blown up\u201d. Wallaroos notch thrilling rugby test victory over South Africa The Wallaroos have earned a pulsating 33-26 triumph over South Africa in Cape Town, as record-equalling Ash Marsters came up with a heroic last-ditch steal to put the Australian women\u2019s side in sight of the WXV2 tournament title. The excellent all-round display on Saturday was headlined by two spectacular performances from flying wingers Desiree Miller and record-breaker Maya Stewart, and sets up a title-deciding match against unbeaten Scotland at the same venue next week.

A spokesperson said paramedics attended Toogoolawah showgrounds \u2013 about 118km north-west of Brisbane \u2013 after receiving reports that two parachutists had collided mid-air. One male patient with significant, and potentially life-threatening, head injuries was airlifted by helicopter to Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s hospital, she said. The other patient with a leg injury was in a stable condition and being transported to Princess Alexandra hospital by road. The Bureau of Meteorology says rugby league fans can look forward to warm and sunny weather for today\u2019s NRLW and NRL grand finals. A young man has died at the Knockout music festival in Sydney last night, according to NSW police. Police commissioner, Karen Webb, said the death was an \u201cunfortunate circumstance\u201d that had been referred to the coroner. We understand he had underlying health issues and there\u2019s no suggestion of any drug taking. Webb said there had been some drug-related hospitalisations associated with the festival. It\u2019s always risky. Whenever you take illegal drugs, you never know where they\u2019re made, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s in them, and you don\u2019t know how your body\u2019s going to react. The NSW police minister, Yasmin Catley, also touched on the candlelight vigil planned for tomorrow, on 7 October, and asked people to \u201cthink about social cohesion\u201d. We ask for people to be sensitive. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of hurt and emotion through our community, and I would just call on people to think about that social cohesion mix. \u2018Action will be taken\u2019 if protesters display Hezbollah flag Asked what would happen if any Hezbollah flags were displayed at today\u2019s rally, assistant commissioner Peter McKenna said organisers had agreed no flags or portraits would be displayed today. Organisers have asked attenders via social media not to bring Hezbollah flags. But McKenna said if anyone was found doing so \u201cand are committing an offence, action will be taken\u201d. Asked if it was against legislation to display a portrait of slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, McKenna said \u201cno it\u2019s not\u201d, but \u201cthere is a view in certain circumstances it could be seen as offensive, and we will consider that throughout the operation\u201d. NSW police say rally response \u2018will be proportionate, it will be significant\u2019 The NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, said the police response began at 10am with a briefing. Webb said assistant commissioner Peter McKenna would be in command of the police presence today. Police will work with organisers, police will work with marshals and others to make sure it is a peaceful rally, that people come into the city [and are] leaving the city according to the form 1. Asked how many police would respond to the rally today, McKenna said \u201cour response will be proportionate, it will be significant\u201d. The NSW police minister, Yasmin Catley, has told reporters there will be a \u201csignificant police presence\u201d on the streets in Sydney today. A pro-Palestine rally will take place in Hyde Park from 1pm today, after NSW police previously attempted to stop it from happening in federal court. Catley said: Everybody has a right to express their views, but we need to respect each other in doing that. She added there will be \u201cno problem whatsoever\u201d if people do the right thing, but if not, \u201cyou can expect to be arrested\u201d. Assistant commissioner Peter McKenna added that if people commit criminal offences, display antisocial behaviour or \u201cdo anything that places people \u2026 [in] jeopardy, we will step in\u201d. The national council of Australia\u2019s tertiary education union has overwhelmingly endorsed the academic boycott of Israel and a long term strategy of demilitarisation of the higher education sector, placing pressure on vice-chancellors grappling with a volatile political climate. The motion, which also calls on university managements to cut ties with the weapons industry and militaries in general, was passed by the National Council of the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) and branches across the country on Saturday. The National Council has a membership of 130 delegates, representing Australia\u2019s 38 public universities. Of more than 100 who voted, 11 abstained and five were against. The vote follows the disbandment of pro-Palestine encampments that were established for months at universities in every state and territory, and similarly urged universities to divest and disclose their connections to weapons manufacturers. A Senate inquiry into antisemitism on university campuses has heard allegations of unsafe campuses among Jewish and Islamic staff and students amid heightened tensions over the ongoing war in the Middle East. Vegemite and Tim Tams cheaper in UK supermarkets than Australia Shoppers in the UK are paying less for Australian brands including Vegemite and Tim Tams than customers in Australia, despite the classic products being made in Australia. A comparison of seven Australian products stocked in UK supermarkets shows they are often cheaper to buy in Britain than at Australia\u2019s two major supermarket chains. Vegemite retails for $1.93 per 100g at Morrisons but costs customers $2.27 at Coles and $2.21 at Woolworths, according to price checks conducted by Guardian Australia.

Thunberg was arrested with other demonstrators, who were blocking a road in Brussels in protest against European Union fossil fuel subsidies. Angela Huston Gold, a spokesperson for United for Climate Justice, one of the groups involved, said \u201cthe climate crisis has reached catastrophic and deadly levels\u201d. Labor MP John Burns says federal government cannot intervene to stop pro-Palestine protests The Labor MP Josh Burns responded to the intervention from the Coalition\u2019s home affairs spokesperson, James Paterson, about pro-Palestine rallies coinciding with the 7 October anniversary. Burns told Sky News that \u201cthere are not mechanisms by which the federal government could intervene here\u201d. Burns said: What happens on our streets is a matter for the states, and to be frank, I support people\u2019s right to protest \u2013 the right to gather and to associate is a fundamental right in Australia. I\u2019m the chair of the Human Rights Committee, and I believe in that. I would also say that October 7 was, is a devastating day on the calendar, and for people to gather on that day sends a very terrible message about whether or not people are allowing their fellow Australians to grieve, and we must have the ability for all of us to grieve. I know this is difficult for our Palestinian community, and I know today, people of Lebanese descent and Lebanese Australians are looking at pictures feeling just terrible for their family. And I get it. I get it. And we need to have room and space for everyone to come together and to feel the devastation of this conflict that\u2019s happening right across the world. So I don\u2019t think that the message of protesting on October 7 does anything else other than really make people who are grieving feel even more upset and more uncomfortable. And I would urge people who are thinking about doing that to maybe consider another option. More than 450 Australians evacuated from Lebanon so far: Marles Richard Marles said the government had assisted more than 450 Australians, mostly citizens, to evacuate from Beirut during the past week, including two flights in the last 24 hours. He said: This is the time to leave. The airport remains open, which is a blessing. It\u2019s really important that people take the opportunity to leave. About 3,600 Australians were now registered with the embassy in Beirut, seeking assistance to leave Lebanon, Marles told the ABC Insiders program. Pro-Palestine protests on 7 October \u2018deeply regrettable\u2019, Marles says Richard Marles has called the pro-Palestinian protests being held today and tomorrow \u201cdeeply regrettable\u201d. Speaking on the ABC, he said the anniversary of the 7 October attacks were a \u201csolemn occasion\u201d that needed to be about what happened on that day: What happened on that day was the loss of more than 1,000 innocent lives, people going about their normal daily business in a peaceful way. I mean, young people attending a concert, people being taken hostage, a whole lot of whom remain hostages to this day. Richard Marles said the government continued to support a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, and the only enduring solution was a negotiated peace. No matter what plays out, there are two peoples who will continue to live side by side. Speaking on ABC Insiders, the deputy prime minister and defence minister acknowledged that seemed \u201cvery unattainable at this moment\u201d. Australians arrive in Cyprus after being evacuated from Lebanon Some images are coming through of Australian citizens, residents and their families arriving at Larnaca airport in Cyprus after being evacuated from Beirut yesterday. Speaking to the ABC, Richard Marles said opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was seeking to exploit the crisis in the Middle East by creating division in Australian society. He said: This is a tragedy that has been playing out in the Middle East. It is obviously difficult. It is obviously complex. He said Dutton had implied Australia was at odds with its allies: That is a patent lie, and it\u2019s an intentional lie, and it\u2019s a lie intended to create division within Australian politics and from there, within Australian society. Speaking to ABC\u2019s Insiders, the deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, said Australia was in lockstep with the United States and that Israel had a right to respond to Iran. Israel clearly has a right to defend itself, and that does include a right to respond, but the manner in which it defends itself obviously matters. Marles said there was a \u201ccycle of violence\u201d in the region, and efforts from the United States with the international community had been to try to avoid a wider conflict and a regional war. The federal opposition\u2019s home affairs spokesperson, James Paterson, says Anthony Albanese should have used \u201cthe status of the office of prime minister\u201d to demand that no pro-Palestine protests occur on the anniversary of the 7 October attacks. During an interview on Sky News this morning, Paterson appeared to concede there was no legal mechanism for the federal government to intervene, but said it was a matter for leadership. Asked to explain his claim that the federal government should have done more to stop protests on 7 October, Paterson said: What I am saying is the prime minister should have shown leadership, and I know that would be something surprising and new and different for him on these issues, but he should have made it clear, and he should have gone direct to community leaders and used the relationships and the status of the office of prime minister that he holds to say this is utterly unacceptable and it must not proceed. We\u2019re not saying that you can\u2019t protest for the Palestinian cause. We\u2019re just saying, pick any other day of the year than the seventh of October. Albanese said on Friday: I believe very strongly that those planning any events on October 7 should think again and should recognise that that is not the time to engage in that activity. Police warn against display of Hezbollah symbols at pro-Palestine rallies While the pro-Palestinian protest organisers have vowed for a peaceful event, the protests have faced criticism from politicians and police, with NSW police this week attempting to prevent the Sydney protest from going ahead, before protest organisers reached an agreement with the police to have the protest occur via a changed route starting at Hyde Park. NSW police had sought to have both the Sunday event and Monday vigil deemed unlawful, citing concerns over expected crowd size and potential hazards including \u201cplanter boxes\u201d at town hall. Police had alleged last Sunday\u2019s rally saw people carrying \u201cprohibited items\u201d as in Hezbollah flags as one of their concerns, and organisers for the Sunday rally have urged participants not to bring any prohibited items. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has expressed concerns about the protests over \u201csocial cohesion\u201d, while the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has claimed the protests are a \u201ccelebration of death\u201d. State and federal police across the country issued a rare joint statement on Friday warning \u201cthere will be no tolerance for illegal behaviour or violence on any day of the year\u201d in the lead-up to protests planned. The NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, said on Friday police would \u201cnot hesitate\u201d to take \u201cappropriate, proportionate action\u201d against anyone committing a criminal offence. NSW police posted on X that the Hezbollah flag, symbols, and images of the former secretary-general of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah should not be displayed. A child and an adult have died and two others were injured in a buggy rollover in Victoria on Saturday evening, AAP reports. Police were investigating the crash, which occurred at 11pm in Tubbut, in the east of the state. The event occurred days after the driver in a 2021 fatal buggy crash was handed a five-year jail term. The mother of the six-year-old girl killed in that incident called the driver\u2019s sentence a \u201cslap in the face\u201d. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, will speak to ABC Insiders host David Speers shortly. Speers has reported that Former Labor - now independent - senator Fatima Payman will unveil a new political party this week. More than 450 Australians and their immediate family members have so far left Lebanon on Australian government-assisted flights, as Israel steps up its strikes in southern Beirut. Two such flights arrived in Cyprus from Beirut yesterday carrying 407 Australians: the first flight carried 229 Australians and the second carried 178. It is understood these Australians and their families are staying in temporary accommodation in Larnaca, Cyprus, before returning to Australia on connecting flights operated by Qantas and Qatar Airways starting from today. Australians are also being encouraged to take up places on two further flights from Lebanon to Cyprus scheduled today. For more on the situation as of yesterday, see this story by my colleague Caitlin Cassidy: There are expected to be large turnouts at what organisers say will be peaceful pro-Palestinian rallies across the major cities in Australia today. They are being held one day before the anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel where 1,450 people were killed or kidnapped, and marking one year since Israel\u2019s ongoing retaliation in Gaza that has resulted in at least 41,000 people \u2013 mostly civilians and many children \u2013 being killed. Rallies have been held weekly in many parts of Australia in support of Palestinians, and more recently in support of Lebanon, after Israel\u2019s retaliation for Hezbollah attacks has killed more than 1,000 people and wounded 6,000 more in the past two weeks, according to Lebanon\u2019s health ministry. Organisers of the Sydney protest said they expected the turnout to be about 5,000 people. The protest times (local) and locations are: Sydney: the protest gets under way from Hyde Park at 1pm. Melbourne: the rally will commence at 12pm outside the state library. Brisbane: the rally will be held at the Queens Gardens at 1pm. Adelaide: the protest will be held at Parliament House at 2pm. Canberra: there is an event being held at 1pm at Garema Place. Darwin: there will be an event at Civic Park Steps from 5pm. In Perth and Hobart, rallies were held on Saturday. We will bring you coverage of these rallies as they get under way. Welcome to another Sunday Guardian live blog. Greetings to those in daylight saving states, who find themselves springing forward this morning. We heard news overnight that the first of two flights evacuating hundreds of Australian citizens, residents and their families from Lebanon has landed safely in Cyprus. Today we are expecting: Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters to march in Sydney and Melbourne today, one year since the start of the Israel-Gaza conflict. In the US, Elon Musk will attend a Pennsylvania rally with Donald Trump (you can follow that here). And fans are preparing for the NRL grand final between the Penrith Panthers and Melbourne Storm this evening. I\u2019m Petra Stock and I\u2019ll be taking the blog through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Health secretary Wes Streeting has been urged to speed up reforms to the adult care system in the wake of patient deaths after two coroners warned him of the impact insufficient care beds and service provision are having on the NHS. Last month, coroners sent two prevention of future deaths (PFD) reports to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) after the inability to discharge patients at two hospitals was linked to the deaths of others awaiting treatment. In the first case, a man died \u201cfollowing a grossly excessive ambulance delay attributable to a systemic failure related to the whole system of health and social care\u201d, according to the PFD report from Guy Davies, assistant coroner for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. The total ambulance delay of nearly 19 hours was judged by the inquest to be \u201cpossibly causative of death\u201d. The inquest found that when the ambulance reached the Royal Cornwall hospital in Truro, there were 11 others queueing to hand over patients to A&amp;E, which was built to house 44 patients but was holding 56. The lack of available beds was the result of patients who were ready for discharge but forced to remain in the hospital because of \u201cinadequate social care provision, community hospital provision and primary healthcare support\u201d. Labour\u2019s election manifesto pledged to create a national care service, but the only specific commitment towards this was a fair pay agreement in adult care, falling short of the programme detailed in a Labour-commissioned report by the Fabian Society thinktank last year. Since the election, the Labour government has abandoned the long-delayed Dilnot reforms to funding care costs, but announced little else. \u201cToo many people are stuck in hospital, unable to leave due to a lack of social care and support in the community,\u201d said Ben Cooper, research manager at the Fabian Society and co-author of last year\u2019s report. \u201cThis is felt throughout the NHS, with worsening wait times for ambulances, and in A&amp;E, and devastating consequences for patients. Fourteen years of Conservative failure to act on social care has contributed to a significant NHS challenge for this government. \u201cUltimately, the government\u2019s promise of an NHS fit for the future requires a national care service. Social care in England needs comprehensive reform, so that everyone has access to support when they need it, including when they leave hospital. \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t start to act now, wait times for ambulances, A&amp;E and other care will not fall and the NHS will continue to struggle. The government should prioritise a long-term plan on social care, alongside its 10-year plan on the NHS.\u201d In his report, Davies highlighted the fragmented structure of the adult care system. \u201cThere is no single organisation with responsibility to ensure that the provision of social care is sufficient to avoid delayed discharges leading to ambulance delays,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe obligation upon local authorities is limited to a requirement to promote the market.\u201d A Cornwall council spokesperson said: \u201cIn spite of the national challenges, which are well recognised, \u2026 and the continued delays around the national policy reforms, Cornwall council has made significant investment in adult social care and is delivering new capacity across a range of services with our providers. We are also working very hard to attract more people into Cornwall\u2019s care sector.\u201d The second PFD report concerned a patient in Manchester who was kept in hospital for a month after he was ready for discharge, because of difficulties finding a suitable care home place over the Christmas period last year. \u201cThe inquest heard evidence that it meant that an acute bed was not available creating delays in allocating beds to patients requiring admission,\u201d the report said. The DHSC said: \u201cOur deepest sympathies are with all those impacted by these tragic cases. It is important we learn lessons from PFD reports, and we will consider these reports carefully before responding. \u201cWe are committed to reforming the sector and, as set out in the manifesto, will take steps to create a national care service, to improve consistency of care across the country, and will establish a fair pay agreement for care professionals.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Spare a thought for the factcheckers at the publisher HarperCollins. For a regular political memoir, those guardians of textual accuracy might, you imagine, raise a query perhaps half a dozen times in each chapter. In the 750-plus pages of Boris Johnson\u2019s <em>Unleashed</em>, however, I\u2019d calculate they were probably working at a rate of nearly one red-inked alarm bell per sentence. No phrase that Johnson writes in this book comes entirely unlaced with hyperbole or self-serving spin. You\u2019d hope the copy editors were being paid by the marginal note and had access to physiotherapy for RSI.</p> <p>Take just the headline acts of the book (for which Johnson may expect to earn \u00a33m) \u2013 those stories splashed earlier this week across the <em>Daily Mail</em>. The claim, for example, that the former prime minister had to be restrained from having British special forces invade the Netherlands in order to secure a batch of Covid vaccines impounded by the EU; or that after a game of tennis with David Cameron at Chequers the then prime minister reportedly vowed to \u201cfuck him up for ever\u201d if he supported the Leave campaign; or that Emmanuel Macron told him that Britain deserved a \u201cpunishment beating\u201d for Brexit; or that the queen\u2019s last words to him, two days before she died, were an expression of approval for his insouciance over the manner of his defenestration.</p> <p>All of these claims, like almost everything else in this book, come with not even the hint of a documented footnote. You quickly realise that each one requires what was always the most preposterous of Johnson\u2019s demands: that you should take him at his word.</p> <p>There are many illustrative instances where the truth of contentious boasts has been established a thousand times. Exhibit A may be Johnson\u2019s perpetual claim that without Brexit there would have been no accelerated vaccine rollout during the pandemic. No matter how many times it has been shown that the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines would never have required EU approval (because of regulation that had <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-vaccine-brexit/\">been in place</a> since 2012), Johnson never tires of repeating the fiction. He adds a clincher here. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t long,\u201d he claims, \u201cbefore graffiti appeared on the wall in Portobello Road, west London. \u2018Brexit saves lives,\u2019 it said.\u201d</p> <p>It is exactly a decade since Johnson\u2019s book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/03/churchill-factor-review-boris-johnson-winston\">The Churchill Factor</a></em>, in which he tried to align his then nascent political ambitions with those of the great wartime leader. That book argued that Churchill \u2013 and by wildly hopeful extension, Johnson \u2013 offered a \u201cresounding human rebuttal to all Marxist historians who think history is the story of vast and impersonal economic forces\u2026 one man can make all the difference\u201d.</p> <p>The intervening years, as this volume shows, have proved Johnson both right and wrong in that contention, to all of our costs. He no doubt made a difference; public life has undeniably become more fractured, venal and shallower for his leading role in it. But his time in office also proved one of the most trenchant of Marx\u2019s observations that \u201chistory repeats itself first as tragedy, second as farce\u201d. Once again here Johnson reveals himself, in his desperate pastiche of his hero\u2019s gambler\u2019s instinct, to be incapable of any register other than snark \u2013 you won\u2019t find any convincing notes of solemnity or compassion in this book, because where is the Bunterish snigger in that?</p> <p>The overarching irony is the fact that the fates presented Johnson with all the circumstances in which he might have proved his mettle as a leader: the great struggle to normalise relations with the EU and the existential crisis of the pandemic. In his reflections on both he shows himself hopelessly wanting. Looking back at his infantile resolution to \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, he notes that his efforts to ingratiate himself with President Macron involved not negotiating the small print of an effective trade deal or cross-border security, but in suggesting a hydrogen-powered Concorde and a bridge across the Channel.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>He repeats a wild belief that he would have won the 2024 election had he not been removed from office by colleagues suffering a collective \u2018attack of the vapours\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Covid, meanwhile, saw him dwelling not on the strained infrastructure of public health but, inevitably, on his crammer\u2019s knowledge of the classics: \u201c\u2018Pericles died of the plague,\u2019 I had earlier reminded my old friend Michael Gove,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand his spectacles seemed to glitter at the thought, like the penguin in <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em>.\u201d His own life-threatening spell in ICU caused him briefly to \u201cwonder blackly\u2026 [if] it was some kind of cosmic judgment on me, on my whole worldview\u201d. That doubt doesn\u2019t survive his return to health. Rather than, say, attend Cobra meetings, his primary sentiment remains that \u201cI needed to bee-oing-oing back on to my feet like an India rubber ball\u2026 fixing the care homes, driving the quest for a cure\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Johnson is not a man made for regret, of course. He repeats a wild belief that he would have won the 2024 election had he not been removed from office by colleagues suffering a collective \u201cattack of the vapours\u201d. And he bangs on, inevitably, about his \u201cbig idea\u201d \u2013 levelling up \u2013 formed partly at Eton when he was confronted with the startling fact that hereditary toffs weren\u2019t necessarily the sharpest knives in the drawer.</p>    <p>Countering this vaunted commitment to social mobility, of course, are the many occasions in which he proved himself the most enthusiastic promoter of cronyism. This, for example, is how he describes his appointment of Kate Bingham, \u201cwhom I had known since I was 18\u201d, to head up the vaccine taskforce. \u201cShe was one of a bevy of brilliant and energetic Paulinas (alumnae of St Paul\u2019s Girls\u2019 School) who went around Oxford in the mid-1980s, terrorising and breaking the hearts of their male counterparts. She had married an old school friend of mine, Jesse Norman, and she had also been at school with my sister, the ubiquitous Rachel\u2026 it was precisely because I knew her that I knew she was superabundantly qualified for the job.\u201d There is less to be said for Dido Harding, also a friend and the wife of a Tory MP, who was entrusted with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/27/nhs-test-and-trace-failed-its-main-objective-says-spending-watchdog\">spaffing \u00a337bn</a> on the entirely ineffective test and trace \u201cmoonshot\u201d (in large part, it seems, because Johnson saw the potential for schoolboy jokes in the classical allusion of her <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dido\">Christian name</a>).</p> <p>Just occasionally he stumbles on the truth. At one point he mentions a piece written 20 years ago, which foretold that \u201cthe Tories will never recover until Boris Johnson leaves the stage\u201d. You only have to glance at the current quartet of Conservative leadership candidates to see that his legacy \u2013 the hollowing out of principle and character in the party he led \u2013 is very much alive. And in this sense, you read this book with the growing nausea that its author still, despite everything, inevitably envisages a heroic sequel.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Unleashed</em> by Boris Johnson is published by William Collins (\u00a330).

He adds a clincher here. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t long,\u201d he claims, \u201cbefore graffiti appeared on the wall in Portobello Road, west London. \u2018Brexit saves lives,\u2019 it said.\u201d It is exactly a decade since Johnson\u2019s book The Churchill Factor, in which he tried to align his then nascent political ambitions with those of the great wartime leader. That book argued that Churchill \u2013 and by wildly hopeful extension, Johnson \u2013 offered a \u201cresounding human rebuttal to all Marxist historians who think history is the story of vast and impersonal economic forces\u2026 one man can make all the difference\u201d. The intervening years, as this volume shows, have proved Johnson both right and wrong in that contention, to all of our costs. He no doubt made a difference; public life has undeniably become more fractured, venal and shallower for his leading role in it. But his time in office also proved one of the most trenchant of Marx\u2019s observations that \u201chistory repeats itself first as tragedy, second as farce\u201d. Once again here Johnson reveals himself, in his desperate pastiche of his hero\u2019s gambler\u2019s instinct, to be incapable of any register other than snark \u2013 you won\u2019t find any convincing notes of solemnity or compassion in this book, because where is the Bunterish snigger in that? The overarching irony is the fact that the fates presented Johnson with all the circumstances in which he might have proved his mettle as a leader: the great struggle to normalise relations with the EU and the existential crisis of the pandemic. In his reflections on both he shows himself hopelessly wanting. Looking back at his infantile resolution to \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, he notes that his efforts to ingratiate himself with President Macron involved not negotiating the small print of an effective trade deal or cross-border security, but in suggesting a hydrogen-powered Concorde and a bridge across the Channel. Covid, meanwhile, saw him dwelling not on the strained infrastructure of public health but, inevitably, on his crammer\u2019s knowledge of the classics: \u201c\u2018Pericles died of the plague,\u2019 I had earlier reminded my old friend Michael Gove,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand his spectacles seemed to glitter at the thought, like the penguin in Wallace &amp; Gromit.\u201d His own life-threatening spell in ICU caused him briefly to \u201cwonder blackly\u2026 [if] it was some kind of cosmic judgment on me, on my whole worldview\u201d. That doubt doesn\u2019t survive his return to health. Rather than, say, attend Cobra meetings, his primary sentiment remains that \u201cI needed to bee-oing-oing back on to my feet like an India rubber ball\u2026 fixing the care homes, driving the quest for a cure\u2026\u201d Johnson is not a man made for regret, of course. He repeats a wild belief that he would have won the 2024 election had he not been removed from office by colleagues suffering a collective \u201cattack of the vapours\u201d. And he bangs on, inevitably, about his \u201cbig idea\u201d \u2013 levelling up \u2013 formed partly at Eton when he was confronted with the startling fact that hereditary toffs weren\u2019t necessarily the sharpest knives in the drawer. Countering this vaunted commitment to social mobility, of course, are the many occasions in which he proved himself the most enthusiastic promoter of cronyism. This, for example, is how he describes his appointment of Kate Bingham, \u201cwhom I had known since I was 18\u201d, to head up the vaccine taskforce. \u201cShe was one of a bevy of brilliant and energetic Paulinas (alumnae of St Paul\u2019s Girls\u2019 School) who went around Oxford in the mid-1980s, terrorising and breaking the hearts of their male counterparts. She had married an old school friend of mine, Jesse Norman, and she had also been at school with my sister, the ubiquitous Rachel\u2026 it was precisely because I knew her that I knew she was superabundantly qualified for the job.\u201d There is less to be said for Dido Harding, also a friend and the wife of a Tory MP, who was entrusted with spaffing \u00a337bn on the entirely ineffective test and trace \u201cmoonshot\u201d (in large part, it seems, because Johnson saw the potential for schoolboy jokes in the classical allusion of her Christian name). Just occasionally he stumbles on the truth. At one point he mentions a piece written 20 years ago, which foretold that \u201cthe Tories will never recover until Boris Johnson leaves the stage\u201d. You only have to glance at the current quartet of Conservative leadership candidates to see that his legacy \u2013 the hollowing out of principle and character in the party he led \u2013 is very much alive. And in this sense, you read this book with the growing nausea that its author still, despite everything, inevitably envisages a heroic sequel. \u2022 Unleashed by Boris Johnson is published by William Collins (\u00a330).

      "body": "<p>Rather than feeling the pain of loss, many of those who attended the Conservative party conference in Birmingham last week said they felt another overriding emotion in the aftermath of July\u2019s cataclysmic general election defeat: one of overwhelming relief.</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest it feels like a weight off my shoulders,\u201d said a senior MP who narrowly retained his seat. \u201cWe knew for two years we were going to lose, so it wasn\u2019t exactly a shock. Now I don\u2019t have to spend all my time answering emails from constituents complaining about all the dreadful mistakes we were making in government.\u201d</p> <p>As for the future, MPs and party members mostly agreed, in their serious private moments, that the Conservative party needed to bide its time.</p> <p>There was simply no point in rushing. Many seemed genuinely humbled. \u201cOn several of the most important issues where we messed<strong> </strong>up, like immigration, we will not have any right to be listened to for quite a long time,\u201d said one new entrant to the House of Commons.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to win back that right somehow over the next couple of years. We have to stand in the corner, show we have learned our lessons. And we need to come together and have a long hard think about where we go now.\u201d</p> <p>Overall, however, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the Tory conference was a deeply confused and conflicted affair.</p> <p>The show it put on for party members, the media and for public consumption was certainly not one of humility, unity, or deep, hard&nbsp;thinking.</p> <p>It was about picking a new leader in a hurry, allowing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/02/bad-jokes-war-stories-and-rehashed-rhetoric-key-takeaways-from-the-tory-leadership-speeches\">the four candidates vying to succeed Rishi Sunak</a> to promote what for the most part would be populist policies, while indulging and talking endlessly about leaders who had gone before.</p> <p>On day two, a key attraction was former leader and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/30/she-still-carries-an-aura-of-spectacular-failure-why-hasnt-liz-truss-gone-away\">prime minister of 49 disastrous days, Liz Truss</a>, who strode on to the stage beaming.</p> <p>Rather than repenting for sending financial markets into meltdown and mortgages skywards with her mini-budget,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/30/liz-truss-tories-would-have-done-better-in-uk-election-if-i-had-stayed-pm\"> she did the reverse</a>, saying the party would have done better at July\u2019s election if she had remained in charge.</p> <p>Another ghost stalking the corridors was Jacob Rees-Mogg, now working as a journalist, who posed for selfies with adoring party members whenever they asked.</p>    <p>There was much talk too of another leader who had imploded before Truss. Was Boris Johnson, who was about to publish his memoirs, plotting a comeback?</p> <p>Two former MPs who had both lost their seats to Labour chatted in a corridor on Monday about the prospect of a Johnson return. One thought he should go for it in a couple of years when a seat came vacant because he was \u201ca winner\u201d and his ex-constituents \u201cadored him\u201d.</p> <p>The other believed Johnson would be up for it, but was horrified at the thought. On one thing they did agree: that the new parliamentary party would be split down the middle over the idea.</p> <p>As for the candidates to succeed Sunak, who had appeared for a very brief address on Sunday and then left, they strutted around as if having already won their country\u2019s and party\u2019s enduring respect and&nbsp;adulation.</p> <p>Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister who has turned rightwards as fast as he has shed weight over recent months, revealed that his daughter\u2019s middle name was Thatcher, and said he hoped to revive the disastrous and costly Rwanda scheme for deporting immigrants, on which huge sums of public money have been wasted.</p> <p>Everywhere he went, Jenrick was accompanied by a group of heavies, darting their eyes around for anyone with possible malign intent against their man, as if he was leader of a global superpower rather than an ex-minister of a government that had just been thrown out by a furious electorate. MPs who do not support Jenrick sneered and mocked him with the nickname \u201cgeneric\u201d.</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch, the former business secretary, surrounded throughout by photographers as if it were the Oscars, seemed intent on causing the maximum stir while she had the chance, by questioning, among other things, whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/sep/29/maternity-pay-is-excessive-says-tory-leadership-hopeful-kemi-badenoch\">maternity pay was too generous</a> and the minimum wage was harming businesses. She duly got the attention \u2013 if not the headlines \u2013 she wanted. \u201cI just love Kemi,\u201d said one Tory member. \u201cShe just goes for it, says what she thinks,\u201d she added, apparently not remembering the Truss&nbsp;disaster.</p> <p>Tom Tugendhat, the former security minister, talked a lot about his days in the military and attacked Jenrick for having claimed, without any apparent evidence, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/01/tom-tugendhat-robert-jenrick-uk-special-forces-terrorists-tory-leadership\">Britain\u2019s special forces had killed rather than captured</a> terrorists because the country\u2019s human rights laws would not allow them to be detained. Drawing on his personal experience, Tugendhat said the comments showed \u201ca fundamental lack of awareness of military operations, the command chain, and the nature of the law in the armed forces\u201d. James Cleverly, the former home secretary and probably now the favourite to lead his party, having emphasised the need for it to become \u201cnormal\u201d, also tore into Jenrick. \u201cOur military do not murder people,\u201d Cleverly said.</p>    <p>And so it went on, often to the bemusement of the membership \u2013 believed to be about 150,000 these days \u2013 who will make their choice in a ballot, after MPs vote this week to reduce the four to two. The weight of responsibility sits heavily on their shoulders. In the last two such votes the members chose Johnson, then Truss. \u201cI hope to goodness they have learned something,\u201d said a former cabinet minister. \u201cSomehow I doubt it.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday morning two party members exchanged views on what they had heard thus far from the potential leaders. \u201cGod knows really, I mean they all have drawbacks don\u2019t they? Kemi, well she has a bit of magic but she is clearly a risk,\u201d said one of them. His friend thought Jenrick was \u201cprofessional\u201d but wasn\u2019t quite sure about him. \u201cAnd Tugendhat, he\u2019s OK but I do wish he would stop going on about the military. It is as bad as bloody Starmer and his father being a toolmaker. Cleverly, he seems a good bloke, but I just wonder if being a good bloke is enough really.\u201d</p> <p>Enough for what was another of the many questions on Conservatives\u2019 minds. Before the conference a large number of senior Tory figures had decided to give the event a miss, partly because they did not believe that whoever the membership finally chose from the final two would be able to unite the party, and lead it into the next election. He or she would be a caretaker in effect. Their view was that the victor had a couple of years, perhaps three at most, before being tipped overboard, and that the prospects of victory at the next election were close to zero.</p> <p>If there was cause for hope in Birmingham, however, it was that Labour\u2019s recent difficulties may offer the Tories more encouragement than they believed was possible just a few weeks ago.</p> <p>Alan Duncan, a former foreign office minister, who stayed away from Birmingham but watched the event closely, said the clear winner was Cleverly, who exuded \u201can air of decency and confidence\u201d. But he added that unfortunately \u201cnone of the candidates covered many of the issues, such as poverty, social deprivation, economic management, health, and foreign policy which the party must grasp if it is to recover.\u201d</p> <p>This was alarming because the Tories needed to get real for their own sake and the country\u2019s. \u201cThe UK is at a dangerous moment,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have a Labour party which has just won a massive majority, with a low vote share, which is already nosediving to terrible approval ratings. The Conservative party is on its knees, but its potential leaders have preferred shallow soundbites to meaningful discussion of what went wrong, and what their vision is. Short-termism will not restore faith in democratic politics.\u201d</p>    <p>With Labour already struggling, some senior Tories \u2013 including figures in the shadow cabinet \u2013 are coming around to the view that, such is the nature of modern politics, the public might possibly still turn back to a reformed and sensible middle-ground Tory party sooner than anticipated because of the speed with which voters now change their minds. If that does not happen, and Labour continues on the slide, they fear the beneficiaries could be Nigel Farage and Reform UK.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in an era where support can form and break up very quickly \u2013 this is sandcastle politics,\u201d said a shadow cabinet member. \u201cBased on that, Labour is in a very precarious&nbsp;position.\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks Keir Starmer\u2019s ratings have nosedived as a result of controversy over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/02/keir-starmer-pays-back-6000-worth-of-gifts-and-hospitality\">numerous \u201cfreebies\u201d</a> which he and his ministers have accepted. And this after they had campaigned on promises to be different from the Conservatives and run a \u201cgovernment of service\u201d.</p> <p>When parliament returns on Monday, both of the main parties enter a vital few weeks. Starmer will attempt to get his premiership back on course, first with the publication of a major bill on Thursday on employment rights. Then on 14 October the PM will convene a large investment summit at which the focus will be on how his party can revive public services at a time when money is in very short supply. On 30 October Rachel Reeves will deliver her first budget as chancellor, before the Tories announce their new leader on 2 November.</p> <p>The latest Opinium suggests Cleverly had the best of at the Conservative conference with his \u201cacceptability\u201d rating improving among the British public. Badenoch took the biggest knock. Half (49%) of 2019 Conservative voters say Cleverly would be an acceptable leader of the Conservative party, with 41% saying the same of Jenrick, 40% of Tom Tugendhat and 37% of Badenoch.</p> <p>But talk of the party moving on under a new leader was somewhat undermined on Saturday when its chair, Richard Fuller, said the Tories should never have forced out Boris Johnson at the height of the Partygate scandal.</p> <p>Speaking to GB News, Fuller said: \u201cRemoving Boris Johnson, whatever one might have thought about what went on or didn\u2019t go on at the time, was a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cMy personal view was also getting rid of someone who\u2019d just won the general election was probably not going to end well, whatever happened.\u201d</p> <p>While some Tories now believe a new leader may at least make them competitive against a struggling Labour government, their own party clearly has a long way to go before it comes to terms with its recent past.</p>",

On day two, a key attraction was former leader and prime minister of 49 disastrous days, Liz Truss, who strode on to the stage beaming. Rather than repenting for sending financial markets into meltdown and mortgages skywards with her mini-budget, she did the reverse, saying the party would have done better at July\u2019s election if she had remained in charge. Another ghost stalking the corridors was Jacob Rees-Mogg, now working as a journalist, who posed for selfies with adoring party members whenever they asked. There was much talk too of another leader who had imploded before Truss. Was Boris Johnson, who was about to publish his memoirs, plotting a comeback? Two former MPs who had both lost their seats to Labour chatted in a corridor on Monday about the prospect of a Johnson return. One thought he should go for it in a couple of years when a seat came vacant because he was \u201ca winner\u201d and his ex-constituents \u201cadored him\u201d. The other believed Johnson would be up for it, but was horrified at the thought. On one thing they did agree: that the new parliamentary party would be split down the middle over the idea. As for the candidates to succeed Sunak, who had appeared for a very brief address on Sunday and then left, they strutted around as if having already won their country\u2019s and party\u2019s enduring respect and adulation. Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister who has turned rightwards as fast as he has shed weight over recent months, revealed that his daughter\u2019s middle name was Thatcher, and said he hoped to revive the disastrous and costly Rwanda scheme for deporting immigrants, on which huge sums of public money have been wasted. Everywhere he went, Jenrick was accompanied by a group of heavies, darting their eyes around for anyone with possible malign intent against their man, as if he was leader of a global superpower rather than an ex-minister of a government that had just been thrown out by a furious electorate. MPs who do not support Jenrick sneered and mocked him with the nickname \u201cgeneric\u201d. Kemi Badenoch, the former business secretary, surrounded throughout by photographers as if it were the Oscars, seemed intent on causing the maximum stir while she had the chance, by questioning, among other things, whether maternity pay was too generous and the minimum wage was harming businesses. She duly got the attention \u2013 if not the headlines \u2013 she wanted. \u201cI just love Kemi,\u201d said one Tory member. \u201cShe just goes for it, says what she thinks,\u201d she added, apparently not remembering the Truss disaster. Tom Tugendhat, the former security minister, talked a lot about his days in the military and attacked Jenrick for having claimed, without any apparent evidence, that Britain\u2019s special forces had killed rather than captured terrorists because the country\u2019s human rights laws would not allow them to be detained. Drawing on his personal experience, Tugendhat said the comments showed \u201ca fundamental lack of awareness of military operations, the command chain, and the nature of the law in the armed forces\u201d. James Cleverly, the former home secretary and probably now the favourite to lead his party, having emphasised the need for it to become \u201cnormal\u201d, also tore into Jenrick. \u201cOur military do not murder people,\u201d Cleverly said. And so it went on, often to the bemusement of the membership \u2013 believed to be about 150,000 these days \u2013 who will make their choice in a ballot, after MPs vote this week to reduce the four to two. The weight of responsibility sits heavily on their shoulders. In the last two such votes the members chose Johnson, then Truss. \u201cI hope to goodness they have learned something,\u201d said a former cabinet minister. \u201cSomehow I doubt it.\u201d On Tuesday morning two party members exchanged views on what they had heard thus far from the potential leaders. \u201cGod knows really, I mean they all have drawbacks don\u2019t they? Kemi, well she has a bit of magic but she is clearly a risk,\u201d said one of them. His friend thought Jenrick was \u201cprofessional\u201d but wasn\u2019t quite sure about him. \u201cAnd Tugendhat, he\u2019s OK but I do wish he would stop going on about the military. It is as bad as bloody Starmer and his father being a toolmaker. Cleverly, he seems a good bloke, but I just wonder if being a good bloke is enough really.\u201d Enough for what was another of the many questions on Conservatives\u2019 minds. Before the conference a large number of senior Tory figures had decided to give the event a miss, partly because they did not believe that whoever the membership finally chose from the final two would be able to unite the party, and lead it into the next election. He or she would be a caretaker in effect. Their view was that the victor had a couple of years, perhaps three at most, before being tipped overboard, and that the prospects of victory at the next election were close to zero. If there was cause for hope in Birmingham, however, it was that Labour\u2019s recent difficulties may offer the Tories more encouragement than they believed was possible just a few weeks ago. Alan Duncan, a former foreign office minister, who stayed away from Birmingham but watched the event closely, said the clear winner was Cleverly, who exuded \u201can air of decency and confidence\u201d. But he added that unfortunately \u201cnone of the candidates covered many of the issues, such as poverty, social deprivation, economic management, health, and foreign policy which the party must grasp if it is to recover.\u201d This was alarming because the Tories needed to get real for their own sake and the country\u2019s. \u201cThe UK is at a dangerous moment,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have a Labour party which has just won a massive majority, with a low vote share, which is already nosediving to terrible approval ratings. The Conservative party is on its knees, but its potential leaders have preferred shallow soundbites to meaningful discussion of what went wrong, and what their vision is. Short-termism will not restore faith in democratic politics.\u201d With Labour already struggling, some senior Tories \u2013 including figures in the shadow cabinet \u2013 are coming around to the view that, such is the nature of modern politics, the public might possibly still turn back to a reformed and sensible middle-ground Tory party sooner than anticipated because of the speed with which voters now change their minds. If that does not happen, and Labour continues on the slide, they fear the beneficiaries could be Nigel Farage and Reform UK. \u201cWe\u2019re in an era where support can form and break up very quickly \u2013 this is sandcastle politics,\u201d said a shadow cabinet member. \u201cBased on that, Labour is in a very precarious position.\u201d In recent weeks Keir Starmer\u2019s ratings have nosedived as a result of controversy over numerous \u201cfreebies\u201d which he and his ministers have accepted. And this after they had campaigned on promises to be different from the Conservatives and run a \u201cgovernment of service\u201d. When parliament returns on Monday, both of the main parties enter a vital few weeks. Starmer will attempt to get his premiership back on course, first with the publication of a major bill on Thursday on employment rights. Then on 14 October the PM will convene a large investment summit at which the focus will be on how his party can revive public services at a time when money is in very short supply. On 30 October Rachel Reeves will deliver her first budget as chancellor, before the Tories announce their new leader on 2 November. The latest Opinium suggests Cleverly had the best of at the Conservative conference with his \u201cacceptability\u201d rating improving among the British public. Badenoch took the biggest knock. Half (49%) of 2019 Conservative voters say Cleverly would be an acceptable leader of the Conservative party, with 41% saying the same of Jenrick, 40% of Tom Tugendhat and 37% of Badenoch. But talk of the party moving on under a new leader was somewhat undermined on Saturday when its chair, Richard Fuller, said the Tories should never have forced out Boris Johnson at the height of the Partygate scandal. Speaking to GB News, Fuller said: \u201cRemoving Boris Johnson, whatever one might have thought about what went on or didn\u2019t go on at the time, was a mistake.\u201d He added: \u201cMy personal view was also getting rid of someone who\u2019d just won the general election was probably not going to end well, whatever happened.\u201d While some Tories now believe a new leader may at least make them competitive against a struggling Labour government, their own party clearly has a long way to go before it comes to terms with its recent past.",

Beds fill the section normally used for bottle service, and piles of blankets are piled high on tables around the dancefloor. Outside the guest entrance to the hulking venue is a family who fled rural southern Lebanon camps. Now their goat is chewing leaves from a tree branch that supports a washing line and a makeshift kitchen. Ali Ahmed sits outside the backstage entrance with 11 members of his family, smiling when he talks about the warm welcome they received at Beirut\u2019s best-known nightclub, one he\u2019d only ever heard about before on local television. His expression grows darker when he describes fleeing Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs last week amid a fierce Israeli bombing campaign. The family slept in the open in the capital\u2019s Martyr\u2019s Square, he says, describing their first night in the shadow of the imposing cobalt blue domes of the Mohammed al-Amin mosque. \u201cThe mosque kept its doors closed.

Ahmed considers his family lucky \u2013 not only were they able to claim a spot in the club\u2019s VIP area but staying at the nightclub has meant food delivery, clean bathrooms and privacy that those in many of Lebanon\u2019s makeshift shelters lack. Some 400 people displaced by Israeli bombardments across southern Lebanon and the Dahiyeh suburb of Beirut are currently sheltering inside Skybar, which until recently welcomed guests to sip champagne on the top floor with a view of the Mediterranean and then party until the early hours in the Skin club below. The families sleeping on the black-and-white floor of the club entrance, around the mirrored bars and beneath the plush black upholstered balconies of the nightclub are just some of the 1.2 million people now displaced in Lebanon. UN officials said late last week that almost 900 shelters set up by the government were full. Staff at the nightclub, who are now coordinating its day-to-day operations as a shelter, said that the owner of the venue was moved to open it up after seeing displaced families sleeping on the streets outside. In less than two weeks, the country of just 5 million people has witnessed a mass displacement crisis, mounting Israeli airstrikes and a troop invasion in its south. More than 1,000 people were killed over 10 days in late September and hundreds more in the period since as Israeli forces repeatedly struck a swathe of Beirut\u2019s suburbs and southern Lebanon. Whole communities have fled to the mountains around the capital while those with the necessary means have crammed on to the dwindling numbers of flights leaving Beirut airport on the lone national airline still running. At least one plane from the Lebanese national carrier was seen landing at the airport as fierce Israeli bombardments struck nearby last week, sending columns of smoke and fire into the air over southern Beirut. Israel\u2019s battle against Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s most powerful proxy, began when the group declared its support for Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel in October last year. After months of Hezbollah launching rocket salvoes into Israeli territory and Israel responding with airstrikes deep into Lebanese territory, recent weeks have seen a dramatic escalation, including the assassination of Hezbollah\u2019s long-time leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in a subterranean bunker under Dahiyeh. Every night last week, Israeli forces pummelled the area and issued mass evacuation orders for much of southern Lebanon in what they say is an effort to target members of Hezbollah or infrastructure employed by the group. A particularly powerful wave of airstrikes on Dahiyeh late in the week shook the ground across southern Beirut, reportedly targeting Nasrallah\u2019s potential successor Hashem Safieddine. Israeli forces also launched a ground invasion of southern Lebanon, sparking fierce fighting that has so far seen at least eight Israeli soldiers killed in battles that Hezbollah and its supporters said would provide their strongest chance of a decisive victory against their oldest enemy. \u201cYou have won a few rounds through your air raids and assassinations, but the war continues, and we will prevail,\u201d Hezbollah spokesperson Mohammad Afif declared, addressing Israeli forces during a media tour of the destruction in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Entire neighbourhoods were deserted, the few signs of life being the young men on motorbikes carrying posters of Nasrallah, which were also affixed to the towering and sometimes smouldering piles of rubble from Israeli airstrikes. Those now sheltering at the nightclub are pinning their hopes on a Hezbollah victory in southern Lebanon as a way for them to eventually return to their homes. Nada Hammoud, a teacher who fled strikes on the Chiyah neighbourhood of southern Beirut for a bed on the edge of the dancefloor at Skin, says she is hopeful that the war will be quick, maybe lasting even less than a week. Others say they are prepared to spend a year living at the club if necessary to help clinch a victory on Lebanon\u2019s southern border. \u201cThis country doesn\u2019t deserve this. But we support Hezbollah \u2013 they will win this. This is our country, our land: there is no place for Israel in the south,\u201d says Hammoud. Lebanon\u2019s underfunded and often highly constrained military, she adds, \u201cisn\u2019t allowed to carry a single bullet, so we need Hezbollah\u201d. As Lebanon struggles to weather a displacement crisis, the fighting between Israel and Tehran\u2019s proxies that has upended relations across the surrounding region now threatens to grow into an increasingly direct conflict with Iran. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly weighing a response to the salvo of 180 ballistic missiles that rained down over Israeli territory last week in response to Nasrallah\u2019s killing. In a visit to Beirut to meet the caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati \u2013 and the increasingly powerful speaker of parliament, Nabih Berri of the Shia Amal movement \u2013 the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said that Tehran still backed a ceasefire \u2013 provided that it occurred simultaneously with a halt to fighting in Gaza. Any ceasefire, he added, must also be accepted by Hezbollah. \u201cWe support efforts for a ceasefire, provided that, first, the rights of the Lebanese people are respected and it is accepted by the resistance,\u201d he said, in reference to the group. The promise of a Hezbollah victory is not lost on Ahmed and his family either. \u201cWe are powerful and we are winning,\u201d he says cheerfully, sitting next to his elderly mother who chimes in to share her support for the group. For now, Ahmed and 10 members of his family are enjoying their position in the VIP area of the nightclub, a place that normally requires a crisp $100 bill to enter, and where people often make even pricier bids for a table. They were only the second family to enter the nightclub, he explained, so they were able to pick a prime spot. \u201cYou\u2019re behind the DJ booth!\u201d bouncer Mohammed Ali tells him, laughing as he opens the black backstage door for some children who want to run into the outdoor area and play. Ali, more used to working the night shift and dealing with rowdy partygoers, says he takes pride in making sure everyone inside the nightclub was being given three meals a day and medical care if they need it. \u201cBe careful, don\u2019t rush,\u201d he gently tells the three children as they clamour at his legs while pushing through the nightclub door.",

It\u2019s a moment to remember those Israelis, mostly civilians, who were brutally tortured, sexually abused and murdered. It\u2019s a time to imagine, if possible, the agony endured by the hostages\u2019 relatives. Many have since lost their loved ones. About 100 hostages remain unaccounted for. It\u2019s a moment to reflect on \u2013 and unreservedly condemn \u2013 the unfathomable hatred that led the young Palestinian men of Gaza to perpetrate such appalling, inhuman acts.</p> <p>The anniversary is also an opportunity to examine the response to the massacre of Israel\u2019s government and people, and of Israel\u2019s friends and enemies. The country\u2019s prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/how-netanyahu-weathered-the-storm-in-the-year-since-hamas-attacked\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, was accused of presiding over an unprecedented security failure. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and intelligence agencies also faced harsh criticism. Netanyahu, urged on by his far-right coalition partners and fearing for his job, decided only blood could pay for blood. He vowed, unrealistically, to destroy Hamas. From that decision, many more massacres flowed.</p> <p>The ensuing IDF <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/10/right-now-it-is-one-day-at-a-time-life-on-israels-frontline-with-gaza\">invasion of Gaza</a> has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, including at least 16,000 children. Almost the entire population of the territory is displaced. The basic necessities \u2013 food, clean water, shelter, medicines \u2013 are in desperately short supply. Generations of young people, those who survive, are traumatised or maimed. Netanyahu and the IDF stand accused of war crimes and Israel of genocide. And yet, while Hamas has suffered eviscerating defeats, it has not been destroyed. Netanyahu\u2019s basic aim remains unfulfilled. There is still no ceasefire.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Having been terribly wronged, having gained the world\u2019s sympathy, Israel now consistently puts itself in the wrong</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Israel\u2019s ever-vengeful, flailing government has now turned its attention to Lebanon, from where Iran-backed Hezbollah has bombarded northern Israel since 7&nbsp;October. Hezbollah\u2019s missiles have displaced thousands. It is entirely reasonable to want to stop them, and action to do so has strong public support. When Israel assassinated Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah\u2019s chief, the country celebrated. Yet once again, Israel\u2019s leaders are over-reaching. Their \u201climited\u201d military incursion is expanding rapidly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/05/blasts-shake-beiruts-southern-suburbs-as-israeli-military-urges-evacuations\">Beirut is under daily fire</a>. <a href=\"https://prezly.msf.org.uk/lebanon-israels-bombardment-causes-unprecedented-mass-displacement-of-people-urgent-humanitarian-needs\">Nearly 1,300 Lebanese</a>, mostly civilians, have died. Forced evacuations, creating wastelands, have <a href=\"https://x.com/ABCNewsLive/status/1841557750997803220\">displaced 1.2 million people</a>. Yet the IDF admits it cannot stop Hezbollah\u2019s rocket fire or say when Israeli residents will return to their homes \u2013 ostensibly the operation\u2019s main aim.</p> <p>Having been terribly wronged, having gained the world\u2019s sympathy, Israel consistently puts itself in the wrong. Its government faces fierce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2024/oct/04/israel-told-not-alone-but-year-war-isolated\">global censure</a>, as seen at the UN general assembly last month. Friends in the UK and Europe are shocked and alienated. Relations with the US, Israel\u2019s main ally and weapons supplier, are at a historical low. Its economy is suffering badly. Antisemitism is on the rise internationally.

It\u2019s true that any democratic government would struggle to eliminate the threats encircling Israel. It\u2019s true that Hamas had to be punished severely and forcibly dislodged from its perch in Gaza. It\u2019s true that Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is urging Islamist jihadist groups to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/04/iran-ali-khamenei-hezbollah-hamas-lebanon-gaza-israel\">redouble attacks on the Jewish state</a>. But it is also true that, while Israel has a fundamental right to defend itself, it does not have a right to do so over the bodies of thousands of civilians in blatant <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/03/19/israeli-forces-conduct-gaza\">contravention of international humanitarian law</a>.</p> <p>No one can argue that the Arab-Israeli conflict (which non-Arab Iran exploits for its own purposes) is anything new. It dates from Israel\u2019s independence in 1948, and its roots go back further still.

      "bodyText": "Tomorrow\u2019s first anniversary of the 7 October Hamas terror attacks on southern Israel in which more than 1,200 people were killed and about 250 taken hostage is a grim milestone. It\u2019s a moment to remember those Israelis, mostly civilians, who were brutally tortured, sexually abused and murdered. It\u2019s a time to imagine, if possible, the agony endured by the hostages\u2019 relatives. Many have since lost their loved ones. About 100 hostages remain unaccounted for. It\u2019s a moment to reflect on \u2013 and unreservedly condemn \u2013 the unfathomable hatred that led the young Palestinian men of Gaza to perpetrate such appalling, inhuman acts. The anniversary is also an opportunity to examine the response to the massacre of Israel\u2019s government and people, and of Israel\u2019s friends and enemies. The country\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was accused of presiding over an unprecedented security failure. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and intelligence agencies also faced harsh criticism. Netanyahu, urged on by his far-right coalition partners and fearing for his job, decided only blood could pay for blood. He vowed, unrealistically, to destroy Hamas. From that decision, many more massacres flowed. The ensuing IDF invasion of Gaza has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, including at least 16,000 children. Almost the entire population of the territory is displaced. The basic necessities \u2013 food, clean water, shelter, medicines \u2013 are in desperately short supply. Generations of young people, those who survive, are traumatised or maimed. Netanyahu and the IDF stand accused of war crimes and Israel of genocide. And yet, while Hamas has suffered eviscerating defeats, it has not been destroyed. Netanyahu\u2019s basic aim remains unfulfilled. There is still no ceasefire. Israel\u2019s ever-vengeful, flailing government has now turned its attention to Lebanon, from where Iran-backed Hezbollah has bombarded northern Israel since 7 October. Hezbollah\u2019s missiles have displaced thousands. It is entirely reasonable to want to stop them, and action to do so has strong public support. When Israel assassinated Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah\u2019s chief, the country celebrated. Yet once again, Israel\u2019s leaders are over-reaching. Their \u201climited\u201d military incursion is expanding rapidly. Beirut is under daily fire. Nearly 1,300 Lebanese, mostly civilians, have died. Forced evacuations, creating wastelands, have displaced 1.2 million people. Yet the IDF admits it cannot stop Hezbollah\u2019s rocket fire or say when Israeli residents will return to their homes \u2013 ostensibly the operation\u2019s main aim. Having been terribly wronged, having gained the world\u2019s sympathy, Israel consistently puts itself in the wrong. Its government faces fierce global censure, as seen at the UN general assembly last month. Friends in the UK and Europe are shocked and alienated. Relations with the US, Israel\u2019s main ally and weapons supplier, are at a historical low. Its economy is suffering badly. Antisemitism is on the rise internationally. One year on, Israel is less secure, its people are less safe, it is taking casualties \u2013 and now a potentially catastrophic war looms with Iran. Confronted by all this, Israelis ask, reasonably enough: what would you do? It\u2019s true that any democratic government would struggle to eliminate the threats encircling Israel. It\u2019s true that Hamas had to be punished severely and forcibly dislodged from its perch in Gaza. It\u2019s true that Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is urging Islamist jihadist groups to redouble attacks on the Jewish state. But it is also true that, while Israel has a fundamental right to defend itself, it does not have a right to do so over the bodies of thousands of civilians in blatant contravention of international humanitarian law. No one can argue that the Arab-Israeli conflict (which non-Arab Iran exploits for its own purposes) is anything new.

It participated in the fight against fascism and nazism during the Second World War and in peacekeeping missions in the Congo, Lebanon and the Comoros, helping African and Arab countries build their armies after independence. The RSF (the former notorious Janjaweed) is a terrorist militia, comprising essentially foreign mercenaries. The international community should stop regional sponsors of the militia, who supply it with sophisticated weapons and mercenaries to fuel the war, and enforce the Jeddah declaration of 11 May 2023, which commits to protect the civilians of Sudan. Babikir Elamin, head of mission Embassy of the Republic of Sudan, London SW1 The bright side of life Billy Connolly\u2019s constructive attitude to death is inspiring (\u201c\u2018Jesus Christ, is that the time already?\u2019 Billy Connolly on death, despair and his new book of drawings\u201d). I\u2019ve not suffered from cancer or Parkinson\u2019s disease, let alone housemaid\u2019s knee, so, at 84, I look forward to several more years yet of music-making and writing. Animals don\u2019t laugh. But we humans can chortle at all the nuisances and inconveniences that illness might bring. Life without them would be dull. Meirion Bowen London N10 Right, then\u2026 Kenan Malik, on liberal conservatism (\u201cCan liberal conservatism survive the remaking of the right? We\u2019ll soon find out\u201d), may have misunderstood a recent piece of mine on the topic in the Financial Times. The piece did not \u201clament\u201d (his verb) but described without judgment the flight of liberal conservatives, here and elsewhere, to an illiberal, hard right. I stressed that the collapse of the liberal right was nothing new. Conservatism has always had a hard right and a liberal right. They are fraternal enemies, forever at war with each other, yet ready also to set aside differences to do what the right in modern democracies has shown itself remarkably successful at \u2013 winning elections and holding power. Malik faults me for exaggerating the right\u2019s internal contradictions. Yet I described it as a circus rider circling the ring with one foot on a pony \u201cCapitalism\u201d and another on a pony called \u201cTradition\u201d. Is that not to say what he is saying \u2013 that the line between liberal and illiberal conservatism is, in his words, \u201cmore blurred than many assume\u201d? Edmund Fawcett London SW5 Another fine mess William Keegan referred to the key roles of two Old Etonian prime ministers, David Cameron and Boris Johnson, in inflicting Brexit on us (\u201cIn my view\u201d). The piece brought to mind the tale, possibly apocryphal, of the restaurateur who changed the name of one of the desserts on his menu from Eton Mess to Brexit Pudding. Mike Pender Cardiff",

Hot dogs \u00a319-\u00a322, desserts \u00a312, wines from \u00a350</strong></p> <p>It is fitting that the Harrods Dining Hall, home to Hot Dogs by Three Darlings, which I visited before the recent re-emergence of the shocking allegations against its previous owner, is reached via the store\u2019s luxury accessories department. Because, like the concessions belonging to Givenchy and Loro Piana standing sentry either side of the doorway, the counter sells things that absolutely no one needs. There, sadly, the similarity must end. For while we might blanch at the price of a Givenchy handbag, we can at least admire the craftwork required to produce one. Nobody in possession of their right wits could admire the work that has gone into these dainty \u201cgourmet\u201d hot dogs, costing up to \u00a322 a pop. Few should want them.</p> <p>The problem begins with the premise. Just as terms like \u201cethical banking\u201d and \u201ccivilised Martini hour\u201d suggest someone is doing it all wrong, the idea of the fancy hot dog misses the point. If you have ever eaten a classic hot dog, say off a Manhattan street cart, you will understand the principles. It shouldn\u2019t feel like an act of self-care. It should be an indulgence. And it most definitely is not just some gnarly sausage in a bun. It is a smoked wiener or frankfurter. The casing should have a light snap beneath the teeth that immediately releases a burst of hot, savoury juices. According to the hot dog maven Owen Barratt, formerly of the much-missed Monty\u2019s Deli, the meat needs to be emulsified to a dense smoothness. It should have heft.</p>    <p>It can be beef or pork, but the bun should be soft and it should be sweet against the salty, smokiness of the dog. These things are key. If they are not in place, any glitzy toppings become irrelevant. It\u2019s like pointing out that a hardened criminal goes to church on Sundays. Who cares? If you offer me a hot dog and it isn\u2019t these things, it is all of my Christmases, cancelled. In the ornately tiled, dimly lit Harrods Dining Hall, the otherwise esteemed chef Jason Atherton has well and truly cancelled my Christmas.</p> <p>There are five \u201chot dogs\u201d on offer, costing between \u00a319 and \u00a322. Have them all for \u00a385. Or then again, don\u2019t. Much is made of the bespoke nature of the grind. The \u201coriginal\u201d, for example, is \u201c80% free range gilt pork shoulder, 10% Iberico pork, 10% chorizo sausage\u201d. The North African-inspired \u201cSouk dog\u201d is made with various cuts of lamb. Each month, there\u2019s a celebrity-endorsed offering. Currently, it\u2019s the Battersea Banger, courtesy of the model David Gandy, though I doubt he secured those cheekbones by going face-down in anybody\u2019s hot dog concession. There\u2019s a slightly worrying image of a Dalmatian next to the menu listing. It turns out that \u00a32 from the \u00a322 price tag goes to <a href=\"https://www.battersea.org.uk/\">Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home</a>, so there\u2019s that. It\u2019s actually made with beef. All of these have a weird, rough, grainy and very dry texture. The casing is wrinkled and hangs off them like an oversized old sock. Perhaps they\u2019ve failed to emulsify the meat. Or they did, but then overheated the dogs in the hot water baths in which they are held in front of us, so the filling has split, before finishing them in some underpowered device beneath the counter. The buns are dense and claggy and undersweetened.</p>    <p>All this means the artful scribbles of mayo and ketchup, the dollops of caramelised onions and scrapings of cheese become an irrelevance. There is a smear of a good <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/sep/25/how-to-make-perfect-baba-ganoush\">baba ganoush</a> under the souk dog and you do get a hit of truffle with Gandy\u2019s offering. But when the key ingredient is so poor, who cares? The online menu promised chips, but Harrods won\u2019t let them have a deep fat fryer and apparently an air fryer didn\u2019t work. So instead, there are tater tots for \u00a37.50, which do have the authentic \u201cmum\u2019s been to Iceland\u201d crunch. Mac and cheese is underseasoned. Let\u2019s hear it then for the sweet salty spiced corn ribs, the best thing on offer here.</p> <p>Atherton is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/jul/10/foodanddrink.shopping3\">gifted chef</a>. I raved about his cooking at a restaurant called L\u2019Anis in my first year in this job. We featured him as a rising star back in 2002. But since then, he seems to have displayed an odd blind spot with detail. Pull up a stool at the circular counter, surrounded by the clatter on one side from Tom Kerridge\u2019s <a href=\"https://tomkerridge.com/restaurants/kerridges-fish-and-chips-at-harrods/\">fish and chip operation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.harrods.com/en-gb/restaurants/the-grill?srsltid=AfmBOorSDuY0Y6UJ2C1RjPX1AKPmfNU7Q-S4s0HnlHJhxWVKfgY5nurU\">The Grill</a> on the other. You\u2019ll find a moist towel waiting for you. It\u2019s fridge cold. But don\u2019t worry. The sparkling water will be warm. (\u201cShall I bring you some ice?\u201d the server says, as he sees me press my knuckles sadly to the glass. Yes, that would be nice.) The wine list offers two of each colour. The cheapest white is a Picpoul at \u00a350 a bottle. It\u2019s available online for \u00a39.79. That\u2019s a mark-up by a factor of five. Or there\u2019s a Sancerre at \u00a3120 a bottle, which you can buy for \u00a325. The Three Darlings menu online offered one bargain: Mo\u00ebt et Chandon champagne at \u00a370 a bottle, as against its retail price of \u00a335. Except when I got there it was \u00a3105 a bottle. Since then, they\u2019ve dropped it again to \u00a380 a bottle. Who knows what it will cost if you go.</p>    <p>Online, before my visit, an ice-cream sundae was \u00a39. Now it\u2019s \u00a312. Well, of course it is. It\u2019s advertised as a \u201cS\u2019more\u201d sundae. A S\u2019more is a big fat square of marshmallow toasted until brown and bubbling, then squidged between graham crackers with a slab of chocolate. We watch as the server gets out a meagre handful of tiny marshmallows like mini dental swabs, sparks up a blow torch for a few seconds until most are barely warm, then chucks them into a coupe with scoops of ice-cream, a mini flake and one of those ice-cream van fan wafers. It is the words \u201ccan\u2019t be bothered\u201d fashioned out of sugar and cream.</p>    <p>My companion lived for a while in New York. She\u2019s a veteran of Nathan\u2019s hot dogs at Yankee Stadium and of garden bonfire-made S\u2019mores in Brooklyn. And she\u2019s finally had enough of all this. She insists on buying us glasses of overpriced champagne, so we at least get one thing that\u2019s reliable out of the experience. This operation is a spin-off from a bistro Atherton is yet to open in Chelsea, which will be called Three Darlings, in celebration of his daughters. That\u2019s a lovely gesture. It\u2019s certainly lovelier than this clumsy, overpriced venture. Some might ask what I expected of Harrods. It\u2019s a fair point. Perhaps I should have managed my expectations.</p> <h2><strong>News bites</strong></h2> <p>The London Shell Co, famous for its two restaurants run on barges moored in London\u2019s Paddington Basin, has announced it is coming ashore.

      "bodyText": "Hot Dogs by Three Darlings, Dining Hall, Harrods, 87-135 Brompton Road, London SW1X 7XL (0207 225 6800). Hot dogs \u00a319-\u00a322, desserts \u00a312, wines from \u00a350 It is fitting that the Harrods Dining Hall, home to Hot Dogs by Three Darlings, which I visited before the recent re-emergence of the shocking allegations against its previous owner, is reached via the store\u2019s luxury accessories department. Because, like the concessions belonging to Givenchy and Loro Piana standing sentry either side of the doorway, the counter sells things that absolutely no one needs. There, sadly, the similarity must end. For while we might blanch at the price of a Givenchy handbag, we can at least admire the craftwork required to produce one. Nobody in possession of their right wits could admire the work that has gone into these dainty \u201cgourmet\u201d hot dogs, costing up to \u00a322 a pop. Few should want them. The problem begins with the premise. Just as terms like \u201cethical banking\u201d and \u201ccivilised Martini hour\u201d suggest someone is doing it all wrong, the idea of the fancy hot dog misses the point. If you have ever eaten a classic hot dog, say off a Manhattan street cart, you will understand the principles. It shouldn\u2019t feel like an act of self-care. It should be an indulgence. And it most definitely is not just some gnarly sausage in a bun. It is a smoked wiener or frankfurter. The casing should have a light snap beneath the teeth that immediately releases a burst of hot, savoury juices. According to the hot dog maven Owen Barratt, formerly of the much-missed Monty\u2019s Deli, the meat needs to be emulsified to a dense smoothness. It should have heft. It can be beef or pork, but the bun should be soft and it should be sweet against the salty, smokiness of the dog. These things are key. If they are not in place, any glitzy toppings become irrelevant. It\u2019s like pointing out that a hardened criminal goes to church on Sundays. Who cares? If you offer me a hot dog and it isn\u2019t these things, it is all of my Christmases, cancelled. In the ornately tiled, dimly lit Harrods Dining Hall, the otherwise esteemed chef Jason Atherton has well and truly cancelled my Christmas.

      "body": "<p><em><strong>The question </strong>I feel I am unable to give 100% to anything. When I say anything, I mean my business, friendships, parenting, my relationship or any other task that is given to me or taken on by me. I don\u2019t feel the urge to put in enough effort. It seems I\u2019m fine about losing people, business, money or anything (so long as it doesn\u2019t leave me destitute). I do fear a bit when things are just about to go, but then somehow it turns out OK. I don\u2019t feel close to my parents. I make most decisions based on what needs to be done, rather than what I feel like doing.</em></p> <p><em>I somehow don\u2019t make the decision to sell up my business, because it just goes on. I take a huge amount of time in making decisions. I am always in two minds. I fear what the decision could turn out to be. I eventually take a decision when time has almost run out.</em></p> <p><em>I am married and have a young daughter. My marriage is a struggle as my wife feels I don\u2019t take enough responsibility. What should I do?</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa\u2019s answer </strong></em>From now on, please drop 100% as a goal. Let\u2019s go for 70%. Perfectionism is stifling and paralysing and the enemy of creativity and connection.</p> <p>You wrote to me from your work email, so I searched your business. Wow! Looks like a great enterprise, you\u2019ve got at least six branches in three different cities. And it\u2019s fantastic that \u201cit just goes on\u201d \u2013 that your own business seems to run itself is what most entrepreneurs dream of. I\u2019m guessing you have got high standards and that you were brought up in a culture of perfectionism, but I\u2019m not sure that this 100% thing suits you.</p> <p>When I was studying a branch of psychotherapy called Gestalt, we were taught to look out for the red flag that is a \u201cshould\u201d. I think you\u2019ve got a massive \u201cshould\u201d going on about always giving your all. It\u2019s time for you to question this because it sounds as if this \u201cshould\u201d, rather than helping you progress through life, is only firing up your inner rebel, who is replying to the \u201cshould\u201d with a \u201cno\u201d.</p> <p>The trouble is, when we disconnect, because we are burning out and we are unaware about what we want to disconnect from, we disconnect from everything, so it then affects all areas of our lives.</p> <p>All of us have an inner voice that in Gestalt therapy is called \u201cTop Dog\u201d. In psychoanalysis, it\u2019s called the \u201csuperego\u201d, in transactional analysis \u2013 the \u201cparent ego state\u201d. Whatever you want to call it, it speaks to you in \u201cshoulds\u201d. We also have an \u201cUnderdog\u201d (or \u201cid\u201d or \u201cchild ego state\u201d) that acts like our inner rebel. It responds to the Top Dog but, here\u2019s the thing, while the Top Dog has words, the Underdog has only feelings and actions. Think of it like this: perhaps Top Dog says, \u201cYou should not overeat,\u201d but then Underdog thoughtlessly reaches for the biscuits. So how do we get around this impasse? You do it by going deeper into the Underdog. It\u2019s hard to listen to Underdog because he doesn\u2019t have words, so we need to find the words for him. Then we must give him a bit of what he wants, so that he doesn\u2019t rebel and sabotage our entire life. I think the key to this is when you say all your decisions are taken based on what you need to do rather than what you feel like doing. I think you need to do more of what you feel like doing rather than what seems sensible to you, because you need to give your Underdog some of what he needs to quell his tendency to rebel.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Settle for 70% and you will have the energy for what is really important</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Don\u2019t make decisions for the perfect outcome, because they take too long and won\u2019t make you happier. Instead, make decisions for the \u201cthat\u2019ll do\u201d outcome. In addition, make more decisions from a feels-good place rather than just from a sensible place. Give it 70%.</p> <p>When you accept that 70% effort for work is enough, rather than breaking yourself in two by believing it should be 100%, you\u2019ll have more emotional energy for what\u2019s really important.</p> <p>Play with your daughter. Don\u2019t train her to be a perfectionist. Be goofy and play. Make her laugh every day. Take full responsibility for either getting-up time or bedtime with her. Don\u2019t see time with your daughter as a chore but as time to relish and enjoy. This is your chance to make a great bond with her, take your time over it. It is not something to be rushed. She is a responsibility, yes, but see her as a person first.</p> <p>Talk to your wife about how you\u2019re feeling. Acknowledging your struggles can open the door to better understanding and cooperation.</p> <p>Make a conscious effort to spend more time with your wife, daughter, parents and friends. Even small acts of attention and care can begin to rebuild connections. What shared activities can you engage in? It could be something as simple as a barbecue. Do stuff that both yourself and they will enjoy. It will strengthen bonds and help you feel more connected. Do more of what you feel like doing, or you won\u2019t feel like doing anything. Remember, old people on their deathbeds regret not spending more quality time with the people that matter more than anything else.</p> <p><em>Every week Philippa Perry addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

      "bodyText": "The question I feel I am unable to give 100% to anything. When I say anything, I mean my business, friendships, parenting, my relationship or any other task that is given to me or taken on by me. I don\u2019t feel the urge to put in enough effort. It seems I\u2019m fine about losing people, business, money or anything (so long as it doesn\u2019t leave me destitute). I do fear a bit when things are just about to go, but then somehow it turns out OK. I don\u2019t feel close to my parents. I make most decisions based on what needs to be done, rather than what I feel like doing. I somehow don\u2019t make the decision to sell up my business, because it just goes on. I take a huge amount of time in making decisions. I am always in two minds. I fear what the decision could turn out to be. I eventually take a decision when time has almost run out. I am married and have a young daughter. My marriage is a struggle as my wife feels I don\u2019t take enough responsibility. What should I do? Philippa\u2019s answer From now on, please drop 100% as a goal. Let\u2019s go for 70%. Perfectionism is stifling and paralysing and the enemy of creativity and connection. You wrote to me from your work email, so I searched your business. Wow! Looks like a great enterprise, you\u2019ve got at least six branches in three different cities. And it\u2019s fantastic that \u201cit just goes on\u201d \u2013 that your own business seems to run itself is what most entrepreneurs dream of. I\u2019m guessing you have got high standards and that you were brought up in a culture of perfectionism, but I\u2019m not sure that this 100% thing suits you. When I was studying a branch of psychotherapy called Gestalt, we were taught to look out for the red flag that is a \u201cshould\u201d. I think you\u2019ve got a massive \u201cshould\u201d going on about always giving your all. It\u2019s time for you to question this because it sounds as if this \u201cshould\u201d, rather than helping you progress through life, is only firing up your inner rebel, who is replying to the \u201cshould\u201d with a \u201cno\u201d. The trouble is, when we disconnect, because we are burning out and we are unaware about what we want to disconnect from, we disconnect from everything, so it then affects all areas of our lives. All of us have an inner voice that in Gestalt therapy is called \u201cTop Dog\u201d. In psychoanalysis, it\u2019s called the \u201csuperego\u201d, in transactional analysis \u2013 the \u201cparent ego state\u201d. Whatever you want to call it, it speaks to you in \u201cshoulds\u201d. We also have an \u201cUnderdog\u201d (or \u201cid\u201d or \u201cchild ego state\u201d) that acts like our inner rebel. It responds to the Top Dog but, here\u2019s the thing, while the Top Dog has words, the Underdog has only feelings and actions. Think of it like this: perhaps Top Dog says, \u201cYou should not overeat,\u201d but then Underdog thoughtlessly reaches for the biscuits. So how do we get around this impasse? You do it by going deeper into the Underdog. It\u2019s hard to listen to Underdog because he doesn\u2019t have words, so we need to find the words for him. Then we must give him a bit of what he wants, so that he doesn\u2019t rebel and sabotage our entire life. I think the key to this is when you say all your decisions are taken based on what you need to do rather than what you feel like doing. I think you need to do more of what you feel like doing rather than what seems sensible to you, because you need to give your Underdog some of what he needs to quell his tendency to rebel. Don\u2019t make decisions for the perfect outcome, because they take too long and won\u2019t make you happier. Instead, make decisions for the \u201cthat\u2019ll do\u201d outcome. In addition, make more decisions from a feels-good place rather than just from a sensible place. Give it 70%. When you accept that 70% effort for work is enough, rather than breaking yourself in two by believing it should be 100%, you\u2019ll have more emotional energy for what\u2019s really important. Play with your daughter. Don\u2019t train her to be a perfectionist. Be goofy and play. Make her laugh every day. Take full responsibility for either getting-up time or bedtime with her. Don\u2019t see time with your daughter as a chore but as time to relish and enjoy. This is your chance to make a great bond with her, take your time over it. It is not something to be rushed. She is a responsibility, yes, but see her as a person first. Talk to your wife about how you\u2019re feeling. Acknowledging your struggles can open the door to better understanding and cooperation. Make a conscious effort to spend more time with your wife, daughter, parents and friends. Even small acts of attention and care can begin to rebuild connections. What shared activities can you engage in? It could be something as simple as a barbecue. Do stuff that both yourself and they will enjoy. It will strengthen bonds and help you feel more connected. Do more of what you feel like doing, or you won\u2019t feel like doing anything. Remember, old people on their deathbeds regret not spending more quality time with the people that matter more than anything else.

      "body": "<p>This summer, the Nobel laureate Prof Aaron Ciechanover joined a group of prominent Israelis gathered in the ruins of the Nir Oz kibbutz to demand a hostage release and ceasefire deal.</p> <p>Nir Oz was the worst hit of all the communities targeted by Hamas on 7 October, with a quarter of its residents kidnapped or killed. Twenty-nine are still in Gaza.</p> <p>If the hostages were not brought back, the basic social contract that underpinned Israeli society would unravel, the 77-year-old professor of medicine warned \u2013 with catastrophic consequences for the entire country.</p> <p>He cited an accelerating \u201cbrain drain\u201d of doctors and other professionals as a worrying sign that some of Israel\u2019s elite already feel they no longer have a future in the country. And without them, Israel itself might struggle to have a future.</p> <p>Ciechanover is a long-term critic of Benjamin Netanyahu and joined protests against his government before the war. But concern about this trend is not limited to political opponents of the Israeli leader. Earlier this year, Netanyahu\u2019s former chair of the National Economic Council, Eugene Kandel, joined forces with the administrative expert Ron Tzur to warn that Israel faces an existential threat.</p> <p>In a paper calling for a new political settlement, they warned that under a business-as-usual scenario \u201cthere is a considerable likelihood that Israel will not be able to exist as a sovereign Jewish state in the coming decades\u201d.</p> <p>Among the threats they highlighted were rising emigration, particularly among the people who have built up Israel\u2019s hi-tech sector and the schools and hospitals vital to attracting the global elite. \u201cIsrael\u2019s locomotive of growth is innovation, and that is driven by a small group of several tens of thousands of people in a country of 10 million,\u201d the paper warned. \u201cThe weight of their departure from the country is immense in comparison to their number.\u201d</p>    <p>The problem precedes the 7&nbsp;October<sup> </sup>attacks and the war that followed, as demographic and political shifts have prompted some secular, liberal Israelis to question their future in a state increasingly dominated by religious traditionalists.</p> <p>Noam is a father of three with businesses that include a PR consultancy and a cannabis pharmacy. He expected that his 40s would be a time of \u201cless doing, more enjoying\u201d, after decades of hard work.</p> <p>Instead, he and his wife spend evenings poring over school options in European countries as they weigh up where to start a new life. The war increased the urgency of the search, but it has been a decision born out of longstanding concerns.</p> <p>\u201cThe main reason we are leaving is that we are seeking a better future for our children. Even if peace can be brokered tomorrow, we still can\u2019t see a future we want to be a part of,\u201d Noam said. \u201cThe demographics speak for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>He thinks Israel\u2019s economy will be hampered by the growing number of ultra-orthodox young people not qualified for professional jobs because they do not study maths or science, or speak English. Socially, he fears the rise of religious conservatives will make life hard for secular Jews. \u201cIf you ask me what we are headed for, you can look at the Iranian model, where religion plays a major role in daily life.</p> <p>\u201cEven without the enemies we have all around [the region], that\u2019s a good enough reason for any child loving parent to take his children away from harm.\u201d</p> <p>Secular Israelis who prioritise living in a liberal democracy are a shrinking portion of Israel\u2019s population, said Uri Ram, professor of sociology and anthropology at Ben Gurion University of the Negev.</p> <p>By 2015, only a minority \u2013 although, at 45%, a large one \u2013 of the Jewish population in Israel defined themselves as secular, and that is shrinking as religious and ultra-orthodox Jewish families, on average, have more children.</p> <p>Data from the first class at elementary schools in 2023 showed that only 40% of children were in the secular stream, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a growing problem of \u2018brain drain\u2019, and it will increase, firstly, if the military risk is not reduced and, secondly, if the state does indeed turn more populist-autocratic,\u201d said Ram, who has researched the struggle for Israel\u2019s future between liberal, mostly secular Israelis like Noam and a group he describes as ethno-religious traditionalists.</p> <p>\u201cIn these situations, the upper middle classes will send their young generations abroad.

Noam said over the last year that five or six families at his children\u2019s school had taken their children out of classes to head abroad, and that he wanted to give his children back a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood after a year of alarms and constant threats.</p> <p>After Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, some Israelis felt failed by a state and army that had promised security, and that still has not yet brought back all the hostages held in Gaza.

      "bodyText": "This summer, the Nobel laureate Prof Aaron Ciechanover joined a group of prominent Israelis gathered in the ruins of the Nir Oz kibbutz to demand a hostage release and ceasefire deal. Nir Oz was the worst hit of all the communities targeted by Hamas on 7 October, with a quarter of its residents kidnapped or killed. Twenty-nine are still in Gaza. If the hostages were not brought back, the basic social contract that underpinned Israeli society would unravel, the 77-year-old professor of medicine warned \u2013 with catastrophic consequences for the entire country. He cited an accelerating \u201cbrain drain\u201d of doctors and other professionals as a worrying sign that some of Israel\u2019s elite already feel they no longer have a future in the country. And without them, Israel itself might struggle to have a future. Ciechanover is a long-term critic of Benjamin Netanyahu and joined protests against his government before the war. But concern about this trend is not limited to political opponents of the Israeli leader. Earlier this year, Netanyahu\u2019s former chair of the National Economic Council, Eugene Kandel, joined forces with the administrative expert Ron Tzur to warn that Israel faces an existential threat. In a paper calling for a new political settlement, they warned that under a business-as-usual scenario \u201cthere is a considerable likelihood that Israel will not be able to exist as a sovereign Jewish state in the coming decades\u201d. Among the threats they highlighted were rising emigration, particularly among the people who have built up Israel\u2019s hi-tech sector and the schools and hospitals vital to attracting the global elite. \u201cIsrael\u2019s locomotive of growth is innovation, and that is driven by a small group of several tens of thousands of people in a country of 10 million,\u201d the paper warned. \u201cThe weight of their departure from the country is immense in comparison to their number.\u201d The problem precedes the 7 October attacks and the war that followed, as demographic and political shifts have prompted some secular, liberal Israelis to question their future in a state increasingly dominated by religious traditionalists. Noam is a father of three with businesses that include a PR consultancy and a cannabis pharmacy. He expected that his 40s would be a time of \u201cless doing, more enjoying\u201d, after decades of hard work. Instead, he and his wife spend evenings poring over school options in European countries as they weigh up where to start a new life. The war increased the urgency of the search, but it has been a decision born out of longstanding concerns. \u201cThe main reason we are leaving is that we are seeking a better future for our children. Even if peace can be brokered tomorrow, we still can\u2019t see a future we want to be a part of,\u201d Noam said. \u201cThe demographics speak for themselves.\u201d He thinks Israel\u2019s economy will be hampered by the growing number of ultra-orthodox young people not qualified for professional jobs because they do not study maths or science, or speak English.

By 2015, only a minority \u2013 although, at 45%, a large one \u2013 of the Jewish population in Israel defined themselves as secular, and that is shrinking as religious and ultra-orthodox Jewish families, on average, have more children. Data from the first class at elementary schools in 2023 showed that only 40% of children were in the secular stream, he said. \u201cThere is a growing problem of \u2018brain drain\u2019, and it will increase, firstly, if the military risk is not reduced and, secondly, if the state does indeed turn more populist-autocratic,\u201d said Ram, who has researched the struggle for Israel\u2019s future between liberal, mostly secular Israelis like Noam and a group he describes as ethno-religious traditionalists. \u201cIn these situations, the upper middle classes will send their young generations abroad.

While most staff, patients and displaced people fled, those who stayed behind described torture at the hands of the Israeli forces, who claimed they had intelligence that Hamas had operated from the hospital.</p> <p>It has been a struggle to keep working, he says. \u201cThe medical staff are part of the population: they evacuate from one place to another, they are displaced, they can be working in the surgical theatre or hospital and receive news that their family have been injured or killed by an airstrike.\u201d</p> <p>Fears for the safety of his own family weighed heavily on Mughaisib. One day in November, when he was on his way to work in Khan Younis, he received a call from his wife telling him that his children had narrowly escaped an airstrike. </p> <p>They had been standing on the street outside the home they were sheltering in. Only moments after they came inside, an airstrike hit a house opposite, killing 20 people including women and children.</p> <p>In February, he was able to evacuate his wife, three children and father to Cairo. \u201cI had felt that something was blocking my chest. I was relieved because now I knew they were in a safe, secure place, far from this suffering, far from this fear and destruction, and that they were finally able to eat properly, sleep properly, drink properly. And then I continued working.\u201d</p> <p>After the focus of Israeli ground operations turned to Khan Younis, including Nasser hospital itself, Mughaisib and his teams shifted southwards to Rafah. </p> <p>It was to the same city that hundreds of thousands of other Gazans also fled \u2013 where they were told by Israel they would be safe \u2013 turning the small community into a place that now hosted the majority of Gaza\u2019s population.</p>    <p>They operated out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/21/what-is-gaza-indonesian-hospital-why-israel-targeting-it\">Rafah Indonesian field hospital</a> until, in May, that area was also made the target of Israeli military operations and people had to flee again, either back to Khan Younis or central Gaza, or another declared safe zone, the al-Mawasi camp on the coast. </p> <p>MSF operates there too, but Mughaisib says that camp has also seen deadly strikes.</p> <p>\u201cI needed to evacuate five times from one place to another in the south area due to the threat of a military operation in Rafah. I was alone with my only pet, my cat, moving from one place to another,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Gaza\u2019s healthcare system is in tatters. <a href=\"https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-2-october-2024\">According to the UN</a>, only 17 hospitals are partially functioning while 19 are completely out of service. Most primary healthcare centres are also out of action, and less than half of patients in critical need of treatment are able to get out of Gaza.</p> <p>As well as conflict-related injuries, Mughaisib and his colleagues must treat wider health issues. He says they are seeing a rise in infectious diseases such as gastroenteritis \u2013 spread through polluted water \u2013 skin infections and hepatitis A. </p> <p>Aid agencies have repeatedly sounded the alarm about access to food and clean water. Last week, the World Health Organization said it was planning to begin a second phase of polio vaccinations after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/29/netanyahu-gaza-polio-vaccination\">the first case of the disease</a> in the country for 25 years was reported in August. </p> <p>Though moments of joy are few, Mughaisib says he does feel some satisfaction when he and his colleagues are able to entertain the children and distract them from their pain.</p> <p>\u201cI always remember the children \u2013 children severely injured, children who had lost a limb, a child of two years [old] who had both legs amputated,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor and so I have to show my strength in front of them, to support them, but these are the patients I remember.\u201d</p> <p>For Mughaisib and the other doctors operating out of Nasser hospital, they are now trying to cling on and provide any service they can. The hospital runs off generators, but these sometimes fall silent when they run out of fuel, and its staff are constantly on edge, working until the moment comes when they might have to move again.</p> <p>They have long hoped for a ceasefire, which they say is desperately needed, but, after repeated promises, no longer have much expectation.</p> <p>\u201cAfter a year now, the word ceasefire is a wish, a dream \u2013 it might come true or not, I don\u2019t know. We thought the ceasefire would be in Ramadan, for Eid, but it did not happen; we thought it would be in the end of summer, it did not happen,\u201d says Mughaisib. \u201cOf course we wish there would be a ceasefire but we reached a moment that we don\u2019t believe that it will happen.\u201d</p>",

They operated out of the Rafah Indonesian field hospital until, in May, that area was also made the target of Israeli military operations and people had to flee again, either back to Khan Younis or central Gaza, or another declared safe zone, the al-Mawasi camp on the coast. MSF operates there too, but Mughaisib says that camp has also seen deadly strikes. \u201cI needed to evacuate five times from one place to another in the south area due to the threat of a military operation in Rafah. I was alone with my only pet, my cat, moving from one place to another,\u201d he says. Gaza\u2019s healthcare system is in tatters. According to the UN, only 17 hospitals are partially functioning while 19 are completely out of service. Most primary healthcare centres are also out of action, and less than half of patients in critical need of treatment are able to get out of Gaza. As well as conflict-related injuries, Mughaisib and his colleagues must treat wider health issues. He says they are seeing a rise in infectious diseases such as gastroenteritis \u2013 spread through polluted water \u2013 skin infections and hepatitis A. Aid agencies have repeatedly sounded the alarm about access to food and clean water. Last week, the World Health Organization said it was planning to begin a second phase of polio vaccinations after the first case of the disease in the country for 25 years was reported in August. Though moments of joy are few, Mughaisib says he does feel some satisfaction when he and his colleagues are able to entertain the children and distract them from their pain. \u201cI always remember the children \u2013 children severely injured, children who had lost a limb, a child of two years [old] who had both legs amputated,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor and so I have to show my strength in front of them, to support them, but these are the patients I remember.\u201d For Mughaisib and the other doctors operating out of Nasser hospital, they are now trying to cling on and provide any service they can. The hospital runs off generators, but these sometimes fall silent when they run out of fuel, and its staff are constantly on edge, working until the moment comes when they might have to move again. They have long hoped for a ceasefire, which they say is desperately needed, but, after repeated promises, no longer have much expectation. \u201cAfter a year now, the word ceasefire is a wish, a dream \u2013 it might come true or not, I don\u2019t know. We thought the ceasefire would be in Ramadan, for Eid, but it did not happen; we thought it would be in the end of summer, it did not happen,\u201d says Mughaisib. \u201cOf course we wish there would be a ceasefire but we reached a moment that we don\u2019t believe that it will happen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "We will be ending this blog shortly and moving to a new one to continue our coverage. Here is a summary of the most recent major developments. Israel strikes hit south Beirut and its outskirts on Saturday night, official Lebanese media reported. \u201cIsraeli enemy warplanes carried out four very violent strikes on [Beirut\u2019s] southern suburbs, and one strike on the Chweifat\u201d area, with ambulances rushing to the site, Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency said. Correspondents in Beirut reported hearing explosions, and Agence France-Presse footage showed plumes of smoke rising from the targeted areas. Israel\u2019s defence force confirmed it intended to strike a mosque in Gaza which it said was being used by Hamas as a command and control complex. Eyewitnesses told Reuters it was being used to house displaced people. At least five people have been reported killed in the strike. Earlier on Saturday an Israel military spokesman said the country will retaliate against Iran for the Iranian missile attack at \u201cthe timing which we decide\u201d. \u201cThe way in which we respond to this disgraceful attack will be in the manner, at the location and the timing which we decide, according to the political leadership\u2019s instructions,\u201d Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a broadcast statement, according to a Reuters report. Iran said that any attack by Israel will be met with an \u201ceven stronger\u201d retaliation, as tensions continue to rise between the two countries. \u201cOur reaction to any attack by the Zionist regime is completely clear,\u201d Abbas Araghchi, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, told reporters in Damascus, Syria. \u201cFor every action, there will be a proportional and similar reaction from Iran, and even stronger.\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu said Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d for calling for a halt on arms deliveries to Israel. \u201cThe axis of terror stands together. But countries who supposedly oppose this [axis] call for an arms embargo on Israel. What a disgrace,\u201d the Israeli prime minister said. \u201cWell let me tell you this Israel will win with or without their support but their shame will continue long after the war is won.\u201d The president of Ireland sharply criticised Israel\u2019s demand that UN peacekeepers leave their positions in southern Lebanon. \u201cIt is outrageous that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have threatened this peacekeeping force and sought to have them evacuate the villages they are defending,\u201d Michael Higgins said. The IDF had requested that peacekeepers operating on the \u201cblue line\u201d between Israel and the Golan Heights \u201crelocate\u201d. France\u2019s president Macron has responded to Netanyahu\u2019s criticism of his calls for a halt on arms deliveries to Israel. Macron told French broadcaster France Inter that calls for a ceasefire were not being heard. \u201cI think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,\u201d he said. Netanyahu called the comments a \u201cdisgrace\u201d, to which Macron\u2019s office responded with a statement of its own later Saturday, describing Netanyahu\u2019s reaction as \u201cexcessive and detached from the friendship between France and Israel\u201d. More details are coming in of the intense Israeli air strikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs that began around midnight local time. Associated Press reports the strong explosions began after Israel\u2019s military urged residents to evacuate areas in Dahiyeh, the predominantly Shiite collection of suburbs on Beirut\u2019s southern edge. AP video showed the blasts illuminating the densely populated southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Social media videos show multiple huge blasts across the area. Israel\u2019s military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted. A road to Beirut\u2019s airport is among the areas hit, according to correspondents on the ground. Lebanon\u2019s national news agency earlier said air traffic has still been landing. Others reported streams of people fleeing the chaos, including from the Sabra Palestinian refugee camp. The Israeli Air Force has confirmed the strike on the mosque in Deir al-Balah where medics say at least five were killed, saying it was being used by Hamas. It also said it struck another site \u201cthat was previously used as the Ibn Rushd school\u201d. \u201cThe command and control complexes were used by Hamas terrorists to plan and carry out terrorist operations against the IDF forces and the State of Israel,\u201d it said in a statement published on the Air Force\u2019s X account. The IAF did not detail casualties. It said that prior to the attack \u201cmany steps were taken to reduce the chance of harming civilians, including the use of precision weaponry, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence information.\u201d Reuters earlier reported at least five people had been killed and more than 20 injured in the strike on the mosque. Eyewitnesses told the news agency the number of casualties could rise as the mosque was being used to house displaced people. There are early reports coming in from Reuters that Israeli air strikes on a mosque near the Al-Aqsa Hospital, in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, has killed at least five people and injured 20. The report is citing medics on the ground. Hezbollah says it has repelled an attempt by Israeli troops to storm into a Lebanese border village in the last few hours, AFP reports. The fighters launched \u201cartillery shells\u201d at \u201cIsraeli enemy soldiers who attempted to infiltrate from... Blida... forcing (them) to retreat,\u201d the group said in a statement. At least eight strikes hit Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs late on Saturday including close to the country\u2019s main airport, Reuters reported, after the Israeli military issued warnings to residents of certain buildings in the area. \u2022Israel strikes hit south Beirut and its outskirts on Saturday night, official Lebanese media reported. \u201cIsraeli enemy warplanes carried out four very violent strikes on (Beirut\u2019s) southern suburbs, and one strike on the Chweifat\u201d area, with ambulances rushing to the site, Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency said. Correspondents in Beirut reported hearing explosions, and AFP footage showed plumes of smoke rising from the targeted areas. \u2022Earlier on Saturday an Israel military spokesman said the country will retaliate against Iran for the Iranian missile attack at \u201cthe timing which we decide\u201d. \u201cThe way in which we respond to this disgraceful attack will be in the manner, at the location and the timing which we decide, according to the political leadership\u2019s instructions,\u201d Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a broadcast statement, according to a Reuters report. \u2022Iran said that any attack by Israel will be met with an \u201ceven stronger\u201d retaliation, as tensions continue to rise between the two countries. \u201cOur reaction to any attack by the Zionist regime is completely clear,\u201d Abbas Araghchi, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, told reporters in Damascus, Syria. \u201cFor every action, there will be a proportional and similar reaction from Iran, and even stronger,\u201d he said. \u2022Benjamin Netanyahu said Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, is a \u201cdisgrace\u201d for calling for a halt on arms deliveries to Israel. \u201cThe axis of terror stands together.

Well let me tell you this Israel will win with or without their support but their shame will continue long after the war is won,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u2022The president of Ireland sharply criticised Israel\u2019s demand that UN peacekeepers leave their positions in southern Lebanon. \u201cIt is outrageous that the Israel Defense Forces have threatened this peacekeeping force and sought to have them evacuate the villages they are defending,\u201d Michael Higgins said in a statement. The Israel Defense Forces had requested that peacekeepers operating on the \u201cblue line\u201d between Israel and the Golan Heights \u201crelocate\u201d. Photographers have captured the explosions which struck south Beirut late on Saturday night. Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency said five Israeli strikes hit south Beirut and its outskirts Saturday, four of them \u201cvery violent\u201d. AFP correspondents in Beirut reported hearing several explosions and witnessed a ball of flame rising up amid thick smoke. Benjamin Netanyahu said in an address on Saturday evening that Israel will respond to Iran\u2019s attack, following the barrage of missiles fired by Tehran at the country this week. \u201cIsrael has the duty and the right to defend itself and to respond to these attacks and that is what we will do,\u201d Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, said in a televised broadcast. Earlier today Abbas Araghchi, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, said that for any attack by Israel, \u201cthere will be a proportional and similar reaction from Iran, and even stronger\u201d. Official Lebanese media said five Israeli strikes hit south Beirut and its outskirts Saturday, four of them \u201cvery violent\u201d. \u201cIsraeli enemy warplanes carried out four very violent strikes on (Beirut\u2019s) southern suburbs, and one strike on the Chweifat\u201d area, with ambulances rushing to the site, Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency said. AFP correspondents in Beirut reported hearing several explosions. AFP footage showed plumes of smoke rising from the targeted areas, with one strike creating a ball of flame that rose into the air while flares shot up amid thick smoke. The National News Agency later said air traffic at Lebanon\u2019s only airport in Beirut was \u201congoing despite the Israeli enemy\u2019s aggression on the southern suburbs\u2019. Explosions have been heard in south Beirut, AFP reported. The news comes after the Israeli army ordered southern Beirut residents to evacuate on Saturday night as it continued its assault on Lebanon targets. Israel previously confirmed it had targeted the intelligence headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut in the early hours of Saturday morning. Earlier today French president Emmanuel Macron led a group of 88 Francophone countries in calling for an \u201cimmediate\u201d ceasefire in Lebanon. The UK foreign secretary said reports of Israel missile strikes hitting Lebanese hospitals are \u201cdisturbing\u201d in a post on X. \u201cReports that Israeli strikes have hit health facilities and support personnel in Lebanon are deeply disturbing,\u201d David Lammy said. \u201cAll parties must comply with international humanitarian law. Our priority is an immediate ceasefire on both sides so Israeli and Lebanese civilians can return home.\u201d The Israeli army ordered southern Beirut residents to evacuate on Saturday night as it continued its assault on Lebanon. \u201cFor your safety and that of your family members, you must immediately evacuate the designated buildings and those adjacent to them and move away from them at least 500 meters,\u201d Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli army, said on social media, AFP reported. More than 2,000 people have been killed and more than 9,535 wounded since fighting started in Lebanon, most of them since 23 September. Israel said it is targeting Hezbollah positions in Beirut. So it\u2019s finally happening. The wider Middle East conflict that so many feared is igniting. Almost exactly a year after Hamas\u2019s 7 October terrorist atrocities, Israel is fighting on multiple fronts. Iran is now the principal adversary. Israeli leaders, including the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, maintain that it always was. Netanyahu has long sought this showdown. Self-deluding boasts that Israel is \u201cwinning\u201d, bruited about after the assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, drown out calls to halt the madness. Despite their otiose talk of changing the regional balance of power, Netanyahu, his far-right allies and generals lack a credible, long-term political strategy. Their whack-a-mole tactics condemn Israel and neighbours to war without end. The same may be said of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the religious extremists who dominate Iran\u2019s regime \u2013 and the surviving leaders of Iran\u2019s proxies Hamas and Hezbollah. Nor should western reactionaries such as Donald Trump escape blame. All contribute to a destructive continuum of confrontation, violence and misery that is intensifying once again. [..] Moderate voices, such as Iran\u2019s new president, are shouted down. Hapless Joe Biden is humiliated. The UN is slandered and ostracised, its aid workers killed. Peace becomes a dirty word. As ever, ordinary people suffer most. More than 1 million displaced in Lebanon; at least 1,000 killed in the past fortnight. More than 41,000 Palestinians dead in Gaza; almost the entire population homeless. Israeli citizens murdered, as in Jaffa last week, and thousands forced to flee; 101 hostages still unaccounted for. How does this end? In short, badly \u2013 for all concerned. \u2022Israel will retaliate against Iran for the missile attack launched by Tehran at \u201cthe timing which we decide\u201d, a military spokesman said on Saturday. \u201cThe way in which we respond to this disgraceful attack will be in the manner, at the location and the timing which we decide, according to the political leadership\u2019s instructions,\u201d Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a broadcast statement, according to a Reuters report. \u2022Iran said that any attack by Israel will be met with an \u201ceven stronger\u201d retaliation, as tensions continue to rise between the two countries. \u201cOur reaction to any attack by the Zionist regime is completely clear,\u201d Abbas Araghchi, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, told reporters in Damascus, Syria. \u201cFor every action, there will be a proportional and similar reaction from Iran, and even stronger,\u201d he said. \u2022Benjamin Netanyahu said Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, is a \u201cdisgrace\u201d for calling for a halt on arms deliveries to Israel. \u201cThe axis of terror stands together. But countries who supposedly oppose this [axis] call for an arms embargo on Israel. What a disgrace. Well let me tell you this Israel will win with or without their support but their shame will continue long after the war is won,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u2022At least 41,825 Palestinians have been killed and 96,910 wounded in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, the territory\u2019s health authorities said on Saturday. \u2022A series of explosions were heard over Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs early on Saturday after the Israeli military demanded evacuations for some areas while Hezbollah said it was engaged in continued clashes with Israeli troops in the Lebanon border area. Israel said on Friday it had targeted the intelligence headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut and was assessing the damage after a series of strikes on senior figures in the militant group that Iran\u2019s supreme leader condemned as counterproductive. \u2022French president Emmanuel Macron said a group of 88 Francophone countries were calling for an \u201cimmediate\u201d ceasefire in Lebanon. The 88 members of the International Organisation of La Francophonie, including France and Canada, call for an \u201cimmediate and lasting\u201d ceasefire in Lebanon, Macron said, according to AFP. \u2022The president of Ireland sharply criticised Israel\u2019s demand that UN peacekeepers leave their positions in southern Lebanon. \u201cIt is outrageous that the Israeli Defence Forces have threatened this peacekeeping force and sought to have them evacuate the villages they are defending,\u201d Michael Higgins said in a statement. The Israeli Defence Force had requested that peacekeepers operating on the \u201cblue line\u201d between Israel and the Golan Heights \u201crelocate\u201d. Benjamin Netanyahu said Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, is a \u201cdisgrace\u201d for calling for a halt on arms deliveries to Israel. Speaking on Saturday, Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, said the country was fighting \u201cagainst the enemies of civilization\u201d. \u201cAs Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilized countries should be standing firmly by Israel\u2019s side. Yet President Macron and some other western leaders are now calling for an arms embargo against Israel. Shame on them,\u201d Netanyahu said. At least 41,825 Palestinians have been killed and 96,910 wounded in Israel\u2019s war on Gaza since 7 October, the territory\u2019s health authorities said on Saturday. Tens of thousands of people protested around the world against Israel\u2019s actions today. \u201cThe axis of terror stands together. But countries who supposedly oppose this [axis] call for an arms embargo on Israel. What a disgrace. Well let me tell you this Israel will win with or without their support but their shame will continue long after the war is won,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cFor in defending ourselves against this barbarism, Israel is defending civilizations against those who seek to impose a dark age of fanatisicim on all of us.\u201d The president of Ireland on Saturday sharply criticised Israel\u2019s demand that UN peacekeepers leave their positions in southern Lebanon. \u201cIt is outrageous that the Israeli Defence Forces have threatened this peacekeeping force and sought to have them evacuate the villages they are defending,\u201d Michael Higgins said in a statement. \u201cIndeed, Israel is demanding that the entire United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) operating under UN mandates walk away.\u201d Ireland accounts for 347 of the 10,000 soldiers serving in the UNIFIL forces, which are charged with maintaining peace in the south of Lebanon. Earlier Saturday, Unifil said it had rejected Israeli demands that it \u201crelocate\u201d some positions ahead of Israeli ground operations against Hezbollah. Higgins called the demand \u201can insult to the most important global institution\u201d. Israel will retaliate against Iran for the missile attack launched by Tehran at \u201cthe timing which we decide\u201d, a military spokesman said on Saturday. \u201cThe way in which we respond to this disgraceful attack will be in the manner, at the location and the timing which we decide, according to the political leadership\u2019s instructions,\u201d Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a broadcast statement, according to a Reuters report. Hagari added that two air bases struck in the attack remained fully operational and no aircraft were damaged. In the aftermath of Iran\u2019s attack on Israel on Tuesday night, Israeli officials claimed their defences had stood firm. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Iran had launched more than 180 missiles, but few details about the damage were released and the US\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the attack \u201cappears to have been defeated and ineffective\u201d. But as Israel prepares its retaliation, analysts believe those initial reports could have been misleading \u2013 and could change the calculus of Israel\u2019s response if it fears getting into a bout of protracted \u201cmissile ping-pong\u201d with Iran, especially should Tehran choose softer targets in the future. Satellite and social media footage has shown missile after missile striking the Nevatim airbase in the Negev desert, and setting off at least some secondary explosions, indicating that despite the highly touted effectiveness of Israel\u2019s Iron Dome and Arrow air defences, Iran\u2019s strikes were more effective than had been previously admitted. Experts who analysed the footage noted at least 32 direct hits on the airbase. None appeared to have caused major damage, but some landed close to hangars that house Israel\u2019s F-35 jets, among the country\u2019s most prized military assets. While those missiles did not appear to hit planes on the ground, they would nonetheless have a deadly effect if fired at a city such as Tel Aviv, or if directed at other high-value targets such as the Bazan Group\u2019s oil refineries near Haifa \u2013 potentially creating an ecological disaster next to a big Israeli city. French president Emmanuel Macron said a group of 88 Francophone countries were calling for an \u201cimmediate\u201d ceasefire in Lebanon. The 88 members of the International Organisation of La Francophonie, including France and Canada, call for an \u201cimmediate and lasting\u201d ceasefire in Lebanon, Macron said, according to AFP. \u201cWe have unanimously expressed ourselves in favour of an immediate and lasting ceasefire and have stated our commitment to de-escalating tensions in the region,\u201d Macron told reporters at the end of a \u201cFrancophonie\u201d summit. He said France would hold an international conference in support of Lebanon in October. Earlier today Macron called for a halt to arms deliveries to Israel, which has been criticised over the conduct of its retaliatory operation in Gaza. \u201cI think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,\u201d Macron told broadcaster France Inter, adding that France was not sending any arms to Israel. Iran said on Saturday that any attack by Israel will be met with an \u201ceven stronger\u201d retaliation, as tensions continue to rise between the two countries. \u201cOur reaction to any attack by the Zionist regime is completely clear,\u201d Abbas Araghchi, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, told reporters in Damascus, Syria. \u201cFor every action, there will be a proportional and similar reaction from Iran, and even stronger,\u201d he said. He spoke after an Israeli military official told AFP on condition of anonymity, as he was not authorised to discuss the issue publicly, the army was \u201cpreparing a response to the unprecedented and unlawful Iranian attack\u201d. It came as Israel president Isaac Herzog said on Saturday that Iran remains an \u201congoing threat\u201d to Israel, a year after the unprecedented October 7 attack by Hamas militants. \u201cIn many senses we are still living the aftermath of October 7... It is in the ongoing threat to the Jewish State by Iran and its terror proxies,\u201d Herzog said in a statement to mark the first anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel. Speaking to reporters, Araghchi expanded on his remarks earlier on X, when he said Israel could \u201cput our determination to the test\u201d. Araghchi was in Syria to meet with Bashar al-Assad, the country\u2019s president. Araghchi renewed his call for ceasefires in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon, saying: \u201cThe most important issue today is the ceasefire, especially in Lebanon and in Gaza.\u201d \u201cThere are initiatives in this regard. There have been consultations that we hope will be successful,\u201d Araghchi said. Earlier on Saturday, Assad\u2019s office quoted him as saying Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel was \u201ca strong response and taught the Zionist entity a lesson\u201d. The attack came days after an Israeli air strike in southern Beirut killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Thousands of protesters took to the streets in several major cities around the world on Saturday to demand an end to bloodshed in Gaza, as the conflict in the Palestinian enclave approaches its first anniversary and spreads in the wider region. About 40,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through central London while thousands also gathered in Paris, Rome, Manila and Cape Town. Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza, which followed the 7 October Hamas attacks, has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry, and displaced nearly all of the enclave\u2019s population of 2.3 million. \u201cUnfortunately, in spite of all our good will, the Israeli government does not take any notice, and they just go ahead and continue their atrocities in Gaza, now also in Lebanon and in Yemen, and also probably in Iran,\u201d said Agmes Koury, who took part in the London protest. \u201cAnd our government, our British government, unfortunately is just paying lip service and carries on supplying weapons to Israel,\u201d she added. In Paris, Lebanese-French protestor Houssam Houssein said: \u201cWe fear a regional war, because there are tensions with Iran at the moment, and perhaps with Iraq and Yemen\u201d. \u201cWe really need to stop the war because it\u2019s now become unbearable,\u201d he added. In Rome, around 6,000 protestors waved Palestinian and Lebanese flags, defying a ban to march in the city centre ahead of the 7 October anniversary. In Manila, activists clashed with anti-riot police after they were blocked from holding a demonstration in front of the U.S. embassy in the Philippine capital in protest at the United States supplying Israel with weapons. Demonstrations to mark the first anniversary were due to take place later on Saturday in other cities across the world, including the United States and Chile. Some demonstrations in support of Israel are also planned over the weekend. Iran\u2019s \u201cresponse to any aggression\u201d by Israel will be \u201cstronger\u201d, Iran\u2019s foreign minister said in a post on X. Seyed Abbas Araghchi posted a photograph of him and Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria, following what he said were talks on regional issues. \u201cHighlighted that Iran will stand with Resistance in any situation. Also made clear that response to any aggression by Israeli regime will be stronger-and they can put our determination to the test,\u201d Abbas Araghchi wrote. Israel is planning for a \u201csignificant and serious\u201d retaliation against Iran for last week\u2019s large-scale ballistic missile attack, my colleague Peter Beaumont reported earlier today. China has evacuated 215 of its citizens from Lebanon, it said on Saturday, as countries continue to withdraw nationals amid the spiralling conflict. \u201cSo far, 215 Chinese citizens have been safely evacuated from Lebanon in two batches under the organisation and arrangement of the Chinese government,\u201d Beijing\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement given to AFP. \u201cThe Chinese Embassy in Lebanon continues to carry out its mission in Lebanon and will continue to assist the Chinese citizens there in taking security measures,\u201d it added. Several countries have launched operations to remove their nationals from Lebanon in the wake of the ground raids, including Russia, France, Spain, Germany and the UK. On Saturday the UK said it had chartered a new flight to withdraw British nationals from Lebanon on Sunday. More than 250 UK citizens have left Lebanon on government-chartered flights amid the conflict, the Foreign Office said. Earlier today a South Korean military transport aircraft returned 97 citizens and family members from Lebanon to a military airfield south of Seoul, the South Korean foreign ministry said. Twenty five people were killed and 127 wounded in Israeli strikes on Lebanon on Friday, the Lebanese health ministry said in a statement on Saturday. The report of the death toll comes after a series of explosions were heard over Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs overnight, after the Israeli military had demanded evacuations for some areas. Lebanon faces a \u201cterrible\u201d crisis, Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said. Grandi said he had arrived in Beirut on Saturday. He said \u201chundreds of thousands of people\u201d had been left \u201cdestitute or displaced\u201d by Israel\u2019s air strikes. Israel\u2019s attacks on Beirut overnight are part of a wider assault that has driven more than 1.2 million Lebanese from their homes in recent weeks. A Hezbollah source said it has \u201clost\u201d contact with Hashem Safieddine, who is considered the most likely candidate to replace Hassan Nasrallah as leader of the organization. \u201cContact with Sayyed Safieddine has been lost since the violent strikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs\u201d early Friday, the source told AFP, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. The source added: \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he was at the targeted site, or who may have been there with him.\u201d Earlier today three Lebanese security sources told Reuters that Israeli air strikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs since Friday have kept rescue workers from searching the site of a strike suspected to have killed Safieddine. \u201c[Hezbollah] is trying to reach the underground headquarters that were targeted, but every single time Israel starts striking again to impede rescue efforts,\u201d a source told AFP. Safieddine \u201cwas with Hezbollah\u2019s head of intelligence,\u201d known as Hajj Murtada, when the strikes took place, the source said. Three hospitals in south Lebanon were forced to close on Friday after Israeli bombings struck two and the other ran out of supplies, displacing a number of doctors from the area and creating concerns around the state of the Lebanese health sector. Marjayoun governmental hospital and the Salah Ghandour hospital in Bint Jbeil, large healthcare centres along the eastern and western sections of the Lebanese borders, announced their closure after their premises were struck, killing seven and wounding 14 healthcare workers. \u201cThe main hospital of the entrance was targeted as paramedics were approaching. Seven were killed, five were wounded. We considered this a message, so we decided to close,\u201d said Dr Mones Kalakish, the director of Marjayoun governmental hospital. He added that because of the frequent targeting of paramedics in south Lebanon, wounded people had not been able to reach the hospital for the past three days. \u201cThere was no warning to the hospital before they struck. The warning didn\u2019t come over the telephone, it came via bombing,\u201d Kalakish said. Mays al-Jabal governmental hospital, 700 metres from the Israel-Lebanon border, said on Friday hospital staff could no longer perform their role due to a cutoff of supplies. \u201cMedical supplies, diesel, electricity, none of it was available. Unifil was bringing us water, and now they are unable to move. How can a hospital operate without water?\u201d said Dr Halim Saad, the director of Mays al-Jabal hospital\u2019s medical services. The Israeli military said on Saturday it had killed two militants from the armed wing of Hamas operating in Lebanon. The military named Muhammad Hussein Ali al-Mahmoud, who it said served as the group\u2019s executive authority in Lebanon, as being killed in an Israeli airstrike, Reuters reported. Said Alaa Naif Ali, a member of Hamas\u2019 Military Wing in Lebanon, was also killed in an Israeli operation overnight on Saturday, it said. The Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, confirmed the deaths of two of its fighters following Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, but provided different names for them: Mohammed Hussein Al-Louise and Saeed Attallah Ali. Over the past year, Israel\u2019s military operation across the Gaza Strip has destroyed the majority of its infrastructure. In its latest analysis released at the end of September, the UN\u2019s satellite image centre estimated that at least 66% of buildings in Gaza had been damaged \u2013 163,778 in total \u2013 of which 52,564 buildings have been completely destroyed. The northern parts of the strip have been the most severely affected, particularly Gaza City. We have gathered these satellite images taken by Planet Labs PBC of the Zeitoun district in Gaza City, its main commercial hub, over the course of the last year. Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters have gathered in central London, with a \u201csignificant\u201d policing operation in place across the capital as events mark the anniversary of the 7 October attacks in Israel. About 200 pro-Palestinian activists convened in Bedford Square on Saturday morning ahead of a planned march amid a heavy police presence, PA Media reported. Some were holding Lebanese and Iranian flags and banners stating \u201cwe do not stand with genocide\u201d and \u201cZionism is racism\u201d, with many chanting \u201cfree, free Palestine\u201d. A protest leader told activists: \u201cWe don\u2019t engage the police and don\u2019t engage counter-protesters. We definitely don\u2019t talk to the blue bibs. \u201cWe do not talk or interact with the police. If I am arrested, no comment. If I am arrested, no caution. If I am arrested, no duty solicitor. \u201cWe are safer when we are together. Only we can keep each other safe.\u201d This was followed by chants of: \u201cWhen Palestine is under attack. What do we do? Stand up. Fight back. When Lebanon is under attack. What do we do? Stand up. Fight back.\u201d A \u201csignificant\u201d policing operation is in place across London in response to planned protest and memorial events, the Metropolitan police said. \u2022 This post was updated at 16.50 to refer to tens of thousands of people, rather than hundreds, joining the pro-Palestinian march in central London. French president Emmanuel Macron on Saturday urged a halt to arms deliveries to Israel, which has been criticised over the conduct of its retaliatory operation in Gaza. \u201cI think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,\u201d Macron told broadcaster France Inter, adding that France was not sending any arms to Israel. The Israeli military has indicated it will expand its operations on multiple fronts around the anniversary of the 7 October attacks on Monday, including a \u201csignificant and serious\u201d retaliation against Iran for last week\u2019s large-scale ballistic missile attack on Israel. \u201cThe IDF [Israeli military] is preparing a response to the unprecedented and unlawful Iranian attack on Israeli civilians and Israel,\u201d the military official said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak publicly on the issue. As Israel said it was planning its response to Tuesday\u2019s Iranian missile strikes, which hit on or near a number of key Israeli bases, the US president, Joe Biden, cautioned against striking Iranian oil facilities, a day after he said Washington was \u201cdiscussing\u201d such action. Dubai\u2019s Emirates Airlines has banned passengers from carrying pagers and walkie-talkies on its flights, following last month\u2019s attacks on Lebanese group Hezbollah involving communication devices that exploded, Reuters reported. \u201cAll passengers traveling to, from, or via Dubai are prohibited from transporting pagers and walkie-talkies in checked or cabin baggage,\u201d the airline said in a statement on its website on Friday. It added that any prohibited items found will be confiscated by Dubai Police as part of heightened security measures. In the deadly September attacks, thousands of booby-trapped Hezbollah pagers and hundreds of radios exploded \u2013 attacks that were widely blamed on Israel but which it has not claimed. The Middle East\u2019s largest airline also announced that flights to Iraq and Iran will remain suspended until Tuesday, while services to Jordan will resume on Sunday. Flights to Lebanon will remain suspended until Oct. 15 due to escalating Israeli attacks against Iran-backed Hezbollah, including strikes near Beirut\u2019s airport. Several other airlines have also suspended flights to Beirut and other regional airports amid heightened tensions. Syrian air defences confronted hostile targets over the city of Homs, Syria\u2019s state news agency SANA said on Saturday. A slick, high-priced television production. Speeches from top officials. A live audience of thousands. A unified show of collective sorrow and military resolve. That is how the Israeli government hoped to mark the passing of one year since Hamas\u2019s surprise and bloody attacks last 7 October. But little has gone according to plan. Many of the families of people killed or taken hostage on that day have come out forcefully against the state-sponsored event, saying pageantry can wait until after the government secures a hostage deal and faces an independent investigation of its own failures before, after and on that day. Some parents have forbidden the government of Benjamin Netanyahu from using their children\u2019s names and images. Several of the kibbutzim that suffered the greatest losses have said they will boycott. Instead, they will gather in their communities to collectively grieve their loved ones, and remember their hostages, in \u201cintimate, sensitive\u201d rituals. In response, the minister responsible for the ceremony has nixed the live audience while seeming to dismiss the families\u2019 objections as \u201cbackground noise\u201d. This has led to even fiercer denunciations on social media, with some of Israel\u2019s top celebrities pledging their support to a rival commemoration. For the government, \u201ceverything is a show\u201d, said Danny Rahamim, a member of Kibbutz Nahal Oz. That may be, but it seems certain that on 7 October, the official show will go on. Indeed it is nearly impossible to imagine a world in which the Netanyahu government \u2013 and the legacy Jewish organizations that echo its messaging around the world \u2013 would resist the chance to use the potent date as a megaphone to broadcast the same story about the attacks that we have all heard many times before. Iran\u2019s oil minister Mohsen Paknejad said on Saturday that he was \u201cnot worried\u201d about the escalating conflict in the region amid reports that Israel would strike Iran, the ministry\u2019s Shana news site said. Paknejad\u2019s comments were made during a visit to Assaluyeh, the energy capital of Iran. An Israeli official told AFP on Saturday that the military is \u201cpreparing a response\u201d to the Iranian missile barrage that targeted Israel earlier this week. \u201cThe IDF (Israeli military) is preparing a response to the unprecedented and unlawful Iranian attack on Israeli civilians and Israel,\u201d the official said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak publicly on the issue. He did not elaborate on the nature or timing of the response. The Gaza-based Anadolu Agency photographer Ali Jadallah talks about some of the most powerful images he has taken in the year since the 7 October attack by Hamas that triggered the Gaza war: Getty Images photographer Amir Levy talks about the personal responsibility he has felt over the last year to \u2018tell the stories of those caught in the conflict\u2019. An Israeli-American photojournalist with 15 years of experience, Levy has been covering the Gaza and Lebanon borders every day since the 7 October attack. Justin Trudeau urged Canadian citizens still in Lebanon on Saturday to sign up to be evacuated on special flights which have been chartered amid worsening security in the country. Canada has 6,000 signed up to leave and officials are trying to reach another 2,500 over the weekend, an official in Trudeau\u2019s office said. More than 1,000 people have already been evacuated. Speaking at a summit of leaders from French-speaking countries in France, Trudeau urged citizens to \u201cget out of Lebanon while they can\u201d. Israel has expanded its strikes on Lebanon in recent weeks after nearly a year of exchanging fire with Hezbollah. A series of explosions were heard over Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs early on Saturday after the Israeli military demanded evacuations for some areas. The attacks followed intense bombardment on Thursday night that reportedly targeted Hashem Safieddine, the most likely candidate to replace Hassan Nasrallah as leader of Hezbollah. Trudeau said an immediate ceasefire from both Hezbollah and Israel was needed so the situation could be stabilised and United Nations resolutions could begin to be respected again. The man widely tipped replace Hassan Nasrallah as leader of Hezbollah has been \u2018unreachable\u2019 since Friday, it has been reported. Three Lebanese security sources told Reuters on Saturday that Israeli air strikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs since Friday have kept rescue workers from searching the site of a strike suspected to have killed Hashem Safieddine. One of the sources said Safieddine has been uncontactable since the strike. Earlier on Saturday we reported that his fate was unclear due to the attacks, which form part of a wider assault that has driven more than 1.2 million Lebanese from their homes. A series of explosions were heard over Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs early on Saturday after the Israeli military demanded evacuations for some areas while Hezbollah said it was engaged in continued clashes with Israeli troops in the Lebanon border area. Israel said on Friday it had targeted the intelligence headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut and was assessing the damage after a series of strikes on senior figures in the militant group that Iran\u2019s supreme leader condemned as counterproductive. Israel has launched fresh airstrikes on Beirut overnight, with a series of loud blasts and huge plumes of smoke reported in the south of the capital in the early hours of Saturday. The Israeli military had earlier demanded the evacuation of parts of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. The attacks, part of a wider assault that has driven more than 1.2 million Lebanese from their homes, followed intense bombardment on Thursday night that reportedly targeted Hashem Safieddine, the most likely candidate to replace Hassan Nasrallah as leader of Hezbollah. His fate remains unclear. At least 41,825 Palestinians have been killed and 96,910 wounded in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, the territory\u2019s health authorities said on Saturday. Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi has arrived in Damascus to discuss regional developments and bilateral relations with Syrian officials, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson said on Saturday. This comes after Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, gave a rare public sermon in Tehran on Friday, vowing that Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza will re-emerge strongly with new leaders, and defending the \u201clegal and legitimate\u201d ballistic missile attack on Israel this week. A new flight has been chartered by the UK government for British nationals to leave Lebanon on Sunday, amid the spiralling conflict in the region. More than 250 UK citizens have left Lebanon on government-chartered flights amid the conflict, the Foreign Office said. The UK chartered a fourth flight to leave Beirut-Rafic Hariri airport in Beirut on Sunday. Hamas said an Israeli strike killed one of its commanders, his wife and two daughters, in a refugee camp in north Lebanon \u2013 an area not previously hit by the current conflict. Hamas said Saeed Atallah Ali, his wife, Shaymaa Azzam, and their two daughters, Zeinab and Fatima, were killed in a \u201cZionist bombardment of his house in the Beddawi camp\u201d near the northern city of Tripoli. The daughters were described as children. A South Korean military transport aircraft returned 97 citizens and family members from Lebanon on Saturday as Middle East tensions rise, the foreign ministry said. A KC-330 aircraft left Beirut on Friday afternoon with the evacuees, who include Lebanese family members, and arrived at a military airfield on the south of Seoul, the ministry said. The UN says that its peacekeepers, including an Irish post operating on the \u201cblue line\u201d between Israel and the Golan Heights, remain in all place despite a request by the Israeli Defence Force that they \u201crelocate\u201d. The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon said Saturday it would not leave positions. \u201cOn 30 September, the IDF (Israeli military) notified Unifil of their intention to undertake limited ground incursions into Lebanon. They also requested we relocate from some of our positions,\u201d the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said. Up to 500 Australians and their close relatives are due to be boarded on to two charter flights out of Beirut on Saturday, amid increased government efforts to expatriate citizens after Israel\u2019s ground incursion into Lebanon\u2019s south. The first flight was expected to fly out of the Lebanese capital and land in Cyprus at about 11.30am local time (6.30pm AEST). From there, two Qantas flights can take passengers to Sydney on Tuesday and Wednesday. Media affiliated with Hamas reported on Saturday that a leader of the group\u2019s armed wing was killed with three family members in an Israeli strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli. It named the al-Qassam Brigades leader as Saeed Atallah. Israel did not immediately comment on the strike. At least four hospitals in Lebanon announced the suspension of work amid the ongoing Israeli bombardment. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Najib Mikati, urged the international community to pressure Israel \u201cto allow rescue and relief teams to reach bombed sites and allow them to move\u201d casualties. Israel cut off a key road near to Lebanon\u2019s Masnaa border crossing with Syria that has been used by hundreds of thousands of people to flee Israeli bombardments in recent days. Israel has accused Hezbollah of using border crossings with Syria to bring in weapons. More than 300,000 people \u2013 a vast majority of them Syrian \u2013 have crossed from Lebanon into Syria over the past 10 days to escape escalating Israeli bombardment, according to Lebanon\u2019s government. More than 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in nearly a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, according to figures by the Lebanese government. Most have been killed in the past two weeks. The UN says that its peacekeepers, including an Irish post operating on the \u201cblue line\u201d between Israel and the Golan Heights, remain in all place despite a request by the Israeli Defence Force that they \u201crelocate\u201d. The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon said Saturday it would not leave positions. \u201cOn 30 September, the IDF (Israeli military) notified UNIFIL of their intention to undertake limited ground incursions into Lebanon. They also requested we relocate from some of our positions,\u201d the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said. \u201cPeacekeepers remain in all positions and the UN flag continues to fly. Ireland has separately told Israel that the single Irish platoon manning post 6-52 on the blue line would remain in the place as any request to move was a matter for the UN\u2019s force commander on the ground. The UN peacekeeping operation composes of 10,000 troops from 46 nations and is mandated to protect the south of the country from unauthorised military activity. Israel said earlier this week that it would start carrying out limited ground incursions into south Lebanon with some of the fighting taking place less than 2 km from the Irish post. \u201cWe continue to urge Lebanon and Israel to recommit to Security Council Resolution 1701 \u2013 in actions, not just word \u2013 as the only viable solution to bring back stability in the region,\u201d Unifil said. It added that it had \u201ccontingency plans ready to activate if absolutely necessary\u201d. Israel has intensified its campaign against Lebanese militant group Hezbollah since 23 September, killing more than 1,110 people and forcing hundreds of thousands to flee their homes in a country already mired in economic crisis. Yesterday, US president Joe Biden took questions from reporters during a rare briefing in which he said he wasn\u2019t sure if the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was delaying a peace deal in the Middle East to influence the outcome of the US election.

Before the war, its gleaming white hull could be seen cruising Lebanon\u2019s coastline, revellers making sure they enjoyed every inch of the 24-metre-long vessel they each paid $600 to ride. Since Israel started an intense bombing campaign across wide swathes of Lebanon on 23 September, the Princess has been making a very different type of journey. The $1.3m craft has been ferrying families from Beirut to Cyprus, bottles of champagne replaced by hastily packed suitcases. \u201cThe trips are fully booked, we have done about 30 trips on our two boats since the bombing started [on 23 September],\u201d said Khailil Bechara, a broker who works with ship captains to transport people to Cyprus. At $1,800 a head, a seat on a boat bound for Cyprus is not cheap. But demand is high as people desperately try to find any route out of Lebanon. The artist Maisara Baroud never found living in Gaza easy. The Israeli-Egyptian blockade, imposed in 2007 after Hamas\u2019s violent takeover of the territory, was suffocating, and Rimal, his middle-class neighbourhood in Gaza City, had not been spared from airstrikes in the previous wars with Israel. Despite everything, he said, his family worked hard to establish a simple, quiet existence after being expelled from their village in what is now Israel in 1948. Baroud, 48, was a lecturer in the fine arts department at Al-Aqsa University, and he, his wife, Khansa, 47, and children Rita, 21, Ilya, 18, and Maria, 14, lived in a flat in the large family building shared with his mother, his siblings and their children. A docile cat and several songbirds completed their home life. A restless sleeper, he liked to draw late at night, after everyone else had gone to bed. On 7 October 2023, that world collapsed. Following the Hamas attacks in Israel, the war arrived like \u201can earthquake that ravaged everything \u2026 Since that date, our sole mission has become trying to survive,\u201d he said. Over the past year, Baroud and his family have been displaced 12 times. Nowhere in Gaza is safe from airstrikes, but encroaching Israeli ground forces have forced them to flee again and again. Each move is more difficult than the last, as options and space in already overcrowded areas dwindle. A new flight has been chartered by the UK government for British nationals to leave Lebanon on Sunday, amid the spiralling conflict in the region. More than 250 UK citizens have left Lebanon on government-chartered flights amid the conflict, the Foreign Office said. The UK chartered a fourth flight to leave Beirut-Rafic Hariri airport in Beirut on Sunday. The government said there were no further flights scheduled due to \u201csignificantly reduced\u201d demand, though it said it would keep the situation under constant review. The Foreign Office said extra capacity had been arranged \u201cdue to high demand for places on commercial flights and has enabled more than 250 additional people to leave in the last week\u201d. \u201cHowever, demand has now significantly reduced and this Sunday\u2019s flight is currently the only one scheduled,\u201d it said. British nationals and their spouse or partner, and children under the age of 18, are eligible to book a place on Sunday. All passengers must hold a valid travel document and dependants who are not UK citizens will require a valid visa that has been granted for a period of stay in Britain of more than six months. At the start of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, when the intensive bombing of civilians began, the thought in my mind was: how will we Palestinians live with the Israelis after this? Twelve months later, with no relenting in the killings and the destruction of Gaza, with Israel spreading the conflict to the West Bank, where more than 700 Palestinians have been killed, and its escalatory attacks in Lebanon and Iran, the question has only become more pertinent. In the course of these past 12 months many atrocities have been committed, starting with the killing by Palestinians of 1,200 Israeli soldiers and civilians, followed by the Israeli army killing more than 41,000 Palestinians, including more than 17,000 women and children, 287 aid workers and 138 journalists and media workers. This does not include those unaccounted for who remain under the rubble of the two-thirds of Gaza\u2019s buildings that have been damaged or destroyed. Here is just one detail from this 12-month war: On 25 September, Israel returned a truck containing 88 bodies with no identifying details to Gaza. Israel has been under the misguided belief that it could hide these atrocities from the world by limiting access to journalists. It has not allowed outsiders to do independent reporting in Gaza, which has made it easier to dispute Palestinian versions of events and the figures of those killed, and the extent of the damage caused. To shed further doubt, the tremendous number of lives lost is usually accompanied by the caveat \u201cclaims the Hamas-run health ministry\u201d. At least 41,825 Palestinians have been killed and 96,910 wounded in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, the territory\u2019s health authorities said on Saturday. A South Korean military transport aircraft returned 97 citizens and family members from Lebanon on Saturday as Middle East tensions rise, the foreign ministry said. A KC-330 aircraft left Beirut on Friday afternoon with the evacuees, who include Lebanese family members, and arrived at a military airfield on the south of Seoul, the ministry said. President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday ordered military aircraft to be deployed to evacuate South Korean citizens from parts of the Middle East as conflict escalates between Israel and Hezbollah, as well as the armed group\u2019s backer, Iran. South Korea\u2019s defence ministry said it flew a C130J transport plane as backup, which is capable of operating on shorter runways and under fire, as a precaution, and sent 39 military personnel, including mechanics and diplomats, Reuters reported. The government will take further actions to ensure the safety of its citizens, the foreign ministry said without elaborating. South Korean diplomats stationed in Lebanon remained in the country, Yonhap news agency reported. Hamas said an Israeli strike killed one of its commanders, his wife and two daughters, in a refugee camp in north Lebanon \u2013 an area not previously hit by the current conflict. Hamas said Saeed Atallah Ali, his wife, Shaymaa Azzam, and their two daughters, Zeinab and Fatima, were killed in a \u201cZionist bombardment of his house in the Beddawi camp\u201d near the northern city of Tripoli. The daughters were described as children. Ali was a leader of al-Qassam Brigades, the group\u2019s armed wing. His death had been reported by Hamas-affiliated media earlier today. A panel of experts discuss what next for a region on a knife edge: The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon said Israel had requested that it \u201crelocate\u201d but that it would not leave positions in the country\u2019s south. On September 30, the IDF (Israeli military) notified UNIFIL of their intention to undertake limited ground incursions into Lebanon. They also requested we relocate from some of our positions,\u201d the UN Interim Force in Lebanon said in a statement, adding that \u201cpeacekeepers remain in all positions and the UN flag continues to fly.\u201d Up to 500 Australians and their close relatives are due to be boarded on to two charter flights out of Beirut on Saturday, amid increased government efforts to expatriate citizens after Israel\u2019s ground incursion into Lebanon\u2019s south. The first flight was expected to fly out of the Lebanese capital and land in Cyprus at about 11.30am local time (6.30pm AEST). From there, two Qantas flights can take passengers to Sydney on Tuesday and Wednesday. Guardian Australia understands that seats were still available for the flights as of Saturday afternoon (Australian time). Speaking to reporters on Saturday, the federal infrastructure minister, Catherine King, said the government\u2019s message to Australians in Lebanon was \u201cdo not wait\u201d, adding it could not be guaranteed that everyone would be evacuated. Here is the Guardian\u2019s latest report on the crisis in the Middle East, including the series of explosions that shook Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs early on Saturday. A series of explosions were heard over Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs early on Saturday after the Israeli military demanded evacuations for some areas while Hezbollah said it was engaged in continued clashes with Israeli troops in the Lebanon border area. Israel said on Friday it had targeted the intelligence headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut and was assessing the damage after a series of strikes on senior figures in the militant group that Iran\u2019s supreme leader condemned as counterproductive. Media affiliated with Hamas, meanwhile, reported on Saturday that a leader of its armed wing was killed with three family members in an Israeli strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli. It named the al-Qassam Brigades leader as Saeed Atallah. Israel did not immediately comment on the strike. In Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, a blast was heard and smoke seen early on Saturday, Reuters witnesses said, as the Israeli military issued three warnings for residents of the area to immediately evacuate. The first alert warned residents in a building in the Burj al-Barajneh neighbourhood and the second in a building in Choueifat district, while the third alert mentioned buildings in Haret Hreik as well as Burj al-Barajneh. Iran-backed Hezbollah said the Israeli army was trying to infiltrate the southern Lebanese town of Odaisseh, where clashes continued. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has arrived in Damascus to discuss regional developments and bilateral relations with Syrian officials, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson said on Saturday. This comes after Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, gave a rare public sermon in Tehran on Friday, vowing that Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza will re-emerge strongly with new leaders, and defending the \u201clegal and legitimate\u201d ballistic missile attack on Israel this week. Images from news agencies overnight show thick clouds of smoke rising over parts of southern Beirut, after the capital was struck by a series of airstrikes in the early hours of Saturday. Hello and welcome to our continuing live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments. Israel has launched fresh airstrikes on Beirut overnight, with a series of loud blasts and huge plumes of smoke reported in the south of the capital in the early hours of Saturday. The Israeli military had earlier demanded the evacuation of parts of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. The attacks, part of a wider assault that has driven more than 1.2 million Lebanese from their homes, followed intense bombardment on Thursday night that reportedly targeted Hashem Safieddine, the most likely candidate to replace Hassan Nasrallah as leader of Hezbollah. His fate remains unclear. Separately, Hezbollah said it was engaged in ongoing clashes with Israeli soldiers near to Lebanon\u2019s southern border, saying Israeli soldiers had renewed an attempt to advance towards the village of Adaysseh. In other news: Media affiliated with Hamas reported on Saturday that a leader of the group\u2019s armed wing was killed with three family members in an Israeli strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli. It named the al-Qassam Brigades leader as Saeed Atallah. Israel did not immediately comment on the strike. At least four hospitals in Lebanon announced the suspension of work amid the ongoing Israeli bombardment. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Najib Mikati, urged the international community to pressure Israel \u201cto allow rescue and relief teams to reach bombed sites and allow them to move\u201d casualties. Israel cut off a key road near to Lebanon\u2019s Masnaa border crossing with Syria that has been used by hundreds of thousands of people to flee Israeli bombardments in recent days. Israel has accused Hezbollah of using border crossings with Syria to bring in weapons. More than 300,000 people \u2013 a vast majority of them Syrian \u2013 have crossed from Lebanon into Syria over the past 10 days to escape escalating Israeli bombardment, according to Lebanon\u2019s government. More than 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in nearly a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, according to figures by the Lebanese government. Most have been killed in the past two weeks. Gaza\u2019s health ministry said at least 41,802 people have been killed and 96,844 injured in Israeli military attacks on Gaza since last October in its latest update on Friday. The ministry has said thousands are most likely lost in the rubble. At least 29 Palestinians were killed in Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip on Friday, according to medics. Israeli attacks continued across Gaza on Friday, including in the city of Deir al-Balah, where an Israeli strike on a home has killed at least four people, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. The military also launched bombs that ignited fires in homes in the Nuseirat refugee camp, while Israeli warplanes struck several sites in the southern city of Khan Younis, \u201cresulting in further casualties and injuries\u201d, Wafa reported. The northern regions of Israel were targeted by Hezbollah rockets almost continuously throughout Friday. The Israel Defense Forces said Hezbollah had launched about 100 rockets into Israel on Friday. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed that Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza would re-emerge strongly with new leaders. In a rare public sermon in front of tens of thousands in Tehran on Friday, Khamenei defended the \u201clegal and legitimate\u201d ballistic missile attack on Israel this week that Iran has said was in retaliation for the deaths of the Hezbollah secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, and the Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh. The US president, Joe Biden, said he didn\u2019t know whether the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was holding up a peace deal in the Middle East in order to influence the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election. Biden earlier urged Israel against striking Iran\u2019s oil facilities. Israeli soldiers conducted widespread raids in the Hebron province in the occupied West Bank on Friday morning, resulting in the detention of more than 24 people, including \u201cminors\u201d, the Palestinian news agency reported. The majority of those detained were reportedly taken from the town of Beit Ummar. Human rights groups and international organisations have alleged widespread abuse of inmates detained by Israel in raids in the occupied West Bank. Funerals were held on Friday for some of the 18 people killed in the occupied West Bank in an Israeli airstrike on a refugee camp in Tulkarm. Among the dead, according to Palestinan reports, was a family of four including two children. A spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, described the attack as a \u201cheinous crime\u201d and a \u201cmassacre\u201d. The attack was condemned by the UN rights office. Hamas\u2019 armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, confirmed that one of its commanders, Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi, and seven other fighters were killed in the Israeli strike. US forces carried out strikes on 15 targets in areas of Yemen controlled by the Houthi rebels on Friday, the US military confirmed. The media in Yemen reported a new round of airstrikes, including on the capital, Sana\u2019a, and near the airport at the port of Hodeidah, and Israeli strikes continued in Gaza and Lebanon. The strikes were targeted at weapons systems, bases and other equipment belonging to the Iran-backed group, US officials said. The Guardian understands there was no UK involvement in the airstrikes on Friday. The last UK-government chartered flight for British nationals to leave Lebanon will depart from Beirut on Sunday. More than 250 British nationals have left Lebanon on flights chartered by government, the UK Foreign Office said on Friday. A South Korean military transport aircraft evacuated 97 citizens and family members on Friday.",

A memorial was set up in the bleachers, his firefighter\u2019s jacket surrounded by flowers. Giant screens said \u201cIn loving memory of Corey Comperatore\u201d, accompanied by his picture. Comperatore\u2019s family were present.</p> \n<p>At 6.11pm, the exact time when gunfire erupted on 13 July, Trump called for a moment of silence. A bell then tolled four times, once for each of the four victims, including Trump. Then opera singer Christopher Macchio belted out Ave Maria.</p> \n<p>Trump then veered into more familiar territory of falsehoods about immigration and other topics. Later he called up on stage Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and owner of social media platform X, who has swerved politically right. Wearing a black cap and black \u201cOccupy Mars\u201d shirt and coat, Musk jumped around with his arms held high and was greeted with cheers.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThe true test of someone\u2019s character is how they behave under fire. We had one president who couldn\u2019t climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist-pumping after getting shot! Fight, fight, fight!\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite Trump\u2019s attempt to stage a coup and cling on to power on 6 January 2021, Musk argued: \u201cPresident Trump must win to preserve the constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America. This is a must-win situation. Get everyone you know, drag them to register to vote. If they don\u2019t, this will be the last election. That is my prediction.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Butler shooting led to widespread criticism of the Secret Service and the resignation of its director. Critics raised concerns about how Crooks was able to access a nearby rooftop with a direct line of sight to where Trump was speaking. In September the former president survived another attempt on his life when a gunman hid undetected for nearly 12 hours at a golf course in one of his Florida clubs.</p> \n<p>On Saturday there was an intensified security presence with Secret Service and other law enforcement officers in camouflage uniforms stationed on roofs. The building from which Crooks fired was completely obscured by tractor trailers and a fence.</p> \n<p>The rally had an upbeat atmosphere like a giant picnic. People sat on the grass or foldout chairs and walkers in blazing sunshine. They gazed up into a brilliant blue sky to see four special forces skydivers \u2013 one holding a giant Stars and Stripes \u2013 jumping from a Cessna 206 plane from more than 5,000 feet, then a flypast of \u201cTrump Force One\u201d accompanied by the theme music from the film Top Gun.</p> \n<p>One tent displayed paintings of the now famous image of a bloodied Trump with fist raised \u2013 reproductions were on sale for up to $200. That photograph was also visible on numerous T-shirts worn by Trump supporters with slogans such as \u201cFight \u2026 fight \u2026 fight!\u201d, \u201cAmerican badass\u201d, \u201cNever surrender\u201d and \u201cFight. Trump 2024. Legends never die\u201d. The commercialisation of the former president\u2019s near death experience was on vivid display.</p> \n<p>Attendees spoke of their ardent support for Trump, their suspicion that Democrats were behind an assassination plot and that his life had been spared by divine intervention.</p> \n<p>Patricia King, 82, using a walker, was at the rally in Butler in July with her 63-year-old daughter, Diana, and both felt it was important to return. \u201cI remember the long wait and how hot it was and people being loyal enough to stand there and some of them fainted,\u201d said King, a retired nurse. \u201cI remember the shots going off \u2013 pop, pop, pop, pop \u2013 and I turned and looked where he was and everybody started running.\u201d</p> \n<p>King praised Trump\u2019s instinctively combative response that day. \u201cThat\u2019s great with me. That\u2019s like: I\u2019m not quitting and that\u2019s what America is about. We don\u2019t quit. Kamala Harris is too weak. I think she\u2019d be asking Putin to have a cup of tea with her, which is not strength to me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Debbie Hasan, 61, a landlord wearing a Trump 2024 cap, described Saturday\u2019s rally as \u201chistory in the making\u201d and recalled the events of 13 July. \u201cI was watching TV and my husband was in the other room. I start screaming: \u2018They shot Trump! They shot Trump!\u2019 Then I called my brother and I\u2019m screaming. And then seeing him get up and the fist pump was an awesome sight. He\u2019s a great man.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hasan outlined a baseless conspiracy theory that Democrats orchestrated the shooting. \u201cI hate to say it, I think they were behind all this. They can\u2019t beat him any other way. They tried putting him in court on all kinds of trumped up charges. They\u2019re at their limit. They don\u2019t know what else to do. They promote hate and prejudice. How they talk about him, some wacko\u2019s going to say, he needs to be keyholed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many rallygoers echoed Trump\u2019s claim that God saved him in order to save the country. Rodney Moreland, 66, retired from various jobs including welding, truck driving and security, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you believe in God but there was an angel around him that day, absolutely. After that happened his demeanour, everything changed about him. Now he\u2019s calm, cool and collected and he\u2019s known what words to say.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Moreland warned of a possible backlash to the election result. \u201cIf it goes the opposite direction, there\u2019s going to be a war. The last election was rigged. They said, we cannot have him stay in office again.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kristi Masemer, 52, a Walmart worker, wearing a T-shirt that said \u201cI\u2019m still a Trump girl. I make no apologies\u201d, criticised people who said they wished the would-be assassin had killed the former president.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe amount of people who were like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry that he missed\u2019. People actually said that about another human being. That\u2019s the Democrat party. Are you kidding me? That\u2019s not humanity. Who would think that?\u201d</p> \n<p>Masemer praised the restraint of Trump supporters after the assassination attempt. \u201cThe best part of all that was the people in the Maga movement after that didn\u2019t riot. We didn\u2019t lash back at these people because we\u2019re not haters. We just want our country back and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Butler county, on the western edge of a coveted presidential swing state, is a rural-suburban community and a Trump stronghold. He won the county with about 66% of the vote in both 2016 and 2020. About 57% of Butler county\u2019s 139,000 registered voters are Republicans, compared with about 29% who are Democrats and 14% other parties.</p> \n<p>Jana Anderson, 62, who works at an animal shelter, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think a woman should be president, only because it\u2019s always been men. I\u2019m a woman but I think men should lead the country, not a woman. Women, in my opinion, are wishy washy. I mean, she says a lot of things, she promises a lot of things, but I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s capable of doing those things.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has returned to the site where he narrowly escaped assassination in July, pushing the emotional buttons of his supporters and suggesting that his political opponents \u201cmaybe even tried to kill me\u201d to stop him regaining the White House. The Republican presidential nominee \u2013 and perennial showman \u2013 mounted an unabashedly sentimental spectacle in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. He was joined by billionaire Elon Musk, who made the baseless claim that if Trump\u2019s supporters fail to turn out, \u201cthis will be the last election\u201d. Their joint appearance before an enthusiastic crowd of thousands capped hours of programming seemingly intended to mythologise the 13 July shooting for the Trump base exactly one month before the presidential election. The rally was held, with heightened security, at the same grounds where Trump was grazed in the right ear and one rallygoer \u2013 firefighter Corey Comperatore \u2013 was killed when a gunman opened fire. The would-be assassin, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper. A photo of Trump standing with blood streaked across his face as he raised his fist and shouted \u201cFight!\u201d became the indelible image of his campaign. Yet Joe Biden\u2019s decision just a week later to step aside and endorse his vice-president, Kamala Harris, stole Trump\u2019s thunder and altered the trajectory of the race. On Saturday Trump became the first former president to return to the scene of his attempted assassination and weaponise it for political gain. His campaign sought to recapture the aura of their candidate as hero and martyr. As he walked out on stage, a video juxtaposed an image of George Washington crossing the Delaware River with the photo of Trump with fist raised. A voice boomed: \u201cThis man cannot be stopped. This man cannot be defeated.\u201d \u201cAs I was saying \u2026\u201d Trump said as he appeared on stage, gesturing towards an immigration chart that he was looking at when the gunfire began 12 weeks earlier. The crowd, which was overwhelmingly white, roared enthusiastically, holding aloft signs that read \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d Standing behind protective glass that now encases the stage at his outdoor rallies, Trump recalled: \u201cOn this very ground a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me and silence the greatest movement \u2013 Maga \u2013 in the history of our country \u2026 But by the hand of providence and the grace of God that villain did not succeed in his goal. He did not stop our movement.\u201d Trump even seemed to be trying to emulate Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Gettsyburg address as he described the field as a \u201cmonument to the valour\u201d of our first responders and prophesied: \u201cForever afterward, all who have visited this hallowed place will remember what happened here and they will know of the character and courage that so many incredible American patriots have showed.\u201d But Trump also hinted darkly, without evidence, about facing \u201can enemy from within\u201d more dangerous than any foreign adversary. \u201cOver the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, tried to throw me off the ballot, and who knows, maybe even tried to kill me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never stopped fighting for you and I never will.\u201d Trump saluted volunteer firefighter Comperatore, who was shot and killed by the gunman, and two other supporters who were wounded.

      "body": "<ul> <li><p><strong>Ukrainian forces said they shot down a Russian warplane in Ukraine\u2019s east on Saturday</strong>. The bomber was downed near the city of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk region, the head of its military administration, Serhiy Horbunov, was quoted as saying by Ukraine\u2019s public broadcaster, Suspilne. Photos showed charred remains of an aircraft after it landed on a house that caught fire.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine said five civilians were killed by Russian shelling in the country\u2019s south and east while Russian forces claimed to have made gains in Ukraine\u2019s east</strong>. A 65-year-old woman and an 86-year-old man were killed in the city of Toretsk and the village of Velyka Novosilka, prosecutors in the Donetsk region said. In the Zaporizhzhia region, two men aged 44 and 46 were killed by Russian shelling in the village of Mala Tokmachka, said the regional governor, Ivan Fyodorov. Prosecutors in the Kharkiv region said a 49-year-old man died when the car he was driving was hit by a Russian drone.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russian forces captured the village of Zhelanne Druge in the Donetsk region, Moscow\u2019s defence ministry claimed</strong> on Saturday. The village is located close to Pokrovsk, a logistics hub for the Ukrainian army that is threatened by the advance of Russian troops. If confirmed, the village\u2019s capture would come three days after Ukrainian forces said they were withdrawing from the frontline town of Vuhledar, about 33km from Zhelanne Druge, after a hard-fought two-year defence.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would present his \u201cvictory plan\u201d at the 12 October meeting of the Ramstein group of nations</strong> that supplies arms to Ukraine. The plan had \u201cclear, concrete steps towards a just end to the war\u201d, the Ukrainian president said on X on Saturday, adding that the 25th Ramstein meeting would be the first to take place at the leaders\u2019 level. \u201cThe determination of our partners and the strengthening of Ukraine are what can stop Russian aggression.\u201d Zelenskyy presented his plan to the US president, Joe Biden, in Washington in September.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Nine people were wounded when a Ukrainian drone struck a passenger bus in the Donetsk city of Horlivka</strong>, according to the city\u2019s Russian-installed mayor, Ivan Prikhodko.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia launched three guided missiles and 13 attack drones at Ukraine overnight into Saturday, Ukraine\u2019s air force said</strong>. The missiles were intercepted, three drones were shot down over the Odesa region and 10 others were lost, it said. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Saturday that air defences shot down 10 Ukrainian drones overnight in three border regions, including seven over the Belgorod region, two over the Kursk region and one over the Voronezh region.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukrainian prosecutors said they were investigating allegations Russian forces executed four Ukrainian prisoners of war and said a possible suspect for the killings was in custody</strong>. \u201cThe investigation was initiated by interrogations of Russian prisoners of war, during which testimonies were obtained regarding the commission of the crime,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office in the north-eastern Kharkiv region posted on Telegram on Saturday. The servicemen are alleged to have been killed on the orders of Russian military command over the summer at an aggregate plant in Vovchansk, which has been the focus of fierce fighting.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russian prosecutors called for a seven-year sentence at the trial of a US citizen accused of fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine against Russia</strong>, Russian news agencies reported. Prosecutors asked the court to take into account 72-year-old Stephen Hubbard\u2019s age and said he had admitted guilt, according to Interfax on Saturday. They asked that he serve the sentence in a maximum-security penal colony. The US embassy in Moscow said it was aware of the reports of an American citizen\u2019s arrest but could not comment further \u201cdue to privacy restrictions\u201d.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Ukrainian forces said they shot down a Russian warplane in Ukraine\u2019s east on Saturday. The bomber was downed near the city of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk region, the head of its military administration, Serhiy Horbunov, was quoted as saying by Ukraine\u2019s public broadcaster, Suspilne. Photos showed charred remains of an aircraft after it landed on a house that caught fire. Ukraine said five civilians were killed by Russian shelling in the country\u2019s south and east while Russian forces claimed to have made gains in Ukraine\u2019s east. A 65-year-old woman and an 86-year-old man were killed in the city of Toretsk and the village of Velyka Novosilka, prosecutors in the Donetsk region said. In the Zaporizhzhia region, two men aged 44 and 46 were killed by Russian shelling in the village of Mala Tokmachka, said the regional governor, Ivan Fyodorov. Prosecutors in the Kharkiv region said a 49-year-old man died when the car he was driving was hit by a Russian drone. Russian forces captured the village of Zhelanne Druge in the Donetsk region, Moscow\u2019s defence ministry claimed on Saturday. The village is located close to Pokrovsk, a logistics hub for the Ukrainian army that is threatened by the advance of Russian troops. If confirmed, the village\u2019s capture would come three days after Ukrainian forces said they were withdrawing from the frontline town of Vuhledar, about 33km from Zhelanne Druge, after a hard-fought two-year defence. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would present his \u201cvictory plan\u201d at the 12 October meeting of the Ramstein group of nations that supplies arms to Ukraine. The plan had \u201cclear, concrete steps towards a just end to the war\u201d, the Ukrainian president said on X on Saturday, adding that the 25th Ramstein meeting would be the first to take place at the leaders\u2019 level. \u201cThe determination of our partners and the strengthening of Ukraine are what can stop Russian aggression.\u201d Zelenskyy presented his plan to the US president, Joe Biden, in Washington in September. Nine people were wounded when a Ukrainian drone struck a passenger bus in the Donetsk city of Horlivka, according to the city\u2019s Russian-installed mayor, Ivan Prikhodko. Russia launched three guided missiles and 13 attack drones at Ukraine overnight into Saturday, Ukraine\u2019s air force said. The missiles were intercepted, three drones were shot down over the Odesa region and 10 others were lost, it said. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Saturday that air defences shot down 10 Ukrainian drones overnight in three border regions, including seven over the Belgorod region, two over the Kursk region and one over the Voronezh region. Ukrainian prosecutors said they were investigating allegations Russian forces executed four Ukrainian prisoners of war and said a possible suspect for the killings was in custody. \u201cThe investigation was initiated by interrogations of Russian prisoners of war, during which testimonies were obtained regarding the commission of the crime,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office in the north-eastern Kharkiv region posted on Telegram on Saturday. The servicemen are alleged to have been killed on the orders of Russian military command over the summer at an aggregate plant in Vovchansk, which has been the focus of fierce fighting. Russian prosecutors called for a seven-year sentence at the trial of a US citizen accused of fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine against Russia, Russian news agencies reported. Prosecutors asked the court to take into account 72-year-old Stephen Hubbard\u2019s age and said he had admitted guilt, according to Interfax on Saturday. They asked that he serve the sentence in a maximum-security penal colony. The US embassy in Moscow said it was aware of the reports of an American citizen\u2019s arrest but could not comment further \u201cdue to privacy restrictions\u201d.",
