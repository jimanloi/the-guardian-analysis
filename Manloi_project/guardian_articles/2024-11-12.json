The measure has sparked intense debate over whether cars should have regular access to the area.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nopropk.com/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaa_eTBKp7KM4lljQCfxWOqCdV8HpiG1ZD7dXOb9aJGwC4IiNpjAwwGv2yI_aem__vXkR0LPOBMYWyjUemxfjw\">Opponents</a> argue that shutting down the highway will increase traffic congestion and impose high <a href=\"https://www.sfcta.org/sites/default/files/2021-07/FINAL_Great_Highway_Evaluation_Report.pdf\">costs on the city</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.oceanbeachpark.org/\">supporters</a> believe the closure will help mitigate coastal erosion and create a safe pedestrian space for the community.</p> <p>The roots of the Prop K debate trace back to the Covid-19 pandemic, when the city\u2019s board of supervisors closed the Upper Great Highway to vehicles, allowing residents to walk and bike there while social distancing to reduce virus transmission.</p> <p>The decision\u2019s popularity led to a <a href=\"https://sfrecpark.org/1555/Great-Highway-Pilot-Project\">pilot program</a> in 2022 that closed the road to cars on weekends but allowed weekday access.</p> <p>The pilot concludes at the end of 2025. With the measure\u2019s approval, the city can now begin the process of permanently closing the section after the pilot ends.</p> <p>As of Monday afternoon, the vote stood at more than 54% in favor of Prop K, according to <a href=\"https://sfelections.org/results/20241105w/index.html\">San Francisco\u2019s department of elections</a>. The measure needs 50% or more to be approved.</p> <p>Critics argued that redirecting traffic from the Upper Great Highway to inland routes could add up to three minutes to commutes for drivers and create safety risks for pedestrians at intersections. \u201cMany of us on the west side feel unheard and overlooked,\u201d said Vin Budhai, founder of the Open the Great Highway/No on K Campaign. \u201cFamilies, seniors and workers who rely on this road will now have to spend more time in traffic.\u201d</p> <p>Jared Lozano, a resident, told <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/sf-prop-k-great-highway-closure-passes-supporters-say/\">CBS News Bay Area</a>: \u201cI\u2019ve already had a friend who\u2019s been T-boned at [a nearby] intersection,\u201d adding: \u201cI was almost run over at that intersection today. This is just going to create so many safety problems for the city.\u201d</p> <p>While the city has installed <a href=\"https://sfrecpark.org/DocumentCenter/View/24168/Great-Highway-June-2024-Report-to-BOS-Final\">speed bumps</a> in some areas to reduce speeding, opponents contend that the existing weekend-only closure was already a fair compromise for weekday commuters and recreational users.</p> <p>Supporters of the park conversion say it will enable public agencies to restore dunes and coastal habitats, strengthening them to withstand rising sea levels. They also argue that limiting vehicle access will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution in this sensitive coastal ecosystem, making the coast safer and more accessible for people using wheelchairs, roller skates and bikes.</p> <p>Supporters also point to the high costs of maintaining the highway, which is closed up to <a href=\"https://www.sf.gov/sites/default/files/2024-08/Legal%20Text%20--%20Reserving%20the%20Upper%20Great%20Highway%20as%20Public%20Open%20Recreation%20Space.pdf\">65 days per year</a> \u2013 18% of the time \u2013 due to sand accumulation.</p> <p>Keeping the highway accessible to cars costs the city between $350,000 and $700,000 annually for sand removal, with an additional $1.5m in one-time capital costs, according to the <a href=\"https://www.sf.gov/sites/default/files/2024-08/Prop%20K%20-%20Great%20Highway%20-%20CON%20VIP%20Letter%20-%20Signed.pdf\">San Francisco controller\u2019s office</a>.

The measure has sparked intense debate over whether cars should have regular access to the area. Opponents argue that shutting down the highway will increase traffic congestion and impose high costs on the city, while supporters believe the closure will help mitigate coastal erosion and create a safe pedestrian space for the community. The roots of the Prop K debate trace back to the Covid-19 pandemic, when the city\u2019s board of supervisors closed the Upper Great Highway to vehicles, allowing residents to walk and bike there while social distancing to reduce virus transmission. The decision\u2019s popularity led to a pilot program in 2022 that closed the road to cars on weekends but allowed weekday access. The pilot concludes at the end of 2025. With the measure\u2019s approval, the city can now begin the process of permanently closing the section after the pilot ends. As of Monday afternoon, the vote stood at more than 54% in favor of Prop K, according to San Francisco\u2019s department of elections. The measure needs 50% or more to be approved. Critics argued that redirecting traffic from the Upper Great Highway to inland routes could add up to three minutes to commutes for drivers and create safety risks for pedestrians at intersections. \u201cMany of us on the west side feel unheard and overlooked,\u201d said Vin Budhai, founder of the Open the Great Highway/No on K Campaign. \u201cFamilies, seniors and workers who rely on this road will now have to spend more time in traffic.\u201d Jared Lozano, a resident, told CBS News Bay Area: \u201cI\u2019ve already had a friend who\u2019s been T-boned at [a nearby] intersection,\u201d adding: \u201cI was almost run over at that intersection today. This is just going to create so many safety problems for the city.\u201d While the city has installed speed bumps in some areas to reduce speeding, opponents contend that the existing weekend-only closure was already a fair compromise for weekday commuters and recreational users. Supporters of the park conversion say it will enable public agencies to restore dunes and coastal habitats, strengthening them to withstand rising sea levels. They also argue that limiting vehicle access will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution in this sensitive coastal ecosystem, making the coast safer and more accessible for people using wheelchairs, roller skates and bikes. Supporters also point to the high costs of maintaining the highway, which is closed up to 65 days per year \u2013 18% of the time \u2013 due to sand accumulation. Keeping the highway accessible to cars costs the city between $350,000 and $700,000 annually for sand removal, with an additional $1.5m in one-time capital costs, according to the San Francisco controller\u2019s office. Proponents argue that converting the stretch to a park could save these funds for other uses. Prop K received notable endorsements from former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, the state senator Scott Wiener, and the incumbent San Francisco mayor, London Breed. Organizations and groups including the San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco Parks Alliance, and Sierra Club also extended their support. Opponents included Aaron Peskin, president of the board of supervisors; Daniel Lurie, the city\u2019s newly elected mayor and Mark Farrell, former interim mayor. The city supervisor, Joel Engardio, who supported the measure, expressed on Sunday his commitment to listening to residents who voted against Prop K. \u201cI understand and respect the views of voters who said no to Prop K,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI will work with residents to ensure that they have a voice in decisions about how to keep traffic moving quickly while minimizing the impacts on neighborhood streets.\u201d",

But the ultimate verdict on his cooking came in 2022 at Irene\u2019s, his pop-up restaurant inspired by his Mumbai upbringing, where he served a goat curry to an Indian grandmother.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to tell us if the curry is good or not,\u201d he remembers saying to his sous chef. She was the \u201creal\u201d restaurant critic: she\u2019d cooked more curries than he\u2019d ever had. At the meal\u2019s end, the chef nervously asked for her verdict. \u201cThis is probably one of the best curries I\u2019ve had in Australia,\u201d she said. Dsouza couldn\u2019t believe he had her approval. \u201cI think we won,\u201d he thought.</p>    <p>Irene\u2019s was named after his late aunt, and the winning goat curry had come from her hand-written, decades-old recipe that Dsouza managed to track down after her death.<br><br>Dsouza has jostled the pans at European-leaning restaurants such as Pellegrino 2000 and Cirrus, but says cooking the food from his culture \u2013 and family \u2013 has a special meaning. \u201cIt\u2019s very different than cooking a piece of fish with carrot puree and putting nasturtiums on there, because that\u2019s a job,\u201d says Dsouza. That goat curry, with its green mango hint, could power him back to childhood Sundays in his aunty\u2019s Mumbai apartment. \u201cWhen you cook something like that, it\u2019s more.\u201d</p> <p>That \u201cmore\u201d hasn\u2019t always been recognised by dining guides and restaurant awards. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be restaurant of the year if you\u2019re someone\u2019s favourite place that they visit on a weekly basis,\u201d says Nancy Lee, who wrote her PhD on celebrity chef culture. \u201cThose kinds of awards are targeted at those special-occasion places.\u201d</p> <p>Food publications have long celebrated \u201cwhite tablecloth type\u201d establishments with big-name chefs, but Lee says the culinary knowledge of migrants can get overlooked, or be seen as a given: \u201cSurely he can make a pad Thai because he\u2019s Thai\u201d. But being a Chinese dumpling master, for instance, requires incredible skills. \u201cI make pasta at home,\u201d she says. \u201cI could never do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/aug/29/shangahi-street-food-pork-dumplings\">xiao long bao</a>.\u201d</p> <p>For Ashley Vola, who runs Melbourne restaurant Vola Foods, it\u2019s important to stay true to her food culture.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody just thought African food was Ethiopian and that was it.\u201d Her plan to highlight <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/30/finding-fufu-australias-growing-appetite-for-west-african-food\">West African cuisine</a> was met with enthusiasm when she launched in 2021: 300 people turned up, and were willing to wait two hours for food, she says.</p>    <p>Vola has gradually shifted to focusing on the food of her birthplace, Cameroon, but it\u2019s been challenging.</p> <p>\u201cCustomers will call up and be like, \u2018Is this a Nigerian or Ghanaian restaurant?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll be like, \u2018It\u2019s Cameroonian.\u2019 And they hang up.\u201d</p> <p>But she credits tough diners in the community, including her sister Kelly (\u201cone of the most pickiest eaters I know\u201d), for helping fine-tune her food \u2013 and develop a backbone for criticism. \u201cI also worked in childcare,\u201d she says. \u201cKids are the hardest people to please.\u201d</p> <p>Recently she took a call from an older Nigerian man who wanted to leave a review for a meal he\u2019d had a month ago. His tone was aggressive: the kind your boss uses when you\u2019re about to be fired. She braced for the worst. Because he was using words in his language to name the dishes, she had trouble understanding him. \u201c[I said] \u2018I\u2019m so sorry uncle. I literally have no idea what that means\u2019 \u2026 Then he went, \u2018Your food is fantastic!\u2019 Oh my god! I literally just fell down.\u201d</p> <p>Because of this feedback from her community, she says, \u201cI\u2019m constantly reminded, every day, why I should stay open.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 November 2024. Chef Neville Dsouza did not work at Saint Peter, as stated in an earlier version. </p>",

That\u2019s a really difficult thing to overcome.\u201d So when non-believers become happy fans before the table\u2019s cleared, \u201cit\u2019s a double hit of that great feeling of hospitality that you get,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had parents out-visit our restaurant compared to their kids over time.\u201d Like Kudinar, chef Neville Dsouza has felt honoured when established food critics sized up his skills. But the ultimate verdict on his cooking came in 2022 at Irene\u2019s, his pop-up restaurant inspired by his Mumbai upbringing, where he served a goat curry to an Indian grandmother. \u201cShe\u2019s going to tell us if the curry is good or not,\u201d he remembers saying to his sous chef. She was the \u201creal\u201d restaurant critic: she\u2019d cooked more curries than he\u2019d ever had. At the meal\u2019s end, the chef nervously asked for her verdict. \u201cThis is probably one of the best curries I\u2019ve had in Australia,\u201d she said. Dsouza couldn\u2019t believe he had her approval. \u201cI think we won,\u201d he thought. Irene\u2019s was named after his late aunt, and the winning goat curry had come from her hand-written, decades-old recipe that Dsouza managed to track down after her death. Dsouza has jostled the pans at European-leaning restaurants such as Pellegrino 2000 and Cirrus, but says cooking the food from his culture \u2013 and family \u2013 has a special meaning. \u201cIt\u2019s very different than cooking a piece of fish with carrot puree and putting nasturtiums on there, because that\u2019s a job,\u201d says Dsouza. That goat curry, with its green mango hint, could power him back to childhood Sundays in his aunty\u2019s Mumbai apartment. \u201cWhen you cook something like that, it\u2019s more.\u201d That \u201cmore\u201d hasn\u2019t always been recognised by dining guides and restaurant awards. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be restaurant of the year if you\u2019re someone\u2019s favourite place that they visit on a weekly basis,\u201d says Nancy Lee, who wrote her PhD on celebrity chef culture. \u201cThose kinds of awards are targeted at those special-occasion places.\u201d Food publications have long celebrated \u201cwhite tablecloth type\u201d establishments with big-name chefs, but Lee says the culinary knowledge of migrants can get overlooked, or be seen as a given: \u201cSurely he can make a pad Thai because he\u2019s Thai\u201d. But being a Chinese dumpling master, for instance, requires incredible skills. \u201cI make pasta at home,\u201d she says. \u201cI could never do xiao long bao.\u201d For Ashley Vola, who runs Melbourne restaurant Vola Foods, it\u2019s important to stay true to her food culture. \u201cEverybody just thought African food was Ethiopian and that was it.\u201d Her plan to highlight West African cuisine was met with enthusiasm when she launched in 2021: 300 people turned up, and were willing to wait two hours for food, she says. Vola has gradually shifted to focusing on the food of her birthplace, Cameroon, but it\u2019s been challenging. \u201cCustomers will call up and be like, \u2018Is this a Nigerian or Ghanaian restaurant?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll be like, \u2018It\u2019s Cameroonian.\u2019 And they hang up.\u201d But she credits tough diners in the community, including her sister Kelly (\u201cone of the most pickiest eaters I know\u201d), for helping fine-tune her food \u2013 and develop a backbone for criticism. \u201cI also worked in childcare,\u201d she says. \u201cKids are the hardest people to please.\u201d Recently she took a call from an older Nigerian man who wanted to leave a review for a meal he\u2019d had a month ago. His tone was aggressive: the kind your boss uses when you\u2019re about to be fired. She braced for the worst. Because he was using words in his language to name the dishes, she had trouble understanding him. \u201c[I said] \u2018I\u2019m so sorry uncle. I literally have no idea what that means\u2019 \u2026 Then he went, \u2018Your food is fantastic!\u2019 Oh my god! I literally just fell down.\u201d Because of this feedback from her community, she says, \u201cI\u2019m constantly reminded, every day, why I should stay open.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 November 2024. Chef Neville Dsouza did not work at Saint Peter, as stated in an earlier version.",

A broken charger and lagging battery capacity brings Oliver\u2019s across-the-hall neighbor Claire (a luminous Helen J Shen) into his meticulously kept space. Shen\u2019s Claire, a more advanced Helperbot series 5 to Oliver\u2019s series 3 (one of a few effectively funny recurring bits), provides a much-needed counter to Oliver\u2019s more angular ways.</p> <p>She is more graceful, more contemplative, with a better grasp on human humor and fallibilities (and with a lovely, crystalline singing voice to boot). He is more prone to binaries, routine and relentless optimism; Criss\u2019s at first overtly physical performance \u2013 the startled, staccato movements and jerkiness of a machine \u2013 settles along with Clarie\u2019s scorn into beloved familiarity over the course of the show\u2019s 1 hour and 45 minutes. Both robots struggle with their obsolescence and hard drive memories of past humans, and the strange tale kicks into gear once they hit the road as reluctant buddies in a quest for answers.</p> <p>You do not have to understand the particulars of robot logic and emotion \u2013 the show doesn\u2019t really bother with it, anyway \u2013 to know the broad strokes of where this goes. There are shades of darkness to this humanoid future (humans preferring the smooth compliance of robots to their disappointing children or needy partners, for example) that are briefly mentioned in relatively seamless, for Broadway, video-montage flashback. But Maybe Happy Ending, as suggested by the title, is a predominantly bright love story, with clear echoes of Pixar: a Toy Story-esque plot of abandoned Helperbots who fall in love in what is essentially an island of misfit toys.</p> <p>And told through a truly stunning, full-spectrum use of the stage, the set harmoniously transformed from sterile apartment to Korean sex motel to forest and back again with aplomb. The power of this doomed love story \u2013 all batteries must die eventually \u2013 is only slightly dampened by somewhat pedestrian, indistinct musical theater songs, sans a major showstopper. The most trenchant emotional moments, as Oliver and Claire learn to love and maybe, eventually, leave each other as robots can do, belong not to the singers, but a swelling, occasionally onstage orchestra and digital evocations of hard drives.</p> <p>Which may hit one\u2019s hardened soul \u2013 it did mine, a bit \u2013 while still pulling some punches. You will likely leave without a song stuck in your head, but with a lump in your throat nonetheless.</p>",

This refreshingly original musical, first staged in Seoul in 2016 and directed here by Michael Arden (most recently of Broadway\u2019s excellent Parade revival), makes swift work of time and space; sheer layers of digital displays (video design by George Reeve), impressively constructed modular sets (scenic design and additional video design by Dane Laffrey) and Criss\u2019s rote movements succinctly illustrate the patter and (robot) heartbreak of Oliver\u2019s daily routine over 12 years in the Helperbot Yards, waiting for an owner who never comes back. That is, until girlbot meets boybot. A broken charger and lagging battery capacity brings Oliver\u2019s across-the-hall neighbor Claire (a luminous Helen J Shen) into his meticulously kept space. Shen\u2019s Claire, a more advanced Helperbot series 5 to Oliver\u2019s series 3 (one of a few effectively funny recurring bits), provides a much-needed counter to Oliver\u2019s more angular ways. She is more graceful, more contemplative, with a better grasp on human humor and fallibilities (and with a lovely, crystalline singing voice to boot). He is more prone to binaries, routine and relentless optimism; Criss\u2019s at first overtly physical performance \u2013 the startled, staccato movements and jerkiness of a machine \u2013 settles along with Clarie\u2019s scorn into beloved familiarity over the course of the show\u2019s 1 hour and 45 minutes. Both robots struggle with their obsolescence and hard drive memories of past humans, and the strange tale kicks into gear once they hit the road as reluctant buddies in a quest for answers. You do not have to understand the particulars of robot logic and emotion \u2013 the show doesn\u2019t really bother with it, anyway \u2013 to know the broad strokes of where this goes. There are shades of darkness to this humanoid future (humans preferring the smooth compliance of robots to their disappointing children or needy partners, for example) that are briefly mentioned in relatively seamless, for Broadway, video-montage flashback. But Maybe Happy Ending, as suggested by the title, is a predominantly bright love story, with clear echoes of Pixar: a Toy Story-esque plot of abandoned Helperbots who fall in love in what is essentially an island of misfit toys. And told through a truly stunning, full-spectrum use of the stage, the set harmoniously transformed from sterile apartment to Korean sex motel to forest and back again with aplomb. The power of this doomed love story \u2013 all batteries must die eventually \u2013 is only slightly dampened by somewhat pedestrian, indistinct musical theater songs, sans a major showstopper. The most trenchant emotional moments, as Oliver and Claire learn to love and maybe, eventually, leave each other as robots can do, belong not to the singers, but a swelling, occasionally onstage orchestra and digital evocations of hard drives. Which may hit one\u2019s hardened soul \u2013 it did mine, a bit \u2013 while still pulling some punches. You will likely leave without a song stuck in your head, but with a lump in your throat nonetheless.",

Alcaraz is due to play Andrey Rublev on Wednesday.</p> <p><strong>Daniil Medvedev</strong> won his first indoor match since last year\u2019s finals with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over <strong>Alex de Minaur</strong>. The 28-year-old Russian, who was docked a point for one of several outbursts as he lost his opening match to Taylor Fritz, this time won without facing a single break point.</p> <p>\u201cI went into this match blocking the noise, even from myself,\u201d Medvedev said afterwards. \u201cI really didn\u2019t care what was happening on the court, I just tried to play, and it was a good feeling. After the last match, I was too tired mentally to fight the way I usually do. I went into the match [today] just trying to hit some shots, even thinking about next year.\u201d</p> <p>Top seed <strong>Jannick Sinner</strong> beat <strong>Taylor Fritz</strong>, his defeated opponent in the US Open final, 6-4, 6-4 for his second win of the tournament.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a very tough match,\u201d said Sinner afterwards. \u201cWe got to know each other very well in a grand slam final. We knew exactly what to expect today, he was very aggressive and I was prepared. I just tried to serve very well in the important moments, which I did. That was a very crucial [seventh] game in the second set, I was down 0-30. If he breaks me there, the momentum could change.\u201d</p> <p>Britain\u2019s <strong>Henry Patten</strong> and partner <strong>Harri Helioevaara</strong> are on the brink of the doubles semi-finals after a second straight win, beating Australians <strong>Max Purcell</strong> and <strong>Jordan Thompson</strong> 7-6, 7-5 in a repeat of their Wimbledon final.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6733cc128f084e2f442696a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-12T21:52:01.926Z\">9.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Right, it\u2019s arrivederci from me, but do join us tomorrow for day four.</strong> We\u2019re planning to cover Carlos Alcaraz v Andrey Rublev from about 2pm local time/1pm GMT, so let\u2019s hope Alcaraz is well enough to play.

And welcome to our coverage of the ATP Finals group match between Jannik Sinner and Taylor Fritz, which wraps up the action on day three after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/12/alex-de-minaur-on-brink-of-atp-finals-exit-after-heavy-loss-to-daniil-medvedev\">transformed Daniil Medvedev defeated Alex de Minaur earlier</a>. Sinner and Fritz both opened with straight-sets victories on Sunday \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/10/taylor-fritz-keeps-his-cool-to-beat-angry-daniil-medvedev-at-atp-finals\">Sinner against De Minaur and Fritz against a self-combusting Medvedev</a> \u2013 so the winner tonight will take pole position in the Ilie Nastase group, with one more set of round-robin matches to come.</p> <p>What marks this evening\u2019s contest out is that it\u2019s a repeat of September\u2019s US Open final. Sinner surged past the American 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 in New York despite having most of the 23,000 spectators against him; this time the Italian will have the best part of 15,000 fans in Turin on his side \u2013 not that the world No 1 and winner of seven titles this season needs any extra help. He\u2019s very much the leading man at the first ATP Finals in 23 years not to feature Federer, Nadal or Djokovic, and he\u2019s the strong favourite to win the season-ending event for the first time, especially with an ailing Carlos Alcaraz reportedly ending his practice session after only 10 minutes earlier because of illness.</p> <p>There\u2019s talk in Turin about whether the Spaniard will be able to face Andrey Rublev in his second match tomorrow \u2013 even if he does play, the most likely challenger to Sinner for the title is now Alex Zverev, for my money \u2013 but first things first, we\u2019ve got Sinner v Fritz to focus on tonight. The players are due to get going at about <strong>8.30pm local time/7.30pm GMT</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Reigning French Open and Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s participation in the ATP Finals in Turin has been cast into doubt after he pulled out of practice with illness. His coach Juan Carlos Ferrero told Spanish media the 21-year-old cut short his session after just five minutes as a chest complaint was making breathing difficult. Alcaraz is due to play Andrey Rublev on Wednesday. Daniil Medvedev won his first indoor match since last year\u2019s finals with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Alex de Minaur. The 28-year-old Russian, who was docked a point for one of several outbursts as he lost his opening match to Taylor Fritz, this time won without facing a single break point. \u201cI went into this match blocking the noise, even from myself,\u201d Medvedev said afterwards. \u201cI really didn\u2019t care what was happening on the court, I just tried to play, and it was a good feeling. After the last match, I was too tired mentally to fight the way I usually do. I went into the match [today] just trying to hit some shots, even thinking about next year.\u201d Top seed Jannick Sinner beat Taylor Fritz, his defeated opponent in the US Open final, 6-4, 6-4 for his second win of the tournament. \u201cIt was a very tough match,\u201d said Sinner afterwards. \u201cWe got to know each other very well in a grand slam final. We knew exactly what to expect today, he was very aggressive and I was prepared. I just tried to serve very well in the important moments, which I did. That was a very crucial [seventh] game in the second set, I was down 0-30. If he breaks me there, the momentum could change.\u201d Britain\u2019s Henry Patten and partner Harri Helioevaara are on the brink of the doubles semi-finals after a second straight win, beating Australians Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson 7-6, 7-5 in a repeat of their Wimbledon final. Right, it\u2019s arrivederci from me, but do join us tomorrow for day four. We\u2019re planning to cover Carlos Alcaraz v Andrey Rublev from about 2pm local time/1pm GMT, so let\u2019s hope Alcaraz is well enough to play. The talk in Turin now is that he hopefully will be. Tomorrow\u2019s other group match is between Alex Zverev and Casper Ruud. We\u2019ll also have a report on Sinner\u2019s victory online shortly. Thanks for your company. Bye! While Sinner is in control of the Ilie Nastase group, all four players are still in contention. Sinner will play Medvedev on Thursday, while Fritz will face De Minaur. 1 Sinner W2 L0 2 Fritz W1 L1 3 Medvedev W1 L1 4 De Minaur W0 L2 I think Sinner\u2019s being a bit modest there. He landed so many returns against one of the strongest servers in the game and won 62% of the points on Fritz\u2019s second serve \u2013 ultimately that\u2019s what won him the match, when he capitalised on Fritz\u2019s first serve breaking down in the final game. Sinner \u2013 so understated when he speaks, in contrast to his fierce hitting \u2013 says on court: It was very tough match. We got to know each other very well at the US Open. I just tried to serve good in the important moments, I struggled to return his serve, but I\u2019m happy I could show some good tennis today. That\u2019s 23 wins now from Sinner\u2019s past 24 matches, and while the computer hasn\u2019t confirmed his place in the semi-finals, he\u2019s almost certain to be in them on Saturday. Fritz looks in control at 30-0. But Sinner returns a second serve with interest for 15-30. And here\u2019s another second-serve chance for Sinner, which he gratefully accepts, but not straight away. It takes a couple of shots before he can step into court and swat away the forehand winner. 30-all. 30-40, when Fritz dumps a backhand into the net. The American is chuntering to himself; Sinner, as always in the big moments, looks so calm and composed. Fritz again misses with his first serve on the match point, Sinner jumps into the second-serve return \u2026 the pair engage in a rally before Fritz makes the error! Fritz is furious with himself but Sinner is smiling, as are the crowd, who rise to salute their numero uno. That\u2019s two wins from two for Sinner in Turin. Second set: Sinner 6-4, 5-4 Fritz* (denotes next server) Sinner slips 0-15 down on serve for the sixth time in this match. But he still hasn\u2019t been broken, and this game sticks to a familiar script as Sinner speeds back to 40-15 and then claims the game. Fritz \u2013 as in the first set \u2013 will serve at 4-5. He was broken then. Can he hold firmer this time? Second set: *Sinner 6-4, 4-4 Fritz (denotes next server) \u201cAgainst most of the players in this tournament he\u2019d have won this match,\u201d says Laura Robson of Fritz, who has arguably played better than he did in the US Open final against Sinner. Fritz is on the ropes at 30-all on his serve \u2013 if he\u2019s broken here Sinner will be serving for the match \u2013 but he hauls himself off them with some gutsy hitting to take the next two points for the hold. Second set: Sinner 6-4, 4-3 Fritz* (denotes next server) 0-30 for Fritz on Sinner\u2019s serve \u2013 will the American finally be rewarded for his efforts this evening? No \u2013 because Sinner scampers back to 30-all and then sends a quite ridiculous backhand winner down the line which leaves him cupping his ear to the adoring crowd! He\u2019s definitely more of a saint than Sinner in these parts. Fritz fumbles long and Sinner gets another hold on the board. Second set: *Sinner 6-4, 3-3 Fritz (denotes next server) Fritz crouches down in an attempt to retrieve Sinner\u2019s return but he balloons wide. 0-15. He comes back for 15-all, but he doesn\u2019t even move to Sinner\u2019s drop shot on the third point. That couldn\u2019t have been struck better. Fritz sends down what feels like his 6383rd ace of the season (he\u2019s actually closing in on 700) for 30-all. His most trusted weapon can\u2019t help him on the next point, though, and Sinner secures a break point, which is close to a match point, but Fritz\u2019s serve finds its range again to dismiss the danger. Deuce. Advantage Fritz. Deuce. Advantage Fritz. Deuce. Advantage Fritz. Game Fritz; huge respect to the American for holding on. This may end in straight sets \u2013 as the other singles matches have so far this week \u2013 but it\u2019s been the most engaging contest of the lot. Second set: Sinner 6-4, 3-2 Fritz* (denotes next server) Jonathan Overend makes the good point on commentary that Sinner\u2019s attacking skills are so eye-catching that it\u2019s easy to overlook how strong he is defensively. But for me, he\u2019s probably second only to Djokovic in the defensive stakes, with the way he slides into the balls on this indoor hard court as if he\u2019s playing on clay. Those skills aren\u2019t enough to make any inroads into Fritz\u2019s service game, though, but he is spinning and sliding at 30-all on his own serve as he plays an incredible half-volley to make it 40-30. And Sinner holds once more. Second set: Sinner 6-4, 2-1 Fritz* (denotes next server) Sinner whips the crowd into an Italian frenzy with a pinpoint backhand pass for 15-0. Some heavy hitting from Fritz and it\u2019s 15-all. But an eighth forehand winner from Sinner brings up game point at 40-15. A flustered Fritz makes the error. And Sinner strides to his chair looking like a man who\u2019s focused on getting the job done in two sets. Second set: *Sinner 6-4, 1-1 Fritz (denotes next server) That\u2019s the first set Fritz has dropped this tournament, and it\u2019s a big, big ask to get past Sinner now; the Italian is so strong when he gets ahead. And Fritz is battling against the crowd too. The tables have very much turned from the US Open final; Sinner triumphed against the crowd there, but now Fritz must try to block out the partisan support for his opponent. Sinner opens the second set with a hold to 15; Fritz responds with a slightly less secure hold to 30. So Fritz, having recovered from 0-40 in his previous service game, steps up to serve to stay in the set. It\u2019s an inauspicious start for the American as he volleys long. He dices with danger on the next point as his shot just clips the baseline, and several shots later he goes for broke with a forehand that does land long. 0-30. 15-40, as Sinner drags Fritz all over the place before a cute drop shot settles matters. And Sinner needs only one set point, as he sends a fizzing forehand winner down the line! His forehand hasn\u2019t been totally firing in this set, but what a time to turn it on! There was so little in that set, but Sinner, as he has done so often this season, stepped it up when it mattered the most. First set: Sinner 5-4 Fritz* (denotes next server) Now it\u2019s Sinner\u2019s turn to recover from the setback of not breaking. He does so with ease, moving to 40-15 and finishing the game off by sending Fritz one way and then the other before dispatching a simple winning volley. This has been an absorbing first set, and Fritz must now hold serve to stay in it. First set: *Sinner 4-4 Fritz (denotes next server) I wonder whether Fritz will be able to keep his focus in this game after the disappointment of missing out on the break. And, indeed, the momentum does quickly shift, with Fritz falling 0-30 down. And then 0-40, three break points, Sinner\u2019s first of the match. Fritz fends off the first \u2013 he saves the second when Sinner spoons long. And Sinner\u2019s backhand flops into the net on the third! Sinner\u2019s dad looks a little stressed in the crowd, and Sinner must be anxious too, because there\u2019s a misjudgment from him at deuce when he thinks the ball is going long. And Fritz secures five points in a row to somehow hold! First set: Sinner 4-3 Fritz* (denotes next server) A Hawk-Eye glitch after the opening exchange, but eventually the confirmation comes that the point is Fritz\u2019s. Sinner rattles off three quick points \u2013 before Fritz prevails in two longer exchanges \u2013 credit to the American for the way he\u2019s staying with Sinner in many of these baseline rallies. Deuce. Advantage Sinner. Deuce, as the game clock ticks beyond five minutes \u2026 Sinner snatches at a backhand and here\u2019s the first break point of the match! No less than Fritz deserves for his efforts. But Sinner survives, and then flummoxes Fritz with a drop shot-lob combination \u2026 Fritz tries the tweener, but it was always going long. Advantage Sinner, and after another advantage he finally holds. First set: *Sinner 3-3 Fritz (denotes next server) 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game, as Fritz finds the sideline with a backhand winner. Fritz is making the task of facing the world numero uno on Italian soil almost look enjoyable. First set: Sinner 3-2 Fritz* (denotes next server) Fritz has another sniff on Sinner\u2019s serve at 15-30, and he then extends the game to deuce. The umpire berates some of the spectators for using the flash on their phones. Now Fritz is berating himself after Sinner secures advantage. Fritz is most definitely up for making a match of this; he\u2019s been so vocal and aggressive. Apart from a few poor unforced errors, he\u2019s been on his game so far. But Sinner holds after his second advantage. First set: *Sinner 2-2 Fritz (denotes next server) Fritz has Sinner scampering left and right, and even one of the finest athletes in the game can\u2019t get Fritz\u2019s forehand back. 30-0. Which is very quickly 40-15. Fritz thinks he\u2019s pulled off a one-two punch on game point, but Sinner scrambles the ball back \u2026 and shows even more ridiculous retrieval skills to extend the point before eventually just missing! The game is Fritz\u2019s but the Italians are still cheering loudly for their man after that rally \u2013 some of whom are wearing neon orange shirts in tribute to the ginger-haired Sinner which are being illuminated by the UV light in the stadium. First set: Sinner 2-1 Fritz* (denotes next server) At 15-all, Sinner goes back behind a wrong-footed Fritz with a winner. A good tactic against the 6ft 5in American. Fritz finds his feet, though, to recover for 30-all; a clutch point this \u2013 it was at this stage that Sinner was broken against Alex de Minaur in his opening match. But Fritz goes for too much and screams in frustration. Game point Sinner, and Fritz flumps a forehand into the net after a baseline rally. First set: *Sinner 1-1 Fritz (denotes next server) Fritz, also wearing a dark shirt but helpfully a bandana to differentiate him from his opponent, doesn\u2019t appear in the mood to hang about on serve either. 15-0, 30-0. But Sinner pulls him back to 30-all, moving his opponent around with ease on the fourth point as a flailing Fritz dumps a backhand into the net. Fritz edges to game point, but then makes another backhand error. Deuce \u2026 from which Fritz surprises Sinner with an unexpected drop shot (already Fritz is having to play out of his comfort zone, notes Laura Robson on the Sky commentary). And from there the American holds. First set: Sinner 1-0 Fritz* (denotes next server) So Sinner, wearing a blue polo shirt and white baseball cap, steps up to serve first. He wins a short, sharp first point. The second is longer, as the pair trade cross-court backhands, and it\u2019s Fritz who blinks first. 30-0. And an ace and unreturned serve make it game. The crowd are already cheering their local hero as if he\u2019s won. The umpire calls one minute, so there\u2019s just enough time to talk tactics. Fritz\u2019s standout weapon is that serve \u2013 followed by his forehand \u2013 and he\u2019ll need both to be fully firing against Sinner, who\u2019s also a big hitter, but can mix his easy power with searing slices and drop shots. Sinner\u2019s the better athlete, too, and will be looking to take charge of points by dragging Fritz around the court. Fritz will feel he has a chance of pulling off the upset after the standout season of his career, but Sinner, of course, has even more confidence after enjoying the best year of his; the Italian\u2019s ability to win two slams and find such consistency amid his ongoing doping case has been remarkable. It\u2019s hard to see beyond Sinner tonight. Now come the coin toss and warm-up. Sinner is giving away a few inches in height to Fritz, so the world No 1 does a big jump at the net to show who\u2019s really boss. The toss goes Sinner\u2019s way, and he elects to serve first. Ever the gentleman, he picks up the coin from the court to save the umpire the bother. In the meantime there\u2019s a light show going on. There are some dancers too. And the music is blasting out just to pump everyone up a bit more. And now the players step on to court, with the home hero Sinner getting by far the louder welcome. No surprises there. \u2026 or three. Sinner has been doing his final warm-ups and the players will be out in a minute or two: Taking out my calculator and scratching my head (a lot), Fritz will reach the semi-finals with a match to spare if he beats Sinner, while Sinner can\u2019t qualify tonight. I think. The complexities of round-robin tennis. Sinner was the runner-up in Turin last year, losing to Djokovic in straight sets, while Fritz is making his second appearance at the ATP Finals after a late call-up in 2022, when he reached the semi-finals. \u201cMy first time [in Turin], I was an alternate, no one really expected much of me,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cI was playing with house money, no pressure. Now, I\u2019m putting more expectation on myself to do better, I\u2019m just a better player.\u201d Back to this evening\u2019s matters. This will be the fourth meeting between Sinner and Fritz. Sinner has the edge in their head-to-head, leading 2-1, with Fritz\u2019s win coming back in 2021, before the real Jannik Sinner stood up. \u201cI have to be at my top if I want to win or get close,\u201d Sinner told the ATP website of facing Fritz. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough, this I know. I know that I will have to raise my level, so hopefully I can do that. I feel like he has improved a lot in the past one and a half, two years. He is serving much better, hitting the ball very, very hard. He\u2019s a great competitor.\u201d In other tennis news: As for Daniil Medvedev, having been booed for his racket-smashing antics against Fritz on Sunday, the Russian stuck his fingers in his ears after a much-improved display against Alex de Minaur earlier. \u201cI went into this match blocking the noise, even from myself,\u201d the 2020 champion said after his brilliant 6-2, 6-4 victory over the Australian. \u201cI really didn\u2019t care what was happening on court, I just tried to play, and it was a good feeling.\u201d The result means Medvedev is back in semi-final contention, while De Minaur will be knocked out with a match to spare on his ATP Finals debut if Sinner v Fritz goes to three sets. We\u2019ve already had a repeat of this year\u2019s Wimbledon men\u2019s doubles final today \u2013 and the result was the same too, with Britain\u2019s Henry Patten and his Finnish partner Harri Heliovaara defeating Australia\u2019s Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson 7-6 (3), 7-5. Patten and Heliovaara are through to the semi-finals with a match to spare, because Wesley Koolhof and Nikola Mektic have just beaten Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos, saving a match point in the second set before winning a match tie-break 10-8, with the late drama warming the crowd up nicely for Sinner v Fritz. They\u2019re already screaming loudly \u2013 just wait until Sinner steps on to court\u2026 While we\u2019re waiting: here are the highlights from their US Open final. Buonasera! And welcome to our coverage of the ATP Finals group match between Jannik Sinner and Taylor Fritz, which wraps up the action on day three after a transformed Daniil Medvedev defeated Alex de Minaur earlier. Sinner and Fritz both opened with straight-sets victories on Sunday \u2013 Sinner against De Minaur and Fritz against a self-combusting Medvedev \u2013 so the winner tonight will take pole position in the Ilie Nastase group, with one more set of round-robin matches to come. What marks this evening\u2019s contest out is that it\u2019s a repeat of September\u2019s US Open final. Sinner surged past the American 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 in New York despite having most of the 23,000 spectators against him; this time the Italian will have the best part of 15,000 fans in Turin on his side \u2013 not that the world No 1 and winner of seven titles this season needs any extra help. He\u2019s very much the leading man at the first ATP Finals in 23 years not to feature Federer, Nadal or Djokovic, and he\u2019s the strong favourite to win the season-ending event for the first time, especially with an ailing Carlos Alcaraz reportedly ending his practice session after only 10 minutes earlier because of illness. There\u2019s talk in Turin about whether the Spaniard will be able to face Andrey Rublev in his second match tomorrow \u2013 even if he does play, the most likely challenger to Sinner for the title is now Alex Zverev, for my money \u2013 but first things first, we\u2019ve got Sinner v Fritz to focus on tonight. The players are due to get going at about 8.30pm local time/7.30pm GMT. And do send me an email with any predictions or predilections; it\u2019s good to have you for company.",

      "bodyText": "Thank you so much for joining me for this match. Arsenal impress with a clinical away win which boost their hopes of progressing out of the group. Juventus will now have to win as many points as possible to make sure they get through. To catch all the action have a read of the report below. We will have more coverage of the competition this evening with Tom Garry at the Man City v Hammarby game and I will be back tomorrow to bring you live updates from Celtic v Chelsea. Until then, have a good evening. Baukje has emailed about the Eidevall/Slegers question: Don\u2019t think Arsenal would have bounced back with Eidevall. The \u201cclick\u201d/trust between him and the players was gone I felt. Also don\u2019t think it is Slegers causing a huge impact. Would have happened with another interim also. Do think Sleger fits, there was already trust with her and the players so she is the best interim for now. Looks like the players got rid of some pressure now that Eidevall is gone. That pressure happens when a team and a coach are not functioning anymore but no decision has been made about stepping down. Not necessary him as a person but as coach. If Slegers can keep the pressure off and keeps them scoring 4-5 goals a game good times are coming. Yeah there is definite change in this Arsenal team. Slegers has said she is in charge until at least the next international break so we will have to wait and see what happens beyond that point. I have to say I love the pun in this Arsenal post and I am also frustrated I didn\u2019t think of it myself: Arsenal sit in second with Bayern Munich top of their group. The German side beat Arsenal earlier in the competition and still have to play their third match of the group, which kick off at 8pm GMT. Juventus remain in third. Barcelona\u2019s game against St Polten has ended 7-0 with Claudia Pina and Caroline Graham Hansen adding goals in the second half. The defending champions still sit behind Manchester City in the group as City defeated them earlier in the competition. Here are the three second half goals scored by Arsenal: Would Arsenal have bounced back if Jonas Eidevall remained in the job? Or has Renee Slegers had a huge impact? Get in touch and let me know your thoughts. This was a professional and clinical win for Arsenal. They are firmly back in form and a deadly team in the WCL and WSL. Juventus\u2019 European hopes are not over yet but this will be a blow to their ambitions. 90 + 3 min: Can Arsenal score again here? Caldentey does not get a shot away but she does win a free kick. The chance does not go anywhere. 90 + 1 min: The delivery was okay but no one can connect. Juventus put is back in but it goes out for a goal kick after Bonansea hits it out. There will be four minutes added. 90 min: Juventus win a late corner as Williamson sees it out. 88 min: An Arsenal win was not out of the question at all but this result is compounding their impressive 5-0win over Brighton. Renee Slegers is doing a hell of a job in the interim Arsenal seat. Who would have predicted this? 86 min: Fox is off for Codina, a really solid performance from the American. Cooney-Cross is also on for Walti. 85 min: Arsenal are in the ascendency again with some intricate passing around the box. Juventus do enough to keep them at bay for now. 83 min: This will be a huge result for Arsenal if they can see this out. I mean it would be an exciting end if Juventus staged a comeback but they do not look good enough tonight. 81 min: Caldentey has now scored three goals in the WCL this season, Hurtig made the first move and Foord kept the move going. Caldentey then pounced and they have thoroughly beaten Juventus. She scores again! 80 min: Fox makes a great run but Peyraud-Magnin collects her cross, the USA player has been an asset for Arsenal tonight. 78 min: Hurtig is on for Arsenal, the player moved from Juventus to Arsenal a few seasons ago and so it is a slight homecoming for her this evening. 76 min: Kullberg just kept backing off Blackstenius and the forward took full advantage, running all the way and beating the keeper. Surely Arsenal are coming away with all three points now. Blackstenius doubles the lead with a sensational solo effort. 75 min: Juventus are trying their hardest to batter down the Arsenal defence but it is standing strong, it has been a good outing by the Gunners backline. 73 min: The corner is repelled but Williamson sends it back in only for Peyraud-Magnin to catch and clear. 71 min: Van Domselaar seems absolutely fine to continue so read into that what you will. Arsenal are onto the attack straight away with Caldentey having a punt at goal and Peyraud-Magnin sees it out for a corner. 70 min: Van Domselaar is down injured here and medical staff have run on to treat her. I\u2019m unsure if it\u2019s a tactical move or if the shotstopper is actually in a spot of bother. 68 min: A lovely move from Juventus but the final pass, trying to find Cantore, has too much on it so Arsenal can clear. 67 min: McCabe complains as Juventus players step over their line for the wall. McCabe sends it deep and Foord heads it into the path of Williamson but the defender\u2019s effort is over the bar. Juventus immediately counter and Vangsgaard takes a shot which is saved. This game is all or nothing in terms of action. 65 min: Arsenal win a free kick through a challenge on Williamson from Bonansea. It\u2019s in a good position and McCabe will take it. 63 min: The game has got a little scrappy and stop start but Arsenal are still the team with momentum. 61 min: Arsenal make a change with McCabe off for Blackstenius and Juventus also make a change with Bonansea on for the hosts. 60 min: Bergamaschi is ruled offside and she is heard saying \u2018no, no, no no\u2019 to the assistant referee. Juventus\u2019 frustrations clear to see. Arsenal counter and they are so close to a second with Fox hitting the woodwork, wow. 58 min: Foord has a great run and she creates a chance which reaches Walti but Beccari sees it out for a corner. The delivery is good and Williamson gets a good touch but Peyraud-Magnin makes a great save. 56 min: Cascarino, while she has made some errors, has been strong for Juventus tonight. She has made some critical clearances and has had a good battle with Mead. 55 min: Vangsgaard makes a brilliant run but she does not have any support and so when she crosses it is easy for Van Domselaar to catch. 53 min: Foord plays a good ball into the box but it is read well by Juventus\u2019 defenders who clear. 51 min: Some lovely passing from Arsenal again but Maanum is offside and so Juventus launch a counterattack. Bergamaschi crosses into the area but Fox is fouled in the box and so Arsenal are able to clear. 49 min: There have been some interesting challenges so far but no yellow cards being presented, the latest from Mead on Caruso. Mead will have to be careful with a tasty challenge in the first half. 47 min: There are no changes at half-time but Kuhl did look like she was warming up on the sidelines. So can Arsenal hold onto or extend their lead? Or will Juventus get back into this one? All to come. In the other 5.45pm GMT kick-off Barcelona are beating St Polten 5-0. Ewa Pajor with two goals with Keira Walsh, Kika Nazareth and Claudia Pina also on the scoresheet. Here is Maanum\u2019s goal: Juventus had so much early pressure but they could not convert it into a goal. Arsenal cranked up their possession and chances which eventually saw Frida Maanum knock down the door. The goal was the first time Juventus have conceded in four games. All to play for but Arsenal are on top. 45 + 1 min: There will be two minutes added. 44 min: Arsenal are playing some beautiful football here, just slicing through the Juventus team. Their latest attack ends with the ball cleared from the box. 42 min: Arsenal want another before half-time but this time Maanum lifts it over the bar for a goal kick. You have to say Renee Slegers is putting her hand up for the permanent manager position with these results, whether she will be considered is another thing but she has done a good job in the interim position. 40 min: Arsenal absolutely carve Juventus open and Maanum beats Peyraud-Magnin for it to trickle into the goal. Arsenal have their reward for all of their pressure. It\u2019s been coming. 38 min: Oh hang on, I think the decision went Juventus\u2019 way. I do not understand that call at all. But they are able to clear. 37 min: Some lovely long passes, particularly from Boattin\u2019s boot unlocks some attack but the final pass is loose and Arsenal can mop up the chance. As Arsenal look to counter Foord is brought down and wins a free kick from inside her own half. They piece some play together and then Russo wins a free kick, it is getting tasty out there. 35 min: Juventus are choosing the right options but they just aren\u2019t executing them clinically. The same can be said of Arsenal but the visitors have looked more capable of scoring in front of goal so far. 33 min: Mead gives away a cheap free kick with a barge on Cascarino. Juventus take it short and then the in-swinging ball has too much on it from Caruso and its out for a goal kick. 32 min: Juventus have spells of really slick football but their final pass or touch is letting them down at the moment. Arsenal are definitely having more opportunities but the hosts\u2019 counter attack is carving Arsenal open. 30 min: Peyraud-Magnin makes a wild save with a punch away but luckily for the keeper an Arsenal player was not in its path to knock in the rebound. She has made a few saves like that and if it continues the visitors could pounce. 28 min: Arsenal work it into the box but Cascarino clears, the Juventus player has been so good for the hosts so far. Juventus counter quickly and Beccari has another shot but Van Domselaar saves. 27 min: Russo wins a free kick in the midfield after a Boattin foul. Russo makes a slow return to her feet but she looks okay to continue. The free kick is played backwards and so it launches the latest Gunners attack. 25 min: My word, if that went in it would have be an absolute belter. Fox has taken a long range effort which is just over the bar. Peyraud-Magnin got a fingertip to it but the corner is not awarded for Arsenal. 23 min: As soon as I say Juventus are being quiet, they have a shot on target. Schatzer takes a punt but Van Domselaar was wise to it. 22 min: Foord passes to Russo, who takes a shot but Peyraud-Magnim makes a save but she can\u2019t control it. Cascarino needs to clear it before an Arsenal player can pick up the rebound. It has been all Arsenal for the past 15 minutes. 20 min: Fox has been at the heart of everything good Arsenal are doing so far, she is the linchpin in their attack at the moment. They just need a clinical final touch and they can score. 18 min: Williamson pops it back into the box but it is over the head of Russo and Juventus are able to clear once more. 16 min: Arsenal work it through the team expertly and Mead crosses into the box. Schatzer sees it out for a corner and Arsenal take it short, it ends with the ball hitting the referee and so we will restart with Arsenal possession. 14 min: Arsenal have found their fourth gear as Maanum finds Russo in the box, who rifles off a powerful shot but Peyraud-Magnin saves. Both sides have had promising opportunities so far. 13 min: Peyraud-Magnin roars to herself as staff leave her and she remains on the pitch. Arsenal immediately return to their attack and Fox crosses but the keeper pushes it clear. 11 min: Fox makes a great pass to Russo but she collides with Peyraud-Magnin, who looks to have come away with an injury. there\u2019s a break in play while she receives some treatment. 10 min: Juventus immediately counter and Beccari gets in a great position but her shot is less impressive with it fired directly at Van Domselaar who easily saves. 8 min: Mead and McCabe stand over the ball but it is the Republic of Ireland international who takes is and what a hit it is. It\u2019s on target but Peyraud-Magnin pushes it over the bar for a corner. The delivery was good but Williamson can\u2019t direct it goalward but that phase of play was more promising from the visitors. 6 min: Arsenal were being pinned in their final third but a long ball from Williamson unlocks their attack and Cascarino gives away a free kick. 4 min: Juventus have had the lionshare of possession early on and they have a chance here. Cantore looked to work it passed Van Domselaar but she read it well to see it out for a corner. The hosts take it short but it\u2019s cleared well. 2 min: Juventus have not conceded a goal since they lost to Bayern Munich earlier this competition. It will be tricky for Arsenal to break them down tonight. Here we go then. Can Arsenal get an away win? Or will Juventus take all the points? All to come. Here\u2019s your five minute countdown. Get your snacks and beverages ready, the show is about to begin. The players will be out on the pitch shortly in a crucial match which will help shape how this group looks come the end of the stage. Will Juventus leapfrog the Gunners into second place? All to come with kick-off in 15 minutes time. Let\u2019s get some snack chat underway shall we? I have once again opted for salted popcorn, a reliable snack choice. What are you digging into for this match? Email me or contact me on X (@rendellx). Arsenal\u2019s match against Bayern Munich will be moved away from the Emirates because of a clash with the men\u2019s team. Our very own Suzy Wrack wrote about the decision here: Juventus manager Max Canzi said: \u201cWe\u2019ll take them [Arsenal] on by playing our game, we\u2019ve worked on our style of play in these last few months and by now we have our own identity both with and without the ball, so we\u2019ll take them on by looking to play to our strengths, but aware of theirs too.\u201d Arsenal\u2019s Beth Mead spoke to press in the build-up to the game about interim boss Renee Slegers: \u201cWe\u2019ve obviously worked with Renee for quite a while now - in different roles to what she\u2019s in now - but I think she\u2019s taken to it like a duck to water. \u201cIt\u2019s been an easy transition. We know what she gives us - the confidence she gives us, we\u2019re playing good football. As individuals and as a collective, we\u2019re really happy with what Renee is doing for us right now. She deserves the credit.\u201d The team news is here. Juventus have named a strong team which includes Estelle Cascarino. Juventus: Peyraud-Magnin; Lenzini, Calligaris, Cascarino; Bergamaschi, Caruso, Schatzer, Boattin; Cantore, Vangsgaard, Beccari. Subs: Capelletti, Proulx, Kullberg, Lehmann, Rosucci, Girelli, Bonansea, Bennison, Bragonzi, Thomas, Krumbiegel, Gallo. Arsenal, meanwhile, once again opt for Daphne van Domselaar in goal. They also leave their top scorer in the competition, Mariona Caldentey, on the bench after she missed the Brighton game with muscle strain. Arsenal: Van Domselaar; Fox, Williamson, Catley, McCabe; Little, Maanum, Walti; Mead, Russo, Foord. Subs: Zinsberger, Williams, Wubben-Moy, Codina, Caldentey, Kafaji, Hurtig, Kuhl, Blackstenius, Wienroither, Cooney-Cross, Reid. Hello and welcome back to our Women\u2019s Champions League coverage where tonight we will be focusing on Juventus v Arsenal. The Gunners have had a slightly tumultuous season with Jonas Eidevall resigning but results have been getting the club back on track with their latest a 5-0 victory against Brighton in the WSL. Arsenal are currently second in their WCL group after losing to Bayern Munich but beating V\u00e5lerenga. Juventus, meanwhile, are third in the group, trailing Arsenal on goal difference. The top two from every group will progress to the knockout stage and so tonight\u2019s game is another crucial fixture for both teams. Arsenal face tough opposition in Juventus, who are currently top of the Serie A table with eight wins and a draw from nine games so far this season. We will take a look at what both camps have said in the build-up shortly but first let\u2019s take a look at the team news before kick-off at 5.45pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>Arsenal cruised to a 4-0 Women\u2019s Champions League win over Juventus in Italy to extend their unbeaten run to five matches. Frida Maanum opened the scoring for the visitors before a flurry of goals from Stina Blackstenius, Mariona Caldentey and Caitlin Foord in the second half ensured a comfortable victory.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was confident [the players could finish the job],\u201d a delighted Ren\u00e9e Slegers said. \u201cJuventus had an early chance and big events in games always give them direction. Scoring the second goal was a release \u2026 that made us feel comfortable.\u201d</p> \n<p>In what has been a difficult start to the season, one of Arsenal\u2019s brightest sparks has been the Norway international Maanum. Since Slegers took over as head coach on an interim basis, the 25-year-old has made the No 10 role her own.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/12/womens-champions-league-manchester-city-hammarby-match-report\">Manchester City maintain perfect WCL start as Fujino seals win over Hammarby</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Her first-half strike proved the breakthrough for her side as they found their rhythm under the gaze of the Italian Alps. It was an intelligent run from the playmaker, one that Arsenal fans have become accustomed to seeing, picked out perfectly by Foord. Maanum struck the ball confidently across the face of goal, the ball nestling neatly in the far corner for her sixth goal of the season.</p> \n<p>It was enough to give the Gunners the advantage at the break against a Juventus side riding high under Massimiliano Canzi. The hosts came into this fixture in form, sitting four points clear at the top of Serie A.</p> \n<p>Canzi opted to change things for the visit of the WSL side, leaving some of his most notable names out. The experienced duo of Cristiana Girelli and Barbara Bonansea gave him plenty of attacking experience to bring off the bench while Sofia Cantore and Arianna Caruso were part of the five who retained their places from the win over Milan on Saturday.</p> \n<p>Arsenal, however, have been building form of their own. Since the departure of Jonas Eidevall a month ago, Slegers has steadied the ship. Results have followed with their most impressive showing coming in the 5-0 win over Brighton at the Emirates on Friday night. Slegers made one change to the side that had dismantled the Seagulls so adeptly, Daphne van Domselaar coming in for Manuela Zinsberger in goal.</p> \n<p>This was the third matchday of this Champions League campaign and it was the English side who came in narrowly ahead of the Italians on goal difference.</p> \n<p>With the bite of early winter in the air, it was the Bianconere who warmed up the quicker of the two teams, stretching Arsenal\u2019s backline early and pressing with intensity. They had the first real opportunity when Cantore broke through only to be denied by an alert stop from Van Domselaar.</p> \n<p>It did not, however, take Arsenal long to find their rhythm and an entertaining first half ensued as Katie McCabe and Valentina Bergamaschi tested the goalkeepers. There was plenty of space to be exploited down the flanks but it was the visitors who looked slightly more cutting.</p> \n<p>There was a warning for Juventus five minutes before the opening goal when Maanum\u2019s run into the box was picked out. Minutes later, the hosts were undone by a similar run, this time the Norwegian making the move pay for the opening goal.</p> \n<p>The second half continued in much the same vein as the first, albeit with Juventus looking a little stretched as they tried to push for an equaliser. Amalie Vangsgaard did her best to run the channels for the Italian side but could not find a finish to beat Van Domselaar.</p> \n<p>Arsenal continued to press forward with a series of attacking substitutions adding impetus. Two of the fresh faces combined to double Arsenal\u2019s lead, Caldentey setting up Blackstenius for a near-post finish. Minutes later, the Spanish winger had one of her own, pouncing on a loose clearance with a sweetly struck finish.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"679bbdf0-ee73-41f1-9eb2-335870947f68\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The defending two-time WCL champions <b>Barcelona</b> thrashed <b>St P\u00f6lten</b> 7-0, before <b>Bayern Munich</b> kept up their perfect start by easing to a 3-0 win over newcomers&nbsp;<b>V\u00e5lerenga</b>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In Group D, Bar\u00e7a broke the deadlock after 32 minutes when Ona Batlle crossed from the left for Ewa Pajor to score from close range. That opened the floodgates as the next four came before half-time \u2013&nbsp;Francisca Nazareth,&nbsp;Aitana Bonmat\u00ed,&nbsp;Keira Walsh and Cl\u00e0udia Pina getting on the scoresheet. A second from Pina and a Caroline Graham Hansen strike finished the rout.<br> </p>\n    <p><br>In Germany, Pernille Harder found the back of the net for Bayern. The Denmark forward headed in the opener early on against V\u00e5lerenga for her fifth goal of this campaign to remain the competition\u2019s top scorer. Giulia Gwinn doubled the hosts' advantage from the penalty spot, with Sarah Zadrazil adding the third with a looping shot in second-half stoppage time.

Foord had had an industrious night down both wings and managed to get her name on the scoresheet with a close-range finish.</p> \n<p>Four goals, four different goalscorers, and a clean sheet will only help to increase belief within the Arsenal ranks ahead of the north London derby on Saturday.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt does build confidence but we have to stay very humble,\u201d Slegers said. \u201cI think the players showed that today. The way they still defended the box and the corners when we were leading 4-0. They kept on going until the last second \u2026 That is what makes us strong.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Arsenal cruised to a 4-0 Women\u2019s Champions League win over Juventus in Italy to extend their unbeaten run to five matches. Frida Maanum opened the scoring for the visitors before a flurry of goals from Stina Blackstenius, Mariona Caldentey and Caitlin Foord in the second half ensured a comfortable victory. \u201cI was confident [the players could finish the job],\u201d a delighted Ren\u00e9e Slegers said. \u201cJuventus had an early chance and big events in games always give them direction. Scoring the second goal was a release \u2026 that made us feel comfortable.\u201d In what has been a difficult start to the season, one of Arsenal\u2019s brightest sparks has been the Norway international Maanum. Since Slegers took over as head coach on an interim basis, the 25-year-old has made the No 10 role her own. Her first-half strike proved the breakthrough for her side as they found their rhythm under the gaze of the Italian Alps. It was an intelligent run from the playmaker, one that Arsenal fans have become accustomed to seeing, picked out perfectly by Foord. Maanum struck the ball confidently across the face of goal, the ball nestling neatly in the far corner for her sixth goal of the season. It was enough to give the Gunners the advantage at the break against a Juventus side riding high under Massimiliano Canzi. The hosts came into this fixture in form, sitting four points clear at the top of Serie A. Canzi opted to change things for the visit of the WSL side, leaving some of his most notable names out. The experienced duo of Cristiana Girelli and Barbara Bonansea gave him plenty of attacking experience to bring off the bench while Sofia Cantore and Arianna Caruso were part of the five who retained their places from the win over Milan on Saturday. Arsenal, however, have been building form of their own. Since the departure of Jonas Eidevall a month ago, Slegers has steadied the ship. Results have followed with their most impressive showing coming in the 5-0 win over Brighton at the Emirates on Friday night. Slegers made one change to the side that had dismantled the Seagulls so adeptly, Daphne van Domselaar coming in for Manuela Zinsberger in goal. This was the third matchday of this Champions League campaign and it was the English side who came in narrowly ahead of the Italians on goal difference. With the bite of early winter in the air, it was the Bianconere who warmed up the quicker of the two teams, stretching Arsenal\u2019s backline early and pressing with intensity. They had the first real opportunity when Cantore broke through only to be denied by an alert stop from Van Domselaar. It did not, however, take Arsenal long to find their rhythm and an entertaining first half ensued as Katie McCabe and Valentina Bergamaschi tested the goalkeepers. There was plenty of space to be exploited down the flanks but it was the visitors who looked slightly more cutting. There was a warning for Juventus five minutes before the opening goal when Maanum\u2019s run into the box was picked out. Minutes later, the hosts were undone by a similar run, this time the Norwegian making the move pay for the opening goal. The second half continued in much the same vein as the first, albeit with Juventus looking a little stretched as they tried to push for an equaliser. Amalie Vangsgaard did her best to run the channels for the Italian side but could not find a finish to beat Van Domselaar. Arsenal continued to press forward with a series of attacking substitutions adding impetus. Two of the fresh faces combined to double Arsenal\u2019s lead, Caldentey setting up Blackstenius for a near-post finish. Minutes later, the Spanish winger had one of her own, pouncing on a loose clearance with a sweetly struck finish. All the wind had been taken out of the hosts\u2019 sails and there was still time for Arsenal to add one more goal. Foord had had an industrious night down both wings and managed to get her name on the scoresheet with a close-range finish. Four goals, four different goalscorers, and a clean sheet will only help to increase belief within the Arsenal ranks ahead of the north London derby on Saturday. \u201cIt does build confidence but we have to stay very humble,\u201d Slegers said. \u201cI think the players showed that today. The way they still defended the box and the corners when we were leading 4-0. They kept on going until the last second \u2026 That is what makes us strong.\u201d",

Not sending off Jordan Pickford for an attempted amputation at Goodison Park. Not sending off Fabinho for performing on-spec achilles keyhole surgery on Evan Ferguson at the Amex.</p> <p>Plus of course, the decision to let yourself be filmed propped up on a sofa, saying all the bad stuff out loud, and in the process completing the amazing character arc of the English football referee, from taciturn northern master butcher, to the current crop of beleaguered full-time reality TV stars.</p> <p>At this point you really do have to hand it to English football. It just keeps on coming up with the most incredible content to fill the holes in an increasingly samey product.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/12/coote-halsey-attwell-other-great-referee-controversies\">Coote in the act: Halsey, Attwell and other great referee controversies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sky Sports\u2019 Tuesday morning coverage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/11/referee-david-coote-video-jurgen-klopp-liverpool-pgmol-premier-league\">Coote-Klopp-Cunt</a>, the morning after, was utterly gripping, the entire story presented with a surreal air of appalled solemnity, as though reporting on the breaking news that Father Christmas has been found naked under a pile of cocaine holding the gun that killed Bobby Kennedy.</p> <p>This mainly involved replaying the footage with key parts tastefully bleeped out, while the two presenters sat ashen-faced at their studio coffee table like community police officers whose job it is to turn up on your doorstep and tell you your dog has been run over. From there it was a huge relief to cut to a consolatory Dermot Gallagher sitting in front of a welsh dresser, incredibly wholesome content in the circumstances, and a first sign that nature might just be healing itself.</p> <p>Perhaps PGMOL should turn this whole cycle into a regular post-match feature: shit-talking late-night videos of a glassy-eyed referee explaining the weekend\u2019s big calls by insulting people on a sofa, which would at least be more interesting than Michael Owen agreeing with Howard Webb.</p> <p>In the middle of all this hilarity and disbelief, this theatre of rage, there are probably three things worth saying. First, Coote is clearly finished as a referee. Second, this is not actually evidence of corruption in football.</p> <p>But it is evidence of idiocy and incompetence, of humans stretched beyond their limits, and of a degree of chaos in football\u2019s basic administration that could be quite useful if, for once, it can be taken as a call to action. Clearly something has to change here. And the wider story really isn\u2019t a boggle-eyed man on a sofa.</p>    <p>At this point it is worth keeping a discrete handle on what has actually been said. The video lasts just over a minute. Coote appears accompanied by a beaming and treacherous companion, who is throughout very clearly loading, cocking and easing Coote\u2019s trigger finger on to the shotgun pointed at his foot.</p> <p>Asked about J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Coote calls him \u201ca cunt\u201d, \u201can absolute cunt\u201d and finally \u201ca German cunt\u201d. He complains about Klopp calling him a liar and deplores what he sees as his aggression and arrogance. The horrible companion ends the video with the phrase \u201cWe hate scousers\u201d. In a separate video Coote for the first time seems concerned, apparently about the possibility \u2013 Dave, seriously, the absolute 100% certainty \u2013 that this is going to end up on the internet at some point.</p> <p>And yes, first things first, Coote is done as an elite referee now. Not because he\u2019s necessarily biased on this evidence, or because he calls Klopp \u201ca cunt\u201d, but because he calls him \u201ca German cunt\u201d, which is arguably racist abuse under the English game\u2019s guidelines. A Wrexham supporter was given a three-year ban from football in April for calling Tranmere Rovers supporters \u201cEnglish bastards\u201d. We can\u2019t have the referee held to a lower standard. Part of Coote\u2019s role is to understand and report this kind of incident during a game. He can\u2019t do that now.</p> <p>The second point, and it will not be a popular one, is that we also need to be careful of David Coote now. Yes, he has behaved idiotically. The sentiments voiced by his companion about hating scousers are unacceptable, low rent and ultimately harmful. But Coote is also a fragile, breakable human being like the rest of us and this incident is going to make his life incredibly difficult for a long time.</p> <p>Let us also not overplay the offence here.

      "bodyText": "Farewell then, David Coote. You were the one who looks a bit like a hungover version of Ross from Friends. Let\u2019s take a look at your best bits. Not sending off Jordan Pickford for an attempted amputation at Goodison Park. Not sending off Fabinho for performing on-spec achilles keyhole surgery on Evan Ferguson at the Amex. Plus of course, the decision to let yourself be filmed propped up on a sofa, saying all the bad stuff out loud, and in the process completing the amazing character arc of the English football referee, from taciturn northern master butcher, to the current crop of beleaguered full-time reality TV stars. At this point you really do have to hand it to English football. It just keeps on coming up with the most incredible content to fill the holes in an increasingly samey product. Sky Sports\u2019 Tuesday morning coverage of Coote-Klopp-Cunt, the morning after, was utterly gripping, the entire story presented with a surreal air of appalled solemnity, as though reporting on the breaking news that Father Christmas has been found naked under a pile of cocaine holding the gun that killed Bobby Kennedy. This mainly involved replaying the footage with key parts tastefully bleeped out, while the two presenters sat ashen-faced at their studio coffee table like community police officers whose job it is to turn up on your doorstep and tell you your dog has been run over. From there it was a huge relief to cut to a consolatory Dermot Gallagher sitting in front of a welsh dresser, incredibly wholesome content in the circumstances, and a first sign that nature might just be healing itself. Perhaps PGMOL should turn this whole cycle into a regular post-match feature: shit-talking late-night videos of a glassy-eyed referee explaining the weekend\u2019s big calls by insulting people on a sofa, which would at least be more interesting than Michael Owen agreeing with Howard Webb. In the middle of all this hilarity and disbelief, this theatre of rage, there are probably three things worth saying. First, Coote is clearly finished as a referee. Second, this is not actually evidence of corruption in football. But it is evidence of idiocy and incompetence, of humans stretched beyond their limits, and of a degree of chaos in football\u2019s basic administration that could be quite useful if, for once, it can be taken as a call to action. Clearly something has to change here. And the wider story really isn\u2019t a boggle-eyed man on a sofa. At this point it is worth keeping a discrete handle on what has actually been said. The video lasts just over a minute. Coote appears accompanied by a beaming and treacherous companion, who is throughout very clearly loading, cocking and easing Coote\u2019s trigger finger on to the shotgun pointed at his foot. Asked about J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Coote calls him \u201ca cunt\u201d, \u201can absolute cunt\u201d and finally \u201ca German cunt\u201d. He complains about Klopp calling him a liar and deplores what he sees as his aggression and arrogance. The horrible companion ends the video with the phrase \u201cWe hate scousers\u201d. In a separate video Coote for the first time seems concerned, apparently about the possibility \u2013 Dave, seriously, the absolute 100% certainty \u2013 that this is going to end up on the internet at some point. And yes, first things first, Coote is done as an elite referee now. Not because he\u2019s necessarily biased on this evidence, or because he calls Klopp \u201ca cunt\u201d, but because he calls him \u201ca German cunt\u201d, which is arguably racist abuse under the English game\u2019s guidelines. A Wrexham supporter was given a three-year ban from football in April for calling Tranmere Rovers supporters \u201cEnglish bastards\u201d. We can\u2019t have the referee held to a lower standard. Part of Coote\u2019s role is to understand and report this kind of incident during a game. He can\u2019t do that now. The second point, and it will not be a popular one, is that we also need to be careful of David Coote now. Yes, he has behaved idiotically. The sentiments voiced by his companion about hating scousers are unacceptable, low rent and ultimately harmful. But Coote is also a fragile, breakable human being like the rest of us and this incident is going to make his life incredibly difficult for a long time. Let us also not overplay the offence here. Who among us has not said very bad words about someone at work. Here\u2019s a secret: everyone hates everyone else in football. Everyone, even nice saintly people with honorifics after their name, calls everyone else this kind of thing all the time. And the life of a referee is at the sharp end of this, a business of unalloyed and near-constant abuse, essentially an uncontrolled social experiment on the breaking points of assorted slightly officious human beings. Is it really a huge surprise David Coote or similar should end up brutalised and spitting toxins on a sofa? The Burnley game Coote refers to in the video ended with him being confronted by Andy Robertson with the words (among many others): \u201cFuck me. What\u2019s the point of having you in the middle? What\u2019s the point of having you? Eh? Fuck me, honestly.\u201d What is the reasonable response to this as a working environment? What kind of human do we want David Coote to be? Because a normal person is going to end up spitting it all back out at some point. Being recorded while doing so is an unfortunate choice. But while this may be wretched behaviour, it is hardly inexplicable. It is, however, a disastrous turn of events in a much wider sense.

      "body": "<p>When Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano were locked in battle during the last round of their first fight at Madison Square Garden, on a fevered night in April 2022, I could not help myself. Alongside an entire row of ringside reporters, I stood up to watch the final minute of a riveting contest. Suddenly oblivious to the march of our urgent deadlines and the etiquette of remaining above such raw human emotion, we were swept away by the courage and determination of both women in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/30/katie-taylorn-amanda-serrano\">one of the greatest fights ever staged at the Garden</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt was only afterwards, when you\u2019re looking back and hearing people\u2019s reactions that you think: \u2018Gosh, that was a huge moment for women in boxing\u2019,\u201d Taylor says now. \u201cYou\u2019re hearing stories of young girls being inspired by that night and how people are calling it historic. It\u2019s then that you just say: \u2018Wow, that was an amazing night.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI think my favourite moment was just before the decision was announced and the two of us were going round the ring with our arms around each other\u2019s shoulders, just taking the applause from the crowd. The respect we had for each other, and what we had just done for the sport, meant that we were definitely very proud. So to have the chance to fight her again is so special\u201d</p> <p>It seems bizarre that their long-awaited rematch should now take place on Friday night as the main support to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/10/mike-tyson-jake-paul-boxing-netflix\">circus stunt in Arlington, Texas</a>, which sees a 58-year-old Mike Tyson fight Jake Paul, the 27-year-old YouTube influencer who is trying to become a boxer. Tyson last fought professionally more than 19 years ago, when he was beaten up and stopped by Kevin McBride, an Irish journeyman, and his lifestyle since then has been typically wayward, marked by continued drink and drug problems.</p> <p>The scrap between Tyson and Paul would be laughable if it did not carry a serious risk. Tyson was once the most ferocious fighter on the planet but he is now a wrecked old shadow of a feared world heavyweight champion. Paul has been working methodically to improve his rudimentary knowledge of boxing and the age difference between him and Tyson is 31 years. He is also fit and carries a decent punch. But the idea that he should share a ring with the most renowned boxer the world has seen since Muhammad Ali is an embarrassment.</p> <p>In stark contrast, the first fight between Taylor and Serrano captured all that is best about boxing \u2013 and the rematch is full of intrigue and real significance. Taylor lost her long unbeaten record in May 2023, when she moved up in weight and Chantelle Cameron won a majority decision against her in Dublin. It was suggested then that Taylor, who is now 38, should retire after her long and glorious amateur and professional career. Taylor was quietly indignant and, a year ago, she became the undisputed world&nbsp;super-lightweight champion when she outpointed Cameron in the rematch.</p>    <p>She and Serrano were due to meet in Texas this July but the entire promotion had to be postponed after Tyson fell ill because of a flare-up of his stomach ulcer. It was another sign that Tyson-Paul should be scrapped but, with hundreds of millions of dollars being generated on Netflix, the entire show was rescheduled for this week.</p> <p>Taylor generally avoids interviews but it helps that we have spoken often over the years. She is typically friendly and polite and in a positive mood. She, understandably, has also chosen to be a diplomat while focusing on the undoubted chance for her and Serrano to display their grit and skill to a completely new audience.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an amazing opportunity because millions upon millions of people will be tuning into this fight,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cI think people are going to see women\u2019s boxing at its very best and that\u2019s amazingly special for the sport.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor listens to my misgivings about the night at the AT&amp;T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys, and the fact that Tyson should not be allowed back in the ring for a competitive fight. \u201cI do definitely have those same concerns,\u201d she admits, \u201cbut he did look very good against Roy Jones [in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/29/mike-tyson-roy-jones-jr-fight-exhibition-report\">drawn eight-round exhibition</a> in November 2020]. He definitely hasn\u2019t lived the cleanest life since then but I think over the last few years he\u2019s cleaned himself up. We\u2019re hoping that shows through on the night, but he obviously has amazing experience and nothing is going to faze Mike Tyson.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor is an ambassador for the old-school boxing company, Everlast, which has been making fight clothing and equipment since 1910, and aligns herself firmly with traditionalists of the ring. Taylor clearly loves the sport with an enduring fervour and sounds hopeful when I ask if Tyson could beat his much younger rival. \u201cI think so. I\u2019ve seen clips of him training recently and he looks very good on the pads. But Jake is a fit man, a young man and a good athlete as well. He seems to have an OK punch and he\u2019s starting to prove himself as a fighter. It\u2019s very interesting, but I have a real soft spot for Mike Tyson.</p> <p>\u201cI think if you\u2019re a boxing person, it really matters that he does well and hopefully wins because Mike Tyson is an absolute legend in sport. He was once known as the baddest man on the planet. He\u2019s super exciting to watch, a real iconic boxer. I have so much respect for him for what he did in the sport and I\u2019d hate for a legend like him to lose a matchup like this. He\u2019s a hero to many of us fighters.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor and Tyson are seen as the away fighters on the bill as Serrano is promoted by Paul \u2013 whose company is staging the event in conjunction with Netflix. Their kinship has been strengthened by a long exchange they had before the first press conference back in May. \u201cWe had a great conversation and his knowledge of the sport is second to none. He\u2019s a great boxing historian so having a chance to sit down and speak to someone who is so knowledgeable, and has a great mindset, was pretty special for me.\u201d</p> <p>She hates talk of retiring but Taylor laughs when I ask if she could imagine doing something similar when she is 58? \u201cNo! Once I do retire from the sport that will be it. I\u2019ve been punched enough over the last 20 years.\u201d</p>    <p>Some of us hope that Taylor, who has done more than anyone for women\u2019s boxing, will soon choose life on the safe side of the ropes. But she talks seriously, and passionately, about her desire to keep fighting for a few more years. She wants \u201ca very special\u201d decider in a trilogy with Cameron and, she says, \u201cthere definitely are other people I\u2019d love to fight. Alycia Baumgardner and Caroline Dubois are both fantastic fighters as well. It\u2019s amazing to have so many options out there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Yet she now faces an extraordinarily difficult night against Serrano. Is she ready to go back into that dark and painful place where she was on that brutal night of their first fight? \u201cI am very aware that I could go back into that place,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I train so hard \u2013 to prepare for those fights. I\u2019m in dark places throughout training camp, and the male and female sparring partners that I\u2019ve had over with me these last few weeks have been phenomenal. I had to show a lot of heart during those sparring sessions and throughout. So this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve gone through a dark place. I know what it feels like to dig deep and I am going to be prepared. I\u2019m ready for this battle.\u201d</p> <p>Midway through the first fight, Taylor was in such trouble that it looked as if Serrano was about to stop her. \u201cAfterwards people were talking about the fifth round and I was like: \u2018What happened?\u2019\u201d Taylor says with a complicated smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realise what had actually happened. I was lost in the fight and, really, I\u2019m just there to throw punches. But I think at the end of that fifth round, I was throwing punches back at her. My head soon cleared and I won the second half of the fight.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor loves to fight in the trenches but she has the skill to outbox Serrano if she follows a more tactical approach. \u201cYeah, I definitely do,\u201d she agrees. \u201cI just have to be more disciplined in doing it and that\u2019s something that I\u2019m trying to focus on. But I do realise that\u2019s not the smartest move sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>She grins wryly but then shakes her head when I ask if she is concerned how the fight may be judged as this is a Jake Paul promotion in Texas. \u201cThat\u2019s not something I ever think of,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the best thing for a fighter to be thinking of as you step into the ring. My job is just to fight and you obviously hope and pray that the judging is very fair. I just want the right winner to win the fight. But I have more important things to be focusing on.\u201d</p> <p>There is a purity about Taylor\u2019s love of boxing and she approaches the fight game very differently to most. It\u2019s striking that she and Brian Peters, who has managed Taylor since she turned professional in 2016, have never signed a contract to cement their working relationship. They prefer to rely on their mutual trust and the fact they are both boxing people to the core.</p> <p>So it is easy for Taylor, who is deeply religious, to rise above the charade of Tyson against Paul and revel in the gravitas of her own fight. \u201cI think our styles mix very well,\u201d she says of Serrano. \u201cShe is obviously a great fighter. I love to box but I do get drawn into a fight like this one. Both our mentalities are that we\u2019re going to do whatever it takes to win the fight so it\u2019s going to be another explosive night. I\u2019m just excited to go in there and perform because I think my best will beat Serrano\u2019s .\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/11/mike-tyson-v-jake-paul-this-is-the-apex-event-of-content-masquerading-as-sport-boxing-ufc\">Mike Tyson v Jake Paul is the apex event of content masquerading as sport | Sean Ingle</a> </p> </aside>   <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/10/mike-tyson-jake-paul-boxing-netflix\">\u2018It\u2019s dumb, but I\u2019ll watch it\u2019: why Tyson\u2019s Netflix brawl is big box office</a> </p> </aside>",

The scrap between Tyson and Paul would be laughable if it did not carry a serious risk. Tyson was once the most ferocious fighter on the planet but he is now a wrecked old shadow of a feared world heavyweight champion. Paul has been working methodically to improve his rudimentary knowledge of boxing and the age difference between him and Tyson is 31 years. He is also fit and carries a decent punch. But the idea that he should share a ring with the most renowned boxer the world has seen since Muhammad Ali is an embarrassment. In stark contrast, the first fight between Taylor and Serrano captured all that is best about boxing \u2013 and the rematch is full of intrigue and real significance. Taylor lost her long unbeaten record in May 2023, when she moved up in weight and Chantelle Cameron won a majority decision against her in Dublin. It was suggested then that Taylor, who is now 38, should retire after her long and glorious amateur and professional career. Taylor was quietly indignant and, a year ago, she became the undisputed world super-lightweight champion when she outpointed Cameron in the rematch. She and Serrano were due to meet in Texas this July but the entire promotion had to be postponed after Tyson fell ill because of a flare-up of his stomach ulcer. It was another sign that Tyson-Paul should be scrapped but, with hundreds of millions of dollars being generated on Netflix, the entire show was rescheduled for this week. Taylor generally avoids interviews but it helps that we have spoken often over the years. She is typically friendly and polite and in a positive mood. She, understandably, has also chosen to be a diplomat while focusing on the undoubted chance for her and Serrano to display their grit and skill to a completely new audience. \u201cIt\u2019s just an amazing opportunity because millions upon millions of people will be tuning into this fight,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cI think people are going to see women\u2019s boxing at its very best and that\u2019s amazingly special for the sport.\u201d Taylor listens to my misgivings about the night at the AT&amp;T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys, and the fact that Tyson should not be allowed back in the ring for a competitive fight. \u201cI do definitely have those same concerns,\u201d she admits, \u201cbut he did look very good against Roy Jones [in a drawn eight-round exhibition in November 2020]. He definitely hasn\u2019t lived the cleanest life since then but I think over the last few years he\u2019s cleaned himself up. We\u2019re hoping that shows through on the night, but he obviously has amazing experience and nothing is going to faze Mike Tyson.\u201d Taylor is an ambassador for the old-school boxing company, Everlast, which has been making fight clothing and equipment since 1910, and aligns herself firmly with traditionalists of the ring. Taylor clearly loves the sport with an enduring fervour and sounds hopeful when I ask if Tyson could beat his much younger rival. \u201cI think so. I\u2019ve seen clips of him training recently and he looks very good on the pads. But Jake is a fit man, a young man and a good athlete as well. He seems to have an OK punch and he\u2019s starting to prove himself as a fighter. It\u2019s very interesting, but I have a real soft spot for Mike Tyson. \u201cI think if you\u2019re a boxing person, it really matters that he does well and hopefully wins because Mike Tyson is an absolute legend in sport. He was once known as the baddest man on the planet. He\u2019s super exciting to watch, a real iconic boxer. I have so much respect for him for what he did in the sport and I\u2019d hate for a legend like him to lose a matchup like this. He\u2019s a hero to many of us fighters.\u201d Taylor and Tyson are seen as the away fighters on the bill as Serrano is promoted by Paul \u2013 whose company is staging the event in conjunction with Netflix. Their kinship has been strengthened by a long exchange they had before the first press conference back in May. \u201cWe had a great conversation and his knowledge of the sport is second to none. He\u2019s a great boxing historian so having a chance to sit down and speak to someone who is so knowledgeable, and has a great mindset, was pretty special for me.\u201d She hates talk of retiring but Taylor laughs when I ask if she could imagine doing something similar when she is 58? \u201cNo! Once I do retire from the sport that will be it. I\u2019ve been punched enough over the last 20 years.\u201d Some of us hope that Taylor, who has done more than anyone for women\u2019s boxing, will soon choose life on the safe side of the ropes. But she talks seriously, and passionately, about her desire to keep fighting for a few more years. She wants \u201ca very special\u201d decider in a trilogy with Cameron and, she says, \u201cthere definitely are other people I\u2019d love to fight. Alycia Baumgardner and Caroline Dubois are both fantastic fighters as well. It\u2019s amazing to have so many options out there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Yet she now faces an extraordinarily difficult night against Serrano. Is she ready to go back into that dark and painful place where she was on that brutal night of their first fight? \u201cI am very aware that I could go back into that place,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I train so hard \u2013 to prepare for those fights. I\u2019m in dark places throughout training camp, and the male and female sparring partners that I\u2019ve had over with me these last few weeks have been phenomenal. I had to show a lot of heart during those sparring sessions and throughout. So this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve gone through a dark place. I know what it feels like to dig deep and I am going to be prepared. I\u2019m ready for this battle.\u201d Midway through the first fight, Taylor was in such trouble that it looked as if Serrano was about to stop her. \u201cAfterwards people were talking about the fifth round and I was like: \u2018What happened?\u2019\u201d Taylor says with a complicated smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realise what had actually happened. I was lost in the fight and, really, I\u2019m just there to throw punches. But I think at the end of that fifth round, I was throwing punches back at her. My head soon cleared and I won the second half of the fight.\u201d Taylor loves to fight in the trenches but she has the skill to outbox Serrano if she follows a more tactical approach. \u201cYeah, I definitely do,\u201d she agrees. \u201cI just have to be more disciplined in doing it and that\u2019s something that I\u2019m trying to focus on. But I do realise that\u2019s not the smartest move sometimes.\u201d She grins wryly but then shakes her head when I ask if she is concerned how the fight may be judged as this is a Jake Paul promotion in Texas. \u201cThat\u2019s not something I ever think of,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the best thing for a fighter to be thinking of as you step into the ring. My job is just to fight and you obviously hope and pray that the judging is very fair. I just want the right winner to win the fight. But I have more important things to be focusing on.\u201d There is a purity about Taylor\u2019s love of boxing and she approaches the fight game very differently to most. It\u2019s striking that she and Brian Peters, who has managed Taylor since she turned professional in 2016, have never signed a contract to cement their working relationship. They prefer to rely on their mutual trust and the fact they are both boxing people to the core. So it is easy for Taylor, who is deeply religious, to rise above the charade of Tyson against Paul and revel in the gravitas of her own fight. \u201cI think our styles mix very well,\u201d she says of Serrano. \u201cShe is obviously a great fighter. I love to box but I do get drawn into a fight like this one. Both our mentalities are that we\u2019re going to do whatever it takes to win the fight so it\u2019s going to be another explosive night. I\u2019m just excited to go in there and perform because I think my best will beat Serrano\u2019s .\u201d",

It\u2019s the first time in modern history that voters here have ousted leadership from either position.</p> <p>Sheng Thao, the mayor, and Pamela Price, the district attorney for Alameda county, were both the target of recall campaigns, launched amid discontent over the city\u2019s challenges: a spiralling housing crisis, rising costs and the departure of the city\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/24/oakland-sports-teams-east-bay-athletics-raiders-warriors\">last remaining major league sports team</a>.</p> <p>But the recall campaigns particularly centered on residents\u2019 enduring frustrations about the area\u2019s crime rates. Like many cities in the US, Oakland experienced a surge in violent crime during the pandemic, one that took longer than elsewhere to subside. Statistics had shown both violent and non-violent crime finally trending down \u2013 before the election, the Oakland police announced a 30% drop in homicides this year compared to 2023. Non-fatal shootings were down 20% and robberies were down 24%. Still, many residents remained deeply frustrated. </p> <p>The overwhelming support for both recalls came amid a broader sentiment in the state that crime had become out of control. Californians also supported a tough-on-crime measure, Prop 36, to enact harsher penalties for retail theft, property crimes and drug offenses and undo some of the landmark criminal justice reforms from a decade ago. They also voted down Prop 6, a measure to ban forced prison labor. Foundational Oakland Unites, a <a href=\"https://oaklandside.org/2024/05/01/whos-funding-the-recall-campaign-against-oakland-mayor-sheng-thao/\">committee set up</a> to fund signature gathering before the mayoral recall, sent residents a \u201cCommon Sense Voter Guide\u201d that encouraged a yes on 36 and no on 6.</p> <p>While the campaigns tapped into deep frustrations among residents, they were funded in large part by a handful of the region\u2019s wealthy residents. Over the summer, the local news site the Oaklandside revealed that Philip Dreyfuss, a hedge-fund manager who lives in the wealthy enclave of Piedmont, had been the biggest funder to the effort to recall the mayor. Ron Conway, a billionaire tech investor, was another major funder.</p> <p>Thao, the mayor, came into office just two years ago, the first Hmong American to lead a major city. She faced opposition from the start of her tenure, including from the city\u2019s police department \u2013 she fired the police chief early in her term \u2013 and her moderate opponent in the mayoral contest.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are fed up with crime and homelessness,\u201d Dan Lindheim, a former Oakland city administrator and now professor at UC Berkeley\u2019s Goldman School of Public Policy, told the Guardian in October. \u201cAnd they want to hold somebody accountable. It was like: \u2018We don\u2019t like what they\u2019re doing, so \u2013 symbolically \u2013 it\u2019s off with their heads.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Criticism intensified after the FBI raided Thao\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/20/oakland-mayor-sheng-thao-fbi-raid\">home</a> in a sprawling corruption investigation. The agency has neither implicated the mayor in any wrongdoing, nor absolved her of involvement. Thao has maintained her innocence.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just piling one thing on top of another,\u201d Lindheim said. \u201cThat was the seal of death for her mayoral position.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement last week, Thao said she was proud of her administration\u2019s accomplishments and was \u201ccommitted to ensuring we stay on track by supporting a smooth transition\u201d.</p> <p>Price, the district attorney for Alameda county, which includes Oakland, was also ousted in a recall campaign that began just months after she took office. She was the first Black woman to hold the job. A former civil rights attorney, Price had come into office promising to reform the justice system, stop \u201cover-criminalizing\u201d young people and hold law enforcement to better account.</p> <p>The Alameda county board of supervisors is expected to appoint an interim district attorney.</p> <p>Thao must vacate the office as soon as election results are certified on 5 December and the Oakland city council declares a vacancy at its next meeting, Nikki Fortunato Bas, the city council president, said in a statement.</p> <p>A special election for a new mayor will be held within 120 days, or roughly four months.</p> <p>Until then, Bas will serve as interim mayor, unless she wins a seat on the Alameda county board of supervisors. As of Monday, Bas was trailing in that race.</p>",

But the recall campaigns particularly centered on residents\u2019 enduring frustrations about the area\u2019s crime rates. Like many cities in the US, Oakland experienced a surge in violent crime during the pandemic, one that took longer than elsewhere to subside. Statistics had shown both violent and non-violent crime finally trending down \u2013 before the election, the Oakland police announced a 30% drop in homicides this year compared to 2023. Non-fatal shootings were down 20% and robberies were down 24%. Still, many residents remained deeply frustrated. The overwhelming support for both recalls came amid a broader sentiment in the state that crime had become out of control. Californians also supported a tough-on-crime measure, Prop 36, to enact harsher penalties for retail theft, property crimes and drug offenses and undo some of the landmark criminal justice reforms from a decade ago. They also voted down Prop 6, a measure to ban forced prison labor. Foundational Oakland Unites, a committee set up to fund signature gathering before the mayoral recall, sent residents a \u201cCommon Sense Voter Guide\u201d that encouraged a yes on 36 and no on 6. While the campaigns tapped into deep frustrations among residents, they were funded in large part by a handful of the region\u2019s wealthy residents. Over the summer, the local news site the Oaklandside revealed that Philip Dreyfuss, a hedge-fund manager who lives in the wealthy enclave of Piedmont, had been the biggest funder to the effort to recall the mayor. Ron Conway, a billionaire tech investor, was another major funder. Thao, the mayor, came into office just two years ago, the first Hmong American to lead a major city. She faced opposition from the start of her tenure, including from the city\u2019s police department \u2013 she fired the police chief early in her term \u2013 and her moderate opponent in the mayoral contest. \u201cPeople are fed up with crime and homelessness,\u201d Dan Lindheim, a former Oakland city administrator and now professor at UC Berkeley\u2019s Goldman School of Public Policy, told the Guardian in October. \u201cAnd they want to hold somebody accountable. It was like: \u2018We don\u2019t like what they\u2019re doing, so \u2013 symbolically \u2013 it\u2019s off with their heads.\u2019\u201d Criticism intensified after the FBI raided Thao\u2019s home in a sprawling corruption investigation. The agency has neither implicated the mayor in any wrongdoing, nor absolved her of involvement. Thao has maintained her innocence. \u201cIt was just piling one thing on top of another,\u201d Lindheim said. \u201cThat was the seal of death for her mayoral position.\u201d In a statement last week, Thao said she was proud of her administration\u2019s accomplishments and was \u201ccommitted to ensuring we stay on track by supporting a smooth transition\u201d. Price, the district attorney for Alameda county, which includes Oakland, was also ousted in a recall campaign that began just months after she took office. She was the first Black woman to hold the job. A former civil rights attorney, Price had come into office promising to reform the justice system, stop \u201cover-criminalizing\u201d young people and hold law enforcement to better account. The Alameda county board of supervisors is expected to appoint an interim district attorney. Thao must vacate the office as soon as election results are certified on 5 December and the Oakland city council declares a vacancy at its next meeting, Nikki Fortunato Bas, the city council president, said in a statement. A special election for a new mayor will be held within 120 days, or roughly four months. Until then, Bas will serve as interim mayor, unless she wins a seat on the Alameda county board of supervisors. As of Monday, Bas was trailing in that race.",

Coote is the subject of an investigation by the referees\u2019 body Professional Game Match Officials Ltd after clips showed the 42-year-old calling the former Liverpool manager \u201carrogant\u201d and a \u201cGerman cunt\u201d. Howard Webb, PGMOL\u2019s chief refereeing officer, said the organisation was taking the incident \u201cvery seriously\u201d. As a participant in football, Coote falls under the scope of the FA\u2019s rules and the investigation is likely to concentrate on a potential breach of rule E3, which deals with behaviour that brings the game into disrepute. Participants can then be charged with further, aggravated breaches of the rule if found to have used insulting words or behaviours relating to a number of personal characteristics, including an individual\u2019s nationality. An FA spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of the matter, and we are investigating it.\u201d In the clips posted online on Monday, Coote appears to be speaking with friends when asked about his experiences dealing with Klopp as a match official. Although the remarks were made in private \u2013 in a second video Coote said: \u201cJust to be clear, that last video can\u2019t go anywhere, seriously\u201d \u2013 the FA has the ability to charge individuals if the material appears in public spaces. During a disciplinary case involving Dele in 2020, an independent regulatory commission found the then Spurs player \u201ccould and should have appreciated that once material is distributed the author no longer has control of the onward distribution\u201d. On Tuesday evening Webb addressed the issue for the first time, saying PGMOL was taking the incident very seriously, but gave no update on when an investigation into Coote\u2019s remarks would be completed. Speaking on the TV show Match Officials Mic\u2019d Up, Webb said: \u201cWe became aware of a video being circulated on social media that we are taking very seriously. We have instigated a full investigation, one of our referees David Coote has been suspended with immediate effect pending the outcome of the investigation.\u201d Webb said the ongoing investigation prevented him from making further comment.

Although leaders including the UK\u2019s Keir Starmer, Barbados\u2019s Mia Mottley and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan addressed the summit, the heads of government of most of the world\u2019s biggest economies stayed away.</p> \n<p>Starmer confirmed stringent new plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/keir-starmer-to-unveil-ambitious-new-uk-climate-goal-cop29-ndc\">revealed by the Guardian</a>, which were praised by campaigners and experts. The UK is one of the first leading economies to present such a plan, months ahead of a UN deadline of next February.</p> \n<p>The cut, of 81% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels, will be partly met by decarbonising the electricity sector, but the government is also likely to have to add new policies to encourage public transport and walking, and a switch from gas heating to electric heat pumps.</p> \n<p>Starmer told journalists at Cop29 that this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2024/nov/12/world-leaders-to-speak-as-cop29-resumes-live-updates\">need not involve drastic changes</a> to people\u2019s lifestyles, , saying: \u201cThe race is on for the clean energy jobs of the future, the economy of tomorrow. I don\u2019t want to be in the middle of the pack, I want to get ahead of the game.\u201d</p> \n<p>He told reporters: \u201cAt this Cop I was pleased to announce that we are building on our reputation as a climate leader with the UK\u2019s 2035 NDC target to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions by at least 81% on 1990 levels.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rebecca Newsom, a senior policy adviser at Greenpeace International, said: \u201cStarmer\u2019s commitment to a relatively ambitious new target for cutting emissions will inject new momentum into the talks and he is right to highlight the huge opportunity offered by the green transition to cut bills, unlock investment and create jobs across the UK. But much clearer plans are still needed \u2013 particularly more investment for those working in offshore oil and gas to transition to renewable energy.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c4a52d38-474c-45cc-8f75-e279c76aaf5a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GVbKjHBC7Tc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Governments were told at Cop they must take concerted action on reducing greenhouse gases or face economic disaster that could threaten them electorally.</p> \n<p>Simon Stiell, the UN\u2019s top climate official, said politics, economics and the climate were now fatally entwined. Governments may be feeling the consequences of the worst inflation for decades but far more serious consequences were in store.</p> \n<p>\u201cWorsening climate impacts will put inflation on steroids,\u201d Stiell said, tuning in to some of the economic fears that have helped deliver a series of electoral victories to rightwing parties around the world in the past year.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe climate crisis is a cost-of-living crisis, because climate disasters are driving up costs for households and businesses. Climate finance is global inflation insurance.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rather than being an issue of protecting future generations, tackling greenhouse gas emissions was the only way to save the global economy in the short as well as the long term, Stiell said. \u201cThere has been a seismic shift in the global climate crisis. Because the climate crisis is fast becoming an economy killer \u2013 right now, today, in this political cycle,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Ilham Aliyev, the president of the Cop\u2019s host nation, Azerbaijan, struck a different note. Azerbaijan has been a sizeable producer of oil and gas since the mid-19th century. Fossil fuels make up 90% of the country\u2019s export income, and the infrastructure of oil and gas extraction is everywhere in evidence around the capital, Baku: a flaring refinery lights up the city\u2019s night-time skyline, oil wells dot the suburbs, and tankers lumber across the Caspian Sea to its port. Even the country\u2019s national symbol is a flame.</p> \n<p>Aliyev, whose family is thought to have made billions from the country\u2019s natural assets, called Azerbaijan\u2019s oil and gas \u201ca gift from God\u201d and made clear the extraction would continue.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs president of Cop29, of course we will be a strong advocate for green transition, and we are doing it,\u201d he told the event. \u201cBut at the same time, we must be realistic.\u201d</p> \n<p>He attacked critics of the country \u2013 an autocratic state that has been found in NGO assessments to be one of the world\u2019s most corrupt \u2013 and defended its use of its resources. \u201cCountries should not be blamed [for having oil and gas deposits] and should not be blamed for bringing these resources to the market, because the market needs them. The people need them,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>His words contrasted with pleas from dozens of developing country leaders for urgent action to stem the rising tide of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and rescue them from the consequences.</p> \n<p>Hilda Heine, the president of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, a tiny, low-lying atoll group in the Pacific that is threatened with inundation if temperatures rise much higher, criticised rich countries for telling the poor they must cut greenhouse gas emissions while failing to provide access to the finance that would enable that.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is in our blood to know when a tide is turning,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd on climate, the tide is turning today.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Monday the talks had got off to a slow start when officials tried to clear up some technical issues before the leaders arrived on Tuesday. A resolution on the trade of carbon offsets was passed, to the relief of the hosts, but this was criticised by some civil society groups <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/critics-say-approval-of-climate-credits-rules-on-day-one-of-cop29-was-rushed\">who said it was flawed and had been rushed through</a>.</p> \n<p>The talks will continue on Wednesday when more world leaders including Giorgia Meloni of Italy and Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan will give addresses.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This year has been \u201ca masterclass in human destruction\u201d, the UN secretary general has said as he reflected on extreme weather and record temperatures around the world fuelled by climate breakdown. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres painted a stark portrait of the consequences of climate breakdown that had arisen in recent months. \u201cFamilies running for their lives before the next hurricane strikes; workers and pilgrims collapsing in insufferable heat; floods tearing through communities and tearing down infrastructure; children going to bed hungry as droughts ravage crops,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these disasters, and more, are being supercharged by human-made climate change.\u201d Guterres was addressing scores of world leaders and high-ranking government officials from nearly 200 countries gathered in Azerbaijan for the Cop29 UN climate summit. Over a fortnight of talks, nations will try to find ways to raise the vast sums of money needed to tackle the climate crisis. Developing countries want guarantees of $1tn a year in funds by 2035 to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather. The talks have been overshadowed by the re-election of Donald Trump, an avowed climate denier, to the US presidency. Although leaders including the UK\u2019s Keir Starmer, Barbados\u2019s Mia Mottley and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan addressed the summit, the heads of government of most of the world\u2019s biggest economies stayed away. Starmer confirmed stringent new plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, as revealed by the Guardian, which were praised by campaigners and experts. The UK is one of the first leading economies to present such a plan, months ahead of a UN deadline of next February. The cut, of 81% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels, will be partly met by decarbonising the electricity sector, but the government is also likely to have to add new policies to encourage public transport and walking, and a switch from gas heating to electric heat pumps. Starmer told journalists at Cop29 that this need not involve drastic changes to people\u2019s lifestyles, , saying: \u201cThe race is on for the clean energy jobs of the future, the economy of tomorrow. I don\u2019t want to be in the middle of the pack, I want to get ahead of the game.\u201d He told reporters: \u201cAt this Cop I was pleased to announce that we are building on our reputation as a climate leader with the UK\u2019s 2035 NDC target to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions by at least 81% on 1990 levels.\u201d Rebecca Newsom, a senior policy adviser at Greenpeace International, said: \u201cStarmer\u2019s commitment to a relatively ambitious new target for cutting emissions will inject new momentum into the talks and he is right to highlight the huge opportunity offered by the green transition to cut bills, unlock investment and create jobs across the UK. But much clearer plans are still needed \u2013 particularly more investment for those working in offshore oil and gas to transition to renewable energy.\u201d Governments were told at Cop they must take concerted action on reducing greenhouse gases or face economic disaster that could threaten them electorally. Simon Stiell, the UN\u2019s top climate official, said politics, economics and the climate were now fatally entwined. Governments may be feeling the consequences of the worst inflation for decades but far more serious consequences were in store. \u201cWorsening climate impacts will put inflation on steroids,\u201d Stiell said, tuning in to some of the economic fears that have helped deliver a series of electoral victories to rightwing parties around the world in the past year. \u201cThe climate crisis is a cost-of-living crisis, because climate disasters are driving up costs for households and businesses. Climate finance is global inflation insurance.\u201d Rather than being an issue of protecting future generations, tackling greenhouse gas emissions was the only way to save the global economy in the short as well as the long term, Stiell said. \u201cThere has been a seismic shift in the global climate crisis. Because the climate crisis is fast becoming an economy killer \u2013 right now, today, in this political cycle,\u201d he said. Ilham Aliyev, the president of the Cop\u2019s host nation, Azerbaijan, struck a different note. Azerbaijan has been a sizeable producer of oil and gas since the mid-19th century. Fossil fuels make up 90% of the country\u2019s export income, and the infrastructure of oil and gas extraction is everywhere in evidence around the capital, Baku: a flaring refinery lights up the city\u2019s night-time skyline, oil wells dot the suburbs, and tankers lumber across the Caspian Sea to its port. Even the country\u2019s national symbol is a flame. Aliyev, whose family is thought to have made billions from the country\u2019s natural assets, called Azerbaijan\u2019s oil and gas \u201ca gift from God\u201d and made clear the extraction would continue. \u201cAs president of Cop29, of course we will be a strong advocate for green transition, and we are doing it,\u201d he told the event. \u201cBut at the same time, we must be realistic.\u201d He attacked critics of the country \u2013 an autocratic state that has been found in NGO assessments to be one of the world\u2019s most corrupt \u2013 and defended its use of its resources. \u201cCountries should not be blamed [for having oil and gas deposits] and should not be blamed for bringing these resources to the market, because the market needs them. The people need them,\u201d he said. His words contrasted with pleas from dozens of developing country leaders for urgent action to stem the rising tide of CO2 emissions and rescue them from the consequences. Hilda Heine, the president of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, a tiny, low-lying atoll group in the Pacific that is threatened with inundation if temperatures rise much higher, criticised rich countries for telling the poor they must cut greenhouse gas emissions while failing to provide access to the finance that would enable that. \u201cIt is in our blood to know when a tide is turning,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd on climate, the tide is turning today.\u201d On Monday the talks had got off to a slow start when officials tried to clear up some technical issues before the leaders arrived on Tuesday. A resolution on the trade of carbon offsets was passed, to the relief of the hosts, but this was criticised by some civil society groups who said it was flawed and had been rushed through. The talks will continue on Wednesday when more world leaders including Giorgia Meloni of Italy and Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan will give addresses.",

      "body": "<p>In the world of two weeks ago, AstraZeneca\u2019s share price probably would have enjoyed a strong day on the release of Tuesday\u2019s third-quarter numbers. The profit figure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/12/astrazeneca-china-investigation-pharmaceutical-profit-us\">beat forecasts</a> and the UK pharmaceutical company raised its guidance for growth in full-year revenues and earnings from \u201cmid-teens\u201d to \u201chigh teens\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Pascal Soriot, the chief executive, unveiled a $3.5bn (\u00a32.7bn) investment programme in the US and talked bullishly about prospects in AstraZeneca\u2019s biggest market. It all sounded like another confident step in the march to take global revenues from $46bn in 2023 to $80bn by 2030.</p> <p>The optimistic tunes were lost in the breeze, however, because investors have a simpler question: what the hell is going on in China? To recap, the share price has shed 17% in a month after news broke in September that several former and current executives were being investigated over allegations of illegally importing cancer medicines, and it emerged that the head of AstraZeneca\u2019s China business, Leon Wang, had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/oct/30/budget-uk-rachel-reeves-pound-borrowing-costs-germany-gdp-recession-business-live-news?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with:block-672242c78f08bfbda3437844#block-672242c78f08bfbda3437844\">detained by the authorities</a>.</p> <p>On that front, Soriot had little fresh news to offer. The Chinese matters were being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/12/astrazeneca-china-investigation-pharmaceutical-profit-us\">taken \u201cvery seriously\u201d</a>, AstraZeneca remains committed to the country for the long-term, but the company hasn\u2019t been contacted by the authorities and is still waiting to hear what they have to say. The shares ended flat on the day.</p> <p>One can construct an argument that the stock market\u2019s reaction to the Chinese affair is too extreme. The country accounts for 13% of AstraZeneca\u2019s revenues, but not as much of its profit. So cutting the whole group\u2019s valuation by almost a fifth before any material financial damage is known could be seen as premature. The whole thing could still blow over.</p> <p>Yet the range of possible outcomes here is enormous. Is it reassuring, or the reverse, that the authorities haven\u2019t contacted the company? Remember that GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s run-in with Beijing a decade ago \u2013 over bribery in that instance \u2013 also had quiet beginnings before becoming a very big deal. It ended with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/19/glaxosmithkline-pays-297m-fine-china-bribery\">fine of about \u00a3300m</a> and a lost decade, more or less, of rebuilding operations in China. The latter would be more serious for AstraZeneca as it is the largest western pharma firm in the country.</p> <p>It is therefore perhaps not so silly for investors to be selling into an information vacuum. Investigations in China tend to take ages and market-moving news tends to emerge from state-controlled media outlets rather than via regulatory bodies. Even then, it tends to be tricky to establish hard information.</p> <p>None of which detracts one iota from AstraZeneca\u2019s strengths.

      "bodyText": "In the world of two weeks ago, AstraZeneca\u2019s share price probably would have enjoyed a strong day on the release of Tuesday\u2019s third-quarter numbers. The profit figure beat forecasts and the UK pharmaceutical company raised its guidance for growth in full-year revenues and earnings from \u201cmid-teens\u201d to \u201chigh teens\u201d. Meanwhile, Pascal Soriot, the chief executive, unveiled a $3.5bn (\u00a32.7bn) investment programme in the US and talked bullishly about prospects in AstraZeneca\u2019s biggest market. It all sounded like another confident step in the march to take global revenues from $46bn in 2023 to $80bn by 2030. The optimistic tunes were lost in the breeze, however, because investors have a simpler question: what the hell is going on in China? To recap, the share price has shed 17% in a month after news broke in September that several former and current executives were being investigated over allegations of illegally importing cancer medicines, and it emerged that the head of AstraZeneca\u2019s China business, Leon Wang, had been detained by the authorities. On that front, Soriot had little fresh news to offer. The Chinese matters were being taken \u201cvery seriously\u201d, AstraZeneca remains committed to the country for the long-term, but the company hasn\u2019t been contacted by the authorities and is still waiting to hear what they have to say. The shares ended flat on the day. One can construct an argument that the stock market\u2019s reaction to the Chinese affair is too extreme. The country accounts for 13% of AstraZeneca\u2019s revenues, but not as much of its profit. So cutting the whole group\u2019s valuation by almost a fifth before any material financial damage is known could be seen as premature. The whole thing could still blow over. Yet the range of possible outcomes here is enormous. Is it reassuring, or the reverse, that the authorities haven\u2019t contacted the company? Remember that GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s run-in with Beijing a decade ago \u2013 over bribery in that instance \u2013 also had quiet beginnings before becoming a very big deal. It ended with a fine of about \u00a3300m and a lost decade, more or less, of rebuilding operations in China. The latter would be more serious for AstraZeneca as it is the largest western pharma firm in the country. It is therefore perhaps not so silly for investors to be selling into an information vacuum. Investigations in China tend to take ages and market-moving news tends to emerge from state-controlled media outlets rather than via regulatory bodies. Even then, it tends to be tricky to establish hard information. None of which detracts one iota from AstraZeneca\u2019s strengths. The shares were previously so highly rated because its pipeline of new drugs is possibly the strongest in the industry and the $80bn revenue goal is credible \u2013 Soriot, in his first decade in charge, has hit targets ahead of time that looked more ambitious at launch. So prepare for an enormous bounce in the share price if, miraculously, the Chinese investigations are resolved quickly at little financial cost. The more likely plotline, unfortunately, is that incomplete information is dribbled out gradually and the saga drags on for months and months. It is the Chinese style.

      "bodyText": "The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) \u201cfailed\u201d the family of a 21-year-old woman after her death two years ago in Derry, initially treating it as suicide rather than a suspected murder, the police watchdog has said. The report by the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland comes amid renewed concerns that gender-based violence is not being taken seriously enough in the region with the highest rate of femicide per capita of all nations in the UK and in the island of Ireland. Katie Simpson, a show jumper, died in hospital in Derry six days after an incident but it was not until the following year that Jonathan Creswell was arrested on suspicion of murder. The police ombudsman investigation concluded that the police investigation was hindered and \u201cflawed\u201d because of the misleading working assumption adopted by a number of officers that Simpson\u2019s injuries were self-inflicted. They criticised a \u201clack of investigative mindset\u201d taking into account police had received intelligence that Simpson may have been the victim of controlling behaviours, that the attempted suicide was suspicious, that she had not fallen from a horse, and that medical staff had also expressed concerns about the circumstances of her injuries. The police ombudsman chief executive, Hugh Hume, said although this intelligence was viewed and logged by police, it \u201cdid not change the direction of the police investigation\u201d. \u201cThere appeared to be a general lack of an investigative mindset which contributed to shortcomings,\u201d he said. The investigation found there were no effective searches carried out at Simpson\u2019s address and that no supervisory officer attended the house at the initial stages of the investigation. Among the other investigative failings identified by the police ombudsman was the lack of consideration given to gathering potential physical evidence from Simpson herself. These included blood samples and photographs of her injuries, despite police being aware at an early stage that she was unlikely to survive. They \u201cmissed opportunities\u201d to interview key witnesses and did not question Creswell\u2019s claim that she had been injured after falling from a horse. The trial of Creswell, 36, for the murder of Simpson ended in April after his sudden death. Katie\u2019s mother, Noleen Mullan, told a press conference: \u201cThe people who are responsible for what\u2019s happened here from the start are nowhere to be seen. \u201cAnd it leaves you feeling empty. There\u2019s been no achievement made, for me. I wanted them to be made accountable but I don\u2019t think they ever will be.\u201d The police ombudsman investigation identified breaches of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) code of ethics in respect of professional duty, the conduct of police investigations and the duty of supervisors. As a result, disciplinary recommendations were made to the PSNI in respect of six police officers. No action was taken against three officers, two of whom had retired and one for whom no misconduct was proven. One police officer received a written warning, another received action aimed at improving performance and one received management advice. The family\u2019s solicitor, Kevin Winters, described the ombudsman\u2019s findings as a \u201cstepping stone on what\u2019s still a long, tortuous road to justice for the Simpson family\u201d. \u201cToday\u2019s findings help provide much-needed answers but equally there are unresolved issues arising from new complaints, one of which involves a serving member of police,\u201d he said. An inquest is also due to be held to examine the circumstances of the death of Simpson. \u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123 and the domestic abuse helpline is 0808 2000 247.

A petition started by three members of the General Synod \u2013 the church\u2019s parliament \u2013 had amassed more than 13,000 signatures calling for the archbishop to quit.</p> <p>In a statement posted by Lambeth Palace, Welby, the spiritual leader of 85 million Anglicans worldwide, said: \u201cHaving sought the gracious permission of his majesty the king, I have decided to resign as archbishop of Canterbury.</p> <p>\u201cThe Makin review has exposed the long-maintained conspiracy of silence about the heinous abuses of John Smyth. When I was informed in 2013 and told that police had been notified, I believed wrongly that an appropriate resolution would follow.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility for the long and retraumatising period between 2013 and 2024.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWelby/status/1856336726832148584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Statement from the Archbishop of Canterbury.<a href=\"https://t.co/aNnuLBMapo\">https://t.co/aNnuLBMapo</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/pIIR1911QU\">pic.twitter.com/pIIR1911QU</a></p>&mdash; Archbishop of Canterbury (@JustinWelby) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWelby/status/1856336726832148584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 12, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>The king approved Welby\u2019s resignation on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>The archbishop said the exact timing of his departure was yet to be confirmed, adding: \u201cI hope this decision makes clear how seriously the Church of England understands the need for change and our profound commitment to creating a safer church. As I step down I do so in sorrow with all victims and survivors of abuse.</p> <p>\u201cThe last few days have renewed my long-felt and profound sense of shame at the historic safeguarding failures of the Church of England. For nearly 12 years I have struggled to introduce improvements. It is for others to judge what has been done.</p> <p>\u201cIn the meantime, I will follow through on my commitment to meet victims. I will delegate all my other current responsibilities for safeguarding until the necessary risk assessment process is complete.\u201d</p> <p>Welby said last week he had considered resigning over his \u201cshameful\u201d decision not to act on reports of abuse by Smyth when he was informed of them in 2013.</p> <p>But Lambeth Palace had said in a statement on Monday that Welby had \u201capologised profoundly both for his own failures and omissions, and for the wickedness, concealment and abuse by the church more widely\u201d, and did not intend to resign.</p> <p>Starmer is not believed to have spoken to Welby before he announced his resignation but Downing Street said the prime minister \u201crespects the decision\u201d.</p> <p>Welby, who had public roles at the funeral of the late Queen and the coronation of King Charles, will have consulted his team of close and trusted advisers on whether or not to quit.</p> <p>Key among them will have been Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, whose judgment is widely respected. Welby\u2019s personal chaplain, Tosin Oladipo, will have offered spiritual guidance.</p> <p>The views of his wife, Caroline, will also have been critical in his decision-making process, it is believed.</p> <p>Cottrell said on Tuesday that it was \u201cthe right and honourable thing\u201d for Welby to have \u201cdecided to take his share of responsibility for the failures identified by the Makin review\u201d.</p> <p> The bishop of London, Dame Sarah Mullally, said the move provided \u201cthe urgent impetus we need to change the face of safeguarding\u201d.</p> <p>But Andrew Graystone, author of Bleeding for Jesus, a book about Smyth\u2019s abuse, said the church needed \u201ca wholesale change of culture at the top of the organisation\u201d, with other clergy taking responsibility for failing to act.</p> <p>He said: \u201cAt least 11 bishops knew about John Smyth\u2019s abuse, but failed to stop him. In addition there were literally scores of rank and file church leaders and members who stood by, feeling it was someone else\u2019s job to act. This is not about the incompetence of one man. It is a deep-seated cultural issue about the privilege in the church.\u201d</p> <p>Alan Collins, a partner in the sexual abuse team at the law firm Hugh James, who represents a number of Smyth\u2019s victims, said Welby\u2019s resignation was a side issue. He said: \u201cThe spotlight must be on how the Church of England failed its victims so dreadfully for over 40 years, and the immediate priority is the Church of England addressing the needs of its victims.\u201d</p> <p>Welby had faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/12/justin-welby-urged-resign-solidarity-church-of-england-abuse-victims-john-smyth\">calls to resign</a> from Smyth\u2019s victims, members of the General Synod and Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Newcastle, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/11/justin-welby-under-growing-pressure-to-resign-over-serial-abuser\">who said his position was untenable</a>.</p> <p>James, a survivor of abuse committed by Smyth, said it was a mistake to presume that Welby\u2019s departure would satisfy all victims. He added: \u201cThere were plenty of other senior clerics who were aware of Smyth\u2019s abuse, from early, too. Replacing the archbishop of Canterbury without a real change in culture is not enough as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p> <p>Smyth sadistically abused private schoolboys who attended evangelical Christian holiday camps in the late 1970s and early 80s.

      "bodyText": "The archbishop of Canterbury is to step down amid intense pressure over his handling of one of the church\u2019s worst abuse scandals. Justin Welby\u2019s decision, announced on Tuesday, comes after mounting demands from victims and members of the clergy for him to quit. Pressure on him had intensified since the publication last week of a damning report on the Church of England\u2019s cover-up of abuse by John Smyth in the UK in the late 1970s and early 80s, and later in Zimbabwe and, it is suspected, South Africa. About 130 boys are believed to have been victims of Smyth, a powerful barrister who died in 2018. The independent Makin review into the abuse concluded Smyth could have been brought to justice had the archbishop formally reported it to police a decade ago. Welby said his decision, which came five days after the report was published, was \u201cin the best interests of the Church of England, which I dearly love and which I have been honoured to serve\u201d. The announcement came hours after Keir Starmer, the prime minister, refused to publicly back him. A petition started by three members of the General Synod \u2013 the church\u2019s parliament \u2013 had amassed more than 13,000 signatures calling for the archbishop to quit. In a statement posted by Lambeth Palace, Welby, the spiritual leader of 85 million Anglicans worldwide, said: \u201cHaving sought the gracious permission of his majesty the king, I have decided to resign as archbishop of Canterbury. \u201cThe Makin review has exposed the long-maintained conspiracy of silence about the heinous abuses of John Smyth. When I was informed in 2013 and told that police had been notified, I believed wrongly that an appropriate resolution would follow. \u201cIt is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility for the long and retraumatising period between 2013 and 2024.\u201d The king approved Welby\u2019s resignation on Tuesday morning. The archbishop said the exact timing of his departure was yet to be confirmed, adding: \u201cI hope this decision makes clear how seriously the Church of England understands the need for change and our profound commitment to creating a safer church. As I step down I do so in sorrow with all victims and survivors of abuse. \u201cThe last few days have renewed my long-felt and profound sense of shame at the historic safeguarding failures of the Church of England. For nearly 12 years I have struggled to introduce improvements. It is for others to judge what has been done. \u201cIn the meantime, I will follow through on my commitment to meet victims. I will delegate all my other current responsibilities for safeguarding until the necessary risk assessment process is complete.\u201d Welby said last week he had considered resigning over his \u201cshameful\u201d decision not to act on reports of abuse by Smyth when he was informed of them in 2013. But Lambeth Palace had said in a statement on Monday that Welby had \u201capologised profoundly both for his own failures and omissions, and for the wickedness, concealment and abuse by the church more widely\u201d, and did not intend to resign. Starmer is not believed to have spoken to Welby before he announced his resignation but Downing Street said the prime minister \u201crespects the decision\u201d. Welby, who had public roles at the funeral of the late Queen and the coronation of King Charles, will have consulted his team of close and trusted advisers on whether or not to quit. Key among them will have been Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, whose judgment is widely respected. Welby\u2019s personal chaplain, Tosin Oladipo, will have offered spiritual guidance. The views of his wife, Caroline, will also have been critical in his decision-making process, it is believed. Cottrell said on Tuesday that it was \u201cthe right and honourable thing\u201d for Welby to have \u201cdecided to take his share of responsibility for the failures identified by the Makin review\u201d. The bishop of London, Dame Sarah Mullally, said the move provided \u201cthe urgent impetus we need to change the face of safeguarding\u201d. But Andrew Graystone, author of Bleeding for Jesus, a book about Smyth\u2019s abuse, said the church needed \u201ca wholesale change of culture at the top of the organisation\u201d, with other clergy taking responsibility for failing to act. He said: \u201cAt least 11 bishops knew about John Smyth\u2019s abuse, but failed to stop him. In addition there were literally scores of rank and file church leaders and members who stood by, feeling it was someone else\u2019s job to act. This is not about the incompetence of one man. It is a deep-seated cultural issue about the privilege in the church.\u201d Alan Collins, a partner in the sexual abuse team at the law firm Hugh James, who represents a number of Smyth\u2019s victims, said Welby\u2019s resignation was a side issue. He said: \u201cThe spotlight must be on how the Church of England failed its victims so dreadfully for over 40 years, and the immediate priority is the Church of England addressing the needs of its victims.\u201d Welby had faced calls to resign from Smyth\u2019s victims, members of the General Synod and Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Newcastle, who said his position was untenable. James, a survivor of abuse committed by Smyth, said it was a mistake to presume that Welby\u2019s departure would satisfy all victims. He added: \u201cThere were plenty of other senior clerics who were aware of Smyth\u2019s abuse, from early, too. Replacing the archbishop of Canterbury without a real change in culture is not enough as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d Smyth sadistically abused private schoolboys who attended evangelical Christian holiday camps in the late 1970s and early 80s. Across five decades, he is said to have subjected as many as 130 boys and young men in the UK and Africa to traumatic physical, sexual, psychological and spiritual attacks, permanently marking their lives. When the abuse was discovered, Smyth was allowed to move abroad with the full knowledge of church officials, where he continued to act with impunity. He died aged 77 in Cape Town in 2018 while under investigation by Hampshire constabulary, and was \u201cnever brought to justice for the abuse\u201d, the Makin review said. Welby volunteered at the holiday camps in the 1970s but has denied any knowledge of concerns about Smyth. However, the report said this was \u201cunlikely\u201d. It added: \u201c[Welby] may not have known of the extreme seriousness of the abuse, but it is most probable that he would have had at least a level of knowledge that John Smyth was of some concern \u2026 It is not possible to establish whether Welby knew of the severity of the abuses in the UK prior to 2013.\u201d \u2022 In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

They say the source of the infestation is wool insulation behind walls and ceilings.</p> <p>They are suing Woodward-Fisher, 68, a property developer who formerly competed for Great Britain as a rower, claiming he was either guilty of \u201cfraudulent misrepresention\u201d or negligent in failing to disclose previous moth issues when answering pre-sale inquiries about the possibility of \u201cvermin\u201d in the house.</p> <p>The payout they are claiming would include Woodward-Fisher buying back the house and compensating them for all expenses and inconvenience caused by the moth menace, a total of more than \u00a336m. The couple claims it would cost almost \u00a310m to replace all the woollen insulation in the building.</p> <p>Woodward-Fisher denies all claims, insisting that he gave honest and full replies on the pre-sale inquiries form, and that as far as he knew any previous moth problems had been eliminated by the time of the move. He also says the couple\u2019s valuation of how much it would cost to remedy the problem is massively overblown, arguing that the true repair bill would be \u00a3162,652.</p> <p>Jonathan Seitler KC, for Woodward-Fisher, said he was honest when dealing with the inquiry about possible previous \u201cvermin infestation\u201d, having told his solicitor they had experienced problems with moths, only to be assured that moths were not vermin and therefore not relevant to this inquiry.</p> <p>Part of the legal debate is the question of whether moths are vermin and therefore have to be included in the inquiry form answer.</p> <p>The court heard that Woodward-Fisher bought the site in 2011 and lived there with his wife, Kerry, 64, an interior designer. The house was extended and radically remodelled before being sold to Patarkatsishvili, 41, the daughter of Badri Patarkatsishvili, a Georgian businessman who fell out with Vladimir Putin and moved to the UK in 2000, and Hunyak, 50, a paediatric dentist who practises in Chelsea.</p> <p>McGhee told Mr Justice Fancourt the presence and cause of the infestation was well known to Woodward-Fisher. The insects and treatment had forced Woodward-Fisher and his family to check into a hotel and leave their dog elsewhere to clear the way for a major \u201cspray\u201d on one occasion, he added.</p> <p>The couple is asking the judge to reverse the house sale on the basis of alleged \u201cfraudulent misrepresention\u201d so that they get their \u00a332.5m back, plus compensation for other losses, including \u00a350,000 for moth-shredded clothes and more than \u00a33.7m they paid in stamp duty.

      "bodyText": "The daughter of a Georgian billionaire and her husband are suing for more than \u00a336m after claiming the London mansion they bought was \u201cinfested with millions of moths\u201d, the high court heard. Iya Patarkatsishvili and Dr Yevhen Hunyak bought the early Victorian seven-bedroom Notting Hill home in west London \u2013 with pool, spa, gym, wine room, library, cinema, and a \u201csnoring room\u201d designed for peaceful sleep \u2013 for \u00a332.5m in May 2019. Days after moving in they spotted signs of an infestation that would go on to destroy clothing and ruin their wine, resulting in them suing the house seller, William Woodward-Fisher. At one point, insects were landing on the couple and their two children\u2019s toothbrushes, cutlery and plates of food, Hunyak told the court, while he had to tip away glasses of wine after discovering moths floating there. John McGhee KC, for the couple, said they were swatting about 100 moths a day and even after intensive sprays and expert treatment still maintain a daily kill count of up to 35. They say the source of the infestation is wool insulation behind walls and ceilings. They are suing Woodward-Fisher, 68, a property developer who formerly competed for Great Britain as a rower, claiming he was either guilty of \u201cfraudulent misrepresention\u201d or negligent in failing to disclose previous moth issues when answering pre-sale inquiries about the possibility of \u201cvermin\u201d in the house. The payout they are claiming would include Woodward-Fisher buying back the house and compensating them for all expenses and inconvenience caused by the moth menace, a total of more than \u00a336m. The couple claims it would cost almost \u00a310m to replace all the woollen insulation in the building. Woodward-Fisher denies all claims, insisting that he gave honest and full replies on the pre-sale inquiries form, and that as far as he knew any previous moth problems had been eliminated by the time of the move. He also says the couple\u2019s valuation of how much it would cost to remedy the problem is massively overblown, arguing that the true repair bill would be \u00a3162,652. Jonathan Seitler KC, for Woodward-Fisher, said he was honest when dealing with the inquiry about possible previous \u201cvermin infestation\u201d, having told his solicitor they had experienced problems with moths, only to be assured that moths were not vermin and therefore not relevant to this inquiry. Part of the legal debate is the question of whether moths are vermin and therefore have to be included in the inquiry form answer. The court heard that Woodward-Fisher bought the site in 2011 and lived there with his wife, Kerry, 64, an interior designer. The house was extended and radically remodelled before being sold to Patarkatsishvili, 41, the daughter of Badri Patarkatsishvili, a Georgian businessman who fell out with Vladimir Putin and moved to the UK in 2000, and Hunyak, 50, a paediatric dentist who practises in Chelsea. McGhee told Mr Justice Fancourt the presence and cause of the infestation was well known to Woodward-Fisher. The insects and treatment had forced Woodward-Fisher and his family to check into a hotel and leave their dog elsewhere to clear the way for a major \u201cspray\u201d on one occasion, he added. The couple is asking the judge to reverse the house sale on the basis of alleged \u201cfraudulent misrepresention\u201d so that they get their \u00a332.5m back, plus compensation for other losses, including \u00a350,000 for moth-shredded clothes and more than \u00a33.7m they paid in stamp duty. They have also presented alternative cases, seeking more than \u00a316m to mark their losses and the diminished value of the property, or alternatively about \u00a313m to cover losses and the cost of further works. Seitler said his client has enlisted pest controllers in 2018 who \u201cappeared to have succeeded in their task by July 2018\u201d, and moths were no longer a problem when they moved out in 2019. The trial continues, but the judge is expected to reserve his decision until a later date.",

They were also unclear about what exactly the job would entail.</p> <p>Sources told the Guardian that Starmer, who is in Baku at the Cop29 climate summit, was expected to give Gray a peerage. This would give her the freedom to promote issues that were important to her \u2013 including devolution \u2013 from the House of Lords.</p> <p>One government source said Gray had been told Starmer planned to rescind his offer. \u201cSue wasn\u2019t told for sure that the job was no longer on offer, but she was warned that was the direction of travel,\u201d they said. \u201cThe way some people are behaving towards her is really horrible.\u201d</p> <p>Allies of the former senior civil servant had previously told the Guardian she had questions over how much power she would actually have as envoy, and whether she would have sufficient access to the prime minister. However, with speculation swirling over her position, her allies admitted that she had jumped before she was pushed after weeks of prevaricating over the role.</p> <p>\u201cSue has taken a decision not to take the role,\u201d one said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to focus on other things.

      "bodyText": "Sue Gray has decided not to take up the post of nation and regions envoy after it became clear Keir Starmer was planning to withdraw his offer, the Guardian understands. Sources said the prime minister\u2019s former chief of staff, who was on a \u201cshort break\u201d between roles after standing down almost six weeks ago, had been told No 10 was likely to rescind the job offer before she had even taken it up. Downing Street insiders had grown concerned about the media attention that would follow Gray, which could have made it harder for her to carry out the role. They were also unclear about what exactly the job would entail. Sources told the Guardian that Starmer, who is in Baku at the Cop29 climate summit, was expected to give Gray a peerage. This would give her the freedom to promote issues that were important to her \u2013 including devolution \u2013 from the House of Lords. One government source said Gray had been told Starmer planned to rescind his offer. \u201cSue wasn\u2019t told for sure that the job was no longer on offer, but she was warned that was the direction of travel,\u201d they said. \u201cThe way some people are behaving towards her is really horrible.\u201d Allies of the former senior civil servant had previously told the Guardian she had questions over how much power she would actually have as envoy, and whether she would have sufficient access to the prime minister. However, with speculation swirling over her position, her allies admitted that she had jumped before she was pushed after weeks of prevaricating over the role. \u201cSue has taken a decision not to take the role,\u201d one said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to focus on other things. She\u2019s taken time to think about it properly, talking to stakeholders, but ultimately she\u2019s decided she doesn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d Starmer\u2019s spokesperson later confirmed that Gray was not taking up the job, presenting it as her choice. \u201cWhile we would not usually comment on individual members of staff \u2026 I can confirm that she has now decided not to take up the role,\u201d she said. She indicated that no one else would be put into the job, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t have any immediate plans to update you on as to further recruitment, but to be very clear, resetting our relationships and working with the regions and nations has been at the heart of everything the government does.\u201d Gray had been \u201cuniquely placed for that role\u201d, she added. Gray had been a popular choice with regional and national leaders \u2013 particularly Labour ones \u2013 who credited her with bringing them \u201cinto the room\u201d with Starmer, and making sure their views were taken into account. However, anxiety that her departure could make it harder to engage with Downing Street appeared to have been unfounded. One regional politician said: \u201cI was very concerned her absence would affect our access to No 10 \u2013 she really did make a difference \u2013 but that hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d Another added: \u201cWe had a great relationship with Sue but are relaxed about this because we also have a very good relationship with Morgan and No 10 who seem as committed to mayors and regions as before.\u201d Gray resigned as Starmer\u2019s chief of staff after finding herself at the centre of a political storm. Starmer shook up his entire top team after facing intense pressure to put an end to the hostile briefings that had at times overshadowed his first 100 days in office. The senior official, who had spent decades as a civil servant and became a household name after Boris Johnson asked her to investigate the Partygate scandal, was replaced as chief of staff by Morgan McSweeney, who masterminded Labour\u2019s general election victory, and with whom she sometimes found herself at odds in government. Downing Street announced at the same time that Gray would take on a new government role as the prime minister\u2019s envoy for the regions and nations. Yet she did not attend Starmer\u2019s inaugural gathering of the council of nations and regions, which was intended to reset relationships and boost growth in every part of the UK. After her appointment, Gray said she was standing down as chief of staff because it had \u201cbecome clear to me that intense commentary around my position risked becoming a distraction to the government\u2019s vital work of change\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump has chosen a pair of establishment Republicans from Florida for senior roles in his administration as he builds a national security team that looks more hawkish than the isolationist America First brand of foreign policy that he has championed in public.</p> <p>Trump was expected to select the senator Marco Rubio as his secretary of state, the US\u2019s top diplomat, and has asked the congressman Mike Waltz, a retired Green Beret known as a China hawk, to become his national security adviser, a powerful role that would help shape his policies on the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as around the world.</p> <p>Rubio is a noted foreign policy hawk with hardline policies on China, Iran, and on Venezuela, where he has led US efforts to unseat the president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. He was one of the earliest China hawks in Washington, where Beijing is now viewed with extreme scepticism by both parties, and has served as a co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China.</p> <p>On Ukraine he is likely to tailor his views to Trump\u2019s and those around him, including Elon Musk and Donald Trump Jr, who have voiced sharp criticism of continued funding for Ukraine\u2019s defence against the Russian invasion. Rubio was one of 15 Republican lawmakers to vote against a $61bn supplemental aid bill in the Senate earlier this year that led to a months-long delay of crucial funding for the Ukrainian military.</p> <p>Rubio said earlier this month on national television: \u201cI think the Ukrainians have been incredibly brave and strong in standing up to Russia. But at the end of the day what we are funding here is a stalemate war, and it needs to be brought to a conclusion, or that country is going to be set back 100 years.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio, whom Trump nicknamed \u201cLittle Marco\u201d during his first presidential run, has gone from a regular target of Trump\u2019s insults to a loyal surrogate to the Republican president-elect.</p> <p>Trump had regularly denigrated him in the past as a member of the Republican establishment, calling him a \u201cpuppet\u201d and saying he was a \u201cnervous basket case\u201d. But he has been in lockstep with Trump during the campaign and has worked with Democrats and fellow Republicans in the Senate foreign relations committee and intelligence committee, making it likely he will have an easy confirmation process in that body.</p> <p>That stands in sharp relief to a reported rival for the role of secretary of state, Ric Grenell, Trump\u2019s former acting director of national intelligence and ambassador to Germany, who has proven himself as a loyalist but was known in Washington and Europe as combative and would have faced a tough confirmation process.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/pompeo-kennedy-and-musk-who-could-be-in-trumps-new-administration\">Trump\u2019s cabinet picks and likely contenders \u2013 so far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Waltz, Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, has argued that Trump should move quickly to end the wars in Gaza and Ukraine in order to transfer US focus and military assets back to the Indo-Pacific region and counter China.</p> <p>Those policies dovetail with Trump\u2019s isolationist tendencies in terms of seeking a speedy resolution to the war in Ukraine, even if it is achieved by forcing Ukraine to make concessions to Russia.</p> <p>\u201cSupporting Ukraine for \u2018as long as it takes\u2019 in a war of attrition against a larger power is a recipe for failure,\u201d Waltz and a co-author, Matthew Kroenig, wrote in an op-ed for the Economist this year. \u201cThe next administration should aim, as Donald Trump has argued, to \u2018end the war and stop the killing\u2019.\u201d They said the US should use economic leverage on energy sales to \u201cbring Mr Putin to the table\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf he refuses to talk, Washington can, as Mr Trump argued, provide more weapons to Ukraine with fewer restrictions on their use,\u201d they continued. \u201cFaced with this pressure, Mr Putin will probably take the opportunity to wind the conflict down.\u201d</p> <p>With regards to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, the pair appeared ready to give Benjamin Netanyahu carte blanche to \u201clet Israel finish the job\u201d, as Trump has said. They also suggested launching a \u201cdiplomatic and economic pressure campaign to stop [Iran] and to constrain their support for terror proxies\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWashington should maintain a military presence in the region, but with the war in Gaza and Lebanon concluded, it can transfer critical capabilities back to the Indo-Pacific,\u201d they wrote.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has chosen a pair of establishment Republicans from Florida for senior roles in his administration as he builds a national security team that looks more hawkish than the isolationist America First brand of foreign policy that he has championed in public. Trump was expected to select the senator Marco Rubio as his secretary of state, the US\u2019s top diplomat, and has asked the congressman Mike Waltz, a retired Green Beret known as a China hawk, to become his national security adviser, a powerful role that would help shape his policies on the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as around the world. Rubio is a noted foreign policy hawk with hardline policies on China, Iran, and on Venezuela, where he has led US efforts to unseat the president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. He was one of the earliest China hawks in Washington, where Beijing is now viewed with extreme scepticism by both parties, and has served as a co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China. On Ukraine he is likely to tailor his views to Trump\u2019s and those around him, including Elon Musk and Donald Trump Jr, who have voiced sharp criticism of continued funding for Ukraine\u2019s defence against the Russian invasion. Rubio was one of 15 Republican lawmakers to vote against a $61bn supplemental aid bill in the Senate earlier this year that led to a months-long delay of crucial funding for the Ukrainian military. Rubio said earlier this month on national television: \u201cI think the Ukrainians have been incredibly brave and strong in standing up to Russia. But at the end of the day what we are funding here is a stalemate war, and it needs to be brought to a conclusion, or that country is going to be set back 100 years.\u201d Rubio, whom Trump nicknamed \u201cLittle Marco\u201d during his first presidential run, has gone from a regular target of Trump\u2019s insults to a loyal surrogate to the Republican president-elect. Trump had regularly denigrated him in the past as a member of the Republican establishment, calling him a \u201cpuppet\u201d and saying he was a \u201cnervous basket case\u201d. But he has been in lockstep with Trump during the campaign and has worked with Democrats and fellow Republicans in the Senate foreign relations committee and intelligence committee, making it likely he will have an easy confirmation process in that body. That stands in sharp relief to a reported rival for the role of secretary of state, Ric Grenell, Trump\u2019s former acting director of national intelligence and ambassador to Germany, who has proven himself as a loyalist but was known in Washington and Europe as combative and would have faced a tough confirmation process. Waltz, Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, has argued that Trump should move quickly to end the wars in Gaza and Ukraine in order to transfer US focus and military assets back to the Indo-Pacific region and counter China. Those policies dovetail with Trump\u2019s isolationist tendencies in terms of seeking a speedy resolution to the war in Ukraine, even if it is achieved by forcing Ukraine to make concessions to Russia. \u201cSupporting Ukraine for \u2018as long as it takes\u2019 in a war of attrition against a larger power is a recipe for failure,\u201d Waltz and a co-author, Matthew Kroenig, wrote in an op-ed for the Economist this year. \u201cThe next administration should aim, as Donald Trump has argued, to \u2018end the war and stop the killing\u2019.\u201d They said the US should use economic leverage on energy sales to \u201cbring Mr Putin to the table\u201d. \u201cIf he refuses to talk, Washington can, as Mr Trump argued, provide more weapons to Ukraine with fewer restrictions on their use,\u201d they continued. \u201cFaced with this pressure, Mr Putin will probably take the opportunity to wind the conflict down.\u201d With regards to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, the pair appeared ready to give Benjamin Netanyahu carte blanche to \u201clet Israel finish the job\u201d, as Trump has said. They also suggested launching a \u201cdiplomatic and economic pressure campaign to stop [Iran] and to constrain their support for terror proxies\u201d. \u201cWashington should maintain a military presence in the region, but with the war in Gaza and Lebanon concluded, it can transfer critical capabilities back to the Indo-Pacific,\u201d they wrote.",

But the largely deliverable spending plans it set out should start to address the most serious wounds \u2013 for example, with the extra money for prisons and schools\u2019 special educational needs funding. </p> \n   <p>The government has also made a start on its long-term objectives with a meaningful boost to capital budgets \u2013 another area of weakness long identified by the Institute for Government \u2013 while other measures will provide some breathing room for ministers to think more radically in the spending review next spring. </p> \n   <p>There is a lot of potential in the government\u2019s plan to take a mission-led approach to that spending review and in its nascent reform agenda of creating more local and preventative services. While the budget could have done more to make a start on these changes, it is reasonable to save the bulk of this work till the spring. But the pressure to get these reforms right is high: on current plans, spending is due to grow much more slowly beyond 2025/26 and in fact implies substantial cuts to unprotected areas such as local government and criminal justice.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Summing up the report\u2019s verdict, <strong>Nick Davies</strong>, programme director at the IfG, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The outgoing Conservative government left public services in an appalling state and returning them a decent standard will take at least this parliament. The budget should stabilise most services in the short-term and made the first tentative steps on the long road to recovery.

He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>If by some chance these two things were to happen, they are not, you know, incompatible with each other. And the university has made that clear to me. They\u2019re not incompatible.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Look, if I was in the United States, I would be promoting Oxford as a great, iconic premier university that is revered in the US.

Under a peculiar rule, the legislation said that when any of them died, there would be byelctions to replace them, with only peers voting and only hereditary peers able to stand as candidates.</p> \n  <p>The new bill will abolish this system, and remove the right of the remaining hereditaries (currently 88 in number) to be in the Lords because of their hereditary peerage. Some of them may be offered life peerages.</p> \n  <p>Opening today\u2019s debate, which will deal with its committee and remaining stages in the Commons, Reeves said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This bill is a matter <em>of</em> principle. In the 21st century it cannot be right for there to be places in our legislature reserved for those born into certain families.</p> \n   <p>Having now seen all <em>of</em> the amendments tabled from parties from across the <em>house</em>, it is clear there is no principled objection to the aim <em>of</em> this bill, which is to remove the right <em>of</em> people to sit and make laws in our legislature by virtue <em>of</em> an accident <em>of</em> birth.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Alex Burghart</strong>, Reeves\u2019 Tory shadow, said the bill was \u201can attempt to gerrymander the membership of the House of Lords undercover of a reform\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>Pete Wishart</strong>, the SNP\u2019s deputy leader at Westminster, said the bill did not go far enough. He said he hoped there would be a vote on an SNP amendment banning anyone who has donated more than \u00a311,180 to a political party (the threshold at which a donation must be declared) from getting a peerage. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>114 years since the Labour party first promised to abolish the House of Lords and the best they can do is this quite frankly embarrassing bill. Unlike the Westminster parties, our position in the SNP is unequivocal \u2013 get rid of the House of Lords now. <br> At the very least Labour MPs must now back my amendment to end peerages being dished out to party donors \u2013 this murky practice should have ended with the Cash-for-Honours scandal. The only possible reason Labour MPs could have for not backing this amendment is that they want to keep stuffing the House of Lords with their millionaire donors.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Other SNP amendments, include one saying the Lords should be abolished and another saying peers should have to pay income tax on the daily allowance they receive, were not allowed because they were outside the scope of the bill.</p> \n  <p>MPs will vote on amdendments to the bill later this afternoon or early this evening.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-673370138f08a71aa0e1f9c4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-12T15:12:34.900Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>My colleague <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong><a href=\"https://x.com/jessicaelgot/status/1856351694960918687\"> says</a> MPs are completely in the dark as to how the Commons will vote when Kim Leadbeater\u2019s assisted dying bill gets it second reading a fortnight on Friday.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Talking to a lot of backbench MPs today about assisted dying and absolutely no one I have spoken to has any idea how to vote.

In highly confidential internal documents seen by London Centric, TfL\u2019s own modelling set out how the move would lead to a collapse in the number of cars on the roads.</p> \n   <p>Khan now insists he will never introduce a pay-per-mile scheme. He pulled the plug on the project ahead of his re-election campaign following claims by political opponents that Labour was pursuing a \u201cwar on the motorist\u201d. This is despite huge pressure to reach the ambitious green targets he has set himself, which will require a substantial decrease in the number of vehicles on London\u2019s roads.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-673368d08f081746a2e89daf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-12T14:50:53.791Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A reader asks:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>@Andrew - does Justin Welby keep his seat in the House of Lords?</p> \n   <p>It appears that it is very difficult to revoke a peerage, although I\u2019m not sure if the ones given to the clergy are treated any differently.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There are 26 bishops in the House of Lords (including the two archbishops).

Originally he suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/sep/06/conservatives.immigrationpolicy\">all young people might take part</a>, in an initiative that was part of his \u201cBig Society\u201d vision and that he hoped would break down class divisions. But when his government did launch the scheme after 2010 it was voluntary.</p> \n  <p>The government eventually passed <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/15/contents\">legislation</a> making the scheme permanent. But by then Cameron was out of office, and subsequently the scheme had its budget slashed. Nandy told the Commons today that from March next year NCS will be wound down for good.</p> \n  <p>She told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In 2011 when the National Citizen Service was established, Facebook and X had only 700 million users. Now they have over three billion. And TikTok had not even been dreamt of.</p> \n   <p>In 2011 an estimated one in eight 10 to 15 year olds had a probable mental health problem. Now that\u2019s one in five. The world has changed and we need a youth strategy that reflects that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Nandy also told MPs that the government would be developing a new national youth strategy, and that this would be backed by \u00a385m from government, and a further \u00a3100m from the dormant assets scheme.</p> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-national-youth-strategy-to-break-down-barriers-to-opportunity-for-young-people\">a news release</a>, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The strategy will prioritise delivering better coordinated youth services and policy at a local, regional and national level. It will make sure decision-making moves away from a one-size-fits all approach, handing power back to young people and their communities, and rebuilding a thriving and sustainable sector. This will help deliver on the government\u2019s missions, spreading opportunities, making our streets safer and taking pressure off health services.</p> \n   <p>To kickstart the process, the government is inviting young people to take part in a series of face-to-face engagements to ensure their perspectives and aspirations are at the heart of decision making. They will then be asked to share their views as part of a \u2018Today\u2019s Youth, Tomorrow\u2019s Nation\u2019 conversation on how best to help the next generation of young people \u2026</p> \n   <p>More than \u00a385m will be allocated in recognition of the urgent need for more youth facilities.

All the others have legislated now, she says.</p> \n  <p>She says there are two points where the Australian legislation is similar to Leadbeater\u2019s.</p> \n  <p>First, the law says you must have a terminal illness.</p> \n  <p>And, second, to be eligible, you must have an enduring capacity to consent at every stage of the process.</p> \n  <p>She says these two principles are the \u201cbedroock safeguards\u201d. They are in the Western Australian legislation, and in Leadbeater\u2019s too.</p> \n  <p>She says when they were taking evidence in her state, they did her evidence of coercion.

Parliament passes important laws (as well as some rather tedious ones), but normally the process is predictable because the government is in charge and most of what it does foreshadowed in a manifesto. Once a minister says \u2018X will become law\u2019, usually it does.</p> \n  <p>But assisted dying is different because the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater is trying to change the bill through the private member\u2019s bill process, MPs will have a free vote and no one really has much of a clue as to what will happen. The main uncertainty is whether or not MPs will vote to give the bill a second reading when it is debated, on Friday 29 November. But even if it passes at second reading, given the jeopardy inherent in the private member\u2019s bill process, it could still be touch and go whether it becomes law.</p> \n  <p>Leadbeater published <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/59-01/0012/240012.pdf\">her bill </a>last night, and she is holding a briefing about it this morning. Here is our overnight story by <strong>Jessica Elgot, Harriet Sherwood </strong>and<strong> Kiran Stacey.</strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/11/assisted-dying-bills-strict-safeguards-to-include-long-jail-terms-for-coercion\">Assisted dying bill\u2019s \u2018strict\u2019 safeguards to include long jail terms for coercion</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Even though Labour MPs will have a free vote, the views of ministers, and the prime minister, will still be influential. <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> voted in favour of assisted dying when the Commons last debated a bill (in 2015 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/11/mps-begin-debate-assisted-dying-bill\">it was defeated by 33o votes to 118</a>) and, when asked about this issue before the election, he always implied that, provided the safeguards were adequate, he would vote in favour again.</p> \n  <p>When he was director of public prosecutions in 2010, with parliament refusing to change the law and the CPS under pressure to prosecute people who had clearly helped terminally ill relatives to die out of kindness, not malice, Starmer issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/feb/25/dpp-releases-assisted-suicide-guidelines\">new guidance</a> on what might have to happen for the CPS to decide prosecution was not in the public interest. This did not change the law, but it was a bold move by a DPP clearly frustrated at the way the law was operating.</p> \n  <p>Now the bill is out, and Starmer can exame the safeguards, which are not trivial. But he still has not said definitely that he will vote for the bill. Speaking to reporters travelling with him at the Cop29 summit, he said Labour MPs would have to make up their own minds. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Look, it\u2019s going to be a free vote and I mean that. It will be for every MP to decide for themselves how they want to vote.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019m not going to be putting any pressure whatsoever on Labour MPs. They will make their own mind up, as I will be.</p> \n   <p>Obviously a lot will depend on the detail and we need to get the balance right but I\u2019ve always argued there will need to be proper safeguards in place.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>10am:</em> Kim Leadbeater holds a press briefing about her assisted dying bill. Charlie Falconer, the former lord chancellor who has introduced similar legislation in the the Lords, and Sir Max Hill, the former director of public prosecutions and another supporter of the bill, are also attending.</p> \n  <p><em>11am (UK time):</em> Keir Starmer is due to hold a press conference in Baku in Azerbaijan, where he is attending the Cop29 summit.

      "bodyText": "Britain has a \u201chuge opportunity\u201d to get ahead of other countries in the race for green investment after the election of Donald Trump as US president, Keir Starmer has said. Speaking at the Cop29 conference in Baku in Azerbaijan, Starmer also claimed that the government could reach its new climate target without \u201ctelling people how to live their lives\u201d. (See 11.58am.) Fewer than 1,000 patients a year in England and Wales are expected to choose assisted dying should the law pass, the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater said, as she outlined her bill setting out the change. Keir Starmer\u2019s former chief of staff Sue Gray has decided not to take up the post of nation and regions envoy after it became clear the prime minister was planning to withdraw his offer, the Guardian understands. Inspectors have uncovered a \u201ctoxic\u201d and secretive culture at an east London council, with decision-making dominated by the inner circle of the local mayor, Lutfur Rahman, according to an official report. Hundreds of schools in England are still at risk of collapse from crumbling concrete, according to previously unpublished figures. The Green party has said that, if Keir Starmer wants to achieve his net zero targets, he will need to do more to get people to cut their energy use. Responding to Starmer\u2019s announcement about a new emissions reduction target for 2035, the Green party MP Ellie Chowns said: The announcement of an 81% cut in emissions by 2035 is welcome \u2013 we need to remove fossil fuels from our economy as rapidly as possible. However, the transition to clean energy needs to be matched by moves on energy reduction. We need a mass home insulation programme and large-scale investment in public transport and active travel. Instead, we have seen Labour downgrade the retrofitting of homes, fail to make solar panels on new builds mandatory, hike bus fares by 50% and offer only loose change for walking and cycling. Keir Starmer says he will not tell people how to live their lives [see 11.30am and 11.58am], but he can put in place policies to support us to make changes that reduce emissions, cut bills and improve our health and wellbeing. This must involve every government department being laser focused on achieving our climate targets. Government whips have urged Labour MPs to be careful when using mobile phones near Westminster after \u201ca number\u201d reported having their devices stolen, Tom Scotson reports in a story for PoliticsHome. The Institute for Government thinktank has published a report today on what the budget will mean for public services. It welcomes the extra funding they are getting, but it says that more will have to be done at the spending review if people are going to notice a significant improvement in service delivery by the time of the next election. Here is an extract. Given the poor state of many services, growing demand and the cost of meeting higher wage bills (including hikes to national insurance contributions and the national living wage), this budget was never going to return public services to full health. But the largely deliverable spending plans it set out should start to address the most serious wounds \u2013 for example, with the extra money for prisons and schools\u2019 special educational needs funding. The government has also made a start on its long-term objectives with a meaningful boost to capital budgets \u2013 another area of weakness long identified by the Institute for Government \u2013 while other measures will provide some breathing room for ministers to think more radically in the spending review next spring. There is a lot of potential in the government\u2019s plan to take a mission-led approach to that spending review and in its nascent reform agenda of creating more local and preventative services. While the budget could have done more to make a start on these changes, it is reasonable to save the bulk of this work till the spring. But the pressure to get these reforms right is high: on current plans, spending is due to grow much more slowly beyond 2025/26 and in fact implies substantial cuts to unprotected areas such as local government and criminal justice. Summing up the report\u2019s verdict, Nick Davies, programme director at the IfG, said: The outgoing Conservative government left public services in an appalling state and returning them a decent standard will take at least this parliament. The budget should stabilise most services in the short-term and made the first tentative steps on the long road to recovery. Much more will be needed in the spending review from Labour\u2019s reform plans if they are to deliver meaningful improvements by the next election. Lord Mandelson, the former Labour cabinet minister, is now described as favourite to be the next UK amassador to Washington. He is also down to the final five in the election to be next chancellor of Oxford University. The two cities are 3,600 miles away from each other, but Mandelson told the Times\u2019s How to Win an Election podcast that he did not think he would have a problem combining both jobs at the same time. He explained: If by some chance these two things were to happen, they are not, you know, incompatible with each other. And the university has made that clear to me. They\u2019re not incompatible. Look, if I was in the United States, I would be promoting Oxford as a great, iconic premier university that is revered in the US. And if I was in Oxford as its ceremonial figurehead, I would be helping to bring in the best of American philanthropy. So they\u2019re not incompatible. And I think anyone who thinks for one moment will realise that. There are few people in British public life who have been as accomplished as Mandelson at accumulating titles and so it is quite possible he will end up with both jobs. William Hague once mocked this trait in a speech when Mandelson was in government. He said: [Mandelson\u2019s] title now adds up to, \u201cThe right honourable the Baron Mandelson of Foy in the county of Herefordshire and Hartlepool in the county of Durham, First Secretary of State, Lord President of the Privy Council and Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills\u201d. It would be no surprise to wake up in the morning and find that he had become an archbishop. Hague may have been ahead of his time. There is now a vacancy for one of those too \u2026 Tim Farron, the former Lib Dem leader, is one of the MPs who has said they will vote against the assisted dying bill. He posted this on social media. Given that we know that coercive control is something insidious and manipulative and that people often don\u2019t realise they have been victims until years later, the Assisted Dying Bill is an enormous threat to vulnerable people. There are no adequate safeguards here. More from my colleague Jessica Elgot on the assisted dying bill. A lot of MPs are also trying to work out the numbers for assisted dying, without committing themselves. Suggests two things to me - a) people trying to work out if they can abstain b) trying to pick the \u201cwinning\u201d side. While MPs are debating the final stages of the House of Lords (hereditary peers) bill, peers are holding a general debate on Lords reform. As my colleague Henry Dyer points out, one chamber is a lot more interested in the topic than the other. Ellie Reeves, the Cabinet Office minister, has told MPs that amendments tabled to the House of Lords (hereditary peers) bill suggest there is no principled objection in the Commons to the government\u2019s plan to remove the right of hereditary peers to sit in the Lords. The last Labour government removed most hereditary peers from the Lords, but 92 were allowed to stay as a compromise. Under a peculiar rule, the legislation said that when any of them died, there would be byelctions to replace them, with only peers voting and only hereditary peers able to stand as candidates. The new bill will abolish this system, and remove the right of the remaining hereditaries (currently 88 in number) to be in the Lords because of their hereditary peerage. Some of them may be offered life peerages. Opening today\u2019s debate, which will deal with its committee and remaining stages in the Commons, Reeves said: This bill is a matter of principle. In the 21st century it cannot be right for there to be places in our legislature reserved for those born into certain families. Having now seen all of the amendments tabled from parties from across the house, it is clear there is no principled objection to the aim of this bill, which is to remove the right of people to sit and make laws in our legislature by virtue of an accident of birth. Alex Burghart, Reeves\u2019 Tory shadow, said the bill was \u201can attempt to gerrymander the membership of the House of Lords undercover of a reform\u201d. Pete Wishart, the SNP\u2019s deputy leader at Westminster, said the bill did not go far enough. He said he hoped there would be a vote on an SNP amendment banning anyone who has donated more than \u00a311,180 to a political party (the threshold at which a donation must be declared) from getting a peerage. He said: 114 years since the Labour party first promised to abolish the House of Lords and the best they can do is this quite frankly embarrassing bill. Unlike the Westminster parties, our position in the SNP is unequivocal \u2013 get rid of the House of Lords now. At the very least Labour MPs must now back my amendment to end peerages being dished out to party donors \u2013 this murky practice should have ended with the Cash-for-Honours scandal. The only possible reason Labour MPs could have for not backing this amendment is that they want to keep stuffing the House of Lords with their millionaire donors. Other SNP amendments, include one saying the Lords should be abolished and another saying peers should have to pay income tax on the daily allowance they receive, were not allowed because they were outside the scope of the bill. MPs will vote on amdendments to the bill later this afternoon or early this evening. My colleague Jessica Elgot says MPs are completely in the dark as to how the Commons will vote when Kim Leadbeater\u2019s assisted dying bill gets it second reading a fortnight on Friday. Talking to a lot of backbench MPs today about assisted dying and absolutely no one I have spoken to has any idea how to vote. Have no idea how this is going to go\u2026 Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, considered plans to introduce road charging in the capital ahead of this year\u2019s mayoral election, according to a report by Jim Waterson on his new London Centric Substack blog. But he says Khan dropped the idea in the face of Tory claims that he was anti-motorist. Waterson says: The pay-per-mile scheme, known as Next Generation Charging but codenamed internally as \u201cProject Gladys\u201d, was expected to be introduced in September 2026, as a flagship policy of the mayor\u2019s third and final term. In highly confidential internal documents seen by London Centric, TfL\u2019s own modelling set out how the move would lead to a collapse in the number of cars on the roads. Khan now insists he will never introduce a pay-per-mile scheme. He pulled the plug on the project ahead of his re-election campaign following claims by political opponents that Labour was pursuing a \u201cwar on the motorist\u201d. This is despite huge pressure to reach the ambitious green targets he has set himself, which will require a substantial decrease in the number of vehicles on London\u2019s roads. A reader asks: @Andrew - does Justin Welby keep his seat in the House of Lords? It appears that it is very difficult to revoke a peerage, although I\u2019m not sure if the ones given to the clergy are treated any differently. There are 26 bishops in the House of Lords (including the two archbishops). Unlike other members of the House of Lords, bishops aren\u2019t there for life. Their right to sit in the Lords is tied to being a bishop, and once they retire from that, they are out. The situation is a different for archbishops because normally they get offered a life peerage when they stand down (just as a few other people with VIP establishment jobs do, like former cabinet secretaries, Met police commissioners and Speakers of the House of Commons). Given the circumstances of Welby\u2019s resignation, he might have to wait a bit for a life peerage, or he might not get one at all. But I suspect it is more likely than not that he will get the customary peerage at some point. National Citizen Service (NCS), a flagship volunteering idea promoted by David Cameron when he became prime minister, is finally being scrapped, Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, has told MPs. In a statement to parliament, Nandy confirmed the move as part of announcement about developing plans for a new national youth strategy. Cameron originally proposed national citizen service when he was opposition leader as a modern version of national service \u2013 compulsory military service for young people, phased out in the UK in the early 1960s but still a popular concept with rightwing Tories. Cameron\u2019s version involved teenagers volunteering. Originally he suggested that all young people might take part, in an initiative that was part of his \u201cBig Society\u201d vision and that he hoped would break down class divisions. But when his government did launch the scheme after 2010 it was voluntary. The government eventually passed legislation making the scheme permanent. But by then Cameron was out of office, and subsequently the scheme had its budget slashed. Nandy told the Commons today that from March next year NCS will be wound down for good. She told MPs: In 2011 when the National Citizen Service was established, Facebook and X had only 700 million users. Now they have over three billion. And TikTok had not even been dreamt of. In 2011 an estimated one in eight 10 to 15 year olds had a probable mental health problem. Now that\u2019s one in five. The world has changed and we need a youth strategy that reflects that. Nandy also told MPs that the government would be developing a new national youth strategy, and that this would be backed by \u00a385m from government, and a further \u00a3100m from the dormant assets scheme. In a news release, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport says: The strategy will prioritise delivering better coordinated youth services and policy at a local, regional and national level. It will make sure decision-making moves away from a one-size-fits all approach, handing power back to young people and their communities, and rebuilding a thriving and sustainable sector. This will help deliver on the government\u2019s missions, spreading opportunities, making our streets safer and taking pressure off health services. To kickstart the process, the government is inviting young people to take part in a series of face-to-face engagements to ensure their perspectives and aspirations are at the heart of decision making. They will then be asked to share their views as part of a \u2018Today\u2019s Youth, Tomorrow\u2019s Nation\u2019 conversation on how best to help the next generation of young people \u2026 More than \u00a385m will be allocated in recognition of the urgent need for more youth facilities. This will include \u00a326m of new funding for youth clubs to buy new equipment and undertake much needed renovations via the Better Youth Spaces programme. The Financial Times is reporting that Sue Gray has decided not to take up the offer of a job at Keir Starmer\u2019s envoy for the regions and nations. In her story Lucy Fisher says: On Tuesday, her allies told the FT that she has rejected the offer. \u201cSue has taken a decision not to take the role. She\u2019s going to focus on other things,\u201d one said. The person added: \u201cShe\u2019s taken time to think about it properly, talking to stakeholders, but ultimately she\u2019s decided she doesn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d In her own story, my colleague Pippa Crerar says the job offer was being withdrawn anyway. She points out that Gray was offered the post almost six weeks ago, but this week was still on the \u201cshort break\u201d we were told she was taking when she was dropped as Starmer\u2019s chief of staff (a delay in turning up that would stretch the patience of most employers). Pippa says it looks like Gray jumped before she was pushed. Has Sue Gray jumped before she is pushed? Sources told me this morning that Starmer was planning to withdraw his offer of nations &amp; regions envoy - but \u2066@LOS_Fisher reporting allies of Gray saying she no longer plans to take it up\u2026 Keir Starmer is planning to withdraw the offer to his former chief of staff Sue Gray of the post of nations and regions envoy amid concerns over what exactly the role would entail, Pippa Crerar reports. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, told the BBC this morning that he thought \u201cthe economics\u201d would push Donald Trump in the direction of renewable energy. Trump\u2019s re-election has been widely seen as a disaster for global efforts to deal with the climate crisis because Trump has described climate change as a \u201choax\u201d and he is an unashamed support of more drilling for oil and gas Asked about how the government would deal with this given its ambitious climate goals, Miliband replied: It\u2019s our job to work with the duly-elected US president. He has his own views. I think what\u2019s interesting about this \u2013 and you will see what decisions the new administration makes \u2013 is that the economics now point in the direction of clean energy. If you think about lots of the decisions that companies and countries are making, they recognise this is the single biggest job creator of our era, and so people want to be ahead in that race. So, we will seek to find common ground with Donald Trump, he will make his own decisions about what he wants to do. I obviously want him to stay in the Paris Climate Agreement, but that\u2019s his decision. In the interview, Miliband was also asked about a post he put on Twitter in 2016 about Trump saying \u201cthe idea that we have shared values with a racist, misogynistic, self-confessed groper beggars belief.\u201d Miliband replied: Look, I\u2019ve said things in the past. My job now as a government minister is to work with the new US administration. I genuinely don\u2019t think that Donald Trump is reading my tweets, I don\u2019t have such a high opinion of myself. Ministers are to partially take over the running of Tower Hamlets council for at least three years after inspectors found the East London local authority had a secretive and \u201ctoxic\u201d culture based around its controversial mayor, Lutfur Rahman. In a written statement, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it would propose sending \u201cministerial envoys\u201d to work with the council, and would instruct it to appoint at least two opposition councillors to its advisory board. Rahman was originally the Labour leader of the council, and then its directly-elected mayor. He was re-elected as an independent but removed from office in 2015 after a specialist court concluded that he was guilty of vote-rigging, buying votes and religious intimidation. He returned in 2022 under the banner of his Aspire party, after a five-year ban from office had lapsed. After new concerns about the running of the council, inspectors were sent in by the previous government. Today\u2019s statement said they found a series of concerns, including a lack of trust between political parties, and a subsequent churn of top officials, with concerns that many had left \u201cas a result of \u2018speaking truth to power\u201d. They also found limited scrutiny, an internal culture described as \u201csuspicious and defensive\u201d and \u201ctoxic\u201d, with key decisions taken by a small group of people around Rahman. While the council had made some changes, the statement said, the leadership showed a tendency to reject criticism, adding: \u201cOn some issues, the inspectors are sceptical of the council\u2019s capability to self-improve.\u201d Jim McMahon, the local government minister, said he was satisfied the problems were sufficiently serious that he was justified under the Local Government Act to impose a \u201cstatutory support pack\u201d for at least three years, with the envoys regularly reporting back. In its own statement, the council welcomed the plan, saying it was \u201ccommitted to working with the government on our continuous journey of improvement\u201d. Q: What is your message for Donald Trump about whether he should stick to the Paris climate agreement? Starmer ignored the Trump part of the question, but said he wanted to show UK leadership on climate issues at the Cop conference. He went on: I see this not just as a global challenge, but a global opportunity. If you look at where global investors are investing, they are investing in renewables, and everybody knows there\u2019s a transition, an energy transition. These things happen quite rarely, once in a generation usually, perhaps a little bit longer than that, where there\u2019s a global transition on energy. And the lesson from history is to go into that transition with a clear plan for a just outcome, but also to take advantage of being a first mover in that. And that\u2019s what I want us to be. There\u2019s a race on for the next generation of jobs. They\u2019re good, well paid jobs. Other countries are in that race. I want to be in it, and I want to win it for the UK, because that will be measured in jobs, well paid, good, secure jobs in the UK for many years to come. Q: [From the Daily Mirror] Would you support banning private flights for personal use? Starmer said he is not going to tell people how to behave. But he said there were measures in the budget affecting private jets. Q: [From Hugo Gye at the i] What is your message to Donald Trump about Ukraine? Starmer said he was not going to start \u201csending messages to the president-elect\u201d. But he said he was happy to state his own position \u201cbecause it\u2019s been my position since the very start, which is that we strongly support Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression\u201d. He said his discussions with other leaders in recent weeks have focused on putting Ukraine in the \u201cbest possible, strongest position\u201d going forward. Q: [From the Times] Is it really realistic to think you can hit your new carbon target without any change to how people live their everyday lives? Starmer said this was realistic. He replied: Yes, of course it is. And the target is my target, and the plan is my plan. I\u2019m not borrowing from somebody else\u2019s plan. I don\u2019t think that as we tackle this really important issue, the way to do it is to tell people how to run their lives and instruct them how to behave. I\u2019m not going to do that. I made a commitment before the election and shortly after the election that we\u2019d be a government that trod lightly on people\u2019s lives and I\u2019m not going to now go around telling people how to live their lives. I do think that the single most important milestone in hitting the target we\u2019ve set out today is clean power 2030 which I know is tough \u2026 I\u2019m absolutely sure we can do it. Q: [From Christopher Hope at GB News] In relation to the controversy about the plan to subject farms to inheritance tax, John McTernan, a former adviser to Tony Blair, has said that farming is an industry the UK does not need and that the government should treat them as Margaret Thatcher treater the miners. Do you agree? Starmer said he totally disagreed. I totally disagree. I\u2019m absolutely committed to supporting our farmers. I said that before the election, and I say it after the election. That is why, in our budget last week, I was very pleased that we\u2019re investing \u00a35bn of our budget over the next two years into farming \u2026 I think it\u2019s essential that [farmers] not only prosper, but prosper well into the future. So I totally disagree with those comments. Q: Do you think Justin Welby should resign? And do you think people should face consequences if they do not report possible criminality to the police? Starmer says this is a matter for the church, but he says these are \u201chorrific\u201d allegations. His thoughts are with the victims, he says. For a second time, he says the allegations are horrific. I\u2019m not going to shy away from the fact that saying these are horrific allegations and that my thoughts are with the victims in relation to it. He does not express any support for Welby. UPDATE: Starmer said: Let me be clear: of what I know of the allegations, they are clearly horrific in relation to this particular case, both in their scale and their content. My thoughts, as they are in all of these issues, are with the victims here who have obviously been failed very, very badly. It\u2019s a matter, in the end, for the church, but I\u2019m not going to shy away from the fact of saying that these are horrific allegations and that my thoughts are with the victims in relation to it. Q: How will you vote on assisted dying? Starmer says he will not be putting pressure on Labour MPs. He says he wants to study the detail of the bill, but safeguards are important to him. When I was chief prosecutor, I was involved in drawing up guidelines. We had a massive consultation exercise, and I saw first-hand the depth of the strength of the arguments on both sides. That is why this will be a free vote. And it will be a free vote where every MP can decide for themselves what position they want to take on the bill, and I will not be putting pressure on any MP to vote one way or the other. I personally will study the details of the bill, which has now been published today, because safeguards have always been extremely important to me and were an essential part of the guidance that I myself drew up when I was chief prosecutor. Starmer is now taking questions. Q: [From Alex Forsyth at the BBC] How will you achieve this? What will it mean for people? Starmer says: We\u2019ve set out the target, which is an important, ambitious target. What we\u2019re not going to do is start telling people how to live their lives. We\u2019re not going to start dictating to people what they do. Starmer says the UK has sent a clear message at this Cop. We are delivering on our promise for good jobs, cheaper bills and higher growth. We are backing UK energy and security on the world stage. We are a key partner for countries, for investors and for businesses, and we are renewing the UK\u2019s climate leadership to deliver for Britain. Starmer confirms that the UK is now committed to a new green goal \u2013 cutting emissions by 81% compared with 1990 levels by 2035. Keir Starmer is holding a press conference at the Cop29 conference in Baku. He says there can be no national security, no economic security, and no global security, without climate security. He says the government has made a rapid start on measures to achieve its goal of decarbonising electricity supply by 2030. The race is on for the clean energy jobs of the future, he says. And he says he wants the UK to be \u201cahead of the game\u201d. Prinsley intervenes with a final point. He says he is telling MPs that abstaining is not a neutral act. People should came and vote, he says. Leadbeater agrees. She says abstaining would imply the status quo is OK. If you abstain, you are saying that the status quo is OK, and hopefully this moment has proved that it\u2019s not OK. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Leadbeater says people with a disability who are not terminally ill are not covered by the bill. She says it is devastating to hear disabled people say they are treated as second class citizens. She says she supports the rights of disabled people. But those rights should not be protected at the expense of the rights of the terminally ill. Leadbeater says, if the bill passes its second reading on 29 November, there will be a \u201crobust process\u201d afterwards. She says it will have to go through a bill committee, and then there wil be a further debate in the chamber before it goes to the Lords. Asked if the bill can be talked out, she says she could use a closure motion to stop this happening. We are getting towards the end, and rushing through final questions now. In response to a question about people dying early, Leadbeater says having the assisted dying option available means that people might put off dying for longer than they do now. Q: Have you got enough MPs supporting you to win? Leadbeater says the debate has begun. People are taking this very seriously. Some MPs are undecided. But now they have the bill. Malthouse says there has been \u201ca big shift\u201d since 2015, when an assisted dying bill was defeated by 330 votes 118. Prinsley says his impression is that older MPs are more inclined to vote for the bill, and younger MPs less so. So, he says, he is less confident about this passing than he was when the debate started. Leadbeater agrees. She says she thinks people who have had experience of a relative going through a painful death are more likely to be in favour. Malthouse intervenes. He goes back to the question about doctors charging, and he says there are three places in the bill where it says they cannot benefit from this. They would have to offer this service as part of their palliative care offer, he says. Q: Would it just be family courts dealing with this? And what would this do for court capacity? Falconer says these applications will not take a long time. These cases would take precedent. But he says they would not have a significant impact on delays in family courts, he says. Hill says the bill is very clear that this bill would only apply to the terminally ill. A judge would not be able to apply the provisions to anyone else. Falconer says a lawyer could argue that this law is discriminatory, on the grounds that it discriminates between the terminally ill and other people. But a legal case like this would have \u201cno prospect of success\u201d, because the courts in Europe have said repeatedly that assisted dying is not a right provided by the European court of human rights. He says the courts have always treated this as a matter for national parliaments. So any legal challenge on ECHR grounds would be \u201cdoomed\u201d, he says. UPDATE: This article by the lawyers Anurag Deb and Lewis Graham, on the UK Human Rights Blog, backs up what Falconer was saying at greater length. Q: How much would doctors charge for approving assisted dying requests? Leadbeater says there would be no obligation on doctors to get involved. On costs, she says the bill says there should be no financial gain for anyone from this. Q: The Western Australian numbers imply the number of people using the law in the UK would be in the thousands every year, not in the hundreds. Talbot says in Western Australia practitioner-administration is allowed, and that is used in 80% of cases. She says the UK bill would just allow self-administration. That is why the numbers are likely to be lower. Peter Prinsley, a Labour MP elected at the election who is also a doctor, is speaking now. He was meant to be on the panel, but did not speak at the state. Leadbeater invites him to contribute now. Prinsley says, as a young doctor, he was opposed to assisted dying. Now he is in favour, he says. He says he does not expect a large number of people to use the new law. On palliative care, he says it should be as good as possible. It should be a core NHS service, and not something just delivered by charities. But even people with the best palliative care sometimes regard that as \u201cinsufficient\u201d. Falconer says the courts are experienced at dealing with capacity issues (ie, does a person have the capacity to decide what should happen to them). But the NHS is experienced at dealing with capacity considerations too. The panel are now taking questions. Q: How many people do you expect to use this law? Leadbeater says most evidence from around the world suggests between 0.5% and 3% of deaths would be covered. Initially the numbers would be in the hundreds, she says. Falconer says different numbers apply in different countries. But the numbers would grow, he says. Leadbeater refers to the figures quoted early showing that, in Western Australia, less than half of the people who registered did not use the right. (See 10.23am.) But having that permission gave them reassurance, she says. Q: Would the court hearings be in public? Hill says the bill shows that there would have to be a \u201csubstantive consideration\u201d. That means the legal process would not just be a tick box exercise. He says how the hearings operate is something that would be decided at a later point. But the bill does not say they have to take place in private, he says. Max Hill, the former director of public prosecutions, is speaking now. He says the law has not changed since the Suicide Act of 1961. At present there is a \u201ctwo-gear system\u201d. People with money can go to Dignitas. But if a relative even just buys them a ticket, they are committing a criminal offence. He says judges have not been able to change the law; there are limits on what they can do. And the CPS cannot properly address this either, he says, because it cannot say for certain that it won\u2019t prosecute some cases. Under the current system, all the scrutiny happens after someone has died. He says it is time for parliament to look at this again, and pass a better law. After a death does happen, a grieving relative is left in limbo for 15, 15, 18 months, not knowing if they will be prosecuted for booking that ticket to Dignitas, or leaving the pills by the bedside. That shows the law at the moment \u201cprovides no safeguards \u2026 and leads the vulnerable in pitiable situation\u201d. Hill says the Leadbeater bill \u201chas safeguards all over it\u201d. Sally Talbot, an Australian MP and a doctor, is speaking next. She says Western Australia has had an assisted dying law since July 2021. She says she has been following the debate in the UK closely, and in many ways the debates are identical. In Western Australia, as in the UK, there were convincing arguments that the system was broken and the law needed to change. But in Western Australia, as here, there were also reservations. And people worried what might happen to palliative care. She says in Australia the latest report on the law has just come out. It says that 1,851 in Western Australia have requested an assisted death since the law came in, and 738 have died by chosing an assisted death. She says the law was decriminalised. \u201cRemember, it happens now, but we have decriminalised it,\u201d she says. The law treats this as a rational decision to end suffering. Western Australia was the second state in the country to legislate for this. All the others have legislated now, she says. She says there are two points where the Australian legislation is similar to Leadbeater\u2019s. First, the law says you must have a terminal illness. And, second, to be eligible, you must have an enduring capacity to consent at every stage of the process. She says these two principles are the \u201cbedroock safeguards\u201d. They are in the Western Australian legislation, and in Leadbeater\u2019s too. She says when they were taking evidence in her state, they did her evidence of coercion. But it was coercion from relatives who were trying to persuade terminally ill people not to die because they wanted an extra week with them. Leadbeater introduces the next speaker, Nat Dye, who has terminal cancer. She says she thinks his views are the most important for people to hear at this press conference. He says he has known \u201cpositive\u201d experiences of death. His fiance and his mother both had relatively peaceful deaths. He says palliative care can work for some people. But he says he is \u201choping for the best but preparing for the worst\u201d. This bill would allow him to avoid the worst-case scenario of a bad death. He is not afraid of dying, he says. He says his loved ones will have to live with the manner of his death for the rest of their lives. He can imagine a situation where he might never get out of bed again. Talk about the end of the tunnel? The tunnel is blocked up, he says. Even with the best palliative care, people can suffer painful deaths. He says he sees this bill as being about allowing him to perform \u201cone last act of kindness\u201d to his family, and to himself too. He says he cannot imagine anyone wanting to end their life because they think they are a burden. For him, choosing to end his life would be an act of kindness. UPDATE: Dye said: Imagine I am dying and palliative care hasn\u2019t improved. Well, I have no choice whatsoever: I die in pain or I die in pain. I see this as a chance just to act with kindness and a choice for people at their darkest hour. I am not a doctor, I am not a lawyer, but I would just implore MPs and peers to really carefully consider these safeguards because I think it is the best phrase I have got: my very death depends on it. The Conservative MP Kit Malthouse is speaking now. Leadbeater introduces him as evidence that her campaign is cross-party. Malthouse says he has been in favour of assisted dying legislation for a long time. He says it is harrowing to hear from people whose relatives have wanted to end their lives in harrowing circumstances. Charlie Falconer, the former Labour lord chancellor, is speaking now. He says the law is \u201ccompletely broken\u201d. The law says people can be jailed for 14 years for helping people to die, but the CPS will not prosecute people motivated by compassion. He says Leadbeater has described the bill as having \u201cthe best and most robust safeguards in the world\u201d for a law like this, and she is right. Kim Leadbeater is speaking now. She says after she came top in the ballot for private member\u2019s bill she suddenly became \u201cthe most popular person in the world\u201d. Many groups wanted her to take up a bill. She says she has consulted very widely on the bill, with the BMA, the archbishop of Canterbury, disability rights activists, medics and lawyers. The current law is not fit for practice, she says. People who do want to end their lives have to travel abroad, and often do so prematurely. She says, however good palliative care is, some people still face a harrowing death. And, when you meet people who have had that experience in their families, you realise \u201cthe status quo cannot go on\u201d, she says. She urges reporters to speak to families in this situation. The Kim Leadbeater briefing is taking place in an MP\u2019s room in the Commons. There are about a dozen or more journalists here, and almost as many people due to speak. Half the journos have ended up sitting on the floor. We are just starting now. The Conservative MP Danny Kruger has posted a lengthy thread on social media explaining why he is opposed to the assisted dying bill. Here are some of his posts. The Bill tries and fails to restrict itself to the extreme cases. But anyone who can find two doctors to confirm they\u2019re within 6 months of death - and a judge to confirm they\u2019re making their own decision - can qualify. (Actually it\u2019s not even \u2018doctors\u2019 but \u2018medical practitioners\u2019, the definition of which will specified at a later date - so a nurse or pharmacist, I guess.) You need to be registered with the first \u2018practitioner\u2019 for 12 months before they can give the green light. If the second one you pick doesn\u2019t agree to sign your form, you can shop around for another one. And if they don\u2019t agree either, I think - it\u2019s not clear - you can start the whole process again, and repeat till you get your wish. So it\u2019s death on demand, if a little slow and bureaucratic (for now - till the activists persuade Parliament to speed it up and simplify it on compassionate grounds). And by the way you don\u2019t have to do all this yourself. A \u2018proxy\u2019 - someone you\u2019ve known for 2 years, or someone \u2018of good standing in the community\u2019 (the Neighbourhood Assisted Death Advisor, perhaps) - can do all the paperwork for you. Stephen Flynn, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, has submitted an application to stand for the party at the next Scottish parliament election but, if elected, also plans to remain an MP, PA Media reports. Writing in the Press and Journal newspaper, Flynn said he hopes to be joined by current and former colleagues at Westminster in aiming to become an MSP at the 2026 election. He said that, if elected, he plans to remain the MP for Aberdeen South until the next general election but would not take two salaries. He wrote: I\u2019m chucking my bonnet in the ring. I will be seeking my party\u2019s nomination to be their candidate for Aberdeen South and North Kincardine at the 2026 Scottish Parliament election. Why? Well, it\u2019s simple really. I don\u2019t want to sit out the upcoming battles that our city, shire and country face in Holyrood \u2026 In my mind, it is clear that we are at a crucial junction in our nation\u2019s story. As John Swinney rebuilds the SNP and refocuses his government, I feel that I can contribute towards the next chapter and help build the case for independence. And, in doing so, I\u2019ll aim to be as unashamed as always in putting Aberdeen and Scotland first. Flynn has been tipped as a future SNP leader, but in practice to run for that post he would need to be sitting as an MSP, not an MP. Kim Leadbeater\u2019s terminally ill adults (end of life) bill would apply in England and Wales. Here is an article by Harriet Sherwood explaining what it would do. In Scotland the Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur has tabled a bill to allow assisted dying, but the Scottish government has said that the Scottish parliament cannot pass it because laws relating to lethal drugs are reserved to Westminster. In Northern Ireland the DUP is strongly opposed to assisted dying, but Sinn F\u00e9in and the SDLP are sympathetic to changing the law to allow it. The UK\u2019s jobs market has shown further signs of cooling after a rise in unemployment in September while pay growth slowed, Richard Partington reports. Good morning. Parliament passes important laws (as well as some rather tedious ones), but normally the process is predictable because the government is in charge and most of what it does foreshadowed in a manifesto. Once a minister says \u2018X will become law\u2019, usually it does. But assisted dying is different because the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater is trying to change the bill through the private member\u2019s bill process, MPs will have a free vote and no one really has much of a clue as to what will happen. The main uncertainty is whether or not MPs will vote to give the bill a second reading when it is debated, on Friday 29 November. But even if it passes at second reading, given the jeopardy inherent in the private member\u2019s bill process, it could still be touch and go whether it becomes law. Leadbeater published her bill last night, and she is holding a briefing about it this morning. Here is our overnight story by Jessica Elgot, Harriet Sherwood and Kiran Stacey. Even though Labour MPs will have a free vote, the views of ministers, and the prime minister, will still be influential. Keir Starmer voted in favour of assisted dying when the Commons last debated a bill (in 2015 \u2013 it was defeated by 33o votes to 118) and, when asked about this issue before the election, he always implied that, provided the safeguards were adequate, he would vote in favour again. When he was director of public prosecutions in 2010, with parliament refusing to change the law and the CPS under pressure to prosecute people who had clearly helped terminally ill relatives to die out of kindness, not malice, Starmer issued new guidance on what might have to happen for the CPS to decide prosecution was not in the public interest. This did not change the law, but it was a bold move by a DPP clearly frustrated at the way the law was operating. Now the bill is out, and Starmer can exame the safeguards, which are not trivial. But he still has not said definitely that he will vote for the bill. Speaking to reporters travelling with him at the Cop29 summit, he said Labour MPs would have to make up their own minds. He said: Look, it\u2019s going to be a free vote and I mean that. It will be for every MP to decide for themselves how they want to vote. I\u2019m not going to be putting any pressure whatsoever on Labour MPs. They will make their own mind up, as I will be. Obviously a lot will depend on the detail and we need to get the balance right but I\u2019ve always argued there will need to be proper safeguards in place. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Kim Leadbeater holds a press briefing about her assisted dying bill. Charlie Falconer, the former lord chancellor who has introduced similar legislation in the the Lords, and Sir Max Hill, the former director of public prosecutions and another supporter of the bill, are also attending. 11am (UK time): Keir Starmer is due to hold a press conference in Baku in Azerbaijan, where he is attending the Cop29 summit. Later he is due to give a speech confirming the government\u2019s new target to cut emissions by 81% compared with 1990 levels by 2035. After 12.30pm: MPs debate the remaining stages of the House of Lords (hereditary peers) bill. If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line or message me on social media.

Merchan\u2019s decision was not made public until Tuesday \u2013 the day he was set to issue his ruling on the immunity issue. The postponement followed numerous successful attempts to delay Trump\u2019s case. Earlier this year, he was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in a scheme to influence the 2016 election. The verdict came on 30 May \u2013 following fewer than 12 hours of jury deliberations in the unprecedented first criminal trial of a US president, former or sitting. The outcome marked a potentially stunning blow to Trump, then the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. The campaign for Joe Biden, who ultimately withdrew his re-election bid, said \u201cno one is above the law\u201d in an email blast shortly after the verdict. \u201cIn New York today, we saw that no one is above the law.

But Trump, whose poll numbers remained steady throughout the trial, did not lose support. He ultimately became the Republican nominee and, on 5 November, bested Kamala Harris. Trump was originally scheduled to be sentenced on 10 July. Then came the 1 July US supreme court ruling that granted sitting presidents broad immunity for official acts taken during their time in office. Trump urged Merchan to delay his sentencing in light of this ruling. His legal team pushed to challenge Trump\u2019s conviction, citing the supreme court decision.

Prosecutors on 10 November sent an email to Merchan indicating that Trump\u2019s team had asked them to agree to a stay so there would be time to review \u201ca number of arguments based on the impact on this proceeding from the results of the presidential election; defendant\u2019s forthcoming certification as president-elect on January 6, 2025; and his inauguration on January 20, 2025\u201d. \u201cThe people agree that these are unprecedented circumstances and that arguments raised by defense counsel in correspondence to the people on Friday require careful consideration to ensure that any further steps in this proceeding appropriately balance the competing interests of (1) a jury verdict of guilty following trial that has the presumption of regularity; and (2) the office of the president,\u201d prosecutors also wrote. They asked Merchan for time to \u201cassess recent developments\u201d and to give them until 19 November to advise him what they believe are \u201cappropriate steps going forward\u201d. Prosecutors indicated that they had spoken to Trump\u2019s team about this and that they agreed to this request. Trump\u2019s lawyers argued over the weekend that there are \u201cstrong reasons for the requested stay, and eventually dismissal of the case in the interests of justice\u201d, according to their aforementioned letter. Trump\u2019s election victory has derailed his other criminal cases. The special prosecutor Jack Smith is winding down the federal election interference and classified documents cases against Trump. The state-level election case in Fulton county, Georgia, is on hold pending appeal, following revelations that the district attorney, Fani Willis, had hired as a prosecutor a man with whom she had an affair. Even if the case survived appeal, proceedings are all but guaranteed to languish until 2029.",

We have lost a dear friend and remarkable artist but take comfort knowing his voice will resonate for generations to come.\u201d</p> <p>Auerbach was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1931 and arrived in Britain eight years later as one of six children to be sponsored by Antonio and Iris Origo. His father, an engineering patent agent, and mother, who trained as an artist, were both murdered in the concentration camps at Auschwitz. Through the sponsorship, he attended Bunce Court in Kent, a progressive boarding school for Jewish refugee children, where his talent for art and drama shone through. In 1947 Auerbach became a naturalised British subject and a year later he began his formal training in London \u2013 St Martin\u2019s School of Art in the day, with extra night classes taken at Borough Polytechnic. During this time he took a role in the then 19-year-old Peter Ustinov\u2019s debut play, House of Regrets, but painting would become his true calling and he continued his studies at the Royal College of Art.</p> <p>Auerbach fell in with Soho\u2019s artistic crowd, which included Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud: when the latter died in 2011, a proportion of his vast Auerbach collection was given to the British government in lieu of \u00a316m death duties.</p> <p>In 1956 Auerbach received his first solo exhibition at London\u2019s Beaux Arts Gallery. Some visitors were unimpressed with his excessive application of paint but he found a fan in the critic David Sylvester, who called it \u201cthe most exciting and impressive first one-man show by an English painter since Francis Bacon in 1949\u201d.</p> <p>Surviving the war was a key influence on Auerbach; he would journey through the capital\u2019s bomb sites and feel an urge to capture the scenes; to somehow document the nation\u2019s collective trauma. Auerbach developed similarly intense relationships with his sitters and preferred to paint only a small circle of friends and family, chief among those his wife, the painter Julia Wolstenholme, the model Juliet Yardley Mills and Estella Olive West, with whom he had a romantic relationship that contributed towards him separating from Wolstenholme. His studio was reportedly cramped and cold, with Auerbach turning the oven on during winter to keep it habitable. To sit for him could be an endurance in itself: the weekly two-hour sessions could go on for a year while Auerbach painted, scraped and repainted. \u201cRather like going to the dentist,\u201d one sitter reported.</p>    <p>After years of struggling financially, things picked up for Auerbach in later life. In 1978 he was the subject of a major retrospective at the Hayward Gallery in London, with the curator Catherine Lampert becoming a regular sitter for several decades afterwards. He represented Britain at the Venice Biennale in 1986, sharing the Golden Lion prize with the German artist Sigmar Polke.</p> <p>In 2015 London\u2019s Tate Britain staged a major retrospective of Auerbach\u2019s work alongside the Kunstmuseum Bonn. His painting Head of Gerda Boehm fetched more than $5m in 2022.</p> <p>Auerbach frequently referenced art history in his work and liked to discuss insights on his heroes: Constable, Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese. There was certainly something old-fashioned about Auerbach\u2019s approach \u2013 in an age of international travel and glitzy art openings, he would rarely leave his patch of north London.

The Kisufim crossing was opening on Tuesday to allow some trucks through Israel\u2019s newly appointed defense minister Israel Katz has said there will be \u201cno ceasefire\u201d and \u201cno respite\u201d in Lebanon. Posting to social media, Katz said \u201cThe warning and powerful activity carried out by the IDF and the security agencies against Hezbollah and the elimination of [Hassan] Nasrallah are a picture of victory and the offensive activity should be continued, in order to worsen Hezbollah\u2019s capabilities and realise the fruits of victory. In Lebanon there will be no ceasefire and there will be no respite\u201d Katz\u2019 comments directly contradicted a statement from Israel\u2019s foreign minister on Monday that there had been a \u201ccertain progress\u201d in ceasefire talks. Hezbollah said on Monday that it had not been directly involved in any talks Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs have again been hit by multiple Israeli air strikes. Israel\u2019s Arabic-language military spokesperson had issued orders that people in specific locations in southern Beirut \u2013 and many villages in southern Lebanon \u2013 should flee their homes. Israeli attacks on Lebanon have killed 3,287 people and injured 14,222 since 7 October 2023, the Lebanese health ministry said on Tuesday, adding that 44 people in Lebanon had been killed and 88 others injured on Monday alone At least five people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on the Lebanese town of Baalshamieh, according to the health ministry Rocket fire from Lebanon has killed two men in their 40s in northern Israel, close to the town of Nahariya, first responders said Air raid sirens were heard in Tel Aviv earlier today, with the Israeli military saying it had intercepted three projectiles fired from Lebanon. Media reported that sirens were also activated at Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion International Airport, where flights were temporarily halted UN peacekeepers have warned that the Israeli military has committed \u201csevere violations\u201d of a ceasefire deal with Syria as its military continues a major construction project along the so-called Alpha Line that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syria Palestinian media sources report that the Al-Qassam Brigades has claimed it successfully mounted an attack on Israeli troops that had taken refuge inside a house in Jabalia refugee camp in the north of the Gaza Strip. Overnight Israel announced the deaths of four soldiers in combat in the northern Gaza Strip At least 43,665 Palestinian people have been killed and 103,076 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in an update today. Of those, 62 Palestinians were killed and 147 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period, the ministry said. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the following in a direct message to Iranians. In it, he says that Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s government feared the people of Iran more than Israel. In the video message, Netanyahu said: That\u2019s why they spend so much time and money trying to crush your hopes and curb your dreams. Well, I say to you this: Don\u2019t let your dreams die. I hear the whispers: Women, Life, Freedom. Zan, Zendegi, Azadi. Don\u2019t lose hope. And know that Israel and others in the free world stand with you. \u200e\u200f\u200f\u201cI know that you don\u2019t want this war,\u201d says Netanyahu. \u201cI don\u2019t want this war either. The people of Israel don\u2019t want this war. There is one force putting your family in grave danger: the tyrants of Tehran. That\u2019s it.\u201d Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have said they conducted two military operations against US naval vessels in the Red and Arabian seas which the group\u2019s military spokesperson said lasted for eight hours, Reuters reported. The first operation targeted an American aircraft carrier in the Arabian sea with a number of missiles and drones, while the second operation launched missiles and drones at two US destroyers in the Red Sea, Yahya Sarea said on Tuesday. A vessel 70 nautical miles southwest of Yemen\u2019s Hodeidah reported several explosions in its vicinity earlier on Tuesday, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations said, adding that the vessel sustained no damage, and the crew remained safe. Since last October, the Iran-backed Houthis have positioned themselves as a key member of Tehran\u2019s regional network of allies, which includes armed groups in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. Houthi rebels say attacks in the Red Sea are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Rocket fire from Lebanon has killed two men in their 40s in northern Israel, close to the town of Nahariya, first responders said. Emergency medic Dor Vakinin said a rocket hit a warehouse. \u201cThere was a lot of destruction and an active fire,\u201d he said. \u201cWe performed medical examinations on two men who were lying unconscious and suffering from severe injuries to their bodies. Unfortunately their injuries were too severe and after the examinations, we had to determine the death of both of them.\u201d Posting footage of the scene, Israel\u2019s foreign ministry wrote in a post on X: \u201cTwo Israelis were murdered when a Hezbollah rocket targeted Nahariya earlier this evening. Hezbollah must be dismantled terrorist by terrorist, rocket by rocket, until Israelis are safe in their homes.\u201d The Israeli military said earlier that a barrage of 10 rockets was fired from Lebanon into northern Israel, some of which were intercepted, while \u201cothers fell in the area\u201d. It said sirens had sounded in central Israel, including in Tel Aviv and at Ben Gurion airport (see earlier post at 15.12). Three projectiles that crossed from Lebanon were intercepted, the Israeli military said. Israeli forces detained at least 15 Palestinians across the occupied West Bank overnight, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s Commission for Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners\u2019 Society said. According to Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, the detentions were carried out in various areas in the West Bank, including Hebron, Ramallah, Qalqilya, Nablus, Salfit and Jerusalem. Israeli forces destroyed property and made threats against detainees \u2013 which included former detainees who had already spent time in Israeli prisons \u2013 and their families while conducting \u201cviolent raids on homes\u201d, Wafa reports. Some Israeli troops were reported to have ransacked homes and destroyed personal belongings. It is estimated that at least 11,600 Palestinians have been arrested in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since last October. Human rights groups and international organisations have alleged widespread abuse of inmates detained by Israel in raids in the West Bank. They have described alleged abusive and humiliating treatment, including holding blindfolded and handcuffed detainees in cramped cages as well as beatings, intimidation and harassment. Israeli attacks on Lebanon have killed 3,287 people and injured 14,222 since 7 October 2023, the Lebanese health ministry has said, adding that 44 people in Lebanon had been killed and 88 others injured on Monday alone. Hezbollah, the Iranian backed Lebanese militant group, began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 7 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas\u2019s attack on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage. The Israeli military unleashed its assault on Lebanon in October, claiming its aim was to return tens of thousands of people evacuated from homes in northern Israel due to the cross-border hostilities. Geneva Abdul is a reporter for the Guardian In the UK, Dr Nizam Mamode, a general, vascular and transplant surgeon who travelled to Gaza in August, has told MPs of \u201ccollective punishment\u201d in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza that has seen more than 43,000 civilians killed by Israeli forces. Giving evidence to the International Development Committee on Tuesday, Dr Mamode told MPs of the deliberate targeting by Israeli forces on children, the lack of medical and general supplies in the territory and the deliberate targeting of healthcare infrastructure and aid workers. When asked by MP Sarah Champion if he regarded what he saw as genocide, Dr Mamode said: I\u2019m not a international human rights lawyer so I can\u2019t talk about the absolute definitions but it\u2019s difficult to find another word for it given what we\u2019ve seen, and I certainly feel the Palestinians feel that is what is happening to them. He added: \u201cIn a word, yes.\u201d In October, the Guardian spoke with Mamode upon his return to the UK. For a month he volunteered at Gaza\u2019s Nasser hospital as part of a medical team with Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP). He described the territory as \u201cpostapocalyptic\u201d and said that aid workers and journalists were deliberate targets. When asked about deliberate targeting of health workers and facilities by the panel on Tuesday, Mamode said: \u201cTo my mind it can\u2019t be anything other than collective punishment, it\u2019s just a consistent attempt to essentially wipe out a large part of the population.\u201d Also speaking before the panel was Sam Rose, a senior deputy director for Unrwa affairs. Rose described the recent Israeli ban on the UN aid organisation as \u201cdevastating\u201d. \u201cIt will be devastating,\u201d said Rose, adding that no other organisation has the scale or scope to provide for Gaza\u2019s 1.9mn residents as Unrwa does. The agency provides food aid, shelter, sanitation, water management and public health services in Gaza, which already faces widespread shortages of food, water and medicine. When asked by MPs of the limited aid entering the territory, Nebal Faraskh from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said \u201cIsrael is still obstructing the entry of humanitarian aid\u201d. \u201cThe humanitarian situation is only deteriorating and the healthcare system is continuing to collapse,\u201d she said. For more than 40 days, no aid, including food, water and medical supplies has reached northern Gaza, she said, where there are no ambulances operating, she added. Since May, only 65 of the organisation\u2019s aid trucks have entered the territory, she said. Nineteen PRCS members she said were killed, as she called for protections for healthcare facilities and workers. \u201cUnfortunately based on figures from last month, we are only receiving less aid from the previous month,\u201d said Faraskh. \u201cThe situation is beyond catastrophe, it\u2019s unimaginable.\u201d When asked of the US aid ultimatum delivered on 13 October, which expires today, Rohan Talbot, advocacy director for MAP, said \u201cIsrael is not acting in good faith with regards to its obligations\u201d. Talbot said 42 aid trucks are entering the territory daily, compared to nearly 500 before the conflict. \u201cIsrael is not complying with what is being demanded of them by the US,\u201dhe added. Israeli ground troops have laid siege to three areas \u2013 Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and the Jabalia refugee camp \u2013 in the northern Gaza governorate in recent weeks. Al Jazeera is reporting that the Israeli army surrounded an evacuation centre and a school housing hundreds of Palestinians in Beit Hanoun earlier today, demanding residents go southwards. Al Jazeera reports: Lots of men have been detained and taken to undisclosed locations. We\u2019ve been in touch with some who were released, and they say that they went through a nightmare. The Israeli soldiers had ordered women to flee southwards without allowing them to take any sort of aid. As soon as they left the school, they were targeted by Israeli quadcopter drones as a method of intimidation. Air raid sirens have been heard in Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s commercial capital, with the Israeli military saying it had intercepted three projectiles fired from Lebanon. \u201cFollowing the sirens that sounded in numerous areas in central Israel, the IAF (Israel Air Force) intercepted three projectiles that crossed from Lebanon,\u201d the army said. Media reported that sirens were also activated at Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion International Airport, where flights were temporarily halted. It is Israel\u2019s main airport. UN peacekeepers have warned that the Israeli military has committed \u201csevere violations\u201d of a ceasefire deal with Syria as its military continues a major construction project along the so-called Alpha Line that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syria. The comments from the UN Disengagement Observer Force, which has patrolled the area since 1974, come after an Associated Press report on Monday that published satellite imagery showing the extent of the works along the frontier. The work, which UNDOF said began in July, follows the completion by the Israeli military of new roadways and what appears to be a buffer zone along the Gaza Strip\u2019s frontier with Israel. The Israel military also has begun demolishing villages in Lebanon, where other UN peacekeepers have come under fire. While such violence hasn\u2019t broken out along the Alpha Line, UNDOF warned on Tuesday the work risked further inflaming tensions in the region. \u201cSuch severe violations of the (demilitarized zone) have the potential to increase tensions in the area and is being closely monitored by by UNDOF,\u201d it added. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Syrian officials have declined to comment on the construction. Following news that five people have been killed in an attack east of Beirut, a security official, speaking anonymously to Agence France-Presse, said the \u201cIsraeli strike targeted a house where displaced people lived, including women and children\u201d. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry has just said that five people were killed in the Israeli airstrike in the mountains east of Beirut, after a security official said a house was targeted. \u201cThe Israeli enemy strike on Baalshamieh killed five people,\u201d the ministry said in an initial report. Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee has again issued a forced evacuation order for residents of southern Lebanon, this time saying people in the affected villages must move north of the Awali river, which meets the coast about 50km (30 miles) from the border with Israel. He prohibited residents from fleeing south. The order was aimed at the villages of Chaqra, Hula, Majdal Selem, Taloussa, Meiss el-Jabal, as-Sawana, Qabrikha, Yahmour, Arnoun, Blida, Muhaibib, Barashit, Fron and Ghandouriya. In a post on X, Adraee wrote: Hezbollah\u2019s terrorist activities force the IDF to act forcefully against it in these areas, and we do not intend to harm you. For your safety, you must evacuate your homes immediately and move to the north of the Awali river. For your safety, you must evacuate without delay. Anyone who is near Hezbollah elements, facilities or weapons is putting his life in danger. A Lebanese security official has told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that an Israeli airstrike hit a villa east of the Lebanese capital Beirut on Tuesday. The security official said the \u201cIsraeli strike caused an unspecified number of casualties\u201d. The country\u2019s state-run National News Agency later said Israeli warplanes hit a house between Baalshamieh and Dhour al-Abadiyah. Details of the attack are still emerging. We will give you the latest developments as soon as we get them. A renewed Israeli assault was launched on the northern part of the Gaza Strip last month, with the Israeli military claiming it was to stop Hamas fighters regrouping there. The blockage of aid and food deliveries and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, however, have led to accusations that Israel is committing the war crime of seeking to forcibly displace the remaining population. Last month, the Knesset \u2013 the Israeli parlimanet - banned Unrwa from conducting \u201cany activity\u201d or providing any service inside Israel, including the areas of annexed East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank. A second vote declared Unrwa a terror group, effectively banning any direct interaction between the agency and the Israeli state. Unrwa provides education, health care and other basic services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the region. The head of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the Knesset vote was \u201cintolerable\u201d and would have \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d. The UN relief and works agency (Unrwa) has warned that already low levels of aid trickling into Gaza had dwindled further, with the situation in the north of the territory described as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. The warning came as the Israeli military said it had delivered hundreds of packets of food to cut-off areas of northern Gaza as the deadline for Israel to get more aid into the Strip or face cuts in military assistance fast approaches (the US government said in a letter on 13 October that Israel had 30 days to take specific steps to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza). Asked about whether there were signs the situation had improved ahead of Wednesday\u2019s deadline, Louise Wateridge, an Unrwa emergencies officer, said \u201caid entering the Gaza Strip is at its lowest level in months\u201d (see post at 11.29 for some of her other comments). Speaking to a Geneva media briefing via video-link from Gaza, Wateridge said that \u201cthe average for October was 37 trucks a day into the entire Gaza Strip... that is for 2.2 million people\u201d. \u201cChildren are dying. People are dying every day,\u201d she said, stressing that \u201cpeople here need everything\u201d. The situation is at its worst in northern Gaza, where a UN-backed assessment at the weekend said that famine was imminent. No food was permitted to enter besieged northern Gaza for an entire month, Wateridge said, adding that UN requests to access the area have been repeatedly denied. Wateridge said that testimonies from the north painted \u201can endlessly horrific\u201d picture that was becoming \u201cmore critical\u201d by the hour, AFP reports. \u201cHospitals have been bombed, the doctors inform us that they have run out of blood supplies, they have run out of medicine... there are bodies in the streets.\u201d At least 43,665 Palestinian people have been killed and 103,076 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. Of those, 62 Palestinians were killed and 147 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period, the ministry said. Gaza\u2019s health ministry has said in the past that thousands of other dead people are most likely lost in the rubble of the territory. Israel\u2019s Kan news reports that an IDF soldier has suffered a head injury after Jewish settlers in the Oz Zion outpost in the Israeli-occupied West Bank threw stones at them. Israeli forces were demolishing several illegal buildings when masked youths began throwing stones, Kan reports. The soldier\u2019s injury was described as \u201cmoderate\u201d and they were taken to hospital in Jerusalem. Israeli security forces have been attending the site of a drone strike which hit a kindergarten in Nesher, near Haifa, this morning . There were no reports of casualties, and the children attending the kindergarten had already been moved to its bomb shelter when the drone struck. The Times of Israel reported the drone \u201chit a tree next to the kindergarten and exploded, causing slight damage to the building and a fence.\u201d The IDF said earlier it is investigating why warning sirens in the local area did not sound. Palestinian news sources report that the director of Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia in the farthest north of the Gaza Strip has said it is yet to receive any medical aid. Will Christou reports from Beirut for the Guardian While Hezbollah has indicated that it wants a ceasefire in Lebanon, it has insisted that it would have its own conditions to stop firing at Israel, and said that it has the capacity to continue fighting for months to come. Lebanon\u2019s speaker, Nabih Berri, who negotiates on behalf of Hezbollah, said on Tuesday that \u201cThere is no sane person who thinks that we will agree to a settlement or solution that achieves the interest of Israel at the expense of Lebanon and its sovereignty.\u201d Israel has issued contradictory statements about ceasefire talks in the last 24 hours, with foreign minister Gideon Saar saying \u201ccertain progress\u201d had been made on Monday, but defense minister Israel Katz on Tuesday morning saying there would be \u201cno ceasefire\u201d and \u201cno respite\u201d in Lebanon. Leaked drafts in Israeli media of a ceasefire proposal showed that Israel was seeking the freedom to fly over Lebanese airspace at will, as well as to take offensive action in Lebanon if it thought Hezbollah was violating the terms of the ceasefire deal. The leaked proposal is understood to reflect Israel\u2019s maximal demands in any future ceasefire negotiation and is expected to be a non-starter with Lebanese and Hezbollah officials, who see it as a violation of Lebanese sovereignty. On Sunday, the Israeli military it had approved plans for an expanded ground offensive in south Lebanon, a month after it launched what it called a \u201climited and targeted\u201d cross-border operation. Hezbollah, for its part, continued to carry out attacks on northern Israel, launching over 200 rockets on Monday and launching a rocket salvo at the town of Kafr Yuval in north Israel on Tuesday afternoon. William Christou reports for the Guardian from Beirut Israel carried out more than a dozen airstrikes on Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut on Tuesday morning, the most intense aerial bombardment of the city in weeks. An Israeli military spokesperson published maps on social media of 11 buildings in Dahiyeh that it said were Hezbollah installations and warned civilians to distance themselves. Around 40 minutes after the warnings were issued, the bombing started and the resulting explosions were heard around the capital city, accompanied by sonic booms of Israeli jets passing overhead. A video showed two missiles striking an at least ten-storey building, leveling it completely. Among the places that were destroyed were Harkous chicken, a neighbourhood restaurant and landmark in Dahiyeh, as well as a medical complex. Daytime strikes in Dahiyeh have been rare over the past two months and residents typically return to the southern suburbs to check on their homes in the relative safety of daylight. The area which used to house around half a million people has been mostly depopulated since Israel began to regularly bomb Dahiyeh in late September. On Monday night, Israel killed at least 14 people in a strike in Ain Yacoub, in the northern province of Akkar about 110 miles from the Israel-Lebanon border. The strike hit a building housing displaced people without warning, in an area that has not witnessed any prior Hezbollah-Israel fighting. Over the last two months, Israel has struck several buildings hosting displaced people in areas which have no affiliation to Hezbollah. It is approaching 2pm in Beirut, Tel Aviv and Gaza City. Here are the latest headlines \u2026 Israel\u2019s newly appointed defense minister Israel Katz has said there will be \u201cno ceasefire\u201d and \u201cno respite\u201d in Lebanon. Posting to social media Katz said \u201cThe warning and powerful activity carried out by the IDF and the security agencies against Hezbollah and the elimination of [Hassan] Nasrallah are a picture of victory and the offensive activity should be continued, in order to worsen Hezbollah\u2019s capabilities and realise the fruits of victory. In Lebanon there will be no ceasefire and there will be no respite\u201d Katz\u2019 comments directly contradicted a statement from Israel\u2019s foreign minister on Monday that there had been a \u201ccertain progress\u201d in ceasefire talks. Hezbollah said on Monday that it had not been directly involved in any talks Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs have again been hit by multiple Israeli air strikes. Israel\u2019s Arabic-language military spokesperson had issued orders that people in specific locations in southern Beirut should flee their homes Palestinian medical officials say two Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 14 people, including two children and a woman. Associated Press reports that most of the victims of one of the strikes were in an Israeli-declared \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d. AP reports that one strike late Monday hit a makeshift cafeteria used by displaced people in Muwasi, the centre of the Israeli declared \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d. At least 11 people were killed, including two children Louise Wateridge, senior emergency officer for Unrwa in Gaza, told a Geneva press briefing that no food had been allowed to enter northern Gaza for an entire month. She told the media \u201cAnything that happens now is already too late. Thousands and thousands of people have been killed senselessly. They have been killed because there is lack of aid, because the bombs have continued and because we have not been able to even reach them under the rubble\u201d Israel has claimed it has met most US demands to increase aid access to the Gaza Strip, despite its own official figures showing aid delivery is at its lowest since December. The Kisufim crossing was opening on Tuesday to allow some trucks through Palestinian media sources report that the Al-Qassam Brigades has claimed it successfully mounted an attack on Israeli troops that had taken refuge inside a house in Jabalia refugee camp in the north of the Gaza Strip. Overnight Israel announced the deaths of four soldiers in combat in the northern Gaza Strip Israel\u2019s military has issued a statement on its official Telegram channel that two suspects have been arrested after an incident yesterday in which two soldiers were injured after they were hit by a car in Al-Khader Palestinians in Bethlehem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank have staged a protest about the number of people detained in Israeli jails. According to Palestinian news agency Wafa more than 11,600 arrests of Palestinians have been made by Israeli security forces in the occupied West Bank since 7 October 2023 The IDF says it is investigating why warning sirens did not sound after a drone crossed into Israel from Lebanon and fell in Nesher, on the outskirts of Haifa The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations agency (UKMTO) has reported multiple explosions in the vicinity of a vessel which was positioned of the western coast of Yemen. It says there was no damage and nobody was injured. Yemen\u2019s Houthis have repeatedly targeted shipping in the area Hebrew media outlet Ynet has reported that authorities in Thailand are warning they have intelligence of plans for an attack on Israeli tourists at a music party on Friday Palestinian media sources report that the Al-Qassam Brigades has claimed it successfully mounted an attack on Israeli troops that had taken refuge inside a house in Jabalia refugee camp in the north of the Gaza Strip. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Gaza. Humanitarian aid agency Mercy Corps has said that Israel has failed to meet US demands to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and called on the Joe Biden administration to take further steps. Mercy Corps CEO Tjada D\u2019Oyen McKenna said in a statement: Our teams are doing everything possible, but we are stymied at every turn. Despite abundant clarity and evidence from organisations like our own operating in Gaza about the impediments to aid delivery, the US government has not done enough to hold Israel to account. The clear and transparent failures to meet the US own standards must now lead to greater action, or risk pushing millions of people toward preventable suffering and death. The US government must do everything in its power to ensure the unfettered provision of essential aid to people in desperate need. Jenny Gustafsson in Hammana has this report today about the impact of Israeli bombing on Lebanon\u2019s agriculture. Palestinians in Bethlehem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank have staged a protest about the number of people detained in Israeli jails. According to Palestinian news agency Wafa more than 11,600 arrests of Palestinians have been made by Israeli security forces in the occupied West Bank since 7 October 2023. Israel\u2019s military has posted to its official Telegram channel to announce that \u201cin accordance with directives from the political echelon\u201d it had opened the Kisufim crossing to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, which Israel has beseiged for over a year. The move comes as a 30 day deadline from the US to improve the access of aid to Gaza expires, with international aid groups saying Israel has failed to make significant changes. The amount of aid reaching Gaza has dropped to the lowest level since December, official Israeli figures show. Reuters reports Louise Wateridge, senior emergency officer for Unrwa in Gaza, told a Geneva press briefing that no food had been allowed to enter northern Gaza for an entire month. She told the media: Anything that happens now is already too late. Thousands and thousands of people have been killed senselessly. They have been killed because there is lack of aid, because the bombs have continued and because we have not been able to even reach them under the rubble. Despite the official figures and the verdict of organisations on the ground, Israel claimed yesterday it had met most of the US demands. Al Jazeera is reporting that at least six people have been killed in a further Israeli airstrike on Gaza today. The news network reports the strike targeted \u201can overcrowded area near Al Noor mosque in the western part of Deir el-Balah city in central Gaza,\u201d and that in addition to the six people killed, \u201cten critically injured people were received by the American field hospital.\u201d The claims have not been independently verified. Al Jazeera has been banned from operating inside Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations agency (UKMTO) has reported multiple explosions in the vicinity of a vessel which was positioned of the western coast of Yemen. It says there was no damage and nobody was injured. Yemen\u2019s Houthis have repeatedly targeted shipping in the area. More details soon \u2026 Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that, in a repeat of a near daily occurrence, Jewish worshippers have entered the al-Aqsa mosque compound and performed religious rites, which is banned. Describing it as a \u201cprovocative tour\u201d, Wafa reports that dozens entered the place, revered in both Muslim and Jewish traditions, \u201cunder the protection of the Israeli occupation police.\u201d It is a long-standing policy that Jewish prayer is not allowed in the Muslim parts of what Jews call the Temple Mount. In August, Israel\u2019s far-right interior security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir entered the site, and said, contrary to stated Israeli government policy, that \u201cour policy is to enable Jewish prayer\u201d. He remains part of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government. Hebrew media outlet Ynet is reporting that authorities in Thailand are warning they have intelligence of plans for an attack on Israeli tourists at a music party on Friday. The warning comes a couple of weeks after a similar threat was reported in Sri Lanka. Lebanese media reports more Israeli airstrikes in the south of the country, near Seddiqine and Kafra. Reuters reports there have been at least five Israeli airstrikes on Beirut so far this morning. Israel\u2019s military has issued a statement on its official Telegram channel that two suspects have been arrested after an incident yesterday in which two soldiers were injured after they were hit by a car in Al-Khader. The town is in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, to the west of Bethlehem. Images sent over the news wires show smoke billowing over Beirut after Israeli strikes on the southern suburbs of Lebanon\u2019s capital. Lebanese media is reporting that two people have been killed and six wounded in an Israeli airstrike on Hermel, which is in the north-east of the country near the border with Syria. In Iran, government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani has been asked about the impact on Iran-US relations of the re-election of Donald Trump, Reuters reports. She said there were no plans for direct talks, but said \u201cWhatever secures the country\u2019s interest and values of the revolution will be pursued by the government,\u201d adding that \u201cwhat is important will be actions and not words\u201d and recommending Trump \u201ctake into account the failure of his past policies.\u201d Lebanese media has reported airstrikes in the southern Beirut suburbs. Earlier Israel\u2019s military ordered residents to evacuate specific areas, threatening strikes against what it termed \u201cHezbollah facilities and interests\u201d in the area. More details soon \u2026 Israel\u2019s military says it is investigating why warning sirens did not sound after a drone crossed into Israel from Lebanon and fell in Nesher, on the outskirts of Haifa. The Times of Israel reports that \u201ca drone launched from Lebanon struck a kindergarten, causing slight damage but no injuries. The children were in the shelter despite the lack of a siren.\u201d It speculates that \u201cstaff may have received a home front command alert on their phones, or heard the sirens in other areas from afar.\u201d The IDF, on its official Telegram channel, also stated \u201cas of now, no reports of injuries have been received.\u201d Palestinian medical officials say two Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 14 people, including two children and a woman. Associated Press reports that most of the victims of one of the strikes were in an Israeli-declared \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d. AP reports that one strike late Monday hit a makeshift cafeteria used by displaced people in Muwasi, the centre of the Israeli declared \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d. At least 11 people were killed, including two children, according to officials at Nasser hospital, where the casualties were taken. Video from the scene showed men pulling bloodied wounded from among tables and chairs set up in the sand in an enclosure made of corrugated metal sheets. The strike came hours after the Israeli military announced an expansion of the \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d, where it has told Palestinians evacuating from other parts of Gaza to take refuge. Overnight Israel has announced the deaths of four soldiers in combat in the northern Gaza Strip. The IDF says that \u201csince the beginning of ground operations in the Gaza Strip on 27 October 2023, 373 soldiers have fallen in combat.\u201d It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. Israel\u2019s Arabic-language military spokesperson has again issued orders that people in specific locations in southern Beirut should flee their homes due to impending Israeli airstrikes, claiming that Israel will target what it deems \u201cHezbollah facilities and interests\u201d. Israel\u2019s newly appointed defense minister Israel Katz has said there will be \u201cno ceasefire\u201d and \u201cno respite\u201d in Lebanon, which has seen a series of Israeli airstrikes and ground incursions in recent weeks. Over 3,000 people have been killed. Posting to social media Israel Katz said: The warning and powerful activity carried out by the IDF and the security agencies against Hezbollah and the elimination of [Hassan] Nasrallah are a picture of victory and the offensive activity should be continued, in order to worsen Hezbollah\u2019s capabilities and realise the fruits of victory. In Lebanon there will be no ceasefire and there will be no respite. We will continue to hit Hezbollah with full force until the goals of the war are achieved. Israel will not agree to any arrangement that does not guarantee Israel\u2019s right to enforce and prevent terrorism on its own, and meeting the goals of the war in Lebanon, [which are] disarming Hezbollah and them withdrawing beyond the Litani River, and returning the residents of the north safely to their homes. Katz was appointed into the defense minister role last week after Benjamin Netanyahu fired Yoav Gallant, citing disagreements over strategy. In May 2024 the international criminal court requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant for alleged war crimes in Gaza. Israel has challenged the decision. About 1.2 million people are believed to have been forced to flee their homes in Lebanon by Israel\u2019s military campaign, and tens of thousands of Israelis have also been forced from their homes in northern Israel by continuous rocket fire from Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli forces inside Lebanon. Katz statement contradicts the words on Monday of Israel\u2019s foreign minister Gideon Saar, who had claimed in public \u201ccertain progress\u201d was being made on ceasefire talks, although a spokesperson for Hezbollah had said they were not involved with them. Good morning and welcome to our blog covering the ongoing crisis in the Middle East. Israel\u2019s recently appointed defence minister, Israel Katz, has dismissed talk of a ceasefire in Lebanon, saying \u201cthere will be no ceasefire and there will be no respite\u201d Israel\u2019s newly appointed foreign minister, Gideon Saar, who replaced Katz in the role, had said on Monday that \u201ccertain progress\u201d had been made on ceasefire talks in Lebanon. However a spokesperson for Hezbollah said they had not been involved in any direct talks Speaking at the joint Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit in Riyadh yesterday, Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, said that his country was suffering an \u201cunprecedented\u201d crisis that threatens its existence Iran\u2019s first vice president Mohammad Reza Aref told the summit on Monday that the \u201cworld is waiting\u201d for Donald Trump\u2019s incoming US government to stop Israel\u2019s wars with Hamas and Hezbollah Israeli attacks on Lebanon have killed 3,243 people and injured 14,134 since 7 October 2023, the Lebanese health ministry said. The death toll in Gaza in the same period has been put at over 40,000 Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee issued more forced evacuation orders for residents of many towns/villages in southern Lebanon The amount of aid reaching Gaza has dropped to the lowest level since December, official Israeli figures show, despite the US having issued a 30-day ultimatum last month threatening sanctions if there was no increase in humanitarian supplies reaching the territory Overnight Israel announced the deaths of four soldiers in combat in the northern Gaza Strip",

The 30-day ultimatum\u2013 due to expire on Tuesday or Wednesday \u2013 was delivered on 13 October, and almost none of its demands have been met, the humanitarian groups say. It is unclear what measures Israel\u2019s apparent failure to comply will trigger, but they may include a temporary halt to the supply of some munitions or other military assistance. Washington has not yet said whether it deems Israel to have complied. The US state department said on Tuesday that the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had told a senior Israeli official the previous day that the steps Israel had taken must lead to actual improvement on the ground. Asked how the US would urge Israel to improve the humanitarian situation, the state department spokesperson Vedant Patel said on Tuesday there was \u201cno new policy or new assessment to offer but we\u2019ll continue to have our conversations with the Israeli government\u201d. \u201cWe have not made an assessment that Israel is violating US law,\u201d Patel said. The news website Axios reported earlier on Tuesday that Blinken had decided not to reduce military assistance to Israel due to the humanitarian situation in Gaza, according to two US officials. In an apparent last-minute concession, Israeli authorities announced an extension of the designated \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d in Gaza, adding inland areas which could partially relieve intense overcrowding and allow some displaced people to move away from the coast as winter approaches. Aid officials in Gaza describe the situation as \u201capocalyptic\u201d in much of the territory, where more than 80% of the population of 2.3 million have been displaced and more than two-thirds of buildings have been destroyed or damaged in 13 months of war.

Auerbach told his friend <a href=\"https://www.royaldrawingschool.org/about/people/academic-board/william-feaver/\">William Feaver</a> they packed things he would need in his future life, including linen for when he married. They knew they would never see him grow up, or be there for any of his future. They believed they would soon die. And they did, in the Holocaust of Europe\u2019s Jews.</p> <p>What a future they missed. The son they saved became one of the greatest British artists of modern times who painted with a fury for life and a gravitas of grief, as if his lust and sorrow were fighting it out in each mighty brushstroke. Slashes of red or black streak across a pair of mid-period canvases, bringing savage bolts of lightning to a lime parkland or a grey heath in violent pastoral scenes that make a spring day seem like pure agony. And that\u2019s in his mature art, when he was more reconciled to life and the healing act of painting itself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I bet each new show and book will raise his reputation \u2013 until we see him as Constable and Picasso rolled into one</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his devastating early work the wound is wide open. In the late 1950s and early 60s, as London was rebuilt after the Blitz and bombsites became shiny new shops and cinemas, he painted a series of resolutely un-swinging building site scenes. Instead of seeing these busy locations as optimistic signs of renewal, he paints them as holes in the world. Girders feebly raised into the sky are dwarfed by the swarming cavernous voids dug out of the bomb-blasted 20th-century soil. You can\u2019t resist the power of these paintings, or doubt for a second that they speak of the lost, the destroyed, the murdered. Auerbach simply refuses to join in the fun as a new consumer society prepares to forget and move on. He\u2019s stuck in the mud.</p>    <p>Auerbach\u2019s building sites, with their almost unreadable lattices of half finished structures and matted, caked brown spaces are almost, you might say, \u201cabstract\u201d. They rival the American abstract expressionist paintings that were then storming Britain \u2013 yet they cleave to the real world, with a bitter, wild tenacity. Abstraction haunts Auerbach like a madness: it\u2019s the easy way out and instead he must bring his masses and dashes of paint back from the cliff edge to portray \u2026 the cliff edge itself.</p> <p>In all of Auerbach\u2019s paintings, from his earliest raw stabbing at the form of a human head to the <a href=\"https://hh-h.com/exhibitions/30/\">self-portraits</a> he did in his 90s, an abstract impulse to let rip in unrecognisable bursts of energy is in tension with a duty to depict real people and places. \u201cDuty\u201d is the fitting word. For Auerbach the depiction of the human face is not an easy thing. It is not what his free, imaginative drawing or painting hand wants to do, but this person must be recorded.</p> <p>His first images of people look ancient. <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/auerbach-e-o-w-nude-t00313\">EOW Nude</a>, painted in 1953-4, could have been found in the ruins of a city destroyed by fire. It is ashen, charred, a grey ghost of a nude model.</p>    <p>But of course it <em>does</em> come from a ruined, burnt out world: mid-20th century Europe. Young Auerbach, orphan of the Holocaust, sees in his models and friends a pummelled, almost-eradicated humanity that impossibly lives on. <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/auerbach-head-of-e-o-w-i-t06682\">Head of EOW I</a>, painted in 1960, actually introduces bright colour \u2013 lashings of mustard yellow, defining smears of blood red, immaculate white. You might even compare it with the lurid colours of the Hammer films enlivening British screens at the time. Like a horror film, it packs a macabre punch.</p> <p>The paint is piled up so thick it juts out far beyond the wooden board it\u2019s been layered on to. It becomes not a picture but an object, almost a sculpture. Into its colours the features of the woman Auerbach calls EOW \u2013 full name Estella West \u2013 are engraved like a photographic negative or the shadow of an atom bomb victim.</p> <p>It is wrong to see Auerbach as a \u201cfigurative artist\u201d in a tame English way. At times, as in a 1970s <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/auerbach-rimbaud-t06688\">portrait of Rimbaud</a> that depicts the French modernist poet on a fascistic poster in what looks like a totalitarian dance hall, he reminds me of a German artist, with a lot in common with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/sep/12/georg-baselitz-degenerate-women-dont-paint-well-german\">Georg Baselitz</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/08/anselm-kiefer-finnegans-wake-bombed\">Anselm Kiefer</a> \u2013 who, like him, cannot forget what lies beneath the successful new postwar western Europe. Auerbach rethought the human image for a world in which the human might be doomed. He painted faces, or as he titled them \u201cHeads\u201d, as if fumbling for their essence. Meeting any of his regular portrait subjects, you realise there\u2019s no simple visual resemblance at all \u2013 to pose for Auerbach was to lend yourself as a near-anonymous icon of the human presence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At a recent book launch I went to, it was announced: \u2018Frank can\u2019t be here: he\u2019s working\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The radical courage of Auerbach\u2019s modern art of the head, and the whole person, made him part of a brilliant group who produced profound, unforgettable art in postwar London. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/07/leon-kossoff-obituary\">Leon Kossoff</a>, who shared his fascination with the capital city, his fellow Berlin child <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/21/lucien-lucian-freud-obituary\">Lucian Freud</a>, and their elder and leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/10/francis-bacon-revelations-review-a-landmark-biography\">Francis Bacon</a>, put blood into Britain\u2019s previously pallid art. Now it\u2019s pretty clear to almost everyone these were our modern art greats \u2013 what could be more modern than a harrowing Auerbach head?</p> <p>He is an artist whose reputation will grow with time. His later art was surely a work of therapy: from the bombsites-become-building sites in which he saw the scars of a still suppurating horror, he found peace of a sort in the open spaces and familiar streets of north London. His paintings of Primrose Hill and Hampstead Heath are tremendous reckonings with the roiling cloudy landscapes of John Constable. Yet they also make me think of the London settings of John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s spy novels: you can imagine Smiley meeting a double agent in his Hampstead painting <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/auerbach-the-origin-of-the-great-bear-t06685\">The Origin of the Great Bear</a>. Like a spy novel, his urban pastorals are shadowed by chills.</p>    <p>In fact his happiest scenes are the city places, like Mornington Crescent, that he saw pretty much every day on his way to his studio.

That is one of several leading questions posed by Hugh Grant\u2019s professorial villain Mr Reed in the hit new film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/31/heretic-review-religious-horror-with-a-suave-dapper-and-evil-hugh-grant\">Heretic</a>, which twists examinations of faith into viciously entertaining psychological horror.</p> <p>Mr Reed\u2019s targets are, at least externally, representatives of religious certainty: two sister missionaries from the the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints who knock on his door with hopes to convert him. Sister Barnes (Yellowjackets\u2019 Sophie Thatcher), a convert from Philadelphia, is quieter, more droll and naturally skeptical. Sister Paxton (Chloe East), raised Mormon in Utah, is more stereotypically chipper, polite and credulous. Both believe Mr Reed \u2013 at least enough to step inside and escape a downpour \u2013 when he says that his wife is baking pie in the other room and will join them shortly; sister missionaries are not allowed to be alone with a man unless another woman is present.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/31/heretic-review-religious-horror-with-a-suave-dapper-and-evil-hugh-grant\">Heretic review \u2013 religious horror with a suave, dapper and evil Hugh Grant </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Initially, Mr Reed seems enthusiastic and curious about their faith; he even has a dog-eared copy of the Book of Mormon. But the conversation rapidly darkens, as Mr Reed devilishly pokes holes in Mormon doctrine and history, as well as most other organized religions, as a means of psychological destabilization, control, fear and eventually violence \u2013 Heretic is, after all, a horror film, written and directed by A Quiet Place film-makers Scott Beck and Bryan Woods. The characters\u2019 Mormonism serves as an entryway into a psychological thriller of belief, as poked and prodded by a madman with the demeanor of a demented religious studies scholar (and played against type with relish by a never-better Grant). The film has, unsurprisingly, drawn the ire of the Mormon church, which said in an official statement that it \u201cpromotes violence against women because of their faith\u201d and \u201cundermines the contributions of volunteers\u201d that \u201cruns counter to the safety and wellbeing of our communities\u201d.

The portrayal of Mormon missionaries was \u201cone of the best I\u2019ve seen\u201d, said Lexi Seals-Johnson, who grew up in the church and went on to establish <a href=\"https://www.lostandfound.club/about\">Lost &amp; Found Club</a>, a group for the female and genderqueer ex-religious community in Salt Lake City, which hosted its own Heretic screening. \u201cI know many woman who served missions, my wife included, could not even watch the trailer because of how eerily similar the first scenes were.\u201d While some phrasing \u201cmay have been a bit off\u201d, said Nicole Merritts of Salt Lake City, \u201cthe naivety of their young age, attempts to stay positive, and the mix of optimistic and weary personalities was a fairly accurate characterization.\u201d</p> <p>For Whitney Rose, a star of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City \u2013 which, along with The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, serves as a primary locus for Utah fascination in pop culture \u2013 Heretic \u201cdepicted exactly what I know missions to be\u201d. Rose, a member of a founding Mormon family who left the church, hosted a <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/heretic-mormon-whitney-rose-whitney-leavitt.html#:~:text=In%20a%20statement%20provided%20to,volunteer%20service%20to%20their%20communities.\">joint screening</a> in Salt Lake with Whitney Leavitt, of The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, who is still faithful, playing on Mr Reed\u2019s binary of Belief/Disbelief and prompting discussions of integrating doubt into one\u2019s practice of faith. To Rose, Barnes and Paxton\u2019s naivete, politeness and vulnerability felt spot-on. \u201cYou\u2019re sending 18-year-olds out into the world who have grown up in a bubble and shelter of Mormonism,\u201d she said. \u201cYou grow up thinking one way your entire life, and at 18, all of a sudden you\u2019re supposed to go out and figure out how to be safe and invite people into a religion.\u201d</p> <p>Rose is one of many formerly devout Mormons to react strongly to the movie, from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1gknap6/ig_story_from_a_family_friend_about_the_movie/\">Reddit threads</a> delving into <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/1gmzv01/heretic_is_not_antireligion_no_spoilers/\">issues of faith</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2024/07/06/trailer-new-horror-movie-about/\">missionary safety</a> to <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTFoVCptD/\">TikToks</a> expressing shock at the accuracy of small details \u2013 East\u2019s Utah accent, the way Barnes frames her status as a convert (\u201cSuch a typical Utah Mormon response,\u201d said Merritts), the way Barnes and Paxton tiptoe around their curiosity of sex in the opening scene, with Barnes framing her own brush with pornography as a lesson from God. \u201cThat\u2019s such a missionary thing to do,\u201d said Caroline Brammer, who was raised Mormon and saw the film in Austin, Texas.</p>    <p>In one of his many belabored speeches deconstructing religion, Mr Reed quotes Gordon B Hinckley, who served as president of the church from 1995 until 2008. \u201cWhen I hear about Mormons in pop culture, they usually take jabs at Joseph Smith or Brigham Young, who were early prophets and easy to criticize,\u201d said Brammer. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever heard someone talk about Gordon B Hinckley, who was the prophet of my childhood.\u201d<strong> </strong>The quote was so specific \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t even know how you would go looking for that,\u201d she said \u2013 that it prompted her to Google if the film-makers were Mormon.</p> <p>Beck and Woods are not; they first developed the idea for the film while working in Salt Lake and befriending many Mormon and ex-Mormon families. For research, they read not only the Book of Mormon but the Quran, various atheist thinkers and Nick Bostrom\u2019s simulation argument, among other texts. They consulted numerous Mormon friends on the script, along with \u201ca consistent gut check of like, are we approaching things with empathy?\u201d said Beck. \u201cAre we actually embodying what our knowledge of Mormon missionaries are actually like? Are we making sure that they don\u2019t feel like caricatures? Are they authentic people? Which is always the goal when you write a script, but it felt like there was a little more responsibility to this.\u201d</p> <p>Aspects of the dialogue, such as the sister missionaries admitting to each other that some of the songs in the Book of Mormon were funny, were drawn from real conversations. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a lot of the truth of what we knew from our friends and putting it in the mouths of these two missionaries, because we feel like the portrayal of the LDS community, and in particular missionaries, are always caricatures,\u201d said Woods. It also helps that both East and Thatcher were raised Mormon, which <a href=\"https://ew.com/heretic-stars-chloe-east-sophie-thatcher-discuss-mormon-upbringing-8738064\">informed</a> the idiosyncrasies of their performances.</p> <p>Brammer compared the film favorably to the Hulu series Under the Banner of Heaven, a prestige TV adaptation of a book about murders by violent Mormon fundamentalists, which \u201csounded very clunky\u201d like \u201cthey never actually talked to someone who was Mormon\u201d. Heretic is \u201cmore focused on the reality that missionaries are just 19-, 20-year-old kids, and not all of them are as like righteous as you\u2019d imagine.

      "bodyText": "What is the one true religion? That is one of several leading questions posed by Hugh Grant\u2019s professorial villain Mr Reed in the hit new film Heretic, which twists examinations of faith into viciously entertaining psychological horror. Mr Reed\u2019s targets are, at least externally, representatives of religious certainty: two sister missionaries from the the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints who knock on his door with hopes to convert him. Sister Barnes (Yellowjackets\u2019 Sophie Thatcher), a convert from Philadelphia, is quieter, more droll and naturally skeptical. Sister Paxton (Chloe East), raised Mormon in Utah, is more stereotypically chipper, polite and credulous. Both believe Mr Reed \u2013 at least enough to step inside and escape a downpour \u2013 when he says that his wife is baking pie in the other room and will join them shortly; sister missionaries are not allowed to be alone with a man unless another woman is present. Initially, Mr Reed seems enthusiastic and curious about their faith; he even has a dog-eared copy of the Book of Mormon. But the conversation rapidly darkens, as Mr Reed devilishly pokes holes in Mormon doctrine and history, as well as most other organized religions, as a means of psychological destabilization, control, fear and eventually violence \u2013 Heretic is, after all, a horror film, written and directed by A Quiet Place film-makers Scott Beck and Bryan Woods. The characters\u2019 Mormonism serves as an entryway into a psychological thriller of belief, as poked and prodded by a madman with the demeanor of a demented religious studies scholar (and played against type with relish by a never-better Grant). The film has, unsurprisingly, drawn the ire of the Mormon church, which said in an official statement that it \u201cpromotes violence against women because of their faith\u201d and \u201cundermines the contributions of volunteers\u201d that \u201cruns counter to the safety and wellbeing of our communities\u201d. The church-owned Deseret News reviewed the film as \u201cdismissive of what believers find sacred\u201d. But for those raised in the Mormon church, a modern American religion often subjected to outside fascination via true crime series, influencer-driven reality shows or satirical caricatures, the prospect of two sister missionaries finding themselves trapped in a dangerous situation, and the metaphor of doubt as a terrifying, infernal descent, felt all too real. The portrayal of Mormon missionaries was \u201cone of the best I\u2019ve seen\u201d, said Lexi Seals-Johnson, who grew up in the church and went on to establish Lost &amp; Found Club, a group for the female and genderqueer ex-religious community in Salt Lake City, which hosted its own Heretic screening. \u201cI know many woman who served missions, my wife included, could not even watch the trailer because of how eerily similar the first scenes were.\u201d While some phrasing \u201cmay have been a bit off\u201d, said Nicole Merritts of Salt Lake City, \u201cthe naivety of their young age, attempts to stay positive, and the mix of optimistic and weary personalities was a fairly accurate characterization.\u201d For Whitney Rose, a star of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City \u2013 which, along with The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, serves as a primary locus for Utah fascination in pop culture \u2013 Heretic \u201cdepicted exactly what I know missions to be\u201d. Rose, a member of a founding Mormon family who left the church, hosted a joint screening in Salt Lake with Whitney Leavitt, of The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, who is still faithful, playing on Mr Reed\u2019s binary of Belief/Disbelief and prompting discussions of integrating doubt into one\u2019s practice of faith. To Rose, Barnes and Paxton\u2019s naivete, politeness and vulnerability felt spot-on. \u201cYou\u2019re sending 18-year-olds out into the world who have grown up in a bubble and shelter of Mormonism,\u201d she said. \u201cYou grow up thinking one way your entire life, and at 18, all of a sudden you\u2019re supposed to go out and figure out how to be safe and invite people into a religion.\u201d Rose is one of many formerly devout Mormons to react strongly to the movie, from Reddit threads delving into issues of faith and missionary safety to TikToks expressing shock at the accuracy of small details \u2013 East\u2019s Utah accent, the way Barnes frames her status as a convert (\u201cSuch a typical Utah Mormon response,\u201d said Merritts), the way Barnes and Paxton tiptoe around their curiosity of sex in the opening scene, with Barnes framing her own brush with pornography as a lesson from God. \u201cThat\u2019s such a missionary thing to do,\u201d said Caroline Brammer, who was raised Mormon and saw the film in Austin, Texas. In one of his many belabored speeches deconstructing religion, Mr Reed quotes Gordon B Hinckley, who served as president of the church from 1995 until 2008. \u201cWhen I hear about Mormons in pop culture, they usually take jabs at Joseph Smith or Brigham Young, who were early prophets and easy to criticize,\u201d said Brammer. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever heard someone talk about Gordon B Hinckley, who was the prophet of my childhood.\u201d The quote was so specific \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t even know how you would go looking for that,\u201d she said \u2013 that it prompted her to Google if the film-makers were Mormon. Beck and Woods are not; they first developed the idea for the film while working in Salt Lake and befriending many Mormon and ex-Mormon families. For research, they read not only the Book of Mormon but the Quran, various atheist thinkers and Nick Bostrom\u2019s simulation argument, among other texts. They consulted numerous Mormon friends on the script, along with \u201ca consistent gut check of like, are we approaching things with empathy?\u201d said Beck. \u201cAre we actually embodying what our knowledge of Mormon missionaries are actually like? Are we making sure that they don\u2019t feel like caricatures? Are they authentic people? Which is always the goal when you write a script, but it felt like there was a little more responsibility to this.\u201d Aspects of the dialogue, such as the sister missionaries admitting to each other that some of the songs in the Book of Mormon were funny, were drawn from real conversations. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a lot of the truth of what we knew from our friends and putting it in the mouths of these two missionaries, because we feel like the portrayal of the LDS community, and in particular missionaries, are always caricatures,\u201d said Woods. It also helps that both East and Thatcher were raised Mormon, which informed the idiosyncrasies of their performances. Brammer compared the film favorably to the Hulu series Under the Banner of Heaven, a prestige TV adaptation of a book about murders by violent Mormon fundamentalists, which \u201csounded very clunky\u201d like \u201cthey never actually talked to someone who was Mormon\u201d. Heretic is \u201cmore focused on the reality that missionaries are just 19-, 20-year-old kids, and not all of them are as like righteous as you\u2019d imagine. A lot of them are questioning things, and going on missions for different reasons,\u201d she said. And they\u2019re kids \u2013 \u201cthey talk about stupid stuff like porn or sex\u201d. And in some cases, move away from the church; several ex-Mormon viewers noted that the terror of the film\u2019s latter half (no spoilers!) offered a metaphor for the bewildering deconstruction of belief system. \u201cI appreciated that both subtle LDS nuances and a spectrum of beliefs were represented,\u201d said Mae Warner, of Salt Lake City. \u201cIn my own life, deconstructing religious beliefs felt violating and not fully consensual. Heretic captures that experience both explicitly and metaphorically in such poignant ways.\u201d The film was \u201ca fairly provocative portrayal of faith in general\u201d, said Seals-Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s always jarring to hear details of the Mormon church discussed in mainstream media because so much of it is hush-hush.\u201d For Rose, though aspects of the film \u201cvalidated my faith of knowing that we\u2019re held accountable for how we treat each other\u201d, the psychological resonated with her departure from the church. \u201cI feel like that was me,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously on a completely different journey, but the mental turmoil and the torment and the struggle that I went through in my 20s of leaving the church, when I had my faith crisis \u2013 that\u2019s what it feels like.

      "bodyText": "A new Louisiana law that requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public classroom by the beginning of 2025 has been temporarily blocked after a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction on Tuesday. The judge said the law was \u201cunconstitutional on its face\u201d \u2013 and plaintiffs were likely to win their case with claims that the law violates the US constitution\u2019s first amendment, which bars the government from establishing a religion and guarantees the right to religious freedom. The ruling marks a win for opponents of the law, who argue that it is a violation of the constitutionally mandated separation of church and state. They also argue that the poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments would isolate students, especially those who are not Christian. Proponents say that the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance to the foundation of US law. The US district judge John W deGravelles in Baton Rouge, who was appointed by the Barack Obama White House, issued the order in an ongoing lawsuit filed by a group of parents of Louisiana public school children after hearing arguments over the law in late October. The state\u2019s attorney general, Liz Murrill, released a statement on Tuesday saying she and her colleagues \u201cstrongly disagree with the court\u2019s decision and will immediately appeal\u201d, according to the New Orleans CBS affiliate, WWL Louisiana. Any appeals in the case are going to be heard by the US fifth circuit, which is widely seen as perhaps the most conservative court. For now, 12 of the 17 active judges at the New Orleans-based court were named by Republican presidents. The Louisiana law ruled on by deGravelles was passed by a Republican-dominated legislature and signed into law by the far-right governor, Jeff Landry, in the reliably conservative state that is ensconced in the Bible belt. The law states that the text of the Ten Commandments must be shown in \u201clarge, easily readable font\u201d, in a frame that is at least 11in by 14in, and is to be displayed in all public school classrooms from kindergarten to those in state-funded universities by 1 January. Each poster must be paired with the four-paragraph \u201ccontext statement\u201d describing how the Ten Commandments \u201cwere a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries\u201d. The law does not require school systems to spend public funds on the posters \u2013 but rather, it allows the systems to accept donated posters or money for the display, according to the Associated Press. In June, several Louisiana families backed by human rights groups lodged a lawsuit in federal court seeking to block the law, arguing that it was unconstitutional. Landry in August told parents who did not want the Ten Commandments displayed in classrooms across the state to tell their children to \u201cnot look at them\u201d. On Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana praised the ruling temporarily blocking the law from taking effect, calling it a \u201cvictory for religious freedom\u201d. \u201cReligious freedom \u2013 the right to choose one\u2019s faith without pressure \u2013 is essential to American democracy,\u201d said Alanah Odoms, the executive director of the ACLU\u2019s Louisiana chapter. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling ensures that the schools our plaintiff\u2019s children attend will stay focused on learning, without promoting a state-preferred version of Christianity.\u201d The Rev Darcy Roake, who is a plaintiff in the case along with her husband, Adrian Van Young, celebrated the ruling, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re pleased and relieved that the court ruled in our favor.\u201d \u201cAs an interfaith family, we expect our children to receive their secular education in public school and their religious education at home and within our faith communities, not from government officials,\u201d Roake added.

Auerbach, in contrast to Matisse, would take a mundane subject such as a descending set of concrete steps at Euston station, trowel the drab pigment on like mortar, and finish with a canvas transformed by its densely observed presence.</p> <p>But despite the Englishness of his work, and his belonging to a group of painters dubbed the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/s/school-london\">School of London</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/oct/23/guardianobituaries.usa\">RB Kitaj</a>, Auerbach, who has died aged 93, was in fact born in Berlin, and had arrived in England alone, aged eight, in 1939. His parents had sent him to Britain for safety, choosing to remain themselves in Germany on the assumption that Hitler would moderate his policy on the Jews. In 1943 they were both transported to Auschwitz and killed.</p> <p>After that traumatic beginning, the source material for his work was to be found within an area of London not much more than five miles across, from Bethnal Green to Camden Town and Primrose Hill, and with only a few human models, almost exclusively long-term friends, lovers and his wife.</p> <p>Auerbach became, along with two of those friends, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/07/leon-kossoff-obituary\">Leon Kossoff</a> (whom Auerbach painted in the early days) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/21/lucien-lucian-freud-obituary\">Lucian Freud</a> (also born in Berlin, also a refugee from Hitler), a leading figure in the School of London, which was neither a school nor composed particularly of Londoners, except by adoption, and had little in common except figuration.</p> <p>As well as these three, the group included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bacon\">Francis Bacon</a>, Kitaj himself, and <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/michael-andrews-649\">Michael Andrews</a>. What they had in common was that they stood out against prevailing trends throughout their careers, especially through the years of pop, op, hyper realism, conceptualism, minimalism, neo-expressionism, and innovation-for-the-sake of-innovationism.</p>    <p>Although they were figurative painters, they were more concerned with communicating the experience of their subject matter \u2013 portrait heads, nudes, townscape \u2013 than with making a likeness. Auerbach, especially, created parallel identities for his subjects rather than replications, both in the oils with their thick accretions of pigment that, without exaggeration, turned many of his early portraits and nude studies into bas reliefs, and in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2024/jan/13/frank-auerbachs-early-charcoal-portraits-look-deep-into-human-life-in-pictures\">charcoal drawings</a>, worked on for many sittings, scrubbed out and begun again, rubbed until holes appeared in the paper. Then they were reworked once more until the haunting image of a head appeared out of the Stygian shade.</p> <p>Of Auerbach\u2019s middle-class parents, Charlotte (nee Burchardt) was an artist, and his father, Max, was a lawyer. A family friend offered to sponsor his place at a liberal co-educational boarding school, Bunce Court in Lenham, Kent, and so he was sent to Britain; he never saw his parents again. </p> <p>Bunce Court gave Auerbach security and a liking for art, but when he left in 1947 he was ill-equipped either for further education or for a career. He drifted into the leftwing Unity theatre in London and made himself useful designing sets, among other productions for Goldoni\u2019s The Servant of Two Masters. At the beginning of 1948 he gained a place at St Martin\u2019s School of Art, but, unable to wait until September to begin painting, he enrolled as a student at the Borough Road Polytechnic (now London South Bank University). This was to be the making of him. Bomberg, a Vorticist before the first world war and, at this point, aged 57, embittered and regarded as a burnt-out case, was a brilliant master for an aspiring artist.</p> <p>In these postwar years English painting was, too often, illustrative naturalism crammed into a provincial interpretation of cubist space. Bomberg encouraged his students to work fast and big, to take risks, to work from primary vision confronted with the motif rather than through preconceived notions of what art should look like. It was tough work and only the better students survived. Auerbach was one of them.</p> <p>He continued with Bomberg\u2019s classes while at St Martin\u2019s, and encouraged his fellow student and friend Kossoff to attend them. When Kossoff failed a year at St Martin\u2019s, Auerbach remarked in retrospect: \u201cI had a very limited art education, but I knew what artists were. Artists were people who failed exams, got thrown out of art school, and were not subservient to their teachers.\u201d He himself went on to the Royal College of Art, and left in 1955 with first-class honours and a silver medal.</p> <p>Kossoff and Auerbach became close friends, painted each other\u2019s portraits, though not for long (neither could afford the time to sit for the other), but for some years regularly visited each other\u2019s studios. Tate Britain has <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/auerbach-portrait-of-leon-kossoff-l02669\">a portrait of Kossoff</a> that Auerbach painted at St Martin\u2019s, in browns, black, yellow and a touch of red \u2013 the cheaper pigments that he could afford. It is a timeless image of concentrated power, a quite extraordinary artistic achievement let alone for a 20-year-old student.</p>    <p>For all the similarities between Kossoff\u2019s work and Auerbach\u2019s, the differences became more apparent. Kossoff, a native Londoner, opened up the city\u2019s crowds and activities, its trains and its swimming pools; Auerbach, the boy who had arrived clutching one little suitcase, hugged his loneliness close, and initially painted a series of building sites. However, he clung to his freshly won identity, painting obsessively a single head, a single figure, a single townscape motif over and over and over, typically Mornington Crescent close to his studio, accreting layers of paint, scraping them off and starting afresh, slowly covering the floor in a thicker impasto even than his canvases, keeping alive by spells of teaching in Bromley and Sidcup, and later the Slade.</p> <p>His personal paradise was Primrose Hill, his first painting of which is practically monochrome and looks like a relief sculpture in need of urgent cleaning. But the palette of some late paintings \u2013 images of Park Village East, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/frank-auerbach-hampstead-road-high-summer\">Hampstead Road</a>, Mornington Crescent \u2013 is so hot they would drive a fireman backwards.</p> <p>He had not been able to afford anything but those ochres, umbers and greys until <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-helen-lessore-1434653.html\">Helen Lessore</a>, a friend to young painters and director of the Beaux Arts gallery, gave him a contract worth \u00a31,200 a year, at which point he was able to relieve his earth colours with Veronese green, cadmium red and chrome yellow. His touch became more fluid, more \u201cmasterly\u201d, especially after he had studied the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-willem-de-kooning-1274106.html\">Willem de Kooning</a> canvases in the Abstract Expressionist room of the New American Painting show at the Tate in 1959.</p> <p>When he was 17 Auerbach had been cast in a Peter Ustinov play at the Unity. Another cast member was Stella West, a widow 15 years his senior. He became her lodger and her lover; she was his model for a long-running series of portraits, usually called <a href=\"https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/head-of-e-o-w-iii-244052\">Head of EOW</a> (E for Estella) with the date appended, and nude studies including a magnificent <a href=\"https://www.meer.com/en/17836-frank-auerbach\">EOW Nude Lying on Her Back</a> (1959), in which the writhing accretions of white pigment with a solitary punctuation of black denoting her pubic hair all laid in against a dun background constitute a life-affirming presence. He and Stella continued together until they broke up acrimoniously in 1973, 15 years after he had married Julia Wolstenholme, a fellow RCA student. Julia bore him a son, <a href=\"https://www.jakeauerbachfilms.com/\">Jake</a>, but they separated shortly after. Then, in 1976, they resumed a loving relationship and she too became his model.</p> <p>In 1963 he had met Joan Yardley Mills, who also became his model; in 1973 for the first time he painted her initials on to a canvas, as he had done with EOW \u201cfor the same reason that you carve people\u2019s name on trees,\u201d he wrote, \u201c\u2026 one writes the name of the person or people that one is in love with.\u201d Despite this, the relationship between Mills and Auerbach was always platonic, rather than romantic.</p>    <p>After the Beaux Arts years, Auerbach was taken up by the Marlborough gallery and gained increasing recognition abroad, typified by the award (shared with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jun/14/sigmar-polke-obituary\">Sigmar Polke</a>) of the Golden Lion prize at the 1986 Venice Biennale. Still, the deep seriousness of his art brought respect rather than love from most critics, but that changed when the Royal Academy gave him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/sep/11/artsfeatures.arts\">a retrospective exhibition</a> in 2001.</p> <p>The show was in galleries next to one of Rembrandt\u2019s portrayals of women. Auerbach had always painted with the masters in mind. He often worked in the National Gallery, making studies that might later become Auerbachian versions of Rembrandt, Rubens or Titian. Walking between those later two exhibitions confirmed that Auerbach\u2019s canvases constitute some of the noblest painting of our times.</p> <p>A Constable exhibition at the V&amp;A in 2014 reinforced Auerbach\u2019s connection to art history \u2013 a literal one when, as a student at the RCA, he would walk through \u201ca secret tunnel\u201d that joins the college with the museum to view the permanent collection. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/21/frank-auerbach-constable-turner-and-me-interview\">an interview prior to the show opening</a> Auerbach said that he loved Constable for his \u201cdoggedness\u201d, that in his paintings, like his own, \u201cHe seems to have walked every path, measured every distance between every tree. Everything has been worked for and made personal so you sometimes feel that Constable\u2019s own body is somehow inside the landscapes there.\u201d</p> <p>In 2015, another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/11/frank-auerbach-tate-britain-review-60-years-retrospective\">Auerbach retrospective was held at Tate Britain</a>; the exhibition consisted of six rooms, each showing eight paintings from a decade of Auerbach\u2019s output. A collection of work from the Tate\u2019s vaults, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/01/frank-auerbach-unseen-review-art-that-restores-a-sense-of-what-it-is-to-be-human\">Frank Auerbach: Unseen</a>, was shown in 2022 at Newlands House Gallery, in Sussex. In his 90s he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/25/frank-auerbach-artist-self-portraits-last-paintings\">turned to self-portraits</a> with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/14/frank-auerbach-twenty-self-portraits-review-hazlitt-holland-hibbert-london\">a series of 20 new works</a> presented at the Hazlitt Holland-Hibbert gallery in 2023. Earlier this year, the Courtauld brought together his charcoal portraits from the postwar period in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/feb/08/frank-auerbach-charcoal-heads-review-courtauld-war\">Frank Auerbach: The Charcoal Heads</a>.</p> <p>Julia died in January.

Ministers will now send central government officials to help oversee the running of Tower Hamlets council, led by Rahman, who was previously banned from public office for involvement in vote-rigging, buying votes and religious intimidation. The report into the governance of Tower Hamlets, where Rahman became the directly elected mayor again in 2022 after his five-year ban expired, sets out a series of concerns, including a lack of trust between the different political parties, and a subsequent churn of top officials. The findings, detailed in a written statement by Jim McMahon, the local government minister, included a perception among many staff that \u201cmany good managers had left the organisation as a result of \u2018speaking truth to power\u2019\u201d. While the inspectors found the council was trying to improve in some areas, it suffered from a \u201cweak and confused\u201d culture of scrutiny, where \u201cdue process is often treated as an obstacle to priorities rather than as a necessary check and balance\u201d. Central to many of the problems was a \u201csuspicious and defensive\u201d internal culture, heavily based around Rahman and a small group of allies, described to the inspectors as \u201ctoxic\u201d. This culture went beyond the mayor and his team, the report said, citing \u201ca lack of respect and cooperation between political parties, which is having a negative effect on good governance\u201d. The statement said: \u201cA culture of patronage, even if not at play in every appointment, is perceived as pervasive enough to undermine trust between members, staff and leadership, as well as with external stakeholders.\u201d The council often seemed more focused on pushing back against criticism than responding to it, it went on, adding: \u201cOn some issues, the inspectors are sceptical of the council\u2019s capability to self-improve.\u201d McMahon said he was satisfied the problems were sufficiently serious that he was justified under the Local Government Act to impose a \u201cstatutory support pack\u201d for at least three years, with ministerial envoys regularly reporting back. He will also instruct the council to appoint at least two opposition councillors to its advisory board. Rahman was originally the Labour leader of the council, before becoming its directly elected mayor in 2010, after a referendum created the post, standing as an independent. He was re-elected in 2014 under a new party called Tower Hamlets First, but was removed from office in 2015 after a specialist court concluded that he was guilty of vote-rigging, buying votes and religious intimidation. In 2018, police concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute any individual. Rahman returned to power in 2022 under the banner of his Aspire party, bringing back several of his previous allies. The council was previously placed under the part-control of commissioners appointed by central government, from 2014 to 2018, after concerns about the awarding of grants and the sale of council property without correct process. Aspire recently lost its majority after several councillors resigned from the party. In a statement, the council said: \u201cTower Hamlets council is committed to working with the government on our continuous journey of improvement.

      "bodyText": "The violence that erupted in Amsterdam last week was sparked by \u201ca toxic cocktail\u201d of hooliganism and antisemitism, according to a detailed report published by the city\u2019s mayor. The city remains gripped by high tensions days after violence flared around a football match last Thursday between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv. A senior police officer warned on Tuesday of calls for more rioting in Amsterdam after dozens of people armed with sticks and firecrackers set a tram on fire overnight. In a 12-page letter, Femke Halsema, the city\u2019s mayor, provided the most comprehensive account yet of the racist animosity that has engulfed Amsterdam for almost a week. In her report, produced with Amsterdam\u2019s public prosecutor and police, Halsema concluded: \u201cWhat happened over the past few days was a toxic cocktail of antisemitism, football hooliganism and anger over the war in Palestine and Israel and other parts of the Middle East.\u201d Halsema presented the preliminary findings to an emergency meeting of the city council on Tuesday. She lamented to the council that \u201cinjustice has been done to both Jews in our city as well as people of minorities who sympathise with the Palestinians\u201d. The mayor stressed that \u201ceven though a more complete picture emerged\u201d of Thursday evening\u2019s events, \u201cand all sorts of terrible things happened, it in no way negates that a \u2018hunt for Jews\u2019\u201d was called for. Ten residents of Israel were among those arrested, the report said, in the first public acknowledgment that Maccabi supporters may have broken the law. The report shows that police were concerned about \u201cfanatic\u201d supporters of Maccabi Tel Aviv a day before Thursday\u2019s game, and confirmed police reports that Maccabi hooligans, some in face coverings, pulled down a Palestinian flag, shouted slogans and attacked a taxi with their belts. The police later saw \u201conline calls that appeared for taxi drivers to mobilise\u201d against the Maccabi fans. At 11am on Thursday, the mayor and police held a meeting that mainly concerned \u201cthe aggression of the Maccabi supporters and the reaction of taxi drivers to it\u201d. A call was made to the Israeli ambassador before the match, asking that they made sure the Israeli government was clear that \u201csports is not mixed with politics\u201d. By Thursday afternoon, police noticed that messages on social media had increased \u201cindicating the willingness to take action against Maccabi supporters\u201d, with a tone that had \u201chardened\u201d with \u201cantisemitic terms being used\u201d. That night, a large group of Maccabi supporters walked around the city centre, some with sticks in their hands, and committed acts of vandalism, the report said. After midnight, local groups committed \u201cviolent hit-and-run actions aimed at Israeli supporters\u201d, it said. \u201cRioters move in small groups, on foot, by scooter or car, briefly attack Maccabi supporters and then disappear again.\u201d While Dutch social media posts had concluded that \u201cyoung Moroccan Amsterdammers in particular have turned against Jewish and Israeli Maccabi supporters\u201d, the report said: \u201cThe precise identity of the perpetrators must be established in a police investigation.\u201d It said: \u201cAntisemitism cannot be answered with other racism: the safety of one group must not be at the expense of the safety of another.\u201d Five people needed hospital treatment and up to 30 were injured in the violence. Dutch police said on Monday they had arrested five more people for their suspected involvement in attacks on Israeli football supporters. The suspects are men aged 18 to 37 living in the Netherlands, police said. The Dutch prime minister, Dick Schoof, a former intelligence chief brought into office under a coalition deal with the far-right, Islamophobic PVV party of Geert Wilders, said \u201chard action\u201d was needed to combat \u201cunadulterated antisemitic violence\u201d against Maccabi fans. On Monday he described reports of violence, vandalism and racism by the Israeli club\u2019s fans as being in a \u201cdifferent category\u201d, although he said they would also be investigated. World leaders were quick to condemn the attacks on Israelis, including Joe Biden who called them \u201cdespicable\u201d, but they have not spoken in detail about the behaviour of Maccabi supporters, including violence against Dutch people. The report said a full independent inquiry was under way into the violence as well as the actions of Dutch authorities, before, during and after the match. On Tuesday, Olivier Dutilh, of the Amsterdam police force, said police were concerned about the threat of more unrest. The city has a large Muslim community and public feelings have run high over Gaza, with more than 2,500 protests authorised so far this year. Israel\u2019s national security council has warned its citizens against travelling to the UK and Europe for cultural and sporting events after the attacks.

      "body": "<p>Last week, Donald Trump was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/how-trump-won-us-election-president\">elected president</a> for a second time. The convicted felon, who has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/donald-trump-accuser-stacey-williams-jeffrey-epstein\">sexual misconduct</a> by more than <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/10/28/trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-women\">two dozen women</a>, has been open about his plans to take \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/30/trump-threats-election-enemy-within\">revenge</a>\u201d against his political opponents, pursue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/31/election-trump-immigration-policies\">mass deportations</a> of immigrants, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/sep/24/donald-trump-presidency-republican-lawmakers-targeting-lgbtq-policies\">rescind</a> federal LGBTQ+ non-discrimination policies and roll back <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/sep/06/presidential-election-climate-crisis-project-2025-trump\">climate protections</a>.</p> <p>Many Americans have been worrying about what a second Trump term would mean for their lives, communities and futures. We spoke to activists and therapists across the country about how they were dealing with the news and how they planned to take action going forward.</p> <p>\u201cI have to remind myself that our pursuit of justice, of equity, is a marathon, not a sprint,\u201d said Faisal Al-Juburi, chief external affairs officer of Raices, a group that offers support and legal representation to immigrants.</p> <p><em>Interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p> <h2>Faisal Al-Juburi, chief external affairs officer, <a href=\"https://www.raicestexas.org/\">Raices</a></h2>    <p>I am feeling heartbreak and frustration. Anti-immigrant sentiment was pervasive throughout this election cycle \u2013 racial politicking and the promise of harm to immigrant families were central to President Trump\u2019s campaign. So his re-election reflects a sobering reality that the scapegoating of Black and brown people sadly resonated with the public.</p> <p>Remember that you have the agency to rebuff today\u2019s cries for resilience. Unyielding strength is something our society demands only of those whose rights we systematically obstruct. So grant yourself the grace and luxury to feel that you\u2019re not going to be okay \u2013 but know that you will be. Take the time to grieve, to replenish your body, mind and soul. Then rise up and heed the call to fight for justice once more.</p> <h2>Aaron Almanza, executive director, <a href=\"https://lgbthotline.org/\">LGBT National Help Center</a></h2>    <p>I\u2019m feeling a lot of things: anger, fear, exhaustion. Basically what our callers are also feeling. We\u2019re not a political organization, but we know that the election is going to directly affect us. So it\u2019s frightening.</p> <p>We\u2019re checking in with each other just to see how we\u2019re doing. What I\u2019m doing with volunteers is asking them, \u201cDo you have support in your life? Other friends, or people you could talk to?\u201d All of this is so fresh. We\u2019re still processing it.</p> <p>Unfortunately the LGBT community has always faced darkness and people pushing against us. So what we always need to do is circle back \u2013 check in on yourself and check in on those you love. And be aware of your own limitations. If you need to take a break, take a break. Are you doomscrolling right now? If that\u2019s making you feel worse, take a step back.</p> <p>Don\u2019t burn out. Maybe shut your brain off. You\u2019re allowed to do that. My brain-shutting-off thing is doing dishes. I didn\u2019t do any of my dishes last night knowing that I would need them today.</p> <h2>Tamika Lewis, clinical director and founder of <a href=\"https://woctherapy.com/\">WOC Therapy</a></h2> <p>I feel rattled for sure. I\u2019m trying to allow myself time to be with the emotions. I think that oftentimes, our default as women of color is to get distracted or get busy and to try to power our way through hard emotions.</p> <p>[On the day after the election] I canceled a couple of things and rested. I\u2019m trying to manage how much news I take in. But after I get over the hump of this shock, I do feel an urgency around mobilizing. Maybe that\u2019s shifting our services to more group models so that we can reach more people. I think there\u2019s going to be higher rates of anxiety and distress, and we\u2019re going to need more access to mental health, especially in marginalized communities.</p> <p>I want to stay hopeful for society. Especially for our teens, because they feel so much existential despair. I still want to choose hope. We just got a new puppy, and nothing is as soothing as a puppy. She brings so much light and play to an otherwise really dark moment. I think we need to practice that too.</p> <h2>Nancy Lumb, LCSW, New York City</h2> <p>Licensed clinical social workers take an oath when we get our degrees, and it\u2019s about values of service and social justice and the worth of the person. Basically, the importance of human relationships, integrity and competence. All of those things seemed to be questioned during this election.</p> <p>As therapists, we need to walk the walk that we teach people. That means using coping skills like breathing, mindfulness and meditation to remain in the present so that we\u2019re responsive versus reactive. If we let ourselves spin out, what are the next four years going to look like?</p> <p>When I think about what I\u2019m going to do going forward, I think about what I can control and what I can\u2019t. What are the positive things I can do to affect me and others in a positive way? Then I can put energy into that.</p> <h2>Madison Nardy, director of <a href=\"https://215pa.org/\">215 People\u2019s Alliance</a></h2> <p>I am coping with my emotions by allowing myself time to feel and process them, while simultaneously putting my emotions into actions. This helps prevent my feelings from becoming overwhelming or paralyzing. For me, it is a way to align my values with meaningful impact and to feel connected to the larger purpose of collective liberation. It also helps keep my emotions balanced and grounded.</p> <p>To keep ourselves grounded, we need to resist the urge to internalize the weight of these policies as personal failures. It\u2019s crucial to remain focused on the long view: our collective history of resistance, our shared capacity for resilience and our ability to create change despite being systematically undermined. It\u2019s easy to feel crushed by the overwhelming nature of these issues, but by focusing on tangible actions \u2013 like organizing, building solidarity and directly supporting our communities \u2013 we remind ourselves that we\u2019re not passive victims of these systems. We are active participants in shaping a different future, even when it feels like the system is stacked against us.</p> <h2>Melody Li, LMFT, founder of <a href=\"https://www.inclusivetherapists.com/\">Inclusive Therapists</a></h2> <p>I feel deep compassion and care for oppressed and marginalized communities that are navigating a spectrum of emotions such as grief, disgust, fear and anger. I am also feeling centered, emboldened and motivated to mobilize. Cycles of structural violence are nothing new here on stolen land built upon by stolen lives. Indigenous and Black communities especially have resisted, fought back and created amazing systems of care for generations.</p> <p>Your fear and overwhelm are real and valid. Be gentle with yourself. Surround yourself with chosen family and kin that honor your feelings and experiences. Create soft spaces for you and your community to grieve and tend to your hearts. Self- and community-care are both important \u2013 remember to water and nourish yourself and one another. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help and support \u2013 we will move through this together.</p> <h2>Sadie Salazar, LCSW, COO of <a href=\"https://www.sagetherapy.com/\">Sage Therapy</a></h2>    <p>I have been really trying to ground myself in my routines. I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s helpful to anyone, regardless of your work or your position. Having a sense of normalcy and doing the things you typically do \u2013 making a meal, cuddling your pet. It\u2019s a reminder of the safety you can feel in your home and your relationships. I had a good cry, then made a smoothie.</p> <p>Be mindful about how you talk to yourself and others, and don\u2019t force toxic positivity. Sometimes, there isn\u2019t a silver lining. For many of us, this isn\u2019t surprising. This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve been confronted with a sense of a lack of safety, or have felt the effects of hatred. When we try to soothe ourselves or other people prematurely and say: \u201cWell, not much about your life will change\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s not helpful. It can feel like gaslighting. Sometimes, it\u2019s just shit, and that\u2019s what this is. We can sit with that, hold that, and then turn to mobilizing and activism.</p> <h2>Ariela Lara, student at UC Berkeley and organizer with the <a href=\"https://www.sunrisemovement.org/\">Sunrise Movement</a></h2> <p>I\u2019m feeling scared and overwhelmed. As a woman of color and daughter of an immigrant mother I fear how Trump\u2019s agenda will strip our rights away \u2013 whether it\u2019s mass deportations that will reach our communities, my reproductive rights, or the climate policies I\u2019ve organized toward for most of my teen years.</p> <p>What kept me sane through this election process? Talking to voters, knocking on doors, understanding where people are coming from when their government hasn\u2019t been working for them. I\u2019m taking action by organizing a walkout at UC Berkeley.</p> <p>With all the emotions that are weighing on me, I will create the disruption needed to win bold policies, protect our voices and rights. I am relying on my community, because we are going to need each other now more than ever. Mutual aid groups, checking in on my family, friends and mobilizing collectively gives me hope. Moving forward I will continue fighting for my neighbors, the people I see on the bus ride home and the students I go to class with.</p> <h2>Kathryn Stinson, psychotherapist and coach</h2>    <p>Getting outside, moving my body and doing breathwork are always top of my list for coping with difficult stuff. Connection with others is also very helpful. Going forward, I suspect finding opportunities to take action on specific issues I care about will be helpful.</p> <p>We learned a few things from the 2016 election. Nothing unfolded exactly the way we thought it would. That\u2019s not to say bad things didn\u2019t happen, because of course they did. But anxiety was not right about everything. Anxiety is very good at convincing us that we know exactly what\u2019s going to happen, that the way we feel right now is the way we will always feel and that we won\u2019t be able to cope. But the fact that those things feel true right now doesn\u2019t mean they are true.</p> <p>Activists are a stubborn bunch of people. They\u2019re in it for the long haul, and they are used to the rollercoaster of progress and loss. No one is giving up.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last week, Donald Trump was elected president for a second time. The convicted felon, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than two dozen women, has been open about his plans to take \u201crevenge\u201d against his political opponents, pursue mass deportations of immigrants, rescind federal LGBTQ+ non-discrimination policies and roll back climate protections. Many Americans have been worrying about what a second Trump term would mean for their lives, communities and futures. We spoke to activists and therapists across the country about how they were dealing with the news and how they planned to take action going forward. \u201cI have to remind myself that our pursuit of justice, of equity, is a marathon, not a sprint,\u201d said Faisal Al-Juburi, chief external affairs officer of Raices, a group that offers support and legal representation to immigrants. Interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity. Faisal Al-Juburi, chief external affairs officer, Raices I am feeling heartbreak and frustration. Anti-immigrant sentiment was pervasive throughout this election cycle \u2013 racial politicking and the promise of harm to immigrant families were central to President Trump\u2019s campaign. So his re-election reflects a sobering reality that the scapegoating of Black and brown people sadly resonated with the public. Remember that you have the agency to rebuff today\u2019s cries for resilience. Unyielding strength is something our society demands only of those whose rights we systematically obstruct. So grant yourself the grace and luxury to feel that you\u2019re not going to be okay \u2013 but know that you will be. Take the time to grieve, to replenish your body, mind and soul. Then rise up and heed the call to fight for justice once more. Aaron Almanza, executive director, LGBT National Help Center I\u2019m feeling a lot of things: anger, fear, exhaustion. Basically what our callers are also feeling. We\u2019re not a political organization, but we know that the election is going to directly affect us. So it\u2019s frightening. We\u2019re checking in with each other just to see how we\u2019re doing. What I\u2019m doing with volunteers is asking them, \u201cDo you have support in your life? Other friends, or people you could talk to?\u201d All of this is so fresh. We\u2019re still processing it. Unfortunately the LGBT community has always faced darkness and people pushing against us. So what we always need to do is circle back \u2013 check in on yourself and check in on those you love. And be aware of your own limitations. If you need to take a break, take a break. Are you doomscrolling right now? If that\u2019s making you feel worse, take a step back. Don\u2019t burn out. Maybe shut your brain off. You\u2019re allowed to do that. My brain-shutting-off thing is doing dishes. I didn\u2019t do any of my dishes last night knowing that I would need them today. Tamika Lewis, clinical director and founder of WOC Therapy I feel rattled for sure. I\u2019m trying to allow myself time to be with the emotions. I think that oftentimes, our default as women of color is to get distracted or get busy and to try to power our way through hard emotions. [On the day after the election] I canceled a couple of things and rested. I\u2019m trying to manage how much news I take in. But after I get over the hump of this shock, I do feel an urgency around mobilizing. Maybe that\u2019s shifting our services to more group models so that we can reach more people. I think there\u2019s going to be higher rates of anxiety and distress, and we\u2019re going to need more access to mental health, especially in marginalized communities. I want to stay hopeful for society. Especially for our teens, because they feel so much existential despair. I still want to choose hope. We just got a new puppy, and nothing is as soothing as a puppy. She brings so much light and play to an otherwise really dark moment. I think we need to practice that too. Nancy Lumb, LCSW, New York City Licensed clinical social workers take an oath when we get our degrees, and it\u2019s about values of service and social justice and the worth of the person. Basically, the importance of human relationships, integrity and competence. All of those things seemed to be questioned during this election. As therapists, we need to walk the walk that we teach people. That means using coping skills like breathing, mindfulness and meditation to remain in the present so that we\u2019re responsive versus reactive. If we let ourselves spin out, what are the next four years going to look like? When I think about what I\u2019m going to do going forward, I think about what I can control and what I can\u2019t. What are the positive things I can do to affect me and others in a positive way? Then I can put energy into that. Madison Nardy, director of 215 People\u2019s Alliance I am coping with my emotions by allowing myself time to feel and process them, while simultaneously putting my emotions into actions. This helps prevent my feelings from becoming overwhelming or paralyzing. For me, it is a way to align my values with meaningful impact and to feel connected to the larger purpose of collective liberation. It also helps keep my emotions balanced and grounded. To keep ourselves grounded, we need to resist the urge to internalize the weight of these policies as personal failures. It\u2019s crucial to remain focused on the long view: our collective history of resistance, our shared capacity for resilience and our ability to create change despite being systematically undermined. It\u2019s easy to feel crushed by the overwhelming nature of these issues, but by focusing on tangible actions \u2013 like organizing, building solidarity and directly supporting our communities \u2013 we remind ourselves that we\u2019re not passive victims of these systems. We are active participants in shaping a different future, even when it feels like the system is stacked against us. Melody Li, LMFT, founder of Inclusive Therapists I feel deep compassion and care for oppressed and marginalized communities that are navigating a spectrum of emotions such as grief, disgust, fear and anger. I am also feeling centered, emboldened and motivated to mobilize. Cycles of structural violence are nothing new here on stolen land built upon by stolen lives. Indigenous and Black communities especially have resisted, fought back and created amazing systems of care for generations. Your fear and overwhelm are real and valid. Be gentle with yourself. Surround yourself with chosen family and kin that honor your feelings and experiences. Create soft spaces for you and your community to grieve and tend to your hearts. Self- and community-care are both important \u2013 remember to water and nourish yourself and one another. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help and support \u2013 we will move through this together. Sadie Salazar, LCSW, COO of Sage Therapy I have been really trying to ground myself in my routines. I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s helpful to anyone, regardless of your work or your position. Having a sense of normalcy and doing the things you typically do \u2013 making a meal, cuddling your pet. It\u2019s a reminder of the safety you can feel in your home and your relationships. I had a good cry, then made a smoothie. Be mindful about how you talk to yourself and others, and don\u2019t force toxic positivity. Sometimes, there isn\u2019t a silver lining. For many of us, this isn\u2019t surprising. This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve been confronted with a sense of a lack of safety, or have felt the effects of hatred. When we try to soothe ourselves or other people prematurely and say: \u201cWell, not much about your life will change\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s not helpful. It can feel like gaslighting. Sometimes, it\u2019s just shit, and that\u2019s what this is. We can sit with that, hold that, and then turn to mobilizing and activism. Ariela Lara, student at UC Berkeley and organizer with the Sunrise Movement I\u2019m feeling scared and overwhelmed. As a woman of color and daughter of an immigrant mother I fear how Trump\u2019s agenda will strip our rights away \u2013 whether it\u2019s mass deportations that will reach our communities, my reproductive rights, or the climate policies I\u2019ve organized toward for most of my teen years. What kept me sane through this election process? Talking to voters, knocking on doors, understanding where people are coming from when their government hasn\u2019t been working for them. I\u2019m taking action by organizing a walkout at UC Berkeley. With all the emotions that are weighing on me, I will create the disruption needed to win bold policies, protect our voices and rights. I am relying on my community, because we are going to need each other now more than ever. Mutual aid groups, checking in on my family, friends and mobilizing collectively gives me hope. Moving forward I will continue fighting for my neighbors, the people I see on the bus ride home and the students I go to class with. Kathryn Stinson, psychotherapist and coach Getting outside, moving my body and doing breathwork are always top of my list for coping with difficult stuff. Connection with others is also very helpful. Going forward, I suspect finding opportunities to take action on specific issues I care about will be helpful. We learned a few things from the 2016 election. Nothing unfolded exactly the way we thought it would. That\u2019s not to say bad things didn\u2019t happen, because of course they did. But anxiety was not right about everything. Anxiety is very good at convincing us that we know exactly what\u2019s going to happen, that the way we feel right now is the way we will always feel and that we won\u2019t be able to cope. But the fact that those things feel true right now doesn\u2019t mean they are true. Activists are a stubborn bunch of people. They\u2019re in it for the long haul, and they are used to the rollercoaster of progress and loss. No one is giving up.",

      "bodyText": "The publisher of the Daily Mail has won a court battle after arguing that its human rights were breached by a requirement for it to pay \u201csuccess fees\u201d to lawyers representing people it had paid damages to. Associated Newspapers Ltd (ANL) complained to the European court of human rights that it was \u201cexcessive and unfair\u201d for it to have to pay such fees to plaintiffs who have engaged lawyers to take cases on a no win, no fee agreement. ANL, which has historically using its editorial pages to campaign against human rights legislation derived from Europe, argued that making it liable for success fees breached article 10 of the European convention of human rights, which protects freedom of expression. It complained about the case of Alaedeen Sicri, a Libyan businessman, who successfully sued for breach of privacy after the MailOnline had named him as a suspect in the 2017 terrorist attack at the Manchester Arena. Sicri, who was released without charge after six days of interviews, was awarded \u00a383,000 in damages but ANL also had to pay \u00a3822,421.79 of his costs, at least \u00a3245,775 plus VAT of which was the \u201csuccess fee\u201d. The publisher claimed that having to pay the additional liability, over and above damages awarded, discouraged the participation of the press in debates over matters of legitimate concern. Finding in favour of ANL against the UK government \u2013 defendants at the Strasbourg court are always a member state alleged to have breached the applicant\u2019s human rights \u2013 the panel of seven judges said that the costs awarded were \u201ceye-watering\u201d. While legislation abolished the liability of losing defendants for success fees and \u201cafter the event\u201d (ATE) insurance premiums, which underwrite a claimant\u2019s liability to pay the defendant\u2019s costs should his or her case be unsuccessful, it does not apply in defamation and privacy cases where the no win, no fee agreement pre-dated the abolition, as in the current case. The judges accepted that the idea of the no win, no fee regime was to widen access to civil litigation and steps had been taken to ensure costs were reasonable, but concluded: \u201cThe requirement that the applicant company pay costs to AS (Sicri), which included success fees, was disproportionate having regard to the legitimate aims sought to be achieved and exceeded even the broad margin of appreciation accorded to the government in respect of general measures pursuing social and economic interests.\u201d ANL also challenged its liability for ATE premiums but the court ruled these were not in violation of article 10 of the convention. The human rights court ordered the UK government to pay ANL \u20ac15,000 (\u00a312,450) in costs and expenses within three months. The publisher had also sought damages of just less than \u00a3320,000 in damages from the UK government, which it said was the total paid in success fees when an additional settlement was added to the amount awarded by the judge. The court reserved judgment on this matter, inviting written submissions from both parties within six months.",

He added: \u201cOur goal is to identify any crimes that have been committed by any individuals who assisted with this crime.\u201d After Borgwardt\u2019s disappearance, volunteers joined law enforcement in spending weeks searching for him, scanning the lake from above with drones while divers inspected its 237ft depth for clues. Keith Cormican, of Bruce\u2019s Legacy, a non-profit organization that specializes in water searches, said he spent about four weeks spaced over two months involved in the operation. \u201cIt\u2019s a little tough to swallow because it required a lot of expenses on this one,\u201d he said, as reported by ABC7 News. At the news conference, the Washington Post reported, Podoll said Borgwardt\u2019s children \u2013 two sons in high school and a daughter in elementary school \u2013 were surprised to learn what their father had allegedly done. Borgwardt\u2019s wife, he said, had known for much longer that her husband had probably faked his own death \u2013 and had been cooperating with authorities. The sheriff remarked: \u201cI put a lot on her shoulders. That is one strong lady. \u201cRyan, if you are viewing this, I plead that you contact us or contact your family. We understand that things can happen, but there\u2019s a family that wants their daddy back.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A neonatal expert who reviewed the deaths and collapses of babies harmed by Lucy Letby has said she feels misled over her commissioning by hospital bosses. Dr Jane Hawdon, a consultant neonatologist, said she was not \u201cadequately briefed\u201d about the suspicions of senior doctors about Letby before she carried out her analysis. Hawdon was asked by Ian Harvey, the Countess of Chester hospital\u2019s medical director, to carry out a \u201ccase notes review\u201d of 17 deaths and collapses on the neonatal unit in the year to June 2016. Her study was one of two reviews ordered by Harvey in response to concerns raised by senior doctors that Letby had deliberately harmed babies. Some consultant paediatricians had urged hospital executives to contact the police, but Harvey instead commissioned a limited analysis by Hawdon and a separate review of the neonatal unit by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Giving evidence to the Thirlwall inquiry on Tuesday, Hawdon conceded that her report was \u201cfairly superficial\u201d and \u201can academic exercise\u201d as it was based only on medical notes rather than a detailed examination involving consultation with the children\u2019s doctors. The report suggested that 13 of the 17 deaths could be explained and \u201cmay have been prevented with different care\u201d. However, Hawdon told the inquiry at Liverpool town hall that none of the deaths could be explained by poor care. The senior neonatologist also said that a number of babies whose deaths she thought at the time were explainable could not now be explained by natural causes, based on newly available information. In a witness statement read to the inquiry, Hawdon said: \u201cI do not consider that I was adequately briefed about the concerns of the paediatricians and I don\u2019t know why the trust chose this approach.\u201d Asked by Rachel Langdale KC, counsel to the inquiry, why she believed she may not have been told that consultants suspected Letby was harming babies, Hawdon said: \u201cMy speculation is that those who were instructing me \u2026 did not believe that that was a likely possibility.\u201d Hawdon said she may not have proceeded with her review had she known that senior doctors suspected criminality. Peter Skelton KC, representing seven of the families of Letby\u2019s victims, asked Hawdon whether she felt misled by Harvey, the medical director. She replied: \u201cI now feel misled. I can\u2019t say who misled me but I feel misled. And, as I have said before, if those details had been made available to me the process I would have followed would have been very different.\u201d Hawdon agreed that the \u201conly appropriate response\u201d if consultants suspected murder was \u201cto either call the police or go through safeguarding processes, which amount to the same thing in the end\u201d. Letby, 34, is serving a whole-life prison term after being convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder and another seven. She has consistently denied harming any infants and is preparing a legal challenge to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The court of appeal has rejected her attempts to overturn the convictions.",

Greenpeace and Uplift accuse the former Conservative government of having unlawfully given the Norwegian oil giant Equinor a licence to exploit the Rosebank oilfield, which sits 80 miles (130km) north-west of Shetland and holds nearly 500m barrels of oil and gas. Lawyers for both groups told a judge in Edinburgh on Tuesday the government and the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) formerly known as the Oil and Gas Authority, had wrongly failed to take into account the tens of millions of tonnes of CO2 that would be burned when the oil was used, and the impact that would have on the climate. Ruth Crawford KC, the lawyer for Greenpeace, told Lord Ericht that Equinor and its Israeli-owned co-investor Ithaca knew it was unlawful to ignore the climate costs of the project. \u201cThere can be no doubt this project will produce substantial amounts of oil and gas [with] a substantial impact on the climate and a substantial impact on environmental and human health,\u201d she said. Their judicial review, being heard in the court of session, Scotland\u2019s top civil court, began as world leaders convened in Azerbaijan for a new round of climate talks, where Keir Starmer confirmed the UK had set a much tougher new target, to cut its carbon emissions by 81% compared with 1990 levels by 2035. Uplift and Greenpeace are asking the court to cancel the drilling licence for Rosebank and also a licence granted to a Shell subsidiary, BG International (BGI) to drill for gas in the Jackdaw field in the North Sea, which they also allege ministers granted unlawfully. They estimate the Rosebank oilfield will release more CO2 than the annual emissions of the world\u2019s 28 poorest countries combined, including Uganda and Mozambique. They believe their challenges were given significant legal weight after the UK supreme court ruled in June that ministers had to take account of the climate impacts from burning the oil and gas extracted by drilling in the UK before issuing licences. Even so, this case could prove to be a significant test of the new Labour government\u2019s pledges to dramatically reduce the UK\u2019s reliance on oil and gas by blocking new drilling licences. After Labour\u2019s general election victory, Ed Miliband, the net zero secretary, decided the UK government would no longer defend the case brought by Greenpeace and Uplift but he still faces a political challenge if they win. If Lord Ericht cancels their drilling licences, Equinor and BGI are likely to reapply for fresh licences to drill both fields, despite the supreme court decision, which followed a legal challenge by the climate campaigner Sarah Finch. BGI is already extracting gas from the Jackdaw field. The companies argue both fields are essential to the UK economy, support thousands of jobs and provide significant tax revenues \u2013 arguments that critics of Labour\u2019s climate policy are likely to endorse. Crawford told the court that those political arguments were irrelevant in this case; this case was solely about whether the law was followed. She said ministers and the NSTA made the same \u201csubstantial error of law\u201d identified by the supreme court in June when they licensed the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields without assessing the climate impacts of the oil and gas they produced. She said Equinor, Ithaca and BGI had spent about \u00a31bn on developing Rosebank and Jackdaw but had miscalculated. They knew it was unlawful to ignore the climate costs of the project, she said, adding: \u201cThey lost the bet.\u201d On Tuesday, before the case began, about 160 climate protesters gathered outside the court calling for the licences to be cancelled, chanting \u201cI believe we can win,\u201d while stretching a long red scarf across the entrance to the court.

The sweet science has long since lost whatever credibility it had as a sport, with promoters finding new ways to debase it in their chase to the bottom line. Football has always purported to be above such publicity-grabbing stunts. Even if those who run and play it are as rapacious in their pursuit of cash as any of the smooth-talking hucksters behind the decision to put a long-past-his-best Tyson against some internet wonk 31 years his junior.

His work done in what might have been the stuff of his dreams but is that of Football Daily\u2019s most terrifying nightmares, Spreen was substituted after 50 seconds without touching the ball, but not before incurring the wrath of a commentator from broadcasters Tyc Sports. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know where to stand \u2026 it\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d they thundered. \u201cThis is shameful, it\u2019s a total disgrace.\u201d</p> <p>The Argentinian Peter Drury wasn\u2019t the only person to criticise Deportivo\u2019s decision to cheapen the game, with V\u00e9lez goalscorer Braian Romero among a plethora of players, past and present, to voice his displeasure by channeling his inner Samuel Beckett. \u201cIt is a wrong message to society, to kids who try hard,\u201d he sighed. \u201cFootball is not that, it is trying and failing and trying again.\u201d Juan Seba Ver\u00f3n also chipped in, declaring Spreen\u2019s inclusion as \u201ca total lack of respect for football and footballers\u201d.

But this needs to be firmed up and the consequences of the realignment built clearly into the Ofsted framework. Inspections should reflect the change in emphasis and credit schools on their work in keeping children healthy and safe. The current safeguarding section is pointless. </p> <p>The recent narrowing of education to a knowledge-driven and outcome-focused agenda has been incredibly damaging, particularly since the pandemic. Previous frameworks cited excellence and enjoyment \u2013 this should once again be the direction&nbsp;of travel.</p> <p>The national obsession with exams needs to be replaced with a focus on creating clear-thinking, healthy and well-rounded human beings. Surely that is the true meaning of an education.<br><strong>Chris Brislen</strong><br><em>Retired academy CEO and headteacher</em></p> <p>\u2022 One way to encourage a sense of belonging and wellbeing is to ensure that every child receives an arts education \u2013 one that is central to and, importantly, integrated into the curriculum. This goes beyond school plays and concerts, towards an entitlement for every young person in drama, dance, music and the visual arts. These encourage working together, self-belief, tolerance, mutual respect, creativity, problem solving, working to a deadline and a shared outcome. This will bring every child into the learning experience and foster a sense of belonging and contribution to the whole, regardless of academic&nbsp;achievements.<br><strong>Helen Elliott</strong><br><em>Ruishton, Somerset</em></p> <p>\u2022 Until we focus more on the wellbeing and work conditions of those who are employed in schools, what hope do we have of creating caring conditions for pupils?

Chris Parker Nottingham \u2022 A refocusing of school priorities on student wellbeing is long overdue (Editorial, 8 November). But this needs to be firmed up and the consequences of the realignment built clearly into the Ofsted framework. Inspections should reflect the change in emphasis and credit schools on their work in keeping children healthy and safe. The current safeguarding section is pointless. The recent narrowing of education to a knowledge-driven and outcome-focused agenda has been incredibly damaging, particularly since the pandemic. Previous frameworks cited excellence and enjoyment \u2013 this should once again be the direction of travel. The national obsession with exams needs to be replaced with a focus on creating clear-thinking, healthy and well-rounded human beings. Surely that is the true meaning of an education. Chris Brislen Retired academy CEO and headteacher \u2022 One way to encourage a sense of belonging and wellbeing is to ensure that every child receives an arts education \u2013 one that is central to and, importantly, integrated into the curriculum. This goes beyond school plays and concerts, towards an entitlement for every young person in drama, dance, music and the visual arts. These encourage working together, self-belief, tolerance, mutual respect, creativity, problem solving, working to a deadline and a shared outcome. This will bring every child into the learning experience and foster a sense of belonging and contribution to the whole, regardless of academic achievements. Helen Elliott Ruishton, Somerset \u2022 Until we focus more on the wellbeing and work conditions of those who are employed in schools, what hope do we have of creating caring conditions for pupils? After a 50-plus-hour week as a teacher in a secondary school last week, I still had a pile of A-level essays to mark on Sunday \u2013 and I\u2019m part-time. Holidays are obviously not incentive enough, as recruitment and retention are in crisis. Peter Russell Sheffield \u2022 Do you have a photograph you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

But before we go, here is a summary of the day\u2019s main news lines from the summit. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>The UK\u2019s ambitious commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 81% must be \u201cthe starting point, not the finish line\u201d,</strong> commentators have said. The commitment was officially delivered to Cop29 in a statement by Keir Starmer this afternoon. It has been broadly welcomed. </p></li> \n   <li><p>Starmer made the commitment in one of <strong>dozens of statements given by national leaders on the second day of the the climate summit in Baku</strong>. But it is only now, with the big cheeses on the way home, that the serious negotiations will get underway. </p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Mia Mottley said the world must take radical action on raising the money needed to fund climate adaptation. </strong>\u201cThese extreme weather events that the world is facing daily suggest that humanity and the planet are hurtling towards catastrophe,\u201d the prime minister of Barbados said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Hilda Heine, president of Marshall Islands, called out rich countries for failing to finance cuts to pollution but encouraged poor countries to still put forward ambitious climate action plans.</strong> \u201cIt is in our blood to know when a tide is turning,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd on climate, the tide is turning today.\u201d</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Charles Michel, president of the European Council, spoke on behalf of the EU to warn against war and present itself as a credible partner to poor countries</strong>. He called out \u201cviolent imperialism, endless cycles of vengeance\u201d as a driver of wars that have driven the world to the brink.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>2024 had been \u201ca masterclass in climate destruction\u201d, Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary general said</strong>, as he addressed world leaders who had gathered in Baku for the summit. \u201cBut there is every reason to hope,\u201d Guterres said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UN\u2019s top climate official, Simon Stiell, warned world leaders \u201cworsening climate impacts will put inflation on steroids\u201d.</strong> \u201cThe climate crisis is a cost-of-living crisis, because climate disasters are driving up costs for households and businesses,\u201d he said, describing it as an \u201ceconomy killer\u201d.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UNHCR, the UN\u2019s refugee body, <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/media/no-escape-frontlines-climate-change-conflict-and-forced-displacement?_kx=Iqw76_90DxVpUi-5LMau_0R3hUwvgda7TdrTtD0w5RZHDQ6F7Kqv5t1VzDWWtYmm.U4qgRF\">released a report</a> saying climate breakdown is making life even more difficult for people fleeing war and persecution</strong>.

But let this be the starting point, not the finish line, in the UK\u2019s ambition to protect children who continue to bear the brunt of the climate crisis</p> \n   <p>COP29 is an opportunity to build on this global leadership with further meaningful action on climate both in the UK and around the world.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s time we stand with children and put their voices at the heart of every aspect of climate change decision-making and financing. </p> \n   <p>As COP29 progresses we hope to see the UK drive forward discussions for a new international climate finance goal and action in the UK ensuring a fair, just transition for all.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Friederike Roder, vice president of global policy and advocacy, Global Citizen, said: </strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The UK\u2019s ambitious new NDC sends a powerful message that climate action is unstoppable, and that climate leadership can and will be found across the world</p> \n   <p>The UK\u2019s decision to listen to climate scientists, and to citizens, and reduce emissions by 81% will cement its position as a global leader in climate action. The decision to do so early - at this critical moment - is equally important in building momentum and setting an example for others to follow.</p> \n   <p>Like all commitments at COP, the proof will be in the delivery. But by setting early goals and outlining ambitious targets, the UK is showing much needed leadership at this important moment. We hope this leads to all nations setting ambitious, high action NDCs that keep the world on track for 1.5 degrees, and encourages those here at COP29 to deliver an NCQG which provides the vital finance to achieve these goals.</p> \n   <p>But the UK\u2019s job isn\u2019t done: so far, it has not made any new commitments on international public finance for climate.

Methane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas, 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over 20 years, and causes about a third of global heating.</p> \n  <p>The good news is that, unlike CO2, methane breaks down in the atmosphere quickly and therefore cuts rapidly slow warming. Fossil fuel exploitation causes a lot of leaks, but these are often cheap to fix.

Methane emissions from cattle were being reduced with better breed and feeds, as well as manure management, in China and Brazil, he said, and emissions from rice growing were being cut with more frugal irrigation in India and Bangladesh.

It will invest in climate, nature and green energy projects, and will aim to raise $75bn over 10 years.

The prime minister said he was delighted to announce the launch of the new CIF Capital Market Mechanism which will list on the London Stock Exchange. He thanked the president for his support and engagement in this area, and welcomed the confidence this showed in the UK\u2019s economy.

Despite falling short of the UK\u2019s fair share, this is a relatively ambitious target compared with many other nations, and will help build momentum at these talks. But targets need to be backed up with bold action. When the government submits its action plan next year, it must include details of how the UK will deliver a full phase out of oil and gas, as it has done with coal. This must include proper funding to help workers transition from high carbon jobs to the green industries of the future.

But before we go, here is a summary of the day\u2019s main news lines from the summit. The UK\u2019s ambitious commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 81% must be \u201cthe starting point, not the finish line\u201d, commentators have said. The commitment was officially delivered to Cop29 in a statement by Keir Starmer this afternoon. It has been broadly welcomed. Starmer made the commitment in one of dozens of statements given by national leaders on the second day of the the climate summit in Baku. But it is only now, with the big cheeses on the way home, that the serious negotiations will get underway. Mia Mottley said the world must take radical action on raising the money needed to fund climate adaptation. \u201cThese extreme weather events that the world is facing daily suggest that humanity and the planet are hurtling towards catastrophe,\u201d the prime minister of Barbados said. Hilda Heine, president of Marshall Islands, called out rich countries for failing to finance cuts to pollution but encouraged poor countries to still put forward ambitious climate action plans. \u201cIt is in our blood to know when a tide is turning,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd on climate, the tide is turning today.\u201d Charles Michel, president of the European Council, spoke on behalf of the EU to warn against war and present itself as a credible partner to poor countries. He called out \u201cviolent imperialism, endless cycles of vengeance\u201d as a driver of wars that have driven the world to the brink. 2024 had been \u201ca masterclass in climate destruction\u201d, Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary general said, as he addressed world leaders who had gathered in Baku for the summit. \u201cBut there is every reason to hope,\u201d Guterres said. The UN\u2019s top climate official, Simon Stiell, warned world leaders \u201cworsening climate impacts will put inflation on steroids\u201d. \u201cThe climate crisis is a cost-of-living crisis, because climate disasters are driving up costs for households and businesses,\u201d he said, describing it as an \u201ceconomy killer\u201d. The UNHCR, the UN\u2019s refugee body, released a report saying climate breakdown is making life even more difficult for people fleeing war and persecution. It finds that three-quarters of the 120 million displaced people around the world are in countries severely affected by climate breakdown. The UN gave the provisional number of participants in this year\u2019s conference as 66,778. This includes everyone from heads of government to security staff to journalists. The number was significantly down from the 83,884 who attended last year\u2019s talks in the United Arab Emirates. A new analysis found social media platforms are becoming \u201cdangerously polluted\u201d by falsehoods about the climate crisis. The actions of big oil and big tech are helping reframe extreme weather events and sow conspiracy theories about renewable energy, the report found. US president Joe Biden\u2019s climate policy was designed to outlast his administration, the White House\u2019s top climate adviser said at Cop29 on Tuesday, writes Dharna Noor, fossil fuels and climate reporter for the Guardian US. \u201cThe way we built climate action in the United States was akin to the public sector coming in with booster packs on a private sector rocket,\u201d Ali Zaidi told reporters. The Biden administration\u2019s landmark policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, provided billions of dollars in tax credits, loans, and other incentives for the private sector to increase its green spending. But the recently re-elected former president Donald Trump has vowed to claw back the policies \u201cunspent\u201d funds, sparking alarm from the climate movement. \u201cWhat we will see is whether we\u2019ve achieved escape velocity or not and how quickly the booster packs are about to fall off,\u201d Zaidi said. Despite his record incentives for carbon-free energy and green technology, under the Biden administration, oil and gas production soared to record levels. When asked about the uptick, Zaidi deflected. \u201cThe US has in the last four years has doubled its decarbonization pace from below 20% to above 40% in 2030, relative to 2005 levels,\u201d he said. \u201cIf every country did that and did it again in the next five to 10 years, we would be headed where we need to head.\u201d Asked about the lame duck administration\u2019s ability to influence climate finance negotiations at the international climate talks in Baku, Zaidi asked reporters to \u201ckeep in mind that we\u2019re talking about a climate finance goal for 2035.\u201d Despite his optimism, Zaidi said he did not \u201cmean to sugarcoat the result of the election.\u201d \u201cLeadership matters and there\u2019s no talking around that,\u201d he said. Large parts of Greenland and west Antarctica will melt if the world exceeds 1.5C of global heating, a report released this morning by the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative has warned. This will lead to more than 10 metres of sea level rise even if temperatures later fall, which will have catastrophic effects for the billions of people living at low elevations. About three-quarters of large cities sit less than 10 metres below sea level, and many metropolises including Shanghai, Bangkok, Manila, Miami, Osaka, Alexandria and Rio de Janeiro will be severely affected. The report also finds that high mountain glaciers in Asia are expected to lose about half their ice, increasing the risk of disastrous floods from glacial lakes and irreparably affecting the water cycle downstream, where many communities rely on water that originates in these areas. It also warns that emissions from melting permafrost are likely to reach a tipping point and create a cycle of emissions that will not be able to be stopped for one to two centuries, meaning enormous levels of carbon will have to be removed from the atmosphere by future generations in order just to stand still, let alone make progress. More reaction has been rolling in on the UK\u2019s new commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which were trailed to my colleague, Fiona Harvey, last night, and then finally delivered by Keir Starmer, the prime minister, in a statement in Baku this afternoon. Shruti Agarwal, senior adviser on climate change and sustainable economies at Save the Children, said: The UK government\u2019s commitment to an 81% emissions reduction by 2035 is an encouraging step. But let this be the starting point, not the finish line, in the UK\u2019s ambition to protect children who continue to bear the brunt of the climate crisis COP29 is an opportunity to build on this global leadership with further meaningful action on climate both in the UK and around the world. It\u2019s time we stand with children and put their voices at the heart of every aspect of climate change decision-making and financing. As COP29 progresses we hope to see the UK drive forward discussions for a new international climate finance goal and action in the UK ensuring a fair, just transition for all. Friederike Roder, vice president of global policy and advocacy, Global Citizen, said: The UK\u2019s ambitious new NDC sends a powerful message that climate action is unstoppable, and that climate leadership can and will be found across the world The UK\u2019s decision to listen to climate scientists, and to citizens, and reduce emissions by 81% will cement its position as a global leader in climate action. The decision to do so early - at this critical moment - is equally important in building momentum and setting an example for others to follow. Like all commitments at COP, the proof will be in the delivery. But by setting early goals and outlining ambitious targets, the UK is showing much needed leadership at this important moment. We hope this leads to all nations setting ambitious, high action NDCs that keep the world on track for 1.5 degrees, and encourages those here at COP29 to deliver an NCQG which provides the vital finance to achieve these goals. But the UK\u2019s job isn\u2019t done: so far, it has not made any new commitments on international public finance for climate. The poorest countries in the world urgently need additional support to fund their NDCs, ensure a just energy transition and withstand natural disasters. The UK could also show leadership in mobilising new sources of finances by joining the Task Force on Global Solidarity Levies. Frans Berkhout, professor of environment, society and climate at King\u2019s College London, said: The Prime Minister\u2019s announcement on UK climate action at COP29 in Baku is highly significant. The 81% emissions reduction target for 2035 is tougher than the existing target. Mr Starmer aims to recapture the UK\u2019s leadership position on climate precisely at a moment of peril for climate policy following Donald Trump\u2019s election. It commits the UK to more rapid investments in renewables and to tackling the really hard parts of the pathway to net-zero \u2013 transport, buildings and food. As Starmer says, these represent huge opportunities, but delivery will be complex and is high-stakes politically. \u201cYou can run but you can\u2019t hide,\u201d is the warning Steven Guilbeault, Canada\u2019s minister of environment and climate change, gave to methane emitters at the Cop29 summit on Tuesday, writes Damian Carrington, environment editor. Satellite monitoring now enables leaks to be spotted from space and UN and other initiatives are now identifying culprits and demanding action. Methane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas, 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over 20 years, and causes about a third of global heating. The good news is that, unlike CO2, methane breaks down in the atmosphere quickly and therefore cuts rapidly slow warming. Fossil fuel exploitation causes a lot of leaks, but these are often cheap to fix. Former UN climate chief Patricia Espionosa told delegates that cutting methane is \u201cessential\u201d to taming the climate crisis. US special climate envoy John Podesta announced the implementation of fines for large methane leakers. A major leak in Texas in 2022 released 147 tonnes an hour, for example, will cost the operator $220,000 per hour from 2026, which should get their attention. Cop29 president Muktar Bubayev said methane emissions were still going \u201cin the wrong direction\u201d and that this year\u2019s focus was on the methane pouring from waste dumps as food rots. The Guardian revealed in February more than 1200 huge methane leaks from dumps. China\u2019s special envoy, Liu Zhenmin, said it was working to cut emissions from coal mines by two-thirds. The World Bank has also targeted methane reductions and president Ajay Banga highlighted projects in dozens of countries. Methane emissions from cattle were being reduced with better breed and feeds, as well as manure management, in China and Brazil, he said, and emissions from rice growing were being cut with more frugal irrigation in India and Bangladesh. Leaks from oil and gas pipelines were also being tackled in Iraq and Bangladesh, both major emitters. The UK\u2019s Ed Miliband summarised the action being taken on different greenhouse gases by saying: \u201cCO2 is the marathon, methane is the sprint.\u201d The crown prince of Jordan, Al Hussein bin Abdullah II, criticised the Israel-Gaza war as well as stressing the climate threats to his country, one of several world leaders at Cop29 to address both issues together, writes Ajit Niranjan, Europe environment correspondent. \u201cHow can we work together for our shared future when some are deemed unworthy of life?\u201d he asked, criticising the international community for standing by as Palestinians have been killed. He added that war compounds environmental threats, particularly for refugees, who make up an estimated 1 in 3 people in Jordan. \u201cOur inability to collectively do what is right is turning us into passive observers,\u201d he said. \u201cNo-one is a bystander in the fight for life on earth. That means fighting for climate change, fighting for peace and fighting to alleviate human suffering together. Because every life is worth fighting for.\u201d The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, has told delegates at Cop29 that the UK will set an ambitious new target to slash carbon emissions by 81%, as he pledged the country would stand alongside countries \u201con the front line of the climate crisis\u201d. The announcement made the UK one of the first countries to announce an official UN carbon cutting plan \u2014 officially known as a nationally determined contribution. The blueprints are not due until February next year. Starmer said: \u201cToday I can confirm, three months ahead of the deadline, the UK\u2019s 2035 international target, our nationally determined contribution, to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions by at least 81% on 1990 levels. \u201cAnd we urge all parties to come forward with ambitious targets of their own, as we all agreed at the last Cop.\u201d After listing some of the green energy policies already pledged or enacted since his coming to power this summer, Starmer promised the UK would support other countries in making a transition to cleaner energy sources. A new capital market mechanism was launching today on the London Stock Exchange, exploiting the UK\u2019s power as a financial centre to finance the green transition. \u201cClimate action is at the heart of this government\u2019s mission for the protection and prosperity of Britain and the world, writ large across our domestic and international priorities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are taking the action needed to protect our planet and its people.\u201d Alexander De Croo, prime minister of Belgium, has spelled out in simple words the state of progress and the task ahead, writes Ajit Niranjan, Europe environment correspondent. \u201cThis is not a time to falter. Emissions continue to rise and we see more and more destructive climate disasters,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we do not alter our policies, we will see an increase of 3C by the end of the century. He added: \u201cMeetings like these are often perceived as talking shops. And yes, these strenuous negotiations are far from perfect. But if you compare climate policy now to a decade ago, we are in a different world.\u201d De Croo also pointed to two overlooked aspects of the energy transition \u2013 simply using less, and building vital but overlooked infrastructure. \u201cThe safest, cheapest and cleanest energy is the one we don\u2019t use,\u201d said de Croo. \u201cWe must do more on energy efficiency, it\u2019s a win-win.\u201d He added that the development of electricity grids and storage capacity had failed to keep pace with the rise in renewables. Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, said in her speech that the world must take radical action on raising the money needed to fund climate adaptation. She said: \u201cWe are in a season of superlatives and the reality is that these extreme weather events that the world is facing daily suggest that humanity and the planet are hurtling towards catastrophe. \u201cThe extreme weather requires from us a serious commitment at this Cop with respect to new collective quantified goals that enable us to reverse the current trajectory and to fund mitigation, adaptation and, of course, loss and damage.\u201d Mottley is a legendary figure at UN climate talks. For years, she has spearheaded a push to transform how global financial institutions handle climate funding. The mission has borne fruit, the Guardian\u2019s Fiona Harvey wrote this week, since the new World Bank president recently promised to take a more active role in climate finance. But in her speech, Mottley criticised a lack of funding for loss of damage, pointing out the fund has attracted pledges of only $700m so far: \u201cAnd this is despite the numerous crises besetting small island developing states. And, indeed, in our own region, Hurricane Beryl, which has caused serious damage to countries, from housing to public infrastructure.\u201d Under Mottley\u2019s leadership, Barbados removed the British queen as head of state, become a fully fledged republic. The president of Spain, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said he was coming with a \u201cterrible truth\u201d in a fast-paced speech that took aim at climate deniers and laggards on cutting pollution, writes Ajit Niranjan, Europe environment correspondent. \u201cWe need drastic measures,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to transform.\u201d Late last month, catastrophic floods hit southern and eastern Spain killed 220 people, after rains that would have been weaker and less likely had people not heated the planet with fossil fuel pollution. S\u00e1nchez has announced \u20ac10bn in aid to help rebuild the disaster zone. \u201cThis societal threat is obvious to everyone,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez. \u201cBut at this crucial time for humanity, we are seeing governments hesitate and slow down when they should be accelerating. Some are even denying evidence and turning back.\u201d Just a quick reminder for readers that if you want to watch the Cop29 leaders\u2019 speeches for yourself, you can click on the image at the top of the blog. Ahmed Abdullah Afif Didi, vice president of Seychelles, has called on rich countries to move beyond pledges and decide on mechanisms to release funds promised at previous Cops, writes Ajit Niranjan, Europe environment correspondent. He said the Seychelles \u2013 an island nation with a land area as small as the German city of Munich but a marine area the size of France and Turkey \u2013 is punching above its weight but having to pay for the costs of rising sea levels. \u201cEverything is being threatened,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to relocate our houses.\u201d He asked where the country was expected to get the money to pay for it. \u201cJust like the gong went now,\u201d Didi said as an automated buzzer marked the end of his speaking slot, \u201cif this could have been done \u2013 if every time it made a boom we released a million dollars \u2013 then I think this afternoon Seychelles would have all the money it needed to restore a lot of its damaged environment.\u201d Azerbaijan\u2019s President Ilham Aliyev told Cop29 earlier today that fossil fuels are a \u201cgift of God\u201d. Rev Fletcher Harper, of GreenFaith, disgrees: More fossil fuels today are literally the highway to hell for billions of people and the planet, certainly not a gift from God. Renewables for all would be today\u2019s sacred gift. Brazil\u2019s vice president, Geraldo Alckmin, has pointed to the start of the climate conventions in Rio in 1992 that have led to delegates sitting in Baku in 2024, writes Ajit Niranjan, Europe environment correspondent. \u201cEach step along this path represents both progress and hesitations of multilateralism in the task of achieving common environmental goals and our ability to rise to the challenge,\u201d he said. He said Brazil is recognised as an \u201cenvironmental powerhouse\u201d and described it as a leader in food security with green and efficient agriculture. The Amazon rainforest, most of which lies in Brazil, is being destroyed by loggers, miners, farmers and ranchers, many of whom were emboldened to chop and burn trees under former president Jair Bolsonaro. Earlier this year, my Amazon-based colleague Jon Watts wrote powerfully about how optimism for the new president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, is drying up. Earlier we reported the powerful speech of Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands, a low-lying island state facing severe threats from the rising waters caused by climate breakdown. She is one of only eight women leaders representing their countries at Cop29 \u2013 nine tomorrow when Giorgia Meloni of Italy is due to arrive. Observers have raised eyebrows at the lack of gender equality at the summit. \u201cOnce again, women are being silenced and cut out of critical negotiations around the climate catastrophe and the future of our planet,\u201d said Helen Pankhurst, senior advisor on gender equality at CARE International UK. She added: Women and girls are contributing the least to the climate crisis, yet world-over they are paying the highest price. If we want to see a fair outcome from climate negotiations, which make a genuine difference, we\u2019ve got to start seeing women represented equally at the very highest levels. We are currently hearing from Philip Isdor Mpango, vice president of Tanzania. It is not clear why Samia Suluhu Hassan, the country\u2019s president, is not representing Tanzania. The president of Sudan, First Lt. General Abdel-Fattah AlBurhan Abdelrahman Al-Burhan, has joined several leaders in criticising the effects of war, calling his opponents a threat to the country along with climate change, writes Ajit Niranjan, Europe environment correspondent. Sudan is in the grip of what the UN has described as \u201cone of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history\u201d, after a civil war broke out in April and both sides were accused of war crimes. It has contributed almost nothing to heating the planet but is one of the most vulnerable to extreme weather made worse by climate change. \u201cClimate change is a key priority for Sudan, because it is vital for its national development,\u201d said Al-Burhan. \u201cClimate change is not just changing the planet, it is changing children,\u201d Abheet Solomon from Unicef told Cop29 on Tuesday, writes Damian Carrington, environment editor. He said children \u2013 the future of humanity \u2013 are disproportionately affected due to their fast-growing bodies. \u201cThe biggest risks to children come from extreme heat, from droughts and storms, from wildfires, from air pollution,\u201d he said. \u201cThese hazards are linked to pregnancy complications, adverse birth outcomes, child malnutrition, killer infectious diseases like malaria, other diseases like asthma and depression, impacts on brain development and mental health.\u201d \u201cI give this litany because it is important to emphasise that we are already seeing the impacts on children\u2019s health,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cThe purpose of climate action is to protect humanity\u2019s future, its children, and therefore we are failing children if we do not keep the 1.5C promise.\u201d Everyone\u2019s health is affected by the climate crisis, said Dr Maria Neira, from the World Health Organisation: \u201cWe say health is the argument for climate action. The WHO community is here to make sure that all the negotiators are aware that when they are negotiating emissions, they are negotiating with our health.\u201d \u201cClimate change is making us sick, as simple as that,\u201d she said. \u201cThis diagnosis is clearly based on science.\u201d She said air pollution from burning fossil fuels kills 7 million people a year, while the climate crisis also harms people via heatwaves and other extreme weather, increasing the transmission of deadly infectious diseases, displacing people and impacting their mental health, and as well as making the production of healthy food harder. \u201cBut if we [fight] climate change, the health benefits that we will unlock can be enormous\u201d Neira, said. She highlighted sustainable travel, such as cycling and walking: \u201cIf we reduce sedentary lifestyles, we reduce all the associated diseases associated with this lack of an active life.\u201d A special report on climate change and health produced for Cop29 found that just five climate-related actions could save 2m lives a year. The most impactful action would be phasing out hundreds of billions of dollars of fossil fuel subsidies and taxing fossil fuels, saving 1.2m lives a year. The other actions are heatwave warning systems, phasing out fossil fuel use in primary healthcare facilities and in homes, and protecting clean water and sanitation from climate damage. Charles Michel, president of the European Council, spoke on behalf of the EU to warn against war and present itself as a credible partner to poor countries, writes Ajit Niranjan, Europe environment correspondent. He called out \u201cviolent imperialism, endless cycles of vengeance\u201d as a driver of wars that have driven the world to the brink. He contrasted it with European beliefs in a rule-based world that promotes \u201cthe strength of law, not the law of strength.\u201d Europe has made some of the greatest progress worldwide in cutting its planet-heating pollution, with emissions in the EU falling a staggering 8% last year, but it is still not on track to reach its 2030 targets. Michel also praised Europe\u2019s climate finance contributions, a sore spot with poorer nations who have highlighted the repeated failure of rich countries to stump up cash to help countries clean their economies and adapt to extreme weather. \u201cYou can count on the European Union,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are stepping up to the plate with financing: $31bn. That\u2019s more than our fair share and we are calling on everyone to follow our example.\u201d Last year, the EU dropped its opposition to a fund to pay for the damage done by climate change. Michel called for \u201cboldness, rather than procrastination\u201d as he repeated calls to expand the donor base of contributors for climate finance. The EU\u2019s relations with Azerbaijan have invited separate accusations of hypocrisy. In its bid to ditch Russian gas, the EU has encouraged Azerbaijan to increase its own production. But it is unwilling to finance their fossil fuel projects because they fall foul of climate considerations. The upshot could be saddling Azerbaijan with \u201cstranded assets\u201d if the EU\u2019s hunger for gas falls in line with its climate goals. Hilda Heine, president of Marshall Islands, called out rich countries for not stumping up enough money to finance cuts to pollution but encouraged poor countries to still put forward ambitious climate action plans, writes Ajit Niranjan, Europe environment correspondent. \u201cIt is in our blood to know when a tide is turning,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd on climate, the tide is turning today.\u201d Heine used her speech to call out those planning to leave the conference and mine more coal and pump more gas, highlighting the \u201cfallacy that their short-term interests are worth the destruction on their doorstep and they will escape without blame.\u201d The Marshall Islands extend across a stretch of the Pacific Ocean. Since they sit only a few feet above sea level, they are existentially threatened by climate breakdown-fuelled rising seas. Two years ago, its climate envoy wrote a powerful essay for the Guardian asking: \u201cHow do we mourn an island?\u201d Heine, whose speech overran the three-minute time slot by 5-and-a-half minutes, said she would look out for greenwashing. \u201cThe repercussions of low ambition and low action will only get worse.\u201d She ended with a Marshallese saying: \u201cWe are all on the same canoe, and we must all work together if we are to reach our destination.\u201d Mohamed Muizzu, president of the Maldives, called for nations to set a bold climate finance goal and slash emissions, writes Dharna Noor, fossil fuels and climate reporter. \u201cThe new climate finance goal must reflect the true scale of the climate crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe need is in trillions [of dollars], not billions.\u201d He also critiqued climate talks participants for their limited progress on climate mitigation. \u201c28 Cops later, emissions still rise,\u201d he said. The climate crisis poses an existential threat to the Maldives, which is responsible for just 0.003% of global greenhouse gas emissions. At the current rate of global warming, 80% of the Maldives could become uninhabitable by 2050, multiple studies have concluded. \u201cFor us the environment and ocean are more than resources, they are our cultural identity,\u201d Muizzu said. \u201cTheir protection remains our sacred duty.\u201d He added: \u201cAs we look around the globe we see funds flowing freely to wage war,\u201d but not to fund climate finance. Muizzu wrote in the Guardian earlier this year: \u201cThe international community must understand that we rely on external financing to prepare for and recover from the climate crisis that its overconsumption has caused.\u201d The president of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko, took a swipe at rich nations in his speech, writes Dharna Noor, fossil fuels and climate reporter. \u201cPeople who are responsible for this are absent,\u201d he said, noting that French president Emmanual Macron was not present for the talks. \u201cHow effective are our climate negotiations if the president of France is not even present?\u201d Lukashenko claimed his nation is meeting its climate goals. \u201cThere is nothing to hold against our country. We are strictly complying with all our obligations but since there is this deep seated bureaucracy in the UN secretariat it\u2019s almost impossible to say anything substantive,\u201d he said. But the nation has been criticized for its failure to transition to renewable energy. \u201cThe prime task is to restructure national economies, first and foremost agriculture,\u201d he said \u2013 an ironic statement from a heavily fossil-fuel dependent country. Lukashenko called for \u201cnot mere words but deeds,\u201d particularly when it comes to climate finance. \u201cThose who have to pay, must pay,\u201d he said. Belarus is a close ally of Russia and the two bordering nations\u2019 energy markets are deeply intertwined. Belarus refineries use Russian oil for a feedstock, while Russian oil companies purchase gas from the refineries. Some countries are working to disconnect their energy systems from the two nations\u2019. Lukashenko\u2019s relationship with Russia \u2013 as well as his treatment of his critics \u2013 has long sparked outrage. This year Lukashenko signed a law granting himself lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution while also preventing exiled opposition from running for president in Belarus. There have been some positive responses to the UK\u2019s new commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Many are pleased at the ambitious goal announced by Keir Starmer, who has said the country will aim to slash emissions by 81% on 1990 levels by 2035, as a sign the UK will take up the baton of climate leadership, with the US almost certain to drop it once Donald Trump becomes president again in January. But they also warn that the UK is currently way off track in reaching even its existing, less ambitious commitment. Kate Blagojevic, Associate Director of Europe at 350.org said: Getting the UK\u2019s more ambitious climate goals out of the door early is a good move by Keir Starmer as it shows willingness to show his cards on an international stage - this is much needed to encourage others to do so. The UK has the potential to become a true global climate leader on the world stage but isn\u2019t quite there yet. For Keir Starmer to claim the coveted mantle in time, the more ambitious emissions reduction targets need to get back on track and be delivered on time without relying on CCS and nuclear power. While Keir Starmer might balk at the cost of doing the right thing, the private sector cannot be relied on to deliver what is needed. But he could force billionaires to pay the tax they owe and choose to channel the increased revenue into delivering real climate action at home and globally so we can hit these targets and pay our fair share. When he delivers this, then the UK will truly be at the forefront of global climate leadership. Debbie Hillier, Mercy Corps Global Climate Policy Lead, said: We appreciate the UK Government showing up strong at COP29, aligning their commitment with the credible recommendations of the Climate Change Committee and setting an 81% emissions reduction target by 2035. This signals a positive shift in tone and transparency from the UK, showing that they are not shying away from the urgent challenges we face. It also sets a strong bar for other countries, encouraging them to develop NDCs in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and get the world on track for 1.5 degrees warming. This needs to be matched with equally ambitious action from the UK on climate finance to enable these NDCs to be implemented. Technical issues at Cop29 have sparked concerns about a lack of transparency from civil society participants. On Tuesday, observers from around the globe gathered to hear negotiations on new goalpost setting for climate finance, and were ushered into an overflow room. Upon entry, they found the sound was not working for some time, making it impossible to hear negotiators\u2019 conversations. \u201cI would think that\u2019s definitely a concern,\u201d said Laura Schaefer, who attended Cop29 with the young Icelandic environmentalists, as part of her home country\u2019s party. \u201cWe traveled all the way here to hear what they\u2019re talking about and to be able to go back home with some new insights.\u201d At UN climate negotiations, observers act as informal watchdogs who can help ensure proceedings reflect the concerns of vulnerable communities. Even when the audio of negotiations is available but spotty, Schaefer said, it threatens accessibility, \u201cespecially for people that struggle with the English language.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s super important to be able to hear the kind of perspectives that there are in the room,\u201d she said. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, president of T\u00fcrkiye, has used his speech to praise Turkey\u2019s progress in cutting pollution, writes Ajit Niranjan, Europe environment correspondent. Turkey is among the countries where the effects of climate change have been felt most strongly, said Erdo\u011fan, who listed a stream of policies the country has introduced to cut pollution \u2013 including a zero-waste project from his spouse. An assessment from Climate Action Tracker in April last year described Turkey\u2019s latest action plan as \u201ccritically insufficient\u201d, with policies to cut pollution that are inconsistent with the Paris climate agreement. The speech, which overran the 3-minute time slot by 2 minutes, also called out Israeli attacks in Gaza and Lebanon, which he said were leading to \u201cchemical penetrating soil and underground water resources\u201d that were harming the future of Gazan children. We now have the video stream of the leaders\u2019 speeches available to stream from this blog page. Just click the photograph at the top and you can watch live. Hi! This is Damien Gayle taking over the liveblog for the rest of the day, with thanks to Alan for getting things started this morning. We are currently awaiting reports of the leaders\u2019 speeches to come through from our team in Baku. But I\u2019ll also be doing my best to keep abreast of other developments from the conference, and related news around the world. Remember, if you have any comments, tips or suggestions you can reach us at Cop29@theguardian.com. Climate protesters gathered outside Scotland\u2019s top civil court this morning in support of a court case to stop the Rosebank oil field, which starts today. The demonstration outside the court of session in Edinburgh earlier on Tuesday was led by Greenpeace and Uplift, who have brought a judicial review to stop the development of Rosebank and the Jackdaw gas field. Rosebank is the UK\u2019s biggest undeveloped oil and gas field, and is located 80 miles off the coast of Shetland, with 80% owned by the Norwegian state-owned oil giant Equinor and 20% by the Israeli firm Ithica. The Jackdaw gas field is in the North Sea, owned by BG International Limited, an affiliate of Shell UK. Crowds chanted \u201cI believe we will win\u201d and \u201cthis is where we draw the line on fossil fuels and climate crimes\u201d while holding a long knitted red scarf across the entrance to the court. Lauren MacDonald, lead campaigner of #StopRosebank, a coalition campaign group against the oil field, addressed the demonstrators, \u201cBuilding this movement to what is now a coalition of over 150,000 individuals, 275 organisations, cross party politicians from every major political party, climate scientists, doctors, faith leaders, farmers, grandparents and young people all of whom are asking why on earth is it that we continue to approve massive fossil fuel projects when we know it will only put us in much more danger \u201cIf we win this case then it will continue to set that precedent that we will stop all new oil drilling in the UK.\u201d She thanked Sarah Finch, who fronted the Finch v Surrey county council lawsuit at the supreme court to change the law on considerations of the future impact of fossil fuel projects, for coming to support the demonstration. The leaders\u2019 speeches are finally beginning, and first up is Kazakhstan\u2019s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who says his country is pursuing carbon neutrality by 2060. He says the new collective quantified goal, or NCQG, should prioritise the regions most affected by climate change, including landlocked developing countries. He says central Asia accounts for just 1% of global emissions but faces many serious climate risks. Tokayev says Kazakhstan is ideally situation for carbon farming and \u201cinvites all parties to explore this avenue.\u201d He adds that the country is \u201cready to be a major supplier of energy transition minerals with many opportunities for corporations\u201d. He ends by warning that the Caspian Sea is in danger, and urges countries to collaborate on working to save it. \u201cWorsening climate impacts will put inflation on steroids unless every country can take bolder climate action,\u201d the UN\u2019s top climate official Simon Stiell has warned world leaders at Cop29. He follows his boss, UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, in spurring the 200 gathered nations to reach a strong agreement at Cop29, especially on delivering the $1tn a year needed for climate action in developing countries. \u201cWe used to talk about climate action as being mostly about saving future generations. But there has been a seismic shift in the global climate crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the climate crisis is fast becoming an economy-killer, right now, today, in this political cycle.\u201d \u201cThe climate crisis is a cost-of-living crisis, because climate disasters are driving up costs for households and businesses,\u201d he said, appealing to leaders in terms that might resonate given that their recent political fortunes have been dominated by the soaring prices endured by their citizens. \u201cLet\u2019s learn the lessons from the pandemic when supply chains were smashed,\u201d Stiell said. \u201cClimate finance is global inflation insurance.\u201d He also made the positive economic case for climate action: \u201cCheap, clean energy can be the bedrock of your economies. It means more jobs, more growth, less pollution choking cities, healthier citizens and stronger businesses.\u201d Finally, he made a subtle reference to the recent election of climate change denier Donald Trump as US president, which prompted fears that the Cop process could be fatally undermined: \u201cThese are not easy times, but despair is not a strategy, and it\u2019s not warranted. Our process is strong, and it will endure. After all, international cooperation is the only way humanity survives global warming.\u201d We are still waiting for the leaders\u2019 speeches, but Azerbaijan\u2019s president Ilham Aliyev used his keynote speech to describe his country\u2019s oil and gas resources as a \u201cgift from god\u201d. Aliyev also criticised western critics of his country\u2019s oil and gas industry, saying it had been the victim of a \u201cwell-orchestrated campaign of slander and blackmail\u201d, Reuters reported. \u201cAs a president of Cop29 of course, we will be a strong advocate for green transition, and we are doing it. But at the same time, we must be realistic,\u201d said Aliyev. \u201cCountries should not be blamed for having [oil and gas resources], and should not be blamed for bringing these resources to the market, because the market needs them. The people need them.\u201d He singled out the United States, the world\u2019s largest historic carbon emitter, and the European Union for particular criticism. \u201cUnfortunately, double standards, a habit to lecture other countries, and political hypocrisy became kind of modus operandi for some politicians, state-controlled NGOs and fake news media in some western countries,\u201d he said. Keir Starmer held a meeting with Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank, at Cop29 on Tuesday. The UK is to be the host city for a new climate fund set up by the International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank. The Climate Investment Fund will be listed on the London Stock Exchange, selling bonds to institutional investors which will then be used to finance climate schemes in the developing world. It will invest in climate, nature and green energy projects, and will aim to raise $75bn over 10 years. The UK\u2019s role in this is to provide the financial markets expertise, and the UK government calculates that it will generate jobs in the City of London, and the UK\u2019s broader finance sector. A spokesperson for the prime minister told the Guardian: \u201cThey agreed on the importance of mobilising private finance to strengthen action to tackle the climate challenge, and the prime minister welcomed the World Bank\u2019s ambition in this area. The prime minister said he was delighted to announce the launch of the new CIF Capital Market Mechanism which will list on the London Stock Exchange. He thanked the president for his support and engagement in this area, and welcomed the confidence this showed in the UK\u2019s economy. The prime minister said that this demonstrated London as a green finance capital, and bolstered Britain as an attractive place to invest in the future.\u201d Starmer will announce the UK\u2019s carbon-cutting plans, called a nationally determined contribution (NDC), on Tuesday afternoon in Baku. As revealed by the Guardian last night, this will be a pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 81% compared to 1990 levels by 2035. This is likely to be one of the strongest NDCs to emerge from the Cop29 conference, as several others that have so far been submitted \u2013 by Azerbaijan, United Arab Emirates and Brazil - have been judged weak by NGOs. Starmer will also confirm that the Labour government will honour the commitment to provide \u00a311.6bn in climate finance by 2026 that was made under its Conservative predecessor. The prime minister was notably cagey when asked by journalists on Tuesday morning whether the UK\u2019s carbon-cutting commitments would require lifestyle changes. He said his government would \u201cnot tell people how to live their life\u201d. Yesterday\u2019s opening plenary was delayed by several hours due to behind-the-scenes negotiations and it now seems today\u2019s leaders\u2019 speeches are also being delayed by about half an hour. Venue staff are still conducting sound checks, and the live feed has changed to a holding screen. Our reporters are still queuing to get into the room so it may be a little while yet before the speeches start. Donald Trump\u2019s successful election campaign was bolstered by the support of Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X and one of the platforms that are becoming \u201cdangerously polluted\u201d by falsehoods about the climate crisis, according to a new analysis. The actions of big oil and big tech are helping reframe extreme weather events and sow conspiracy theories about renewable energy, the report by the Climate Action Against Disinformation group found. As Cop29 kicks off, the group states, \u201cthe consequences of climate change are now more extreme, and so too is the nature and ubiquity of mis- and disinformation.\u201d A small number of \u201csuper spreaders\u201d are helping distribute debunked claims about clean energy and electric vehicles on social media platforms, the report finds, with disasters such as wildfires and floods being used to ferment opposition to climate policies and even threats of violence against emergency workers. Fossil fuel companies are still welcomed as advertisers, too, with Meta, owner of Facebook, receiving at least $17.6m for ads that received more than 700 million impressions over the past year, according to the report. These adverts depict fossil fuels as essential for energy needs and push for industry-friendly policies. The prevalence of online misinformation about the climate crisis is not new, but threatens broader public support for climate measures, the group said. \u201cThe further decay of information integrity is not a foregone conclusion, but we must confront threats now, before the damage is beyond repair,\u201d the report warns. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, has said he will not be \u201ctelling people how to live their lives\u201d in order to reach the UK\u2019s new 81% emissions reduction target, but said it was \u201cachievable\u201d. The prime minister said that he would not be suggesting people take fewer flights, install heat pumps or eat less meat - but said it would lead to a reduction in energy bills and the security of energy independence. Starmer will formally announce the emissions goal at Cop29 later on Tuesday but it is expected to mean a target of reduction of emissions by 81% compared with 1990 levels by 2035, as the Guardian revealed last night. \u201cI\u2019ll set out our goal later on today, but look, it will be ambitious, and that\u2019s measured not by telling people what to do,\u201d Starmer told broadcasters in Baku. \u201cIt\u2019s measured by making sure that we get to clean power by 2030 \u2013 that\u2019s the single most important target \u2026 and that will bring with it lower bills for people, for their energy it\u2019ll give them independence, so that tyrants like Putin can\u2019t put his boot on our throat, causing all sorts of difficulties for our energy bills.\u201d Starmer said he accepted it would mean difficult choices for government. \u201cI accept it\u2019s a difficult target. It\u2019s an achievable target. But it\u2019s not about telling people how to live their lives. I\u2019m not interested in that. \u201cI am interested in making sure that their energy bills are stable, that we\u2019ve got energy independence, and that we also, along the way, pick up the next generation of jobs.\u201d He said that the UK would be showing \u201cleadership on the climate challenge \u2026 a very important challenge of our time.\u201d But he said it was also \u201cthe single biggest opportunity for the next generation of jobs... this morning, here at Cop, I\u2019m announcing a \u00a31bn order for blades for offshore wind, which would be jobs in Hull.\u201d Asked about the effect of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory on efforts to combat climate change, the energy secretary Ed Miliband said he was sure that they would find \u201ccommon ground\u201d with the president-elect, who has described climate change as a \u201choax.\u201d \u201cYou will see what decisions the new administration makes \u2013 is that the economics now point in the direction of clean energy,\u201d he told BBC Breakfast. \u201cIf you think about lots of the decisions that companies and countries are making, they recognise this is the single biggest job creator of our era, and so people want to be ahead in that race. \u201cSo, we will seek to find common ground with Donald Trump, he will make his own decisions about what he wants to do. I obviously want him to stay in the Paris climate agreement, but that\u2019s his decision.\u201d More reaction is coming in to the UK\u2019s new emissions cut target revealed by the Guardian last night. It has generally been warmly welcomed, though with some caveats. Zahra Hdidou of ActionAid said: With a planet battered by severe floods, storms, and heatwaves\u2014and a climate denier elected to the White House\u2014the UK is setting a bold bar for climate action at Cop this year. Yet this commitment risks being sabotaged by a costly obsession with carbon capture and storage\u2014 a false climate solution that hands a dangerous lifeline to the fossil fuel industry. Adding further insult to injury, the UK continues to pour over \u00a35bn in public subsidies each year into polluting industries, diverting valuable funds away from where they\u2019re truly needed while adding fuel to the climate fire. Rebecca Newsom of Greenpeace said: Despite the shadow cast over this summit by the prospect of Trump 2.0, Keir Starmer is choosing to step up, instead of stepping back from climate action. Despite falling short of the UK\u2019s fair share, this is a relatively ambitious target compared with many other nations, and will help build momentum at these talks. But targets need to be backed up with bold action. When the government submits its action plan next year, it must include details of how the UK will deliver a full phase out of oil and gas, as it has done with coal. This must include proper funding to help workers transition from high carbon jobs to the green industries of the future. As our planet reels from catastrophic floods in Spain and bakes in what is likely to be the hottest year on record, this is the bare minimum needed to limit warming to 1.5C. My colleague Fiona Harvey spotted some performers waiting to take to the stage for the ceremony The \u201ccultural segment\u201d of the high-level leaders\u2019 event has begun. It features a lot of brightly lit shots of the countryside with the saturation level turned up to the max, smiling children picnicking and shots by drones soaring through mountain passes, all backed by an cheerful if intense orchestral score. This is followed by a singer in a dinner jacket singing something rousing, although sadly translation was not provided. It is interspersed with shots of the watching delegates looking appreciative if slightly nonplussed. Next up is some lively folk music from two tar players, backed by the orchestra and played at a pace that feels as though it could be intended to increase the pressure the delegates are feeling to get a positive result. They are followed by a violinist in front of a backdrop of crashing waves and sunlight reflected on water. In the halls of Cop29, activists from Oil Change International gathered around a computer to watch a Dutch court\u2019s ruling on a major ruling. In this morning\u2019s verdict, the Dutch appeals court struck down a 2021 ruling ordering oil and gas giant Shell to cut emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels. The activists were devastated. Laurie van der Burg, Oil Change International, said: \u201cWhile we mourn today\u2019s setback, the movement for climate justice is only getting stronger. Around the world, movements are increasing pressure on Shell and other big polluters for continuing to aggressively drive the climate crisis, through fossil fuel expansion and lobbying to obstruct, weaken, and delay climate policies.\u201d Despite the major setback, Van der Burg remained optimistic about future lawsuits against big oil, noting that at least 86 lawsuits have been filed against fossil fuel producers globally. \u201cRich fossil fuel producing countries gathering in Baku this week should take notice,\u201d she said. \u201cUnless they stop propping up fossil fuels with billions of dollars in subsidies and instead take responsibility for paying the climate finance they owe to the global south they too will be held responsible in court. We\u2019re just getting started.\u201d The ruling cited March 2024 research by Oil Change International which showed Shell\u2019s climate plans are out of step with the goals of the Paris climate accord. The Guardian has a full report below, which will be updated further as reaction comes in: \u201c2024 \u2013 a masterclass in climate destruction.\u201d That is how UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres started his address to world leaders at Cop29 on Tuesday. \u201cFamilies running for their lives before the next hurricane strikes; Workers and pilgrims collapsing in insufferable heat; Floods tearing through communities, and tearing down infrastructure; Children going to bed hungry as droughts ravage crops. All these disasters, and more, are being supercharged by human-made climate change,\u201d he said. The world leaders event happens at the start of Cop, intended to spur and inspire their negotiators towards a strong final agreement. But it was Guterres that read the riot act, with very strong words on the human cost of the climate crisis, and the extreme urgency of action. \u201cNo country is spared,\u201d he emphasised, with global supply chain shocks sending prices soaring for everyone. \u201cUnless emissions plummet and adaptation soars, every economy will face far greater fury.\u201d \u201cBut there is every reason to hope,\u201d Guterres said, with nations having already pledged to transition away from fossil fuels at last year\u2019s Cop28. \u201cIt\u2019s time to deliver and humanity is behind you.\u201d With solar and wind the cheapest source of new electricity almost everywhere, \u201cdoubling down on fossil fuels is absurd,\u201d he said. \u201cThe clean energy revolution is here. No group, no business, and no government can stop it. But you must ensure it is fair and fast.\u201d Guterres listed three priorities. First \u201cemergency\u201d emissions reductions, with the G20 countries leading. Second, protecting people from the ravages of the climate crisis, especially the most vulnerable, which will require hundreds of billions of dollars. Third, delivering the overall finance goal, which should be at least $1tn a year and is the key task at Cop29. \u201cDeveloping countries eager to act are facing many obstacles: scant public finance; raging cost of capital; crushing climate disasters; and debt servicing that soaks up funds,\u201d he said. \u201cDeveloping countries must not leave Baku empty-handed. A deal is a must.\u201d Guterres highlighted both government funding, cheap loans from development banks and \u201cinnovative\u201d sources, particularly levies on shipping, aviation, and fossil fuel extraction. \u201cPolluters must pay,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world must pay up, or humanity will pay the price,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate finance is not charity, it\u2019s an investment. Climate action is not optional, it\u2019s imperative. Both are indispensable to a liveable world for all humanity.\u201d The UN and the Cop presidency have celebrated last night\u2019s early breakthrough on carbon credits rules that pave the way for a carbon market. \u201cYesterday we secured critical progress on one of our key priorities, article 6\u201d said Azerbaijan\u2019s lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev, referring to a fraught section of the Paris agreement that has frustrated climate negotiators for nearly a decade. The move is a \u201cgamechanger to direct resources to the developing world and save up to $250bn a year to implement climate plans,\u201d he said. Carbon markets let rich countries and companies pay poor ones to cut emissions and count the savings on their own. It\u2019s a process that can speed up climate action by plucking cheap and low-hanging fruit first, but runs the risk of being abused when underwhelming or harmful projects are credited, or when projects are double-counted. NGOs reacted with anger to the way in which the rules were pushed through on Monday night, describing it as a \u201cbackdoor deal\u201d. The supervisory body adopted new standards ahead of the summit and recommended the parties to approve it, breaking with previous years in which it had given negotiators a set of recommendations to discuss. Maria Aljishi, chair of the supervisory body, said further work was being done to develop standards at a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cWe absolutely must follow due process at all times. The CMA [parties to the Paris agreement] are free to give the supervisory body any guidance, and we are more than happy to receive that guidance and act on it.\u201d The world leaders in attendance have posed for the traditional \u201cfamily photo\u201d before the high-level segment gets under way. It is notably more sparsely attended (and rather less grand) than the equivalent image taken at Cop28 last year: Officials from the Taliban are attending Cop29, the first UN climate conference they have been at since they took power in Afghanistan in 2021. Because the organisation is not formally recognised by UN member states, the group cannot participate fully in proceedings but were invited by hosts Azerbaijan to \u201cpotentially participate in periphery discussions and potentially hold bilateral meetings,\u201d according to a report by news agency Reuters. Afghanistan has suffered from drought for decades and is one of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate breakdown. The UN has announced the provisional number of participants in the year\u2019s conference: 66,778. This includes everyone from heads of government to security staff to journalists. The number is significantly down from the 83,884 who attended last year\u2019s talks in the United Arab Emirates, although it is still far higher than all other previous events. Numbers of attendees have been rising rapidly in recent years; Cop27 had about 49,704 delegates attend, while Cop26 in Glasgow hosted 38,457. The UNHCR, the UN\u2019s refugee body, has released a report today on how climate breakdown is making life even more difficult for people fleeing war and persecution. It finds that three-quarters of the 120 million displaced people around the world are in countries severely affected by climate breakdown, and that by 2040 65 countries around the world are expected to face \u201cextreme climate-related hazards\u201d. The report finds that those living in \u201cextremely fragile states\u201d receive about $2 of adaptation funding each per year, compared with $161 in non-fragile states. It also finds that the vast majority of that funding goes to those in capital cities, overlooking those in rural areas. Filippo Grandi, the UN\u2019s high commissioner for refugees, said: \u201cThe climate emergency represents a deep injustice. People forced to flee, and the communities hosting them, are the least responsible for carbon emissions yet are paying the highest price. The billions of dollars in climate financing never reach them, and humanitarian assistance cannot adequately cover the ever-widening gap. Solutions are at hand, but we need urgent action. Without proper resources and support, those affected will be trapped.\u201d The UK is to announce its new NDC, or nationally determined contribution, at the conference today. My colleague Fiona Harvey revealed last night that it will commit to an emissions reduction of 81% on 1990 levels by 2035. The target is in line with the recommendation made by the government\u2019s official advisers, the Climate Change Committee. Although campaigners have said the target should be considered the bare minimum the UK should commit to, privately many will feel relieved the target is not lower. The UK is currently off track to meet its 2030 commitment of a 68% cut in emissions on 1990 levels, having reduced its ambition under the Sunak government. Read the full story here: After a rather frustrating first day, when disagreements over the agenda led to delays and false starts, today is \u2013 or should be \u2013 the day Cop29 really gets going. Put another way, it\u2019s when the circus comes to town, because security ramps up meaning no one can get anywhere, the corridors are packed with guards and camerapeople, and for this segment of the conference world leaders get to bask in the spotlight. This is the start of the World Leaders Climate Action Summit, when heads of state and government arrive. This year, there will be notably fewer from big developed countries than could usually be expected. After the election of Donald Trump, Joe Biden will not be putting in an appearance, and the beleaguered US delegation are looking anxious. Xi Jinping of China has made a habit of staying at home for Cops. Germany\u2019s Olaf Scholz is facing the dissolution of his coalition, so he won\u2019t be coming. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is stuck in the midst of confirmation hearings for her cabinet, which also means that Cop veterans Teresa Ribera - the dynamic former Spanish environment minister who has galvanised previous Cops - and Dan Jorgensen, the former Danish environment minister who has been a steadying presence since his first Cop in Copenhagen in 2009, will also be stuck in Brussels. Emanuel Macron of France has an ongoing crisis to cope with so is staying in Paris, from where he yesterday waved off Keir Starmer, one of the few heads of major economies to hit Baku. Starmer is expected to unveil the UK\u2019s NDC and boost the prospect of private sector cash ramping up to join the public money that is expected to be pledged here, through a deal that will see a key climate fundraising vehicle listed in London. He will be joined by Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, and others. There will also be plenty of space given to developing countries to make their points. Mia Mottley of Barbados is here, an electric presence at previous Cops whose ideas for a revolution in climate finance are now becoming mainstream. For Azerbaijan\u2019s presidency, today will be crucial for national prestige. They will look to capitalise on the presence of leaders to give the instructions to their negotiating teams that are needed to unlock the talks. Behind the scenes and the public speeches, they will try to ensure that political leaders don\u2019t get away with just an exchange of warm words and some photo opportunities. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the Cop29 climate conference, where Tuesday is the first day of the world leaders\u2019 event. The Guardian\u2019s reporters will be bringing you updates from the ground and around the world. I\u2019m Alan Evans, my colleague Damien Gayle will be taking over later, and you can reach us at cop29@theguardian.com.",

Many of its neighbors in the River Arts district in Asheville, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina\">North Carolina</a>, were leveled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-helene\">Hurricane Helene</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/29/hurricane-helene-historic-flooding-global-heating-fema\">flooding</a> in late September.</p> <p>\u201cWe were graciously spared the worst of the damage,\u201d said McGaughey, who opened the business with his wife, Shannon, in 2017. Then, it was a pop-up serving elevated cuisine on paper plates at a local brewery. During the recent storm, Vivian\u2019s building sustained some roof damage. \u201cWe lost water and power, as did everyone else. But we also lost tens of thousands of dollars worth of product.\u201d</p> <p>The business is also losing workers. \u201cQuite a few important and key characters in our staff had to leave the state. And we haven\u2019t been able to give those that stuck around any kind of date in terms of reopening,\u201d said McGaughey, who was nominated for a James Beard Foundation south-east regional chef award last year.</p> <p>More than a month after the hurricane pummeled the mountains of western North Carolina nearly 80% of Asheville homes and businesses do not have drinking water,<strong> </strong>according to Asheville Water Resources. No water means that restaurants, reliable engines of the Buncombe county\u2019s $3bn <a href=\"https://www.bpr.org/bpr-news/2023-10-24/how-asheville-tourism-became-a-3-billion-a-year-behemoth\">tourism economy</a>, can\u2019t fully operate in their busiest money-making season when visitors typically seek out fall color and cool mountain temperatures. In turn, that means a large swath of the area\u2019s residents are without work; more than 22,000 people work in food preparation jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/23/asheville-north-carolina-cookouts-hurricane-helene\">Disaster dining: cookouts became a lifeline in a hurricane-ravaged North Carolina city</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of Vivian\u2019s employees, nearly half have left. Among them are a pastry chef who moved back to Boston, a dishwasher who returned to Virginia, and a sous chef who lost his home in the floods and relocated to the eastern part of the state. McGaughey noted: \u201cPeople are making those decisions on a weekly basis.\u201d</p> <p>Though Vivian escaped destruction, it\u2019s closed indefinitely. In this case, luck is a relative thing.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that our building is still standing has made it more complicated in terms of getting funding. No insurance company is being helpful to anyone in Asheville that I have heard of, and ours is being particularly nasty. Since we can\u2019t prove that the damage to the roof came from the storm, they won\u2019t cover that. They won\u2019t cover our losses. They\u2019ve completely denied us any of our claims.\u201d</p> <p>Without money for repairs and water, McGaughey is unsure of the future for his restaurant and staff.</p> <p>Kim Murray, co-owner of Creekside Taphouse, is in a similar situation as an independent restaurateur. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get any assistance, and we lost an entire month of revenue\u201d at the quaint neighborhood barbecue and beer joint. \u201cOur insurance claim was immediately denied, and we\u2019re in the process of trying to appeal that. We applied for a [Small Business Administration] disaster loan, and they told us there was no more money and there won\u2019t be any more funding until after the election.\u201d</p>    <p>Creekside reopened on 24 October<strong>,</strong> but not with a full staff. Murray said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to bring back staff in order of their need, but it\u2019s a double-edged sword because I have no idea how much money they are going to be able to make.\u201d</p> <p>Bartender Capuchina Taylor has experienced the cut of that blade first hand. She works at North Carolina\u2019s oldest known gay bar, O.Henry\u2019s, which opened in 1976. Halloween is usually one of their busiest days of the year.

      "bodyText": "Josiah McGaughey\u2019s fine dining restaurant, Vivian, is still standing. Many of its neighbors in the River Arts district in Asheville, North Carolina, were leveled by Hurricane Helene\u2019s flooding in late September. \u201cWe were graciously spared the worst of the damage,\u201d said McGaughey, who opened the business with his wife, Shannon, in 2017. Then, it was a pop-up serving elevated cuisine on paper plates at a local brewery. During the recent storm, Vivian\u2019s building sustained some roof damage. \u201cWe lost water and power, as did everyone else. But we also lost tens of thousands of dollars worth of product.\u201d The business is also losing workers. \u201cQuite a few important and key characters in our staff had to leave the state. And we haven\u2019t been able to give those that stuck around any kind of date in terms of reopening,\u201d said McGaughey, who was nominated for a James Beard Foundation south-east regional chef award last year. More than a month after the hurricane pummeled the mountains of western North Carolina nearly 80% of Asheville homes and businesses do not have drinking water, according to Asheville Water Resources. No water means that restaurants, reliable engines of the Buncombe county\u2019s $3bn tourism economy, can\u2019t fully operate in their busiest money-making season when visitors typically seek out fall color and cool mountain temperatures. In turn, that means a large swath of the area\u2019s residents are without work; more than 22,000 people work in food preparation jobs. Of Vivian\u2019s employees, nearly half have left. Among them are a pastry chef who moved back to Boston, a dishwasher who returned to Virginia, and a sous chef who lost his home in the floods and relocated to the eastern part of the state. McGaughey noted: \u201cPeople are making those decisions on a weekly basis.\u201d Though Vivian escaped destruction, it\u2019s closed indefinitely. In this case, luck is a relative thing. \u201cThe fact that our building is still standing has made it more complicated in terms of getting funding. No insurance company is being helpful to anyone in Asheville that I have heard of, and ours is being particularly nasty. Since we can\u2019t prove that the damage to the roof came from the storm, they won\u2019t cover that. They won\u2019t cover our losses. They\u2019ve completely denied us any of our claims.\u201d Without money for repairs and water, McGaughey is unsure of the future for his restaurant and staff. Kim Murray, co-owner of Creekside Taphouse, is in a similar situation as an independent restaurateur. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get any assistance, and we lost an entire month of revenue\u201d at the quaint neighborhood barbecue and beer joint. \u201cOur insurance claim was immediately denied, and we\u2019re in the process of trying to appeal that. We applied for a [Small Business Administration] disaster loan, and they told us there was no more money and there won\u2019t be any more funding until after the election.\u201d Creekside reopened on 24 October, but not with a full staff. Murray said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to bring back staff in order of their need, but it\u2019s a double-edged sword because I have no idea how much money they are going to be able to make.\u201d Bartender Capuchina Taylor has experienced the cut of that blade first hand. She works at North Carolina\u2019s oldest known gay bar, O.Henry\u2019s, which opened in 1976. Halloween is usually one of their busiest days of the year. But this year, she said, \u201cI probably made $80 on what would normally be over a $200 day. I can\u2019t make rent on $80 a shift.\u201d Her hourly wage is a mere $6 an hour, less than the state\u2019s minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Despite the drop in income, Taylor doesn\u2019t want to leave her post. \u201cI really love my job,\u201d she said.

None of those professions can go back to work yet [full time]. So customers have been tipping what they can, which is often less than normal.\u201d Now that she\u2019s back at work, she can\u2019t get unemployment. But unable to access Fema relief or other aid, she\u2019s depending on her credit card for day-to-day expenses, \u201cand that\u2019s not something I would ever do\u201d, she added. \u201cI\u2019m in an industry that was entirely stopped because of [hurricane impact],\u201d said Alex Nolan. After assisting in an Asheville location of beloved staple Mission Pizza, Helene forced Nolan to return to Winston-Salem, North Carolina. \u201cSimilar to how it was during Covid, the entire rug was pulled up from under me, and I\u2019m up shit\u2019s creek through no fault of my own.\u201d Nolan had built a life in Asheville, cooking for the celebrated restaurant Rhubarb for seven years before going to work for old friends at Mission Pizza.

But the focus quickly narrows to the hard human labour required to pick, pack and parcel out the contents of those containers to consumers across the US. We watch as scores of subdued workers board a bus, making their way to their shifts at JFK8. Outside the warehouse\u2019s inscrutably blank walls, on a wind-whipped approach road, a small group of union organisers hand out leaflets, chat to workers and huddle around braziers for warmth.</p> <p>During the depths of the Covid pandemic, Union\u2019s co-directors, Stephen Maing and Brett Story, heard about the efforts of this small crew to fight for better terms and conditions. The result is this intimately shot, sometimes almost claustrophobic film \u2013 the winner of a special jury prize at this year\u2019s Sundance film festival \u2013 that charts the rise of what became the Amazon Labor Union (ALU).</p>    <p>\u201cWe had an opportunity to watch from the ground up, this process of workers learning to become organisers, and what it took to manifest that,\u201d says Maing. \u201cIt was of great interest to get to feel what it was like: the exhaustion, the culture of fear that they were encountering, and then also, on the flip side, the determination that they were demonstrating to get this done.\u201d</p> <p>ALU leader Chris Smalls is the movie\u2019s charismatic lynchpin. Dismissed in 2020 after he led a walkout over health and safety during the pandemic, he devoted himself full-time to trying to organise his former Amazon colleagues.

      "bodyText": "As Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House in January, US trades unions are among the many constituencies bracing themselves for impact. Cheered on by Elon Musk, Trump is expected to gut public regulators \u2013 including the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which enforces unions\u2019 right to organise in America\u2019s workplaces. Musk, who rejects unions as creating \u201ca lords-and-peasants sort of thing\u201d, had already joined a legal claim, alongside Amazon founder and fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos, arguing the NLRB is \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and should be scrapped. It is against this bleak outlook for US labour activists that a new documentary, Union, opens in the UK this week. It follows the David and Goliath battle of a ragtag group of workers at Amazon\u2019s huge JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, to create a union from scratch, and force Bezos\u2019s retailing giant to the negotiating table. The film opens with footage of a vast cargo ship stacked high with shipping containers making its stately progress into the port of New York. But the focus quickly narrows to the hard human labour required to pick, pack and parcel out the contents of those containers to consumers across the US. We watch as scores of subdued workers board a bus, making their way to their shifts at JFK8. Outside the warehouse\u2019s inscrutably blank walls, on a wind-whipped approach road, a small group of union organisers hand out leaflets, chat to workers and huddle around braziers for warmth. During the depths of the Covid pandemic, Union\u2019s co-directors, Stephen Maing and Brett Story, heard about the efforts of this small crew to fight for better terms and conditions. The result is this intimately shot, sometimes almost claustrophobic film \u2013 the winner of a special jury prize at this year\u2019s Sundance film festival \u2013 that charts the rise of what became the Amazon Labor Union (ALU). \u201cWe had an opportunity to watch from the ground up, this process of workers learning to become organisers, and what it took to manifest that,\u201d says Maing. \u201cIt was of great interest to get to feel what it was like: the exhaustion, the culture of fear that they were encountering, and then also, on the flip side, the determination that they were demonstrating to get this done.\u201d ALU leader Chris Smalls is the movie\u2019s charismatic lynchpin. Dismissed in 2020 after he led a walkout over health and safety during the pandemic, he devoted himself full-time to trying to organise his former Amazon colleagues. Smalls hopes the ALU\u2019s experience \u2013 which saw them win a historic union recognition ballot in April 2022 \u2013 will be an inspiration to workers across the US and overseas. \u201cThe movie is only 90 minutes but I was out there for over 300 days, talking to workers,\u201d Smalls says. \u201cSo, of course, you build relationships, you earn the trust of your colleagues. And you know that this is a marathon, not a sprint. There\u2019s going to be days of setbacks and days of defeat, but if you guys just stick it out and band together, you\u2019ll be victorious.\u201d Smalls sees the US as the ground zero for many of the practices adopted by Amazon and other global corporations. \u201cWe\u2019re the country where billionaires thrive because they exploit the weak federal laws that we have, and there\u2019s no accountability,\u201d he says. \u201cBezos, Musk, all these billionaires are able to monopolise companies, exploit workers and get away with it. So, of course, they try to follow the same model in any country that they set up shop.\u201d Smalls spoke to the Guardian before the re-election of Donald Trump, but was already fearful about the impact of a second Trump term for low-paid workers. \u201cAll of the major unions have a sense that Musk and Trump are going to try to reverse the progress we made, and also change federal laws to set us back over 100 years,\u201d Smalls says. \u201cIt\u2019s a real threat, and I worry, but at the same time I\u2019m also hopeful, because no matter who\u2019s the president, we have to continue to organise no matter what. And the best thing we can do is prepare to be strike ready, because that\u2019s our only weapon to defend ourselves.\u201d Back outside JFK8, the film follows the ALU organisers as they gather signatures and chat to colleagues about their concerns over poor conditions and poverty wages. At home, Smalls talks tactics in Zoom calls as his children play in the background. The struggle is all-consuming. For its part, Amazon uses every weapon at its disposal, from calling the police to disperse ALU organisers from outside the building, to bussing in managers to brief workers about the risks of union membership. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the know, you vote no,\u201d say posters plastered around the site in the run-up to the vote. And the ALU organisers have to do most of their work from outside, whatever the weather \u2013 standing in the cold, handing out burgers, and at one point \u201cfree weed and pizza\u201d, to workers as they come on or off shift. All of this \u2013 bar the free weed \u2013 will be intensely familiar to veterans of a similar tussle with Amazon in Coventry, in the UK, where the GMB union narrowly lost a ballot in July that would have given them formal recognition in a first for the company in the UK.

Bernie Sanders, for one, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/bernie-sanders-democrats-election\">said</a> it was \u201cno great surprise that a Democratic party which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBernie\u2019s argument basically boils down to this: voters want someone who has the vibe of an outsider, who can direct the voters\u2019 anger against powerful people like billionaires and political elites,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cOtherwise, a racist demagogue will come along and fill the void by scapegoating vulnerable groups like migrants, which is exactly what Trump did.\u201d</p> <p>Meyers noted that Harris \u201cdid campaign on many pro-worker policies like raising the minimum wage, making it easier to unionize or taking on corporate price gouging. But now some Democrats are saying those policies may have been overshadowed by the decision to elevate Republicans like Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney.\u201d</p> <p>And some Democrats, such as the New York congressman Tom Suozzi, claim that the party is too beholden to the \u201cfar left\u201d and have begun supporting Republican transphobic talking points.</p> <p>\u201cTo anyone suggesting Democrats could win elections by throwing trans people under the bus, let me just say: fuck off,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cIf you\u2019re choosing this moment to scapegoat and demonize vulnerable people rather than aim your criticism at the powerful elites and moneyed interests who paved the way for the return of Trump and stand to benefit from his second term, you\u2019re way off.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvtCBMkFHS4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LvtCBMkFHS4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>On The Late Show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert\">Stephen Colbert</a> opened with a humorous story, as Wicked-themed dolls from Mattel are being pulled from stores after the company mistakenly listed a porn site on the packaging for the movie souvenir.

      "bodyText": "Late-night hosts talk Donald Trump\u2019s re-election as president, Democratic infighting and a promotion mishap for the new Wicked movie. The Daily Show In his first monologue since Donald Trump won both the electoral college and the popular vote in the US presidential election, Jon Stewart returned to The Daily Show shellshocked. \u201cIt turns out the election was stolen by more people voting for Donald Trump,\u201d he joked. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a caper. \u201cIt\u2019s a delight to hear about why it happened from so many people who were so wrong about what was going to happen,\u201d he added, referring to the rampant blame game among Democrats, as evidenced by several clips of pundits blaming the \u201cfar left\u201d. \u201cI only have one problem with the woke theory,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t recall seeing any Democrats running on woke shit. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget about Kamala Harris. It\u2019s not like she was exactly waving around her NPR tote bag,\u201d Stewart said ahead of a clip of the vice-president saying: \u201cI have a Glock.\u201d \u201cThey acted like Republicans for the last four months,\u201d Stewart bemoaned. \u201cThey wore camo hats and went to Cheney family reunions. Do you know how dangerous it is to wear a hunting hat around Cheney?! \u201cDemocrats were mostly running against an identity that was defined for them based on a couple of months of post-George Floyd, defund-the-police Instagram posts from four years ago,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat happened was the country felt like government wasn\u2019t working for them, and that the Democrats in particular were taking their hard-earned money and giving it to people who didn\u2019t deserve it as much as them. So the Democrats got shellacked. \u201cI\u2019m sure any robust examination of better policies is very welcome. But I just want to please assure people: this isn\u2019t forever,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThis is not the end. We have to regroup, and we have to continue to fight and continue to work day in and day out to create a better society for our children, for this world, for this country, that we know is possible. It\u2019s possible.\u201d Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers looked into how \u201cDemocrats are doing what they do best: turning on each other\u201d. Many liberal politicians have expressed their opinion on what went wrong this election. Bernie Sanders, for one, said it was \u201cno great surprise that a Democratic party which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them\u201d. \u201cBernie\u2019s argument basically boils down to this: voters want someone who has the vibe of an outsider, who can direct the voters\u2019 anger against powerful people like billionaires and political elites,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cOtherwise, a racist demagogue will come along and fill the void by scapegoating vulnerable groups like migrants, which is exactly what Trump did.\u201d Meyers noted that Harris \u201cdid campaign on many pro-worker policies like raising the minimum wage, making it easier to unionize or taking on corporate price gouging. But now some Democrats are saying those policies may have been overshadowed by the decision to elevate Republicans like Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney.\u201d And some Democrats, such as the New York congressman Tom Suozzi, claim that the party is too beholden to the \u201cfar left\u201d and have begun supporting Republican transphobic talking points. \u201cTo anyone suggesting Democrats could win elections by throwing trans people under the bus, let me just say: fuck off,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cIf you\u2019re choosing this moment to scapegoat and demonize vulnerable people rather than aim your criticism at the powerful elites and moneyed interests who paved the way for the return of Trump and stand to benefit from his second term, you\u2019re way off.\u201d Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert opened with a humorous story, as Wicked-themed dolls from Mattel are being pulled from stores after the company mistakenly listed a porn site on the packaging for the movie souvenir. Instead of printing the website for the movie, WickedMovie.com, the packages cited a different website with more than 6,000 scenes of \u201cwicked\u201d porn. Anyone who clicked on the offending link was directed to a page requiring users to be 18 years or older; those that clicked enter landed on a promotion page for the porn movie titled Kenzie Loves Girls 2. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have a lot of questions, but I\u2019ll just tell you right off: no, you do not have to have seen Kenzie Loves Girls 1 to understand the plot of Kenzie Loves Girls 2,\u201d Colbert joked. Mattel issued a press release apologizing for the \u201cunfortunate error\u201d and promised \u201cimmediate action to remedy this\u201d. \u201cAdding \u2018for a handy link to our full press release, please go to handyfullrelease.com. And we did it again, didn\u2019t we?\u2019\u201d Colbert joked. In political news, Trump announced his new chief of staff, Susie Wiles, who was also his 2024 campaign manager. \u201cSo she was the one who put Trump in a garbageman costume and had him dance to Ave Maria, and it worked, and I don\u2019t know what anything means anymore,\u201d said Colbert. Wiles \u201cmay not be the worst choice for this job \u2013 and not just because the worst choice was elected president\u201d, Colbert added, because during the campaign, Wiles reportedly worked to keep particularly divisive and fringe conservative figures out of Trump\u2019s orbit. \u201cFor instance, she lured Rudy Giuliani away from Trump using a bottle of cabernet dressed up as a sexy lady,\u201d he joked. Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel looked ahead to the transition of power. According to the Presidential Transition Enhancement Act, the incoming president has to sign a pledge saying he will avoid conflicts of interest and other ethical concerns while he\u2019s in office. \u201cWhich is hilarious,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking a bear to sign something promising to protect the salmon.\u201d Trump\u2019s team has missed multiple deadlines to sign this, dating back to September. \u201cOf course, he\u2019s being difficult about signing an ethics pledge because he\u2019s not going to behave ethically,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cThis is the White House version of Charlie Brown trying to kick the football.

      "body": "<p>Last week, Brig Gen Itzik Cohen, a senior IDF officer, quietly admitted what the international community has long been reluctant to acknowledge: that Israel is carrying out ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza, and deceiving the world about its true objectives in the besieged territory. He made the admission during a closed briefing to Israeli journalists last Tuesday regarding the army\u2019s activities in the north of the strip. Israel\u2019s forces, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/palestinians-will-not-be-allowed-to-return-to-homes-in-northern-gaza-says-idf\">he boasted</a>, were getting closer to the \u201ccomplete evacuation\u201d of Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya \u2013 Gaza\u2019s three northernmost cities, which have been under intense Israeli bombardment since early October. \u201cThere is no intention of allowing the residents of the northern Gaza Strip to return to their homes,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/editorial/2024-11-10/ty-article-opinion/netanyahus-ethnic-cleansing-is-on-display-for-all-to-see/00000193-12ac-d3a2-a3d7-5bed1d8d0000\">Cohen continued</a>, before adding that his \u201cclear orders\u201d were to \u201ccreate a cleansed space\u201d.</p> <p>The army hastened to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/idf-israel-military-no-return-remarks-north-gaza\">distance itself</a> from Cohen\u2019s comments after they garnered the attention of the international media: what may have sounded like war crimes, a spokesperson clarified, was merely a remark taken out of context. Yet what we see playing out on the ground in northern Gaza is exactly as Cohen described it: tens of thousands of civilians forced out of homes, shelters <a href=\"https://apnews.com/world-news/still-wrecked-from-past-israeli-raids-hospitals-in-northern-gaza-come-under-attack-again-00000192eebfd414a79fffbf88cc0000#\">and hospitals</a>, day after day, by airstrikes, artillery fire, quadcopter drones or armed battalions arriving at their door \u2013 who make sure to <a href=\"https://x.com/UNWateridge/status/1854242727480934704\">demolish</a> or <a href=\"https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1847980759262384246.html?utm_campaign=topunroll\">burn</a> whatever is left behind.</p> <p>Remaining residents are being starved; some are forced to survive on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnasAlSharif0/status/1853750948939628589\">salt and water</a> alone. With <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/more-families-stream-out-north-gaza-tanks-push-deeper-2024-11-07/\">no food entering</a> the besieged areas for more than a month, global food security experts <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/9/strong-likelihood-of-imminent-famine-in-north-gaza-food-security-experts\">have warned</a> of a \u201cstrong likelihood that famine is imminent\u201d.</p> <p>Israel claims its current operation in northern Gaza \u2013 resembling an <a href=\"https://www.972mag.com/exterminate-expel-resettle-israel-northern-gaza/\">even more brutal</a> version of the now infamous \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/israel-generals-plan-clear-north-gaza-palestinians\">generals\u2019 plan</a>\u201d \u2013 was launched to quell Hamas\u2019s attempts to re-establish a foothold in the area. The army is certainly encountering small pockets of Hamas fighters, and <a href=\"https://www.idf.il/59780?firstName=&amp;lastName=&amp;city=&amp;unit=&amp;startDate=5%2F10%2F2024&amp;endDate=11%2F11%2F2024\">sustaining losses</a> in the process. Yet senior defence officials <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-10-13/ty-article/.premium/israeli-defense-officials-govt-pushing-aside-hostage-deal-eyeing-gaza-annexation/00000192-8585-d988-a3ba-dde59a470000\">told Israel\u2019s Haaretz</a> newspaper soon after the campaign began that the political echelon was pushing for a different goal altogether: annexation.</p> <p>A second high-profile admission last week, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/05/benjamin-netanyahu-fires-israeli-defence-minister-yoav-gallant\">Israel\u2019s outgoing defence minister</a>, appeared to confirm this. Yoav Gallant, who had been unceremoniously fired two days earlier by Benjamin Netanyahu, made use of his final hours in office to have a frank discussion with some of the families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza. In comments that received less international media attention than those of Cohen, Gallant <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-firing-gallant-tells-hostage-families-netanyahu-needlessly-keeping-troops-in-gaza/\">reportedly stated</a> that there was no military justification for continuing the war or keeping Israeli forces inside the strip. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left in Gaza to do,\u201d he told the families. \u201cThe major [objectives] have been achieved. I fear we are staying there just because there is a desire to stay there.\u201d</p> <p>That desire, it seems, is getting stronger by the day among a growing segment of the Israeli right who see this as a moment of redemption. With northern Gaza cleansed of its Palestinian inhabitants, Israeli settlers \u2013 including the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=430705303386981\">hidden architects</a> of the generals\u2019 plan \u2013 will be able to do what they have been dreaming about since Israel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/22/israel1\">\u201cdisengagement\u201d from the occupied territory</a> in 2005, and baying for since the <a href=\"https://timeout.co.il/%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97%D7%99-%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%94-%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A8-%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94/\">very first days</a> of the current war: re-establish Jewish settlements in the territory. Indeed, they already have the plans <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/this-is-our-land-we-deserve-it-dozens-of-israelis-planning-to-cross-border-and-settle-in-gaza-13238436\">drawn up</a>. </p>    <p>This, of course, is not official Israeli policy \u2013 at least not yet. But last week\u2019s statements by Cohen and Gallant certainly provide strong indications that it is where we\u2019re heading. Another indication came in the form of the two additional far-right ministers <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/official-confirms-far-right-minister-wasserlauf-joining-security-cabinet-as-observer/\">invited to join</a> Israel\u2019s security cabinet at the start of this week: <a href=\"https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/politics/article/16756960\">Orit Strook</a>, the minister of settlements and national missions, and Yitzhak Wasserlauf, the minister for the development of the periphery, the Negev and the Galilee. If you were looking for the Knesset members best positioned to advise on the settlement of Gaza, these would be your go-to candidates.</p> <p>And, as Israel <a href=\"https://x.com/yoavzitun/status/1855299597138096182?s=46&amp;t=9dWa0HpIDFVxB1s0g6EsfA\">continues its preparations</a> to make this a reality, the final piece of the puzzle may have just fallen into place. The return to the White House of Donald Trump, whose previous tenure was marked by the renunciation of longstanding US and international consensus positions on Israel-Palestine, puts American support for Israeli annexation of northern Gaza firmly on the table. Whether it\u2019s in the context of a <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/ex-envoy-says-trump-aims-to-weaken-iran-deal-of-the-century-likely-back-on-table/\">revamped</a> \u201cdeal of the century\u201d or a less grandiose agreement whereby Netanyahu gets what he wants in exchange for \u201cwinding down\u201d hostilities in the south of the strip, a permanent Israeli seizure of at least part of the territory appears dangerously imminent.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Bezalel Smotrich, Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, announced that he has his <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/far-right-minister-calls-israeli-sovereignty-west-bank-2025-2024-11-11/\">sights set</a> on an even bigger prize: sovereignty over the West Bank within the forthcoming year. Under the shadow of war, he has already made <a href=\"https://www.yesh-din.org/en/the-quiet-overhaul-changing-the-nature-of-israeli-control-in-the-west-bank-analysis-of-israels-37th-governments-annexation-policy-and-its-ramifications/\">significant strides</a> towards this goal, building on the settler movement\u2019s successes of <a href=\"https://www.972mag.com/settlements-roads-infrastructure-smotrich/\">years gone by</a>.

International courts are unable to keep pace with the carnage on the ground, while a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/29/white-house-israel-rafah-red-line\">series</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/15/us-israel-weapons-gaza-aid-letter\">empty threats</a> from Washington has further emboldened Israel\u2019s far-right government and its base, who will be <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-pm-netanyahu-appoints-new-ambassador-united-states-2024-11-08/\">feeling invincible</a> after Trump\u2019s victory.</p> <p>The president-elect, erratic as he is, may yet be swayed in a <a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/11/saudi-hosted-summit-says-mideast-peace-requires-end-israeli-occupation\">different direction</a> by his <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/less-privileged-personal-how-u-s-saudi-ties-may-soon-n1247439\">Saudi confidants</a>, or the outgoing Biden administration could take a decisive parting swing at Israel in its final weeks.

      "bodyText": "Last week, Brig Gen Itzik Cohen, a senior IDF officer, quietly admitted what the international community has long been reluctant to acknowledge: that Israel is carrying out ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza, and deceiving the world about its true objectives in the besieged territory. He made the admission during a closed briefing to Israeli journalists last Tuesday regarding the army\u2019s activities in the north of the strip. Israel\u2019s forces, he boasted, were getting closer to the \u201ccomplete evacuation\u201d of Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya \u2013 Gaza\u2019s three northernmost cities, which have been under intense Israeli bombardment since early October. \u201cThere is no intention of allowing the residents of the northern Gaza Strip to return to their homes,\u201d Cohen continued, before adding that his \u201cclear orders\u201d were to \u201ccreate a cleansed space\u201d. The army hastened to distance itself from Cohen\u2019s comments after they garnered the attention of the international media: what may have sounded like war crimes, a spokesperson clarified, was merely a remark taken out of context. Yet what we see playing out on the ground in northern Gaza is exactly as Cohen described it: tens of thousands of civilians forced out of homes, shelters and hospitals, day after day, by airstrikes, artillery fire, quadcopter drones or armed battalions arriving at their door \u2013 who make sure to demolish or burn whatever is left behind. Remaining residents are being starved; some are forced to survive on salt and water alone. With no food entering the besieged areas for more than a month, global food security experts have warned of a \u201cstrong likelihood that famine is imminent\u201d. Israel claims its current operation in northern Gaza \u2013 resembling an even more brutal version of the now infamous \u201cgenerals\u2019 plan\u201d \u2013 was launched to quell Hamas\u2019s attempts to re-establish a foothold in the area. The army is certainly encountering small pockets of Hamas fighters, and sustaining losses in the process. Yet senior defence officials told Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper soon after the campaign began that the political echelon was pushing for a different goal altogether: annexation. A second high-profile admission last week, by Israel\u2019s outgoing defence minister, appeared to confirm this. Yoav Gallant, who had been unceremoniously fired two days earlier by Benjamin Netanyahu, made use of his final hours in office to have a frank discussion with some of the families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza. In comments that received less international media attention than those of Cohen, Gallant reportedly stated that there was no military justification for continuing the war or keeping Israeli forces inside the strip. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left in Gaza to do,\u201d he told the families. \u201cThe major [objectives] have been achieved. I fear we are staying there just because there is a desire to stay there.\u201d That desire, it seems, is getting stronger by the day among a growing segment of the Israeli right who see this as a moment of redemption. With northern Gaza cleansed of its Palestinian inhabitants, Israeli settlers \u2013 including the hidden architects of the generals\u2019 plan \u2013 will be able to do what they have been dreaming about since Israel\u2019s \u201cdisengagement\u201d from the occupied territory in 2005, and baying for since the very first days of the current war: re-establish Jewish settlements in the territory. Indeed, they already have the plans drawn up. This, of course, is not official Israeli policy \u2013 at least not yet. But last week\u2019s statements by Cohen and Gallant certainly provide strong indications that it is where we\u2019re heading. Another indication came in the form of the two additional far-right ministers invited to join Israel\u2019s security cabinet at the start of this week: Orit Strook, the minister of settlements and national missions, and Yitzhak Wasserlauf, the minister for the development of the periphery, the Negev and the Galilee. If you were looking for the Knesset members best positioned to advise on the settlement of Gaza, these would be your go-to candidates. And, as Israel continues its preparations to make this a reality, the final piece of the puzzle may have just fallen into place. The return to the White House of Donald Trump, whose previous tenure was marked by the renunciation of longstanding US and international consensus positions on Israel-Palestine, puts American support for Israeli annexation of northern Gaza firmly on the table. Whether it\u2019s in the context of a revamped \u201cdeal of the century\u201d or a less grandiose agreement whereby Netanyahu gets what he wants in exchange for \u201cwinding down\u201d hostilities in the south of the strip, a permanent Israeli seizure of at least part of the territory appears dangerously imminent. Meanwhile, Bezalel Smotrich, Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, announced that he has his sights set on an even bigger prize: sovereignty over the West Bank within the forthcoming year. Under the shadow of war, he has already made significant strides towards this goal, building on the settler movement\u2019s successes of years gone by. Who\u2019s to say Trump won\u2019t oblige him? For more than a year, international pressure has failed to put the brakes on Israel\u2019s crazed onslaught on Gaza, which many experts have termed a genocide. International courts are unable to keep pace with the carnage on the ground, while a series of empty threats from Washington has further emboldened Israel\u2019s far-right government and its base, who will be feeling invincible after Trump\u2019s victory. The president-elect, erratic as he is, may yet be swayed in a different direction by his Saudi confidants, or the outgoing Biden administration could take a decisive parting swing at Israel in its final weeks. But with the probability of both scenarios appearing remote, it is up to the rest of the international community to bring real pressure to bear against Israel in the form of arms embargos and comprehensive sanctions. For more than 43,000 Palestinians killed so far by Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza, which may be a significant undercount, it\u2019s already too late \u2013 but countless more lives depend on it.

DeSmog and the Climate Investigations Center previously found that the Air Pollution Foundation underwrote the earliest studies on CO2 conducted in 1955 and 1956 by renowned climate scientist Charles David Keeling, paving the way for his groundbreaking \u201cKeeling Curve,\u201d which charts how fossil fuels cause an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Other earlier investigations have found that major fossil companies spent decades conducting their own research into the consequences of burning coal, oil and gas. One 2023 study found that Exxon scientists made \u201cbreathtakingly\u201d accurate predictions of global heating in the 1970s and 1980s, only to then spend decades sowing doubt about climate science. The newly unearthed documents come from the Caltech archives, the US National Archives, the University of California at San Diego, the State University of New York Buffalo archives and Los Angeles newspapers from the 1950s. The Western States Petroleum Association and the American Petroleum Institute, the top US fossil fuels lobby group, did not respond to requests for comment.",

Grocery prices rose by 2.3% year-on-year, up from 2% in September \u201cbut still within typical levels,\u201d according to retail analysts Kantar. The rate has been below 3% every month since the early summer. The UK\u2019s jobs market has shown further signs of cooling after a rise in unemployment in September while pay growth slowed, as business leaders warned the budget could hit hiring demand and lead to higher prices. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the rate of unemployment rose to 4.3% in the three months to September, up from 4% the previous quarter, amid broader signs of a slowdown in the jobs market. While the ONS warned its jobs market figures should be treated with caution amid data collection issues, separate figures showed the number of employees on company payrolls fell by 9,000 over the quarter and vacancies fell for a 28th consecutive month to the lowest level since May 2021. Our other main stories today: Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Bye! \u2013 JK In a boost to UK life sciences, the Swiss drugmaker Sandoz has just opened a \u00a310m device development lab in Cambridge to work on pen injectors, autoinjectors, on-body devices, inhalers, nasal and ophthalmic sprays. The company, which specialises in generic drugs (cheap copies of drugs that have come off patent) and is the largest generic drugmaker in the world, employs 45 scientists at the site and is in the process of hiring 15 more by early next year, with more recruitment planned later in 2025. Its UK headquarters is in Camberley in Surrey, where around 170 people. The firm is also opening a \u00a3100m factory in Slovenia and is pursuing investments in Austria. Richard Saynor, the Sandoz chief executive, and Baroness Gillian Merron, health minister responsible for life sciences and innovation, have opened the device development centre in Cambridge. Merron said Biosimilar medicines and generic medicines deliver huge cost savings to the NHS and taxpayer, freeing up funds for frontline patient care. The Sandoz expansion is a vote of confidence in the UK\u2019s world-leading life sciences sector, boosting economic growth, delivering a raft of new, affordable treatments and improving the resilience of our supply chains. I\u2019ve just been on a media call with AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot. AstraZeneca\u2019s China president Leon Wang, who was detained last month by Chinese authorities, is in touch with a lawyer but the company has \u201cvery little information\u201d about the investigation, according to the drugmaker\u2019s chief executive. He spoke after the company released third-quarter results. \u201cWe are in the early stage and we don\u2019t have all the detailed information that will enable us to draw conclusions as it relates to what happened,\u201d said Soriot. \u201cIn fact we have very little information\u201d about Wang\u2019s case and the company has not been approached by the Chinese government about it, he added. Asked about oversight of its operations in China, Soriot said the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker had 18,000 employees in China. You really cannot police 18,000 people from headquarters. The company later clarified that it has just over 16,000 employees in China. Shell has won its appeal against a landmark climate judgment by a Dutch court, which in 2021 ordered the fossil fuel company to sharply reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. A court of appeal ruled on Tuesday that, while Shell does have a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to cut its emissions as a big oil company, this would not be achieved by imposing a specific legal goal. Shell had appealed against a lower court ruling in 2021 that it must cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels. It was the first such ruling against a company in the world. Shell\u2019s chief executive, Wael Sawan, welcomed the appeal decision, saying it was \u201cthe right one for the global energy transition, the Netherlands and our company\u201d. The oil cartel Opec has cut its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2024 and also lowered its projection for next year \u2013 its fourth consecutive downgrade. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said in its monthly report that world oil demand will rise by 1.82m barrels per day (bpd) this year, down from growth of 1.93m bpd it forecast last month. There is a wide range of forecasts for the strength of demand growth in 2024, partly due to differences over demand from China and the pace of the world\u2019s switch to cleaner fuels. Opec is still at the top end of industry estimates after the revision. The oil cartel also cut its global demand growth estimate for next year to 1.54m bpd, from 1.64 million bpd. The UK can strike a US trade deal with Donald Trump while also rebuilding EU relations after Brexit to cement its status as a \u201cbeacon of stability\u201d in an increasingly volatile world, a leading economist has said. Andy Haldane, the former Bank of England chief economist, said Keir Starmer\u2019s government could show the UK was \u201copen for business at a time when so much else of the world is looking inward \u2013 whether to the EU, or the US, it could really pay dividends\u201d. After Trump\u2019s election victory the prime minister has faced competing demands urging him to pick a side in trade talks with Washington and Brussels, just as he had begun a push to mend fences with Europe.However, Haldane suggested the UK government could have both with a trade policy straddling the Atlantic. \u201cI hope the government is in a position to really pat its head and rub its tummy at the moment,\u201d he told the Guardian. Of course we should pursue energetically an improved deal with the EU, although that won\u2019t be straightforward. The new government committed to that and should keep on committing to that. That should not, though, preclude \u2013 and does not preclude, as difficult as it will be \u2013 seeking out a free trade arrangement with the US under a new Trump presidency. Metro Bank has been fined nearly \u00a317m by the UK\u2019s financial watchdog for failings in its money-laundering controls over four years. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued the \u00a316.7m penalty after finding failures in monitoring 60m transactions over a four-year period that risked a \u201cgap being left in the defence against the criminal use of the financial system\u201d. Problems persisted despite being raised by junior employees three years before they were completely resolved, the regulator said. Metro said it accepted the FCA\u2019s findings and had since resolved the monitoring system failings and enhanced its processes. The challenger bank, which has 76 branches and 2.7 million customers, launched in the UK in 2010 as the first high street bank to open in more than 100 years. From June 2016, Metro automated the monitoring of customer transactions for potential financial crime. Shares in the Irish support services firm DCC jumped after the company laid out plans for a break-up of the business to focus on its energy division. DCC, which is headquartered in Dublin but listed on the FTSE 100 in London, hopes to capitalise on opportunities in energy transition such as biofuels, and announced plans to sell its healthcare division by 2025 and evaluate strategic options for its technology arm over the next two years. The shares soared by 17% and are now trading 13.3% higher. Donal Murphy, the chief executive, said: We are announcing decisive actions today to simplify our group, pursue our largest growth and returns opportunity and unlock substantial shareholder value, from positions of strength. This aligns with our philosophy of disciplined capital allocation. In the energy sector we are building a unique, multi-energy, sustainable business focused on supporting our customers with their energy transition. Our strategy will deliver strong profit growth, high returns and a significant reduction in our customers carbon emissions. Our healthcare and technology divisions have a long and successful heritage in DCC. They are high-quality businesses, led by strong, entrepreneurial management teams. Our actions are designed to ensure that these businesses and our people have the best opportunity to grow and progress. The finance boss of Vodafone has assured customers that they will not experience price rises as a result of its proposed merger with Three, which could be completed next year. Speaking to journalists after it published its half year results, Margherita Della Valle, chief financial officer at the telecoms company, said its pricing strategy would not change after the merger. The comments come after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said last week that the deal could be pro-competitive if the pair pledged to continue the roll-out of 5G and put in place some short-term price commitments. Della Valle said that the companies had made a decision to freeze all packages under 20 gigabytes for the next three years, if the deal goes ahead. She said: The merger is pro-competitive because we create a third scale operator that can compete with the big two (BT/EE and Virgin Media O2) already in the market. Going forward, there will be more competition because there will be a third scale network capable of competing with these two. The competition watchdog will now make its final decision on whether the merger can go ahead on 7 December, with the two companies expecting to complete the merger in early 2025 if given the green light. The enlarged group would serve about 27 million customers. Della Valle also said the merger would create between 8,000 and 12,000 jobs in the UK, with some of this offset by job cuts due to synergies of roles after the merger. The comments came as the London-listed company saw revenues hit \u20ac15.1bn (\u00a312.5bn) for the first half of the year, up 1.7% on last year\u2019s figure. This came despite revenues falling in Germany, its biggest market. AstraZeneca\u2019s chief executive has said that the drugmaker is taking investigations by Chinese authorities into its business in the country \u201cvery seriously\u201d and will \u201cfully co-operate\u201d with them. Authorities are thought to be investigating the importation of two AstraZeneca cancer treatments into China. Pascal Soriot\u2019s remarks came as Britain\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company lifted its 2024 revenue and profit forecasts, and announced it was spending $3.5bn on research &amp; development and manufacturing of cancer and other drugs in the United States, in its biggest investment in at least a decade. The company\u2019s share price has fallen over the past fortnight, since it announced that its China president, Leon Wang, who was executive vice president for internatinal market, was standing back because he is under investigation by Chinese authorities. Alongside Wang, two former and two current executives have also been detained over allegations of illegally importing oncology medicines. AstraZeneca\u2019s China business is now being run by Michael Lai, the general manager. Chinese authorities are understood to be investigating the importation of AstraZeneca\u2019s cancer drug Imjudo, which has not been approved for sale in China, as well as shipments of Enhertu between Hong Kong and China. Enhertu is another cancer treatment that was first licensed in Hong Kong and then in China. The investigations concern the five individuals, and not the company itself. Soriot said: We take the matters in China very seriously. If requested we will fully cooperate with the authorities. We remain committed to delivering innovative life-changing medicines to patients in China. There has been a wider crackdown by Beijing on drugmakers and hospitals in recent years as part of an anti-corruption campaign, aimed at bringing rising medical spending under control. AstraZeneca reported a 21% rise in revenues to $13.6bn between July and September, catapulting pre-tax profit 24% higher to $1.8bn, stripping out currency moves. Here is our full story the UK job market: The UK\u2019s jobs market has shown further signs of cooling after a rise in unemployment in September while pay growth slowed. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the rate of unemployment rose to 4.3% in the three months to September, up from 4% the previous quarter. While the ONS warned its jobs market figures should be treated with caution amid data collection issues, there were broader signs of a slowdown from separate figures showing the number of employees on company payrolls fell by 9,000 over the quarter. Vacancies also fell for a 28th consecutive month to the lowest level since May 2021. The government has come under pressure from businesses after outlining tax increases in the budget, including a rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) that bosses have said could lead to job cuts. And here\u2019s some instant analysis from our outgoing economics editor Larry Elliott: For the past few years only cursory attention has been paid to the unemployment figures because the jobless rate has been low and there have been plenty of unfilled vacancies for those seeking work. But, thanks to a slowing economy and decisions made by Rachel Reeves in last month\u2019s budget, that could be about to change. For the next few months every release on the state of the labour market will be scrutinised to see what impact two announcements made by Reeves last month are having on jobs. Inevitably, the chancellor\u2019s decision to increase the national minimum wage by 6.7% and increase employer national insurance contributions will have some effect but it will take months to assess how big those effects will be. Grocery price inflation in the UK picked up in October, while supermarket sales hit their highest level so far this year, as shoppers started their Christmas shopping early, buying mince pies and Christmas cake. Grocery prices rose by 2.3% year-on-year, up from 2% in September \u201cbut still within typical levels,\u201d according to retail analysts Kantar. The rate has been below 3% every month since the early summer. Promotional activity by the grocers is helping to keep prices down. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: Spending on deals has been going up consistently for the past 18 months and it now makes up 28.6% of all sales. Offers are helping to lift branded sales especially. The growth gap between brands and own-label is the biggest it\u2019s been since February 2021, sitting at 4.9% and 2.7% apiece. Take-home sales at the big supermarket chains and other grocers increased by 2.3% over the four weeks to 3 November to reach \u00a311.6bn, making this the biggest sales month of the year so far. Christmas came early, with 14.4% of households picking up mince pies in October while 648,000 shoppers have already bought a Christmas cake. Halloween also boosted sales. McKevitt said: Many of us got into the spooky spirit last month, as 3.2m households bought at least one pumpkin. Confectionery spending also got a boost to \u00a3525m in October as sales of chocolates and sweets both went up, climbing by 13% and 7% each. Trips to the supermarket hit a four-year high at 480m, the highest since before the pandemic. Ocado topped the growth table, boosting its sales by 9.5% over the 12 weeks to 3 November, while the two largest supermarkets in Britain \u2013 Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 also outperformed the wider market. Asda continued to struggle, with sales down 5.5% while the Co-op\u2019s sales fell by 2.1%. Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, said: 2.8 million people \u2013 a near record number are locked out of work due to poor health. This is bad for people, bad for businesses and it\u2019s holding our economy back. That\u2019s why our Get Britain Working plan will bring forward the biggest reforms to employment support in a generation, backed by an additional \u00a3240m of investment. And while it\u2019s encouraging to see real pay growth this month, more needs to be done to improve living standards too. So, from April next year over three million of the lowest paid workers will benefit from our increase to the National Living Wage, delivering a \u00a31,400 a year pay rise for a full-time worker. Responding to the news that unemployment has risen to 4.3%, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said: Any rise in unemployment is concerning and many will be worried about the impact of the upcoming National Insurance hike on British jobs. Small businesses have been clobbered by years of Conservative economic vandalism and the government\u2019s jobs tax could now make it even harder to hire new staff and give out pay rises. Jobs and salaries could be in for yet another hit and that\u2019s just not fair. The new government should be supporting our small businesses, not placing more financial pressures on them. Ministers must change course, starting by exempting GPs and social care providers from the National Insurance hike. The job market figures come after the government set out tax increases in the budget, including a rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) which business leaders say could hit hiring and pay increases. Paul Daley at Capital Economics added: Even though the rise in pay growth in September will probably be followed by a bigger gain in October, as the new public sector pay deals start, the easing in private sector regular pay suggests that the Bank of England will continue to cut interest rates gradually. We continue to think the Bank will skip the December meeting and cut rates at the following February meeting. Public sector pay will probably jump again in October as the 5-6% pay deals agreed in recent months start to take effect\u2026 Most important for the Bank, was that private sector earnings excluding bonuses was stable at 4.8% in September. That left it exactly in line with the rate the Bank forecast last week. Gora Suri, an economist at PwC UK, said: The labour market continues to loosen, with vacancies dropping further, though still slightly above pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate also ticked up slightly to 4.3%. But wage growth is proving to be a little more persistent. Annual growth in employee\u2019s total earnings is up to 4.3%, reflecting the civil service one-off payments made in the summer. Despite a loosening labour market, nominal pay growth remains in excess of the circa 3% level that is considered to be consistent with the Bank\u2019s 2% inflation target. Real pay continues to grow given that inflationary pressures have fallen back at a faster pace than wage growth. Looking ahead, businesses are likely to face increasing cost pressures. Almost simultaneously, they have been hit with a trifecta of policy changes which raise their costs - an increase in employer NICs, a rise in the National Living Wage and the Employment Rights Bill. If businesses pass some of this onto workers, this could weigh on pay growth in the short to medium term. Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s said last week that the NIC rise would cost them \u00a3100m and \u00a3140m respectively as they warned they could pass these costs on in the form of higher prices, while Tesco faces a \u00a31bn increase in its national insurance bill this parliament. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Unemployment in the UK has gone up, while regular wage growth slowed to the lowest rate in more than two years, according to official figures. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% between July and September, up from 4% in the June to August quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics, which warned that the job market figures should be treated with caution due to data collection issues. Pay excluding bonuses climbed by 4.8% year-on-year, the lowest since June 2022. Including bonuses, wage growth picked up to 4.3% from 3.8%, although this was affected by one-off payments made to the civil service last summer. Liz McKeown, the ONS\u2019s director of economic statistics, said: Growth in pay excluding bonuses eased again this month to its lowest rate in over two years. Pay growth including bonuses increased, but for recent periods these figures have been affected by last year\u2019s one-off payments made to public sector workers. Job vacancies have fallen again, as they have been doing for more than two years now. However, the total still remains a little above where it was before the pandemic. The number of job vacancies fell to its lowest level since May 2021, down by by 35,000 on the quarter to 831,000 between August and October. The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.2806, the lowest since mid-August, after the figures were released. Paul Daley, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: Overall, there is little here to suggest the Bank of England needs to worry that the loosening in the labour market and the easing in underlying wage growth are coming to an end. Asian shares tumbled amid disappointment over Beijing\u2019s latest economic stimulus package, and as investors worried about president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policies. Meanwhile, bitcoin jumped to a new high of more than $89,000. The Shanghai market lost 1.3% while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng slid by 3%. The price of bitcoin, the world\u2019s best-known cryptocurrency, has more than doubled from $37,000 a year ago, as markets are expecting lighter regulation of crypto currencies under a Trump administration. Bitcoin touched $89,982 and is now trading around $89,300. The Agenda 11am GMT: Eurozone/Germany ZEW economic sentiment index",

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca\u2019s chief executive has said it is taking investigations by Chinese authorities into its business in the country \u201cvery seriously\u201d and insisted it is committed to China in the long run. Authorities are thought to be investigating the importation of two cancer treatments manufactured by Britain\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company into China. Pascal Soriot, the AstraZeneca chief executive, said: \u201cWe take the matters in China very seriously. If requested, we will fully cooperate with the authorities.\u201d Soriot, Britain\u2019s best-paid boss of a FTSE 100 company, who is in line for an \u00a318.7m package this year, denied there had been a lack of oversight by headquarters, but conceded that in a large workforce of more than 16,000 in China \u201cunfortunately some will be tempted\u201d to maximise sales. AstraZeneca has strengthened its 200-plus compliance team in the country, introducing field-based compliance officers, and uses artificial intelligence to scrutinise sales staff\u2019s expense reports to identify any misbehaviour, he said. \u201cWe are at a very early stage,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have very little information because we haven\u2019t been approached as a company so far. We remain very committed to China, we are in China for the long run, it\u2019s a very important market for us\u201d as it has \u201ca lot of patients\u201d and an \u201cimportant part of innovation in the industry,\u201d referring to research &amp; development of new drugs. The company still plans to build a $450m factory in the country. Batting off suggestions of a potential spin-off of the China division, Soriot said: \u201cI don\u2019t think we have anything to regret. We never said we wanted to spin off the business in China.\u201d The company\u2019s share price has fallen over the past fortnight, since it announced that its China president, Leon Wang, who was executive vice-president for international, was stepping back because he is under investigation by Chinese authorities. Alongside Wang, two former and two current executives have also been detained over allegations of illegally importing oncology medicines. AstraZeneca\u2019s China business is now being run by Michael Lai, the general manager. Chinese authorities are thought to be investigating the importation of AstraZeneca\u2019s cancer drug Imjudo, which has not been approved for sale in China, as well as shipments of Enhertu between Hong Kong and the mainland. Enhertu is another cancer treatment, which was first licensed in Hong Kong and then in mainland China. Sources said shipments may have been made from Hong Kong before it was approved on the mainland. The investigations concern the five individuals, and not the company itself. There has been a wider crackdown by Beijing on international drugmakers and hospitals in recent years as part of an anti-corruption campaign, aimed at bringing rising medical spending under control. AstraZeneca\u2019s market value fell by \u00a314bn in a single day a week ago after a report that dozens of senior executives at its China unit could be implicated in an insurance fraud case in the country\u2019s pharmaceutical sector. This relates to a separate issue dating back to 2021. AstraZeneca said that \u201cto the best of the company\u2019s knowledge, the investigations include allegations of medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation and personal information breaches\u201d. Soriot\u2019s remarks came as AstraZeneca lifted its 2024 revenue and profit forecasts, and announced it was spending $3.5bn (\u00a32.7bn) on research and development and manufacturing of cancer and other drugs in the US, its biggest investment globally in at least a decade. The company reported a 21% rise in revenues to $13.6bn between July and September, catapulting pre-tax profit 24% higher to $1.8bn, stripping out currency moves. In China, sales grew by 15% to $1.7bn in the third quarter. The drugmaker now expects 2024 revenues and core earnings a share to increase by a high teens percentage. Revenues in the US, its biggest market, climbed by 23% to $6bn \u2013 44% of the company\u2019s total sales. The company is still in negotiations with the UK government over expanding its vaccine site in Speke, near Liverpool, with talks centring on the amount of Treasury funding. Soriot said another issue, also raised by other industry leaders, was access to new medicines on the NHS. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think your products are going to be reimbursed and used by patients, of course it\u2019s a less attractive environment.\u201d",

Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the rate of unemployment rose to 4.3% in the three months to September, up from 4% the previous quarter, amid broader signs of a slowdown in the jobs market. While the ONS said its jobs market figures should be treated with caution amid data collection issues, separate figures showed the number of employees on company payrolls fell by 9,000 over the quarter and vacancies fell for a 28th consecutive month to the lowest level since May 2021. The government has come under pressure from businesses after outlining tax increases in the budget, including a rise in the national minimum wage and employer national insurance contributions (NICs) that bosses have said could lead to job cuts. Trade groups said the latest figures showed the jobs market was slowing as companies braced for higher costs. \u201cMany firms are telling us they are being forced to raise prices, put recruitment and investment plans on hold and look for ways to reduce their costs,\u201d said Jane Gratton, the deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce. \u201cThere is a limit to how much additional cost they can absorb.\u201d Matthew Percival, of the CBI lobby group, said: \u201cThese figures come against a backdrop of rising concern about spiralling employment costs which are set to increase after last month\u2019s NICs rise, the employment rights bill and the latest increase in the national living wage.\u201d Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s last week said the tax rise would cost them \u00a3100m and \u00a3140m respectively as they said they could pass these costs on in the form of higher prices, while Tesco faces a \u00a31bn increase in its national insurance bill this parliament.

      "body": "<p>\u2018I was a risk when they hired me,\u201d smiles Emma Pinchbeck. The chief executive of Energy UK, the voice of the industry, is hours away from a black-tie awards event that will serve as her unofficial leaving do. After almost five years in the role, she will join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/09/energy-industry-trade-body-chief-to-head-uks-climate-watchdog\">the government\u2019s climate watchdog</a>, the Climate Change Committee, in a matter of&nbsp;days.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty funny to remind people of this now, but I was an untested risk. I don\u2019t think back in 2019 if you\u2019d said to the energy industry, \u2018who would you want as a spokesperson for the sector in a time of crisis?\u2019 that they\u2019d necessarily have chosen someone like me.\u201d</p> <p>Pinchbeck was approached for the job when her first child was still a newborn. The former head of climate policy at WWF had stood out in her role as the deputy chief executive of trade group RenewableUK for her outspoken advocacy of Britain\u2019s low-carbon agenda. Understandably, a large part of the interview process focused on whether she could be a good fit advocating for companies with fossil fuel interests, too.</p> <p>\u201cAnd not once in five years has it been a problem,\u201d says Pinchbeck. While there may have been disagreements about the bolder elements of the government\u2019s net zero plan in the early days of her tenure, these were settled years ago. Today, the shift to cleaner energy is less about a green ideology than an economic opportunity.</p> <p>It is unclear whether that message will endure in the US, where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-us-presidential-election\">re-election of Donald Trump</a> has already created jitters for renewables developers across the globe. Pinchbeck is hopeful. \u201cThe US has grown to be one of the biggest markets in the world for things like batteries and onshore wind, and a lot of that happened under the last Trump presidency. One of the fastest-growing professions in the US was windfarm technician.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing that I\u2019m closely watching is the Inflation Reduction Act. It was really delivering in a lot of industrialised states \u2013 in red states \u2013 and helped to establish factories and jobs. It\u2019s possible that there won\u2019t be too much change because these policies are bluntly useful for the narrative that the Trump campaign has led on \u2013 improving the economy and improving domestic industry. As ever in politics, you have to distinguish the noise from what will actually happen, and it is genuinely too early to tell.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>We need an enduring solution for people\u2019s energy bills: there are 99 good ideas the government could be thinking about</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pinchbeck is confident the economic arguments on the shift to renewable energy will win. \u201cI hardly ever talk about climate change and emissions in this job. We just call it economics,\u201d she says.</p> <p>So perhaps choosing a relative outsider to lead this change was a prescient move by Energy UK? \u201cThe board \u2026 felt strongly that energy was really important to the economy but was often overlooked or treated as a political toy. But they also understood that net zero was coming and that the whole sector was changing. So the question was, could I change what we were about, and what we were for? Could I make energy more politically resonant?\u201d</p> <p>Pinchbeck has managed exactly that, according to industry veterans. Whereas Energy UK was once seen as a staid, somewhat defensive voice for the former \u201cbig six\u201d energy companies, they say it now reflects an industry alive with green ambition.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re noisier than we used to be,\u201d Pinchbeck says. \u201cWe are more relevant, too. We\u2019re in more rooms, having more serious conversations with more serious people than we were five years ago. But it would just be flattering my ego to believe that I\u2019ve had anything to do with energy being so much in the news.\u201d</p> <p>Months after she took up the role, the world was plunged into the pandemic, forcing people into their homes and driving up energy bills. However, energy market prices tumbled, in a blow to the country\u2019s power generators. When market prices stormed back after the reopening of major economies, the UK\u2019s energy companies faced fresh peril: surging costs caused scores of them to collapse into administration, leaving millions of homes in flux.</p> <p>The suppliers that survived faced further price rises when Russia cut gas supplies to Europe as it invaded Ukraine.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I was a risk when they hired me,\u201d smiles Emma Pinchbeck. The chief executive of Energy UK, the voice of the industry, is hours away from a black-tie awards event that will serve as her unofficial leaving do. After almost five years in the role, she will join the government\u2019s climate watchdog, the Climate Change Committee, in a matter of days. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty funny to remind people of this now, but I was an untested risk. I don\u2019t think back in 2019 if you\u2019d said to the energy industry, \u2018who would you want as a spokesperson for the sector in a time of crisis?\u2019 that they\u2019d necessarily have chosen someone like me.\u201d Pinchbeck was approached for the job when her first child was still a newborn. The former head of climate policy at WWF had stood out in her role as the deputy chief executive of trade group RenewableUK for her outspoken advocacy of Britain\u2019s low-carbon agenda. Understandably, a large part of the interview process focused on whether she could be a good fit advocating for companies with fossil fuel interests, too. \u201cAnd not once in five years has it been a problem,\u201d says Pinchbeck. While there may have been disagreements about the bolder elements of the government\u2019s net zero plan in the early days of her tenure, these were settled years ago. Today, the shift to cleaner energy is less about a green ideology than an economic opportunity. It is unclear whether that message will endure in the US, where the re-election of Donald Trump has already created jitters for renewables developers across the globe. Pinchbeck is hopeful. \u201cThe US has grown to be one of the biggest markets in the world for things like batteries and onshore wind, and a lot of that happened under the last Trump presidency. One of the fastest-growing professions in the US was windfarm technician. \u201cThe thing that I\u2019m closely watching is the Inflation Reduction Act. It was really delivering in a lot of industrialised states \u2013 in red states \u2013 and helped to establish factories and jobs. It\u2019s possible that there won\u2019t be too much change because these policies are bluntly useful for the narrative that the Trump campaign has led on \u2013 improving the economy and improving domestic industry. As ever in politics, you have to distinguish the noise from what will actually happen, and it is genuinely too early to tell.\u201d Pinchbeck is confident the economic arguments on the shift to renewable energy will win. \u201cI hardly ever talk about climate change and emissions in this job. We just call it economics,\u201d she says. So perhaps choosing a relative outsider to lead this change was a prescient move by Energy UK? \u201cThe board \u2026 felt strongly that energy was really important to the economy but was often overlooked or treated as a political toy. But they also understood that net zero was coming and that the whole sector was changing. So the question was, could I change what we were about, and what we were for? Could I make energy more politically resonant?\u201d Pinchbeck has managed exactly that, according to industry veterans. Whereas Energy UK was once seen as a staid, somewhat defensive voice for the former \u201cbig six\u201d energy companies, they say it now reflects an industry alive with green ambition. \u201cWe\u2019re noisier than we used to be,\u201d Pinchbeck says. \u201cWe are more relevant, too. We\u2019re in more rooms, having more serious conversations with more serious people than we were five years ago. But it would just be flattering my ego to believe that I\u2019ve had anything to do with energy being so much in the news.\u201d Months after she took up the role, the world was plunged into the pandemic, forcing people into their homes and driving up energy bills. However, energy market prices tumbled, in a blow to the country\u2019s power generators. When market prices stormed back after the reopening of major economies, the UK\u2019s energy companies faced fresh peril: surging costs caused scores of them to collapse into administration, leaving millions of homes in flux. The suppliers that survived faced further price rises when Russia cut gas supplies to Europe as it invaded Ukraine. Now, as conflict flares in the Middle East, energy market prices show no sign of returning to pre-Covid levels. Pinchbeck is clear the crisis is not over. \u201cAt least not in how people are experiencing it. That\u2019s because people were already struggling [with their bills] in the run-up to the energy crisis. Government support helped, but people got into debt during the energy crisis, and that debt is now deepening.\u201d The official figure for energy company debts stands at a record \u00a33bn.

      "bodyText": "Several leading French newspapers have said they are suing the social media platform X, accusing it of running their content without payment. The joint action against the company run by the US billionaire Elon Musk is being led by several daily newspapers \u2013 Le Figaro, Les Echos, Le Parisien and Le Monde \u2013 and includes other titles such as the culture magazine Telerama, Courrier International, HuffPost, Malesherbes Publications and the Nouvel Obs news weekly. They accuse the site, formerly known as Twitter, of violating \u201cneighbouring rights\u201d, which, under a European directive adopted into French law, are due when social media platforms republish news content. The newspapers, as well as the French news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP), had already asked for an emergency injunction against X, which they accuse of not negotiating. On 24 May, a Paris tribunal agreed with the media companies, and gave X two months to provide commercial data that would allow the outlets to assess the income the platform earns from their content. X \u201chas not yet complied\u201d with this decision, \u201cdemonstrating its continued intent to avoid its legal obligations\u201d, the newspapers said in a statement, justifying their latest suit. France has been fighting for years to protect the publishing rights and revenue of its press and news agencies against what it terms the domination of powerful tech companies that share news content or show news stories in web searches. To tackle this, the EU has created a form of copyright, called neighbouring rights, that allows news media to demand compensation for the use of their content. France has been a test case for the EU rules. In 2019, it was the first EU country to enact the directive on the publishing rights of media companies and news agencies, which required large tech platforms to open talks with publishers seeking remuneration for use of news content. After initial resistance, Google and Facebook both agreed to pay some French media for articles shown in web searches. In March, a French lawyer for X said the social network was not subject to the neighbouring rights directive because, unlike Google or Facebook, X rests on \u201cwhat users post\u201d and not on what it publishes itself, the public broadcaster France TV reported. Last year, Musk posted on X about the AFP case, writing: \u201cThis is bizarre.

She expressed support for a two-state solution and described attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d, while side-stepping attempts by MEPs to get her to condemn Israel\u2019s government.</p> <p>Kallas, a lawyer and MEP before she became Estonia\u2019s first female prime minister in 2021, is one of six European Commission candidates appearing before the parliament on what has been called \u201csuper Tuesday\u201d. Unlike the 25 other nominees to join Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s second commission, which is expected to take office on 1 December, Kallas has already been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/27/ursula-von-der-leyen-wins-second-term-as-european-commission-president\">confirmed as the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign policy</a>, a position appointed by EU governments.</p> <p>But in order to also become a vice-president of the commission, she needs approval from MEPs.</p> <p>These two roles \u2013 her position is known as double-hatted in EU jargon \u2013 point to the challenges of the job: touring the globe as the EU\u2019s chief diplomat, while coordinating foreign policy between 27 national capitals that have frequently diverging views, and leading the EU\u2019s cash-strapped foreign service from Brussels.</p> <p>In her opening remarks to MEPs, Kallas referred briefly to her childhood growing up behind the iron curtain in what was the Soviet Union.</p> <p>During the Soviet deportation of 1941, Kallas\u2019s mother was deported to Siberia as a six-month-old baby with her mother and grandmother. They were not allowed to return to Estonia until a decade later. Her mother went on to marry Siim Kallas, a central bank chief, who played a critical role in Estonia\u2019s post-Soviet transition, serving as Estonia\u2019s prime minister from 2002-03 and 10 years as a European commissioner until 2014.</p> <p>Kallas, 47, suggested her experience as an Estonian could help her turn a fresh page with African governments, which have seen previous EU high representatives from former colonial powers, including Spain, Italy and the UK.</p> <p>Discussing the EU\u2019s future cooperation with Africa, Kallas said she was in \u201ca very good position\u201d coming from a country that experienced \u201cwhat it means to fight for its freedom\u201d. She promised \u201ca partnership of equals\u201d with African states, as well as cooperation to manage migration. But she faced no specific questions about the EU\u2019s controversial migration deals with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/13/eu-fears-for-its-human-rights-credibility-as-tunisia-crushes-dissent-leak-shows\">Tunisia</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/17/egypt-eu-deal-refugees-mediterranean\">Egypt</a>, or the \u20ac5bn trust fund for Africa, which aims to deter migration and was recently given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/25/eu-fund-to-stem-migration-africa-europe-risks-european-court-of-auditors\">an excoriating review</a> by the EU\u2019s auditors.</p> <p>She said the EU had to strengthen Europe\u2019s defence industry, but warned against duplicating Nato\u2019s military role, saying: \u201cIf we have two parallel structures the ball might fall between those chairs and we don\u2019t need that.\u201d</p> <p>Kallas faced several questions on Ukraine from far-right MEPs, who were elected in greater numbers than ever before in June\u2019s elections. Responding to a question about whether Trump would \u201cput an end to the fantasies\u201d that Ukraine would win, she said that agreements that brought only a short-term peace would bring only more wars, citing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/ukraine-crisis-minsk-ceasefire-agreement-details\">2015 Minsk agreement</a> after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and aid to pro-Kremlin separatists in the Donbas. Kallas cited the Yale historian Timothy Snyder, who argues that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/28/russia-wins-by-losing-timothy-snyder-on-raising-funds-for-ukrainian-drone-defence\">Russia must lose decisively</a> to become \u201ca \u2018normal\u2019 European country\u201d.</p> <p>Kallas continued: \u201cRussia has never lost its last colonial war.

The former Estonian prime minister was speaking to MEPs during a three-hour hearing before she takes office, when she listed Ukraine\u2019s victory as a priority \u2013 stronger words than vaguer formulas of support voiced by some EU politicians. \u201cVictory of Ukraine is a priority for us all; the situation on the battlefield is very difficult,\u201d Kallas told MEPs in her opening remarks. \u201cThat is why we must keep on working every day, today, tomorrow and for as long as it takes, and with as much military, financial and humanitarian aid as needed.\u201d In a carefully worded overture to the incoming Donald Trump administration, she said support for Ukraine was in the US\u2019s interest. \u201cIf the US is worried about China, or other actors, then they should also be worried about how we respond \u2026 [to] Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, because we see how Iran, North Korea, China \u2013 more covertly \u2013 and Russia are working together.\u201d Later asked about Trump\u2019s intentions, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody really knows what the new president-elect is doing\u201d and said the EU needed \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d to get information from the US on its plans, adding: \u201cIsolation has never worked for America.\u201d On defence, the EU needed \u201ca drastic change of mindset\u201d, she said, adding that the west \u201ccannot accept\u201d that Russia, Iran and North Korea produce more ammunition than the whole Euro-Atlantic community. As Estonia\u2019s prime minister, Kallas was one of the originators of an EU plan to provide Ukraine with 1m rounds of shells, but progress has been slow. She also said the EU would \u201cstrengthen our mutual security by working more closely with the United Kingdom\u201d, the sole reference to the UK in the three-hour session. Asked about how Europe should respond to authoritarian states supporting Russia, she said the EU needed to signal to China that its aid to Moscow had \u201cconsequences\u201d and \u201ca higher cost\u201d but did not offer specifics. She wanted to discuss Iran with EU foreign ministers, she said, but twice failed to answer a question about whether she supported designating Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) a terrorist organisation, a subject that has long divided member states. Along with the war in Ukraine, she described the situation in the Middle East as an \u201curgent\u201d priority. She expressed support for a two-state solution and described attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d, while side-stepping attempts by MEPs to get her to condemn Israel\u2019s government. Kallas, a lawyer and MEP before she became Estonia\u2019s first female prime minister in 2021, is one of six European Commission candidates appearing before the parliament on what has been called \u201csuper Tuesday\u201d. Unlike the 25 other nominees to join Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s second commission, which is expected to take office on 1 December, Kallas has already been confirmed as the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign policy, a position appointed by EU governments. But in order to also become a vice-president of the commission, she needs approval from MEPs. These two roles \u2013 her position is known as double-hatted in EU jargon \u2013 point to the challenges of the job: touring the globe as the EU\u2019s chief diplomat, while coordinating foreign policy between 27 national capitals that have frequently diverging views, and leading the EU\u2019s cash-strapped foreign service from Brussels. In her opening remarks to MEPs, Kallas referred briefly to her childhood growing up behind the iron curtain in what was the Soviet Union. During the Soviet deportation of 1941, Kallas\u2019s mother was deported to Siberia as a six-month-old baby with her mother and grandmother. They were not allowed to return to Estonia until a decade later. Her mother went on to marry Siim Kallas, a central bank chief, who played a critical role in Estonia\u2019s post-Soviet transition, serving as Estonia\u2019s prime minister from 2002-03 and 10 years as a European commissioner until 2014. Kallas, 47, suggested her experience as an Estonian could help her turn a fresh page with African governments, which have seen previous EU high representatives from former colonial powers, including Spain, Italy and the UK. Discussing the EU\u2019s future cooperation with Africa, Kallas said she was in \u201ca very good position\u201d coming from a country that experienced \u201cwhat it means to fight for its freedom\u201d. She promised \u201ca partnership of equals\u201d with African states, as well as cooperation to manage migration. But she faced no specific questions about the EU\u2019s controversial migration deals with Tunisia or Egypt, or the \u20ac5bn trust fund for Africa, which aims to deter migration and was recently given an excoriating review by the EU\u2019s auditors. She said the EU had to strengthen Europe\u2019s defence industry, but warned against duplicating Nato\u2019s military role, saying: \u201cIf we have two parallel structures the ball might fall between those chairs and we don\u2019t need that.\u201d Kallas faced several questions on Ukraine from far-right MEPs, who were elected in greater numbers than ever before in June\u2019s elections. Responding to a question about whether Trump would \u201cput an end to the fantasies\u201d that Ukraine would win, she said that agreements that brought only a short-term peace would bring only more wars, citing the 2015 Minsk agreement after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and aid to pro-Kremlin separatists in the Donbas. Kallas cited the Yale historian Timothy Snyder, who argues that Russia must lose decisively to become \u201ca \u2018normal\u2019 European country\u201d. Kallas continued: \u201cRussia has never lost its last colonial war. We have to do everything that they will lose it now.\u201d",

About 130 boys are believed to have been victims.</p> <p>The independent review into the abuse concluded Smyth might have been brought to justice had the archbishop formally reported it to police a decade ago.</p> <p>Lambeth Palace had said in a statement on Monday that Welby had \u201capologised profoundly both for his own failures and omissions, and for the wickedness, concealment and abuse by the church more widely\u201d but did \u201cnot intend to resign\u201d.</p> <p>His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/12/justin-welby-step-down-archbishop-canterbury\">resignation was announced</a> on Tuesday afternoon.</p>  <h2>How does the archbishop step down?</h2>  <p>Under legislation passed by the church\u2019s ruling body, the General Synod and parliament, known as the ecclesiastical offices regulations, the archbishop of Canterbury is required to retire at 70 and is expected to remain in the role until that date.</p> <p>If an archbishop wants to step down before then, they must tender their resignation to the serving monarch, in Welby\u2019s case, King Charles, who grants permission for them to stand down.</p> <p>Welby would have turned 70 in January 2026 and had been intending to serve until then, according to reports.</p> <p>The legislation does allow for an archbishop to extend their term one year beyond 70, which must be authorised by the monarch.</p> <h2>Has an archbishop of Canterbury ever resigned before retirement age?</h2>  <p>Dr Rowan Williams, Welby\u2019s predecessor, resigned from his role in 2012, aged 61. He announced he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/16/rowan-williams-resigns-archbishop-canterbury\">return to academia</a>, as master of Magdalene college at the University of Cambridge, the following January.</p> <p>His time in office was marked by a growing schism in the worldwide Anglican church. Williams was attacked by conservatives for his liberal views on homosexuality and by liberals for failing to live up to these principles.</p> <h2>How will Welby\u2019s successor be chosen?</h2>  <p>The archbishop of Canterbury is nominated by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister, who in turn takes advice from the Crown Nominations Commission.</p> <p>The commission is a Church of England body and not one of the crown, and the prime minister is not obliged to accept its advice.</p> <p>The commission agrees upon two names for nomination to the prime minister, which may be given in an order of preference.</p> <p>Parliament is not directly involved in the selection process. However, it does have to approve the measures that the General Synod passes from time to time, which define the procedures used.</p> <p>When an archbishop of Canterbury is to be chosen, the body will consist of: the archbishop of York; another senior bishop; six members of the General Synod; three representatives of the diocese of Canterbury; and five members chosen from the global Anglican communion. A chairperson will be appointed by Downing Street.</p>  <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 November 2024. An earlier version said there are 16 voting members of the Crown Nominations Commission choosing the archbishop of Canterbury, including six representatives of the diocese of Canterbury and one from the global Anglican communion. In fact there are 17 members in total, including three representatives of the diocese of Canterbury and five members from the global Anglican communion.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has announced he will step down after facing pressure to quit over his handling of an abuse scandal. A damning report was published last week on the Church of England\u2019s cover-up of John Smyth\u2019s abuse in the UK in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and later in Zimbabwe and South Africa. About 130 boys are believed to have been victims. The independent review into the abuse concluded Smyth might have been brought to justice had the archbishop formally reported it to police a decade ago. Lambeth Palace had said in a statement on Monday that Welby had \u201capologised profoundly both for his own failures and omissions, and for the wickedness, concealment and abuse by the church more widely\u201d but did \u201cnot intend to resign\u201d. His resignation was announced on Tuesday afternoon. How does the archbishop step down? Under legislation passed by the church\u2019s ruling body, the General Synod and parliament, known as the ecclesiastical offices regulations, the archbishop of Canterbury is required to retire at 70 and is expected to remain in the role until that date. If an archbishop wants to step down before then, they must tender their resignation to the serving monarch, in Welby\u2019s case, King Charles, who grants permission for them to stand down. Welby would have turned 70 in January 2026 and had been intending to serve until then, according to reports. The legislation does allow for an archbishop to extend their term one year beyond 70, which must be authorised by the monarch. Has an archbishop of Canterbury ever resigned before retirement age? Dr Rowan Williams, Welby\u2019s predecessor, resigned from his role in 2012, aged 61. He announced he would return to academia, as master of Magdalene college at the University of Cambridge, the following January. His time in office was marked by a growing schism in the worldwide Anglican church. Williams was attacked by conservatives for his liberal views on homosexuality and by liberals for failing to live up to these principles. How will Welby\u2019s successor be chosen? The archbishop of Canterbury is nominated by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister, who in turn takes advice from the Crown Nominations Commission. The commission is a Church of England body and not one of the crown, and the prime minister is not obliged to accept its advice. The commission agrees upon two names for nomination to the prime minister, which may be given in an order of preference. Parliament is not directly involved in the selection process. However, it does have to approve the measures that the General Synod passes from time to time, which define the procedures used. When an archbishop of Canterbury is to be chosen, the body will consist of: the archbishop of York; another senior bishop; six members of the General Synod; three representatives of the diocese of Canterbury; and five members chosen from the global Anglican communion. A chairperson will be appointed by Downing Street. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 November 2024. An earlier version said there are 16 voting members of the Crown Nominations Commission choosing the archbishop of Canterbury, including six representatives of the diocese of Canterbury and one from the global Anglican communion. In fact there are 17 members in total, including three representatives of the diocese of Canterbury and five members from the global Anglican communion.",

Hoyzer awarded Paderborn two penalties and sent off the Hamburg striker Emile MpenzaSapina made more than \u20ac750,000 from Paderborn\u2019s 4-2 victory, according to the indictment.

Seven of the Penthouse club\u2019s sex workers picketed and delivered signed letters to the business late on Friday night, demanding fairer workplace conditions. One, a 21-year-old, was allegedly assaulted inside the venue while carrying a placard. Penthouse bills itself as \u201cthe only 6 star brothel located in Sydney CBD\u201d. Sex worker and former Penthouse contractor Iris Hues said the club changed its pricing structure and service menu at the beginning of the month, raising rates without increasing workers\u2019 earnings, as well as penalising workers with hidden fees and fines. She said that while some demands had been met, others \u2013 including reinstating the former 60/40 sex worker/business earnings split \u2013 had been ignored, forcing the women to take strike action. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Shortly before midnight on Friday, protesters approached the front desk of the club, holding signs that read \u201cNo profit without u$!\u201d and \u201cWorth more than 50/50\u201d. The letters\u2019 14 signatories also alleged the club failed to provide a clean workspace, blaming unhygienic conditions for a spate of respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia. \u201cToday, we walk out \u2013 until our needs are met,\u201d they wrote. \u201cYou raise your cut on extra services we provide, without a raise for the ones providing it. Dictating the services we provide, taking away our choice with our own bodies. \u201cThe reason we worked here was because we felt comfortable, and now we feel controlled.\u201d After the women delivered the letters to the front desk, they entered the club\u2019s main bar area where, in front of about 40 patrons and sex workers, one of the women was allegedly assaulted, Guardian Australia was told by multiple witnesses. New South Wales police said that following reports of an alleged assault at a business on Pitt Street, officers \u201cwere told an altercation had occurred between a group of people and a man, before the group left the scene. Investigations are ongoing.\u201d Hues claimed she was fired last week from the Penthouse for raising concerns around work conditions. She claims all seven protesters had now lost their contract positions at the club. \u201cWe were all shaking before we went in. It was really, really scary,\u201d Hues said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to communicate or open a dialogue with management at all.\u201d She said about 50 women worked at the club, but that many felt unsafe to strike. \u201cThere is a large portion of girls that can\u2019t afford to not work, or can\u2019t afford to go and find another brothel,\u201d she said. \u201cThe power imbalance has been in the favour of the pimps and the bosses for too long, when the sex industry has always belonged to its workers. We make them their money. The sex industry thrives on silence and us not being able to say or know anything.\u201d The protest was modelled on direct action taken by strippers as part of New Zealand\u2019s Fired Up Stilettos movement and Sydney\u2019s 1973 Kings Cross stripper strike, she said. The Scarlet Alliance\u2019s chief executive, Mish Pony, said that as sex work was decriminalised in more jurisdictions across Australia, sex workers increasingly had the ability to organise and strike over workplace health and safety and pay conditions without legal repercussions.

She said sex workers had full rights of refusal to perform a sex act. \u201cAlthough these issues are very disappointing to hear about, it\u2019s also very heartening to know workers are coming together and fighting for workplace rights,\u201d she said of Friday\u2019s protest. \u201cNobody should be forced to put up with bad workplace conditions.\u201d The Penthouse has been contacted for comment.",

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Mark Serrels, Choice\u2019s editorial director, named NIB as the \u201cworst of a bad bunch\u201d of health insurers for charging single parents more than couples.

Population health scientists see Republican-led states, some of which have the worst health outcomes in the developed world, and Trump\u2019s track record as warning signs for the future. \u201cWe were looking at the policies other countries had adopted that allowed their populations to live longer and healthier,\u201d said Dr Steven Woolf, a population health researcher and family doctor at Virginia Commonwealth University.

Without getting into the minutia of that list \u2013 some of which is actively harmful \u2013 the focus stands in contrast to what population health scientists see as the most effective ways to improve the nation\u2019s health, from getting everyone health insurance to improving STD tracking and diagnostic programs to increasing tobacco taxes. The US south paints one of the starkest examples of ignoring this evidence. This longtime conservative stronghold has among the highest rates of diabetes, obesity, infant mortality, maternal mortality, sexually transmitted diseases, cancer and self-reported poor health in the nation, and sometimes the developed world.

The south as a region also has the highest rates of people who lack health insurance, have less than a high school education and live in poverty \u2013 all associated with worse overall physical and behavioral health outcomes. \u201cThe US is not doing well at protecting the health and welfare of its residents,\u201d said Reginald Williams II, vice-president of international health policy at the Commonwealth Fund.

But the Republican party has a track record of cutting regulations that protect health \u2013 like occupational health and safety standards \u2013 and opposing those that protect health \u2013 such as curbing cigarettes, alcohol, junk food or pollution. These, in turn, are what researchers call the \u201cpolitical determinants of health\u201d. And a growing body of research, including a study published as recently as September by Krieger, shows how the conservative policy agenda is associated with poor health outcomes. \u201cIt\u2019s the conditions of life, the air we breathe, the temperature of the planet, the nature of the qualities of the ecosystems in which we live \u2013 that\u2019s fundamental to understanding population health,\u201d said Nancy Krieger, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard\u2019s TH Chan school of public health. This area of research grew substantially after the Covid-19 pandemic, when the worst-affected populations moved from the poor and people of color early in the outbreak, to more affluent, white and conservative states where Republicans opposed masks and vaccines. \u201cSo there\u2019s one part [of political determinants of health] \u2013 what are the policies of the health insurance system?\u201d said Krieger. For instance, Republican-led South Dakota took steps to restrict insurance coverage this election cycle. There, voters approved a measure to add work requirements to Medicaid, the public health insurance program for low-income Americans. The American Cancer Society called that change \u201cdangerous and life-threatening\u201d, and one that goes against research showing \u201ctime and again that access to health insurance is a significant determining factor in surviving a cancer diagnosis\u201d.

      "body": "<p>When the first episode of House aired, on this week in 2004, what we thought was good television was dramatically starting to shift. The West Wing was on its sixth season, The Wire was on its second. Mad Men was still three years away, Breaking Bad was four. Network TV was such a different beast to TV as we know it now: there were 24-odd episodes of House a season, meaning it would air once a week for about half a year. These days, it\u2019s hard to think of a drama with more than eight episodes per season.</p> <p>If you believe quantity lessens quality, it\u2019s strange to watch House now and see how good it (mostly) remains \u2013 fast, sharp and often very funny, with a magnetic central performance by Hugh Laurie who, before House, was known for playing bumbling toffs in British comedies and the dad in Stuart Little. You can watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqHh6TvGQIQ\">Laurie\u2019s audition tape for House online</a> (shot in a dark hotel bathroom in Namibia) and immediately see why he got the role; suddenly George from Blackadder was a caustic, unshaven doctor, spitting out medical jargon with a perfect American accent while maintaining a limp and a semi-permanent frown.</p> <p>As Princeton-Plainsboro\u2019s resident terror and head of diagnostics, Greg House specialises in solving the cases that stump other doctors (or \u201czebras\u201d, medical slang for obscure diagnoses). He barely tolerates his young, ambitious team: Dr Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), Dr Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) and Dr Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer). He bullies and flirts with his boss, the dean of medicine, Dr Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), and fobs off work to hang out with his sardonic best friend, Dr James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard). House is damaged, both physically and emotionally: a past misdiagnosis has left him with a permanent limp, an opioid addiction and an endless appetite for self-destruction. With the occasional overdose, romance, dramatic death or new cast member, this is basically the plot for 177 episodes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urZLTobAfJc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/urZLTobAfJc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/11/the-babadook-at-10-how-a-tiny-australian-film-became-a-horror-hit-and-an-unlikely-queer-icon\">The Babadook at 10: how a tiny Australian film became a horror hit \u2013 and an unlikely queer icon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By 2008, House was the biggest television show in the world, watched by 81 million people.

His ability to spot a diagnosis dazzles and frustrates everyone around him; as one patient observes, \u201cWhen you\u2019re that big of a jerk, you\u2019re either great or unemployed.\u201d He\u2019s a staunch atheist whose only dogma is rationality: he argues a rape survivor into getting an abortion, secretly offers a terminally ill child an early death if she wants it, and risks his medical licence to give his best friend chemotherapy at home. He hates his patients, but is drawn to the puzzles they present. He can be deeply cruel to those he loves and startlingly gentle with people he barely knows.</p> <p>Sure, the medicine was often interesting \u2013 scurvy, bubonic plague, a condition called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_hand_syndrome\">Alien hand syndrome</a> which, frighteningly, actually exists \u2013 but if you\u2019re watching House, you are watching for one guy only. \u201cNo one cares about the medicine,\u201d House grouches in the final episode, which neatly sums up the whole thing.</p>    <p>Not all of the episodes work. Around a third are just OK \u2013 but the majority veer between solid and brilliant, which isn\u2019t a bad hit rate for a network procedural with 177 episodes. The brilliant ones are concentrated in the first six seasons \u2013 the second is best, the fourth is an excellent reset, and the sixth was a brave attempt to do something new \u2013 but House noticeably ran out of steam by season seven, and smartly ended with season eight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/nov/03/streaming-new-releases-australia-november-netflix-stan-binge-apple-disney\">Borderlands, Civil War and Scorsese on the Beatles: what\u2019s new to streaming in Australia in November</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like most pop culture from the 2000s, House hasn\u2019t aged perfectly.

      "bodyText": "When the first episode of House aired, on this week in 2004, what we thought was good television was dramatically starting to shift. The West Wing was on its sixth season, The Wire was on its second. Mad Men was still three years away, Breaking Bad was four. Network TV was such a different beast to TV as we know it now: there were 24-odd episodes of House a season, meaning it would air once a week for about half a year. These days, it\u2019s hard to think of a drama with more than eight episodes per season. If you believe quantity lessens quality, it\u2019s strange to watch House now and see how good it (mostly) remains \u2013 fast, sharp and often very funny, with a magnetic central performance by Hugh Laurie who, before House, was known for playing bumbling toffs in British comedies and the dad in Stuart Little. You can watch Laurie\u2019s audition tape for House online (shot in a dark hotel bathroom in Namibia) and immediately see why he got the role; suddenly George from Blackadder was a caustic, unshaven doctor, spitting out medical jargon with a perfect American accent while maintaining a limp and a semi-permanent frown. As Princeton-Plainsboro\u2019s resident terror and head of diagnostics, Greg House specialises in solving the cases that stump other doctors (or \u201czebras\u201d, medical slang for obscure diagnoses). He barely tolerates his young, ambitious team: Dr Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), Dr Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) and Dr Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer). He bullies and flirts with his boss, the dean of medicine, Dr Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), and fobs off work to hang out with his sardonic best friend, Dr James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard). House is damaged, both physically and emotionally: a past misdiagnosis has left him with a permanent limp, an opioid addiction and an endless appetite for self-destruction. With the occasional overdose, romance, dramatic death or new cast member, this is basically the plot for 177 episodes. By 2008, House was the biggest television show in the world, watched by 81 million people. Laurie once said: \u201cIt\u2019s such a densely verbal, idiomatic, very funny, intricate show \u2013 I cannot imagine what it\u2019s like seeing it in Turkish.\u201d Perhaps it worked because it occupied a strange new lacuna: it was a case-of-the-week ensemble procedural and a character study of a singularly complicated human being. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Greg House is miserable, wounded, obsessive, childish, churlish, self-loathing, confusingly sexy. His ability to spot a diagnosis dazzles and frustrates everyone around him; as one patient observes, \u201cWhen you\u2019re that big of a jerk, you\u2019re either great or unemployed.\u201d He\u2019s a staunch atheist whose only dogma is rationality: he argues a rape survivor into getting an abortion, secretly offers a terminally ill child an early death if she wants it, and risks his medical licence to give his best friend chemotherapy at home. He hates his patients, but is drawn to the puzzles they present. He can be deeply cruel to those he loves and startlingly gentle with people he barely knows. Sure, the medicine was often interesting \u2013 scurvy, bubonic plague, a condition called Alien hand syndrome which, frighteningly, actually exists \u2013 but if you\u2019re watching House, you are watching for one guy only. \u201cNo one cares about the medicine,\u201d House grouches in the final episode, which neatly sums up the whole thing. Not all of the episodes work. Around a third are just OK \u2013 but the majority veer between solid and brilliant, which isn\u2019t a bad hit rate for a network procedural with 177 episodes. The brilliant ones are concentrated in the first six seasons \u2013 the second is best, the fourth is an excellent reset, and the sixth was a brave attempt to do something new \u2013 but House noticeably ran out of steam by season seven, and smartly ended with season eight. Like most pop culture from the 2000s, House hasn\u2019t aged perfectly. There are a lot more references to \u201chookers\u201d than you\u2019d believe, and asexual, intersex and fat patients are spoken about in ways some might find clumsy or distasteful now. The sheer number of gay jokes is frankly remarkable, but none of it is nasty \u2013 and what else are you going to write when two of your male actors have that much chemistry? (If House was remade now, I suspect the only thing that would change is House and Wilson would not have settled just for a proposal and would actually get married.) But in some ways, House aged really well. It is the perfect rebuke to that most irritating catchphase \u2013 \u201cYou can\u2019t say that any more\u201d \u2013 in that House says pretty much everything about anyone, and we still love him. He\u2019s having a second life among even the most puritanical viewers: gen Z, some of whom weren\u2019t even alive when it first aired.

      "body": "<p>\u2018People tell me I\u2019m a serial collaborator, but sometimes a dialogue is more interesting than a monologue,\u201d says Italian drummer and musician Valentina Magaletti. \u201cWhen you talk with yourself, you know where you\u2019re going and what you want to say. When it\u2019s with someone else, the narrative changes.\u201d</p> <p>Magaletti is one of the most prolific musicians currently working in experimental music. A voracious collaborator, she always has a clutch of releases just out or coming up. In September a meaty new collaboration with Afro-Portuguese artist N\u00eddia was released; last month saw a new album from the un-pindownable Moin (a trio with production duo Raime, where she has been bumped from collaborator to band member). There\u2019s also a 7in from her post-dub duo Holy Tongue coming up, an album from her duo V/Z (with Zongamin), and she will soon start recording her fourth solo album.</p>    <p>These releases fall among nonstop live dates \u2013 she thinks she has played about 100 shows this year, so today presents a rare chance to catch her at home in her London flat, with her cat Ashby (named after harpist Dorothy Ashby), in a space filled with art, objects, instruments and a very large record collection. Three walls of LPs cover one end of the room, watched over by cardboard cutouts of Maggie Simpson and David Bowie. There\u2019s a baseball cap reading \u201cMAKE NOISE MUSIC GAY AGAIN\u201d, a small piano swamped by cassettes and zines, a guitar and a glass cabinet of curiosities.</p> <p>What filing system does she use for the records, I ask as we sit down for a coffee. \u201cIt depends on the girl I\u2019m dating,\u201d she laughs. Her own archive is on overspill shelves in the spare room, with other bands she\u2019s been in: psychedelic pop band Vanishing Twin; Tomaga (a duo with the late Tom Relleen), CZN with percussionist Jo\u00e3o Pais Filipe, and releases from label and micro-publisher Permanent Draft, co-run with her partner, French writer Fanny Chiarello.</p> <p>As a drummer Magaletti is often called versatile, but it\u2019s more accurate to say she is insatiably hungry to play, with the grounding to carve out a distinctive style wherever she places herself. Her sound is tight but textural: more like an etching than a painting, with precise lines building idiosyncrasies that come from process, context, and collaborators. She is interested in things feeling \u201cslightly off, or impenetrable\u201d, she says, although latterly she has been compared to Jaki Liebezeit \u2013 and has filled his shoes in the Can Project. She names American jazz drummer, percussionist and professor Milford Graves as a key influence, for \u201cextending what drums meant, not just physically, but also poetically.

      "bodyText": "\u2018People tell me I\u2019m a serial collaborator, but sometimes a dialogue is more interesting than a monologue,\u201d says Italian drummer and musician Valentina Magaletti. \u201cWhen you talk with yourself, you know where you\u2019re going and what you want to say. When it\u2019s with someone else, the narrative changes.\u201d Magaletti is one of the most prolific musicians currently working in experimental music. A voracious collaborator, she always has a clutch of releases just out or coming up. In September a meaty new collaboration with Afro-Portuguese artist N\u00eddia was released; last month saw a new album from the un-pindownable Moin (a trio with production duo Raime, where she has been bumped from collaborator to band member). There\u2019s also a 7in from her post-dub duo Holy Tongue coming up, an album from her duo V/Z (with Zongamin), and she will soon start recording her fourth solo album. These releases fall among nonstop live dates \u2013 she thinks she has played about 100 shows this year, so today presents a rare chance to catch her at home in her London flat, with her cat Ashby (named after harpist Dorothy Ashby), in a space filled with art, objects, instruments and a very large record collection. Three walls of LPs cover one end of the room, watched over by cardboard cutouts of Maggie Simpson and David Bowie. There\u2019s a baseball cap reading \u201cMAKE NOISE MUSIC GAY AGAIN\u201d, a small piano swamped by cassettes and zines, a guitar and a glass cabinet of curiosities. What filing system does she use for the records, I ask as we sit down for a coffee. \u201cIt depends on the girl I\u2019m dating,\u201d she laughs. Her own archive is on overspill shelves in the spare room, with other bands she\u2019s been in: psychedelic pop band Vanishing Twin; Tomaga (a duo with the late Tom Relleen), CZN with percussionist Jo\u00e3o Pais Filipe, and releases from label and micro-publisher Permanent Draft, co-run with her partner, French writer Fanny Chiarello. As a drummer Magaletti is often called versatile, but it\u2019s more accurate to say she is insatiably hungry to play, with the grounding to carve out a distinctive style wherever she places herself. Her sound is tight but textural: more like an etching than a painting, with precise lines building idiosyncrasies that come from process, context, and collaborators. She is interested in things feeling \u201cslightly off, or impenetrable\u201d, she says, although latterly she has been compared to Jaki Liebezeit \u2013 and has filled his shoes in the Can Project. She names American jazz drummer, percussionist and professor Milford Graves as a key influence, for \u201cextending what drums meant, not just physically, but also poetically. A kind of Fluxus energy \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m after. Everything is so often in a grid, but drums are physical: it\u2019s just you and your environment; your body versus an object.\u201d Magaletti says she always wanted to be a drummer. She was thrown out of the classroom at school in Bari, Italy for drumming with pencils on the table, and says her mother jokes about how single-minded she is. \u201cPlaying music, going to gigs, listening to music, it\u2019s all I want,\u201d she says.

She moved to London in 2000, enormously expanding her cast of collaborators: she once told an interviewer she left Bari because she\u2019d jammed with everyone in town. After the conservatory she started to pull apart her learnings. \u201cThis deconstruction happened because I saw that drumming had often been really conventional, even in the way the kit is presented \u2013 it\u2019s always the bloody same,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very machismo, showing off how fast [you can play].

But she prefers to form new outfits than be or use \u201cfeatured\u201d artist credits. \u201cI prefer collaborating because then we can share everything,\u201d she says. \u201cOtherwise it can be like a football team, when you pay loads of money for all those champion players, and then you don\u2019t score.\u201d People often ask her how she manages to do so much: Magaletti says she is not stymied by self-critique and doesn\u2019t care about what others think.

Industrial action at Bakkavor, a large supplier of the fish roe dip, has caused a \u201cshort disruption\u201d to the supply and availability of taramasalata at supermarkets across the country. Employees at Bakkavor\u2019s Spalding site in the Midlands launched strike action about six weeks ago over pay. Tubs of own-brand taramasalata were out of stock online at Waitrose, Sainbury\u2019s and Tesco, the UK\u2019s largest grocer. The Marks &amp; Spencer dip was also unavailable at Ocado online.

The dip has a distinctive salty and tangy flavour, and is a staple of traditional Greek meze. Guardian critic Jay Rayner devoted a whole section of his book Nights Out at Home to the dip. Bakkavor said that the strike action would not have a long-term effect on food supply and that its Christmas ranges were manufactured at the company\u2019s other sites. The British Retail Consortium acknowledged there were taramasalata availability issues but said retailers were \u201cadept at managing supply to ensure the impact on customers is kept to a minimum and they can purchase goods as normal\u201d, according to the FT. The Unite trade union said that 700 of the Spalding factory\u2019s 1,400 workers were on strike, but Bakkavor said only 450 employees were not attending work. According to the Unite union, workers at the company\u2019s Spalding site are demanding a pay rise of 81p an hour and most workers at the site are paid \u00a311.54 an hour. In a statement issued last week, Donna-Maria Lee, chief people officer at Bakkavor, disputed Unite\u2019s claim that the company had carried out years of real-term pay cuts.

Smalls was laid off from the Amazon fulfilment centre for objecting to poor safety protocols; he set about creating a union, with a lonely, cold vigil outside the warehouse, handing out leaflets, accepting support from well-wishers, doing media interviews. The pressure grew, and the dream of creating a union was theoretically possible because of the law that if 30% of the workforce require it, a vote on unionisation has to be taken. Amazon\u2019s workforce turnover means employees come and go and it is very difficult to get up to this point. But it was achieved, and a \u201cyes\u201d majority secured \u2013 after which Amazon started a huge legal campaign to have that vote annulled.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLgm71L9MTY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BLgm71L9MTY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Directors Stephen Maing and Brett Story give a shrewd, fly-on-the-wall picture of the divisions within the union itself, with the working-class members and people of colour uneasy with the white college-grad contingent who are very gung-ho about protesting and getting arrested, not quite realising that for black people this is to risk death.

Smalls was laid off from the Amazon fulfilment centre for objecting to poor safety protocols; he set about creating a union, with a lonely, cold vigil outside the warehouse, handing out leaflets, accepting support from well-wishers, doing media interviews. The pressure grew, and the dream of creating a union was theoretically possible because of the law that if 30% of the workforce require it, a vote on unionisation has to be taken. Amazon\u2019s workforce turnover means employees come and go and it is very difficult to get up to this point. But it was achieved, and a \u201cyes\u201d majority secured \u2013 after which Amazon started a huge legal campaign to have that vote annulled. Directors Stephen Maing and Brett Story give a shrewd, fly-on-the-wall picture of the divisions within the union itself, with the working-class members and people of colour uneasy with the white college-grad contingent who are very gung-ho about protesting and getting arrested, not quite realising that for black people this is to risk death. These are the hard yards of standing up to a corporation with a vested interest in effacing workers\u2019 rights. \u2022 Union is in UK cinemas from 14 November.",

It found that any transactions which took place on the day a new account was opened, or until the account record was updated, were able to pass through the system unchecked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2024/nov/11/end-of-nationalisation-treasury-natwest-royal-bank-of-scotland-financial-crisis\">End of Treasury\u2019s stake in NatWest is nigh, and no flashy sell-off required | Nils Pratley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Junior staff raised the alarm in 2017 and 2018, but Metro failed to identify and fix the problem until July 2019. Even then, the FCA said the bank did not have the systems in place to consistently check that all the data was being properly entered until December 2020.</p> <p>It left a loophole in which 60m transactions, worth \u00a351bn, were able to pass through the system without being properly reviewed for potential money laundering.</p> <p>The regulator on Tuesday said it had fined Metro \u00a316.7m over the failings, which the FCA said \u201crisked a gap being left in our defence against the criminal misuse of our financial system. Those failings went on for too long.\u201d </p> <p>Metro said it accepted the FCA\u2019s findings and had since resolved the monitoring system failings and enhanced its processes. Metro would have been fined \u00a323.8m but was given a 30% discount under FCA rules after agreeing to resolve the problems. The company\u2019s shares were largely unaffected by news of the fine.</p> <p>It is the latest blow to the UK challenger bank, which has been working through a painful turnaround plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/13/metro-bank-to-cut-1000-jobs-and-end-seven-day-branch-model\">involving more than 1,000 job cuts,</a> since being forced into the arms of the Colombian billionaire Jaime Gilinski Bacal as part of a \u00a3925m rescue deal last year.</p> <p>The challenger bank, which has 76 branches and 2.7 million customers, launched in the UK in 2010, when it became the first high street bank to open in more than 100 years. Co-founded by the US billionaire Vernon Hill, it initially attracted a wave of customers after launching in the UK offering seven-day opening hours and dog-friendly branches.</p> <p>But a major accounting blunder in 2019, in which it miscalculated the amount of risky loans on its balance sheet, put it in breach of UK regulations, leading to a mini-bank run and resulting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/02/metro-bank-founder-to-quit-board-amid-fallout-from-accounting-error\">Hill resigning as chair</a>.</p> <p>It also dashed hopes of more lenient capital rules that might have helped Metro compete with larger rivals, prompting panic last autumn that led to the bank being scooped up by Bacal, who now owns 53% of the lender.</p> <p>Under Bacal\u2019s guidance, the lender has been pulling out of the traditional retail mortgage market, and pushing further into business banking and specialist mortgages involved in shared ownership, buy-to-let, and high-net-worth individuals paid in bonuses rather than salaries. </p> <p>It has led to a turnaround in the bank\u2019s fortunes, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/04/metro-bank-new-business-model-analysis\">forecast by the bank in August</a> predicted it would return to profitability by the end of the year. On Tuesday, the bank said it had returned to profit on an \u201cunderlying basis\u201d in October.</p> <p>Commenting on the FCA fine, Daniel Frumkin, the chief executive of Metro Bank, said: \u201cThe conclusion of these inquiries draws a line under this legacy issue, allowing the bank to move forward and fully focus on the future, building on the solid foundations it has already laid.</p> <p>\u201cWe are continuing, at pace, our shift towards higher-yielding specialist mortgages and commercial, corporate and SME lending with a strong pipeline of business.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, the FCA fined another challenger bank, Starling, \u00a329m for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/02/starling-bank-fined-29m-for-shockingly-lax-financial-controls\">\u201cshockingly lax\u201d financial crime controls</a>. The online bank \u201cleft the financial system wide open to criminals and those subject to sanctions\u201d, the FCA said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Metro Bank has been fined nearly \u00a317m by the UK\u2019s financial watchdog for failings in its money-laundering controls over four years, in a fresh blow to the lender a year on from its near-collapse. In a surprise announcement that also triggered the early release of Metro\u2019s third-quarter results on Tuesday morning, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it had found shortfalls in the bank\u2019s financial crime checks between 2016 and 2020. The FCA said that while Metro started automating the monitoring of customer transactions for potential financial crime in 2016, the system did not work as intended. It found that any transactions which took place on the day a new account was opened, or until the account record was updated, were able to pass through the system unchecked. Junior staff raised the alarm in 2017 and 2018, but Metro failed to identify and fix the problem until July 2019. Even then, the FCA said the bank did not have the systems in place to consistently check that all the data was being properly entered until December 2020. It left a loophole in which 60m transactions, worth \u00a351bn, were able to pass through the system without being properly reviewed for potential money laundering. The regulator on Tuesday said it had fined Metro \u00a316.7m over the failings, which the FCA said \u201crisked a gap being left in our defence against the criminal misuse of our financial system. Those failings went on for too long.\u201d Metro said it accepted the FCA\u2019s findings and had since resolved the monitoring system failings and enhanced its processes. Metro would have been fined \u00a323.8m but was given a 30% discount under FCA rules after agreeing to resolve the problems. The company\u2019s shares were largely unaffected by news of the fine. It is the latest blow to the UK challenger bank, which has been working through a painful turnaround plan involving more than 1,000 job cuts, since being forced into the arms of the Colombian billionaire Jaime Gilinski Bacal as part of a \u00a3925m rescue deal last year. The challenger bank, which has 76 branches and 2.7 million customers, launched in the UK in 2010, when it became the first high street bank to open in more than 100 years. Co-founded by the US billionaire Vernon Hill, it initially attracted a wave of customers after launching in the UK offering seven-day opening hours and dog-friendly branches. But a major accounting blunder in 2019, in which it miscalculated the amount of risky loans on its balance sheet, put it in breach of UK regulations, leading to a mini-bank run and resulting in Hill resigning as chair. It also dashed hopes of more lenient capital rules that might have helped Metro compete with larger rivals, prompting panic last autumn that led to the bank being scooped up by Bacal, who now owns 53% of the lender. Under Bacal\u2019s guidance, the lender has been pulling out of the traditional retail mortgage market, and pushing further into business banking and specialist mortgages involved in shared ownership, buy-to-let, and high-net-worth individuals paid in bonuses rather than salaries. It has led to a turnaround in the bank\u2019s fortunes, and a forecast by the bank in August predicted it would return to profitability by the end of the year. On Tuesday, the bank said it had returned to profit on an \u201cunderlying basis\u201d in October. Commenting on the FCA fine, Daniel Frumkin, the chief executive of Metro Bank, said: \u201cThe conclusion of these inquiries draws a line under this legacy issue, allowing the bank to move forward and fully focus on the future, building on the solid foundations it has already laid. \u201cWe are continuing, at pace, our shift towards higher-yielding specialist mortgages and commercial, corporate and SME lending with a strong pipeline of business.\u201d Last month, the FCA fined another challenger bank, Starling, \u00a329m for \u201cshockingly lax\u201d financial crime controls. The online bank \u201cleft the financial system wide open to criminals and those subject to sanctions\u201d, the FCA said.",

In this week\u2019s newsletter: Elon Musk and Donald Trump want to create a \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d, crypto wins big across the board, and a modern equivalent of Lysistrata takes hold on TikTok. Thank you for joining me.</p> <p>Trump, president-elect of the US, said he wants to appoint Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, as the country\u2019s \u201csecretary of cost-cutting\u201d to reduce bureaucracy in the federal government by an order of $2tn, roughly a third. Trump announced in September that he would create a \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d. Musk had pushed for the idea and has since relentlessly promoted it, emphasizing the acronym for the agency: Doge, a reference to a meme of an expressive Shiba Inu. Trump said the agency will be conducting a \u201ccomplete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government, and making recommendations for drastic reforms\u201d.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://x.com/CollinRugg/status/1854716187512651808\">video posted on X</a> two days after the election, Trump said he would \u201cimmediately re-issue my 2020 executive order, restoring the president\u2019s authority to remove rogue bureaucrats\u201d. He wants to \u201cclean out the deep state\u201d.

Americans do want to spend less \u2013 of their own money. Do they want austerity and less financial assistance from the federal government?

The president-elect promised to ban bureaucrats from taking jobs at the companies they regulate. Such a rule would seem to bar SpaceX\u2019s lieutenants from the Pentagon\u2019s door. But the president-elect has never shied away from cronyism. The two are not trying to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest: Musk\u2019s role in the government will be structured so that he can maintain control of his companies, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d207c4a9-0e6d-4ece-a44d-abf890316b5a\">the Financial Times reports</a>.</p> <p>In his first term, Trump and his team struggled to fill the thousands of government appointments needed to run the federal government. Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie said the administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5111947\">never fully recovered from its failure to find those appointees</a>. Perhaps adding Musk to the equation is meant to prevent a repeat of such laggardliness. In an extreme version of the new administration, Trump and Musk simply eliminate any position for which they can\u2019t find a friendly appointee. In John Kennedy Toole\u2019s Pulitzer-winning 1980 novel A Confederacy of Dunces, the idiot hero, tasked with organizing an intractable pile of files at his new job, eradicates the company\u2019s mess.

Federal government employees, by contrast, enjoy strong employment protections that would hinder Musk\u2019s slash-and-burn approach to cost-cutting and possibly render it impossible.

      "body": "<p>A driver killed 35 people and severely injured another 43 when he rammed his car into people exercising at a sports centre in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, police said on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Police had detained a 62-year-old man at the sports centre in Zhuhai after the ramming late on Monday, on the eve of an airshow by the People\u2019s Liberation Army that is hosted annually in the city.</p> \n<p>Police identified the man only by his family name of Fan, as is usual with the Chinese authorities. Fan was discovered in the car with a knife, with wounds to his neck thought to be self-inflicted, according to the statement. Police said he was unconscious and receiving medical care. They added that their preliminary investigation suggested he had been dissatisfied with the split of financial assets in his divorce.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, urged local officials to ensure social stability and called for \u201call-out efforts\u201d to treat the injured, according to state media. It was reported that Xi had dispatched a team from Beijing oversee the handling of the incident.</p> \n<p>For almost 24 hours after the crime took place, it was unclear what the death or injury toll was. One of the four hospitals that took in people for treatment said it had more than 20 injured, state media reported on Monday. Calls made to the hospitals in the city by AP reporters went unanswered, or were directed towards other hospitals.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday morning, searches for the incident were heavily censored on Chinese social media platforms. A search on Weibo for the sports centre turned up only a few posts, with a couple referring to the fact something had happened, without pictures or details. Articles by Chinese media about the incident from Monday night were taken down.</p> \n<p>However, outside China\u2019s Great Firewall, on X, videos were able to circulate. They were shared by the news blogger and dissident Li Ying, who is better known on X as Teacher Li. His account posts daily news based on user submissions. In the videos, dozens of people were lying prone on the running track in the sports centre. In one, a woman says \u201cmy foot is broken\u201d, and a firefighter can be seen performing CPR on someone, as people are told to leave the scene. Similar images were posted on Weibo but were censored.</p> \n<p>Chinese internet censors take extra care to scrub social media before and during big events, such as the meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress, where the government announces its major policy initiatives for the coming year.</p> \n<p>The incident happened on the day before China\u2019s biggest airshow, which opened in Zhuhai on Tuesday. The new aircraft debuted at the show included the PLA Air Force\u2019s J-35A fighter jets, which appeared in public for the first time.</p> \n<p>The sports centre, which serves the city district of Xiangzhou, regularly attracts hundreds of people, who run on its track, play football and dance. After the incident, the centre announced it would be closed until further notice.</p> \n<p>There have been a number of recent attacks in China in which suspects appeared to target random people, including schoolchildren. In October, a 50-year-old man was detained after he allegedly <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/28/asia/stabbing-attack-haidian-beijing-china-intl/index.html\">used a knife to attack children at a school in Beijing</a>. Five people were injured. In September, three people were killed in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0e1zjqdlp2o\">a knife attack in a Shanghai supermarket</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A driver killed 35 people and severely injured another 43 when he rammed his car into people exercising at a sports centre in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, police said on Tuesday. Police had detained a 62-year-old man at the sports centre in Zhuhai after the ramming late on Monday, on the eve of an airshow by the People\u2019s Liberation Army that is hosted annually in the city. Police identified the man only by his family name of Fan, as is usual with the Chinese authorities. Fan was discovered in the car with a knife, with wounds to his neck thought to be self-inflicted, according to the statement. Police said he was unconscious and receiving medical care. They added that their preliminary investigation suggested he had been dissatisfied with the split of financial assets in his divorce. On Tuesday, Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, urged local officials to ensure social stability and called for \u201call-out efforts\u201d to treat the injured, according to state media. It was reported that Xi had dispatched a team from Beijing oversee the handling of the incident. For almost 24 hours after the crime took place, it was unclear what the death or injury toll was. One of the four hospitals that took in people for treatment said it had more than 20 injured, state media reported on Monday. Calls made to the hospitals in the city by AP reporters went unanswered, or were directed towards other hospitals. On Tuesday morning, searches for the incident were heavily censored on Chinese social media platforms. A search on Weibo for the sports centre turned up only a few posts, with a couple referring to the fact something had happened, without pictures or details. Articles by Chinese media about the incident from Monday night were taken down. However, outside China\u2019s Great Firewall, on X, videos were able to circulate. They were shared by the news blogger and dissident Li Ying, who is better known on X as Teacher Li. His account posts daily news based on user submissions. In the videos, dozens of people were lying prone on the running track in the sports centre. In one, a woman says \u201cmy foot is broken\u201d, and a firefighter can be seen performing CPR on someone, as people are told to leave the scene. Similar images were posted on Weibo but were censored. Chinese internet censors take extra care to scrub social media before and during big events, such as the meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress, where the government announces its major policy initiatives for the coming year. The incident happened on the day before China\u2019s biggest airshow, which opened in Zhuhai on Tuesday. The new aircraft debuted at the show included the PLA Air Force\u2019s J-35A fighter jets, which appeared in public for the first time. The sports centre, which serves the city district of Xiangzhou, regularly attracts hundreds of people, who run on its track, play football and dance. After the incident, the centre announced it would be closed until further notice. There have been a number of recent attacks in China in which suspects appeared to target random people, including schoolchildren. In October, a 50-year-old man was detained after he allegedly used a knife to attack children at a school in Beijing. Five people were injured. In September, three people were killed in a knife attack in a Shanghai supermarket.",

The archdiocese presented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-orleans-clergy-abuse\">one plan</a> to reorganize the church and compensate more than 500 survivors of sexual abuse at the hands of clergymen. For their part, attorneys for a committee of survivors presented another that seeks far more money.</p> <p>Church lawyers maintain that the archdiocese and its affiliates \u2013 but not their insurers \u2013 should pay about $125,000 to each sexual abuse claimant. Survivors\u2019 attorneys countered that the church, its affiliates and insurers should pay $2m per claim. Recent bankruptcy cases involving Catholic dioceses elsewhere have cost more than $600,000 for each abuse claim.</p> <p>The two sides have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/new-orleans-archdiocese-clergy-child-sexual-abuse-secret-files\">tentatively agreed on</a> non-monetary settlement terms, including a public release of confidential personnel files outlining how the archdiocese managed the careers of clergymen faced with substantial allegations of child sexual abuse.</p> <p>Meanwhile, since at least April, Louisiana state police has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/30/new-orleans-catholic-church-child-sex-trafficking-investigation\">investigating</a> New Orleans\u2019 archdiocese for suspected child sex trafficking.

The church took steps under the leadership of Aymond and his three predecessors to keep Hecker\u2019s abusive past hidden from the public, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/may/09/new-orleans-catholic-church-abuse\">media investigations</a> by the Guardian and WWL Louisiana have shown.</p> <p>Aymond took a step to move his archdiocese past the worldwide church\u2019s ongoing clergy molestation scandal in 2018 when he published a list disclosing the names of 57 priests and deacons with credible child molestation allegations against them.

      "bodyText": "New Orleans\u2019 Roman Catholic archbishop Gregory Aymond is submitting his resignation Tuesday, on his 75th birthday, fulfilling a church requirement \u2013 though it is unclear if Vatican officials would immediately accept it with his scandal-plagued organization\u2019s expensive, highly contentious bankruptcy case still unresolved. In a letter issued on Friday to priests and deacons under his command, Aymond cited canon \u2013 or church \u2013 law that required him to offer to retire because of his age. But he said he also offered to remain in office until the resolution of the bankruptcy. Precisely when he retires is up to Pope Francis, who \u201ccan accept the resignation or ask me to remain at this time\u201d, he wrote in the missive. \u201cIt has been a privilege to serve in the archdiocese of New Orleans, and I appreciate your fraternal support and prayers during this challenging time of reorganization,\u201d Aymond\u2019s letter said. Historically, the Vatican\u2019s responses to such age-mandated resignation offers can vary, former US Vatican embassy attorney Tom Doyle told New Orleans\u2019 CBS affiliate, WWL Louisiana. The archbishop of Boston since 2003, Cardinal Se\u00e1n O\u2019Malley, recently retired at 80 years old, well beyond the mandated retirement age. \u201cThe ones they let hang around tend to be the ones who haven\u2019t appeared to screw up,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cBut \u2026 very often, they\u2019re not aware of what\u2019s going on at the diocese level.\u201d Doyle said if the pope accepts the resignation, he has two options: name a successor immediately or appoint an archdiocesan administrator as a caretaker until a new archbishop arrives. Aymond\u2019s leadership of the US\u2019s second-oldest diocese is at a critical juncture. The archdiocese presented one plan to reorganize the church and compensate more than 500 survivors of sexual abuse at the hands of clergymen. For their part, attorneys for a committee of survivors presented another that seeks far more money. Church lawyers maintain that the archdiocese and its affiliates \u2013 but not their insurers \u2013 should pay about $125,000 to each sexual abuse claimant. Survivors\u2019 attorneys countered that the church, its affiliates and insurers should pay $2m per claim. Recent bankruptcy cases involving Catholic dioceses elsewhere have cost more than $600,000 for each abuse claim. The two sides have tentatively agreed on non-monetary settlement terms, including a public release of confidential personnel files outlining how the archdiocese managed the careers of clergymen faced with substantial allegations of child sexual abuse. Meanwhile, since at least April, Louisiana state police has been investigating New Orleans\u2019 archdiocese for suspected child sex trafficking. A state police search warrant alleges \u201cwidespread sexual abuse of minors dating back decades\u201d was \u201ccovered up and not reported to law enforcement\u201d. One of the city\u2019s longtime Catholic priests, Lawrence Hecker, is tentatively scheduled to be tried on charges of child rape, kidnapping and other crimes on 3 December, decades after he confessed in writing to his superiors that he sexually molested or harassed several minors whom he met through work. The church took steps under the leadership of Aymond and his three predecessors to keep Hecker\u2019s abusive past hidden from the public, media investigations by the Guardian and WWL Louisiana have shown. Aymond took a step to move his archdiocese past the worldwide church\u2019s ongoing clergy molestation scandal in 2018 when he published a list disclosing the names of 57 priests and deacons with credible child molestation allegations against them. The roster was meant to be a conciliatory gesture to abuse survivors who demanded full transparency from him. But the list has grown to nearly 80 names and spurred so much civil litigation from clergy molestation survivors that Aymond had the archdiocese file for chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection in 2020. He initially indicated his belief that the archdiocese could settle its bankruptcy for $7.5m or less. Yet the fees alone for attorneys and other professional advisers have soared past $40m. On Tuesday, attorneys for some clergy abuse survivors involved in the archdiocesan bankruptcy requested permission to eventually depose Aymond, certain attorneys who have represented him and an outside expert who published a report with suggestions on how to settle the bankruptcy. Their request wasn\u2019t immediately ruled on. Some abuse survivors have long demanded Aymond\u2019s resignation over his management of the archdiocese\u2019s affairs in the lead-up and aftermath of the 2018 list\u2019s publication. But James Adams, who served for a time as the chairperson of a committee representing the interests of survivors in the archdiocese\u2019s bankruptcy, said he believed it would be helpful for Aymond to remain involved in the chapter 11 process no matter what the Vatican decides with respect to his retirement. \u201cIt was Archbishop Aymond who placed the archdiocese \u2026 in bankruptcy protection,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s Archbishop Aymond who has been monitoring this and instructing his counsel all the way through this process.\u201d Alluding to how Aymond has repeatedly expressed a desire to \u201cwalk with the survivors down this path of healing\u201d, Adams added: \u201cI would expect \u2026 [him] to stick around even if another archbishop is appointed here.\u201d",

There were two blocks in front of the house, then the Avenida Atl\u00e2ntica, which was asphalted and had a sidewalk, and then a huge stretch of sand before you finally got to the beach. We never imagined that one day it would reach our house.</p> \n<p>Right in front of us was the only apartment block in Atafona, the four-storey Julinho building, which I watched being built. It was destroyed by the sea in 2008. In a way, the rubble protected my house, but the sea was slowly advancing. My children started saying I should move out.

The base of the wall was already gone, because the sea was taking the sand from beneath the ground floor. I filmed it on my phone, then sent it to her, and when I looked up, I saw water coming in through the part of the wall that had fallen. It\u2019s like living in a sandcastle.</p> \n<p>To stop the advance, we thought about putting stones in front of the wall, but that would harm the neighbours, even if it protected me a little. Because the sea doesn\u2019t stop coming, it just goes around.</p> \n<p>We installed fencing, with large metal sheets, to slow it down. My bedroom, which was closest to the sea, already had a huge crack in the wall from leaks. When the fencing was touching the house, we had no choice left.

In 2022, together with my children, I decided to demolish it. It was a very difficult time. I\u2019d just found out I had ovarian cancer and needed to have both ovaries removed, I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. It took three months to knock it down.</p> \n<p>After that, I kept on living in the small house at the back, until October this year. Then I had to leave there as well, because lots of sand started coming in.</p> \n<p>I remember when I was still living there, I\u2019d pass my hand over my face and feel sand on it. Dunes began to form on the street and one reached the wall by the entrance of the house. Then another huge dune formed in the garden. I can no longer open the main gate, and the garage gate only opens a little, because there\u2019s so much sand on the path, no cars can get in.</p> \n<p>I asked a guy with a tractor to remove the sand, but he said that I was throwing money away, because every time he\u2019d take it away, the wind would blow, and the dune would form again.

It had been a mistake, many said, that the campaign had centered on vague, abstract slogans such as \u201csaving democracy\u201d and \u201cnot going back\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m reading and watching suggests the Harris team and many others misjudged much of the electorate,\u201d said Judith, a retired Harris voter from Vermont.</p> <p>\u201cThe population needed more attention on food prices, gas prices. Hearing how robust the economy is does not buy their groceries. The Hispanic and Black populations feared their job security would be threatened by allowing more immigrants into this country. These things mattered more than Trump\u2019s reputation and criminal record. I get it, sadly.\u201d</p>    <p>\u201cWe lost it because we\u2019re not speaking to the issues that Americans are so concerned about,\u201d said 77-year-old Bill Shlala, from New Jersey, a Democrat who has voted Republican in some races over the years, and who worked in special education.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about, how do I not lose my house to medical bills? How do I afford to send my child to college?

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s like being sucked into a tsunami,\u201d said Vivian Glover, a Kamala Harris voter from South Carolina, about the realisation that Donald Trump had been re-elected as president. \u201cThe contrast between the two campaigns couldn\u2019t have been more stark. On the one hand an intelligent, highly qualified public servant with a unifying message, and the opponent someone who epitomizes corruption, immorality, dishonesty, incompetence, racism, misogyny, tyranny and has clearly indicated his willingness to embrace authoritarianism.\u201d \u201cThis election felt like a chance for real change, and I was inspired by the idea of having a female president,\u201d said Sydney, 40, a teacher from New York. \u201cI believed in her vision for a more inclusive and just America, and it\u2019s difficult to let go of that hope.\u201d Despite Sydney\u2019s disappointment, Trump\u2019s decisive victory and remarkable political comeback did not surprise her. \u201cI think the biggest issue for a lot of Americans is simply the economy,\u201d she said. Glover and Sydney were among many hundreds of US voters who shared with the Guardian via an online callout and follow-up interviews how they felt about the outcome of the presidential election, what had decided their vote and what their hopes and fears were for Trump\u2019s second presidential term. Among those who had voted Republican, many said they had expected a Trump win, and that the polls had never properly reflected the atmosphere on the streets of their communities. They had voted for Trump, many said, because they felt he would handle the economy and international geopolitics better than Harris would have done, and because they wanted a crackdown on illegal immigration. Various Trump voters, among them young first-time voters, women and citizens with immigration backgrounds, said they had voted for the billionaire this time because they saw a vote for Trump as a \u201cvote against woke\u201d and against what they saw as leftwing extremism, a vote for \u201ccommon sense\u201d, and as a vote against \u201cbiased\u201d media, which they felt had unfairly persecuted Trump for years and could no longer be trusted. Scores of Trump voters expressed outrage about Democrats including Harris and Hillary Clinton likening Trump to Hitler and calling him a fascist. Some male respondents said they had voted for Trump because they were tired of men being \u201cvilified\u201d, unfairly called \u201cmisogynist\u201d and \u201cblamed for everything\u201d. Although Trump was far from perfect, many supporters said, his second term would hopefully lead to more peace globally, economic stability and an improvement to their financial situation, more secure borders, and a return to meritocracy and \u201cfamily values\u201d. Of those who said they had voted for the Harris-Walz ticket, many were shocked by the election result and had expected a Democratic victory, citing extremely tight polls and Harris\u2019s perceived strong pull among younger people and women. Various Democratic voters blamed Trump\u2019s electoral college landslide on a lack of education among his supporters, as well as on social media platforms such as X and YouTube, where the \u201cmanosphere\u201d has become highly effective at undermining progressives, their policies and campaigns. Becky Boudreau-Schultz, 50, a receptionist and the mother of a teenage boy from Mason, Michigan, felt the Democrats had underestimated the sway of these platforms. Trump, she said, \u201cput on a show\u201d that sought to tap people\u2019s fears about immigration and loss of independence. \u201cHis followers eat that up. Kamala ran on civility but, obviously, that is not America\u2019s mood. Mainstream media seemed to warn people of Trump\u2019s horrible potential but his supporters weren\u2019t and aren\u2019t watching.\u201d Instead, she felt, voters were turning to \u201csocial media echo chambers that masquerade as actual news sources\u201d. Many Democratic voters were highly critical of the Harris campaign, which, scores felt, had been out of touch with the average voter, did not sufficiently connect with concerns of young men and ethnic minorities, and had failed to address Americans\u2019 most pressing worries. It had been a mistake, many said, that the campaign had centered on vague, abstract slogans such as \u201csaving democracy\u201d and \u201cnot going back\u201d. \u201cWhat I\u2019m reading and watching suggests the Harris team and many others misjudged much of the electorate,\u201d said Judith, a retired Harris voter from Vermont. \u201cThe population needed more attention on food prices, gas prices. Hearing how robust the economy is does not buy their groceries. The Hispanic and Black populations feared their job security would be threatened by allowing more immigrants into this country. These things mattered more than Trump\u2019s reputation and criminal record. I get it, sadly.\u201d \u201cWe lost it because we\u2019re not speaking to the issues that Americans are so concerned about,\u201d said 77-year-old Bill Shlala, from New Jersey, a Democrat who has voted Republican in some races over the years, and who worked in special education. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about, how do I not lose my house to medical bills? How do I afford to send my child to college? Joe Biden has attempted to correct that a little bit, especially with outreach to unions, but we became the party of the elites. \u201cThe Republicans and the extremists understand the angst of the American people, and they\u2019re calling on that angst without any real plan. But then we presented no alternative.\u201d Many Harris voters felt that the vice-president had not been a good candidate, but mostly reckoned that it had been too late to find another one, citing Biden\u2019s late decision to pull out of the race. \u201cHarris had an impossible job with minimal time to reach voters,\u201d said Carla, 71, a retired professional in the legal sector from Ohio. \u201cBiden should have never run for re-election. There would have been a different outcome if Democrats had had the time to run primary elections and pick a strong candidate.\u201d Various people suggested that Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, had been a poor running mate. Others defended Harris. \u201cI feel Kamala Harris did an excellent job of campaigning,\u201d said 81-year-old Pat, from Colorado, who holds a college degree in journalism and is retired. \u201cBut too many felt that \u2018they were better off four years ago than now\u2019.\u201d Pat is now plagued by concerns about Trump firing experienced federal workers, deporting immigrants, exposing pregnant women to severe health risks, ignoring climate change and rolling back support for Ukraine. \u201cI\u2019m appalled. I\u2019ll never understand why someone as vulgar and unhinged as Trump is so popular with voters, including my sons in Missouri,\u201d she said. \u201cI can only hope that his bark is worse than his bite regarding democracy, immigration and abortion.\u201d Jack, a 19-year-old college student from Minnesota, was among a string of Democrats who said they had only reluctantly turned out for Harris, citing a lack of clear policy and the party\u2019s move to the right on some issues, such as immigration. \u201cThis was my first election, and I voted for Kamala with minimal enthusiasm,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Kamala was the right candidate, but this [loss] is owed to the complete strategic failure of the Dems in focusing on getting votes of independents and moderate Republicans. A [moderate] Democrat will lose to a real Republican every time.\u201d He was \u201cnot at all surprised that Trump won\u201d, as the economy had \u201cnot improved for the average American on the ground\u201d, he said. \u201cI also believe this nation is too fundamentally misogynistic to elect a female president. We can elect a rapist before we can elect a woman.\u201d \u201cI completely reject the accusation that men like me voted for Trump because of misogyny,\u201d said a male professional with Hispanic roots in his mid-40s from Florida who wanted to stay anonymous. \u201cMy wife and I did not vote for Trump because we could not live with a female president, but because we wanted Trump to be our president.

That\u2019s why the polls keep getting it wrong.\u201d \u201cI voted for Trump and consider myself a moderate,\u201d said Hayden Duke, 45, a teacher from Maryland. \u201cI\u2019ve voted for all parties in the past. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier that we have rejected the Biden-Harris wokeness, weakness and lack of common sense which have destroyed our economy and allowed wars to take place all over the world.

They say Kamala Harris lost because of misogyny, but I\u2019m ready for a female president. I voted for [would-be Republican presidential candidate] Elizabeth Dole all the way back in 2000.\u201d Had Harris chosen the, in Duke\u2019s view, the more broadly appealing Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, as her running mate, Duke felt she might have won Pennsylvania and possibly the election \u2013 an opinion that was shared by various people. Others took the opposite view. \u201cThe Democrats refused to listen to the public on Gaza which I think lost them support,\u201d said Tom, 28, a higher education professional from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who \u201chad a feeling\u201d Trump would win.

Several people who got in touch said they had backed Trump for the first time in 2024, despite having concerns about him and his Maga movement. A 25-year-old mechanic from Iowa who wanted to stay anonymous \u201cdisliked both candidates in 2020 \u2013 their policies, personalities, and campaigns. \u201cThis year,\u201d he said, \u201cI voted for Donald Trump.\u201d A key point in his decision had been his financial stability, which has been crumbling over the past few years, he said. \u201cI believe Donald Trump\u2019s administration will do a better job helping the American people financially and improving international stability. I do, however, have concerns for young adults who are pro-choice, and those in the trans community whose rights may be under attack under the new presidency.\u201d Milly, in her 40s, from Washington state, was another first-time Trump voter. \u201cI voted for Obama twice, but the liberal movement in America has lost me, because it completely changed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] movement has completely radicalized itself, from initially wanting to push back against actual sexual and racial discrimination to pursuing an absurd, deeply unfair equality-of-outcome agenda. These extremists are alienating so many people with pretty liberal views.\u201d Being pro-choice, Milly said she was planning on lobbying the Republican party to soften its stance on harsh abortion bans in some states. \u201cI still identify as a liberal, but I\u2019m a liberal with limits: society\u2019s norms can\u2019t be overhauled entirely just to suit tiny minorities and extreme political fringe movements. I hope Donald Trump will bring common sense and realism back into American political discourse.\u201d Jacqueline, 63, a retired photographer and writer from Arizona who described herself as disabled, fears that the new reality under Trump may become unsurvivable for people like herself who depend on the social security net, which she believes the new administration wants to get rid of. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about social security for the elderly, for disability, for veterans, death benefits for widows, food stamps. I live in a very poor area. People can\u2019t feed their families without food stamps. People like me, my neighbors, this whole community, many people that voted for them, will have no way to survive.\u201d Another huge worry of hers is Trump\u2019s possible environmental policy. \u201cClimate change affects everything, and if we don\u2019t fix that, nothing else matters. He\u2019s going to reverse everything that the Biden administration has set up to mitigate climate change and to make the transition to renewable energy.\u201d Jacqueline also struggles to wrap her head around the new reality that America now has a president with a criminal conviction. \u201cIf you\u2019re a felon, you can\u2019t get a good job, you have to put that on every job application, that label follows you around. But you can be president of the United States. It\u2019s literally insane.\u201d Josh, an engineer in his 50s from Pennsylvania, has an answer for people who cannot understand why more than 74 million Americans were not put off by Trump\u2019s criminal record. \u201cThe people calling Trump \u2018a convicted felon\u2019 need to understand: many people like me voted for Trump not despite this kangaroo court conviction, but because of it. His trial was a shameful persecution of a political opponent by a Democratic prosecution. It fired me up.\u201d JT, 28, a full-time employee from Texas, was one of various people who said they considered Trump \u201cthe lesser evil\u201d, and voted Trump in 2020 and 2024, despite disliking the available candidates in both elections. \u201cI voted for Trump based on two reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel I was better off economically when he was in charge. And I\u2019m originally from California, and watched as the Democratic party\u2019s rule there made it so much harder for people like me to get ahead.\u201d Alongside exploding prices, high taxes, and higher crime and homelessness rates, he pointed to California having become \u201cway too focused on identity politics. \u201cHarris is from California, and I don\u2019t want the USA to become like California. I\u2019m a mixed-race person of colour and have never liked identity politics. I don\u2019t care about race or gender or orientation; I want results.\u201d He wants stronger borders and immigration enforcement, considering it \u201cinsulting\u201d that people like his foreign-born family had to wait for years in difficult circumstances before being able to immigrate legally while others cross the border illegally. \u201cHarris fixated on democracy being in danger and abortion, ignoring the two huge concerns of economy and immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a ton of concerns about Trump, mostly about his personality and lack of morals, his weird tirades and personal attacks. He outright lies, a lot. But as long as he is able to improve the economy like in 2016 and improve on the immigration issue, I\u2019ll consider it a win.\u201d Elizabeth McCutchon, 61, a psychiatric nurse practitioner and mother of five, voted for Harris, but is married to a Republican. \u201cThe mistake of the Democrats has been to keep asking the question, \u2018How could you?\u2019 rather than, \u2018What did we not understand about American voters?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some Harris voters who are now saying they will have nothing to do with people who voted for Trump. I think this sort of behavior will be used by Trump voters to demonstrate how out of touch Harris voters are. \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump will provide the change that his voters were promised. But he is different than the status quo.\u201d",

Police say Maccabi fans tore a Palestinian flag down from the facade of a building and burned it, shouted \u201cfuck you, Palestine\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/binnenland/artikel/5479291/hooligans-van-maccabi-tel-aviv-amsterdam-slaags-met\">and vandalised a taxi</a>.</p> \n<p>After a radio callout a number of taxi drivers converged on a casino on the nearby Max Euweplein, where about 400 Israeli supporters had gathered. Police dispersed the taxi drivers and escorted supporters out of the casino.</p> \n<p>Verified social media videos show Maccabi fans setting off flares and fireworks and chanting in Hebrew \u201col\u00e9, ol\u00e9, let the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] win, we will fuck the Arabs\u201d. The Dutch national broadcaster NOS, other local media outlets and Amsterdam city hall officials also reported that fans chanted that there were \u201cno children\u201d left in Gaza.</p> \n<p>Amsterdam has a large Muslim community and has allowed more than 2,500 protests against the war in Gaza so far this year. </p> \n<h2>What happened the next day?</h2> \n<p>There were further clashes on Thursday afternoon on the central Dam Square, where a large crowd of Maccabi supporters had gathered. Police said pro-Palestine demonstrators tried to reach the square. Two arrests were made. </p> \n<p>Maccabi supporters were filmed chanting anti-Arab slogans on their way to the Johan Cruyff Arena. Police escorted the 2,600 fans to the game and dispersed protesters defying a ban on a pro-Palestinian demonstration outside the stadium.</p> \n<p>After the match, which Ajax won 5-0, there were numerous attacks, described by Halsema as \u201chit and run\u201d, on Maccabi supporters across the city centre. Footage showed masked youths on scooters and ebikes seeking out, chasing down and beating victims \u2013 mostly in Maccabi colours \u2013 until about 4am.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8b490996-cd53-4ec2-8543-146304ec302a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SH1Z5wUdtvc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Witness accounts and screenshots of mobile phone message exchanges suggest some were targeted as Jews, being asked if they were Jewish or to show their passports. False reports circulated that Maccabi supporters had gone missing or been taken hostage. Five people were hospitalised and 20 to 30 slightly injured.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/11/eyewitnesses-film-maccabi-fans-causing-trouble-in-amsterdam/\">Footage has also emerged</a> of Maccabi supporters close to Amsterdam central railway station setting off fireworks, chanting anti-Palestine slogans and taking iron scaffolding tubes and wooden planks from a building site to use as weapons. Other <a href=\"https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/beelden-harde-kern-maccabi-schuren-ze-trapten-tegen-onze-deur-en-probeerden-ons-huis-binnen-te-komen~bd3cb6e2\">footage shows Maccabi fans</a> running through the streets swinging belts. </p> \n<p>Tensions remain: on Monday night, dozens of people carrying sticks and firecrackers set an empty tram on fire and smashed its windows in western Amsterdam. Footage showed many people on the square throwing fireworks, poles and wooden pallets.</p> \n<h2>How did the authorities respond?</h2> \n<p>About 800 police made a total of 62 arrestsbefore, during and after the match, mostly for public order offences. The city hall report released on Monday said 10 Israelis had been among those detained. Most of the 62 were released with a fine but four men \u2013 Dutch nationals aged between 16 and 26 \u2013 are still in custody.</p> \n<p>One man was arrested on Saturday after being identified from CCTV images and police announced a further five arrests on Monday, all men aged 18 to 37 from Amsterdam or surrounding towns. </p> \n<p>A partial state of emergency was declared in Amsterdam and the surrounding area, giving police the right to carry out random stop-and-search operations. Extra police were drafted in, security stepped up at Jewish buildings, and protests banned.</p> \n<p>At a press conference on Friday, Halsema said the violence \u201cbrings back memories of pogroms.

      "bodyText": "Violence in Amsterdam around a Europa League football match between the local team Ajax and Israel\u2019s Maccabi Tel Aviv sparked horror around the world, against a backdrop of soaring antisemitic and Islamophobic abuse and attacks across Europe fuelled by the Middle East conflict. The Amsterdam mayor, Femke Halsema, has said she had not been told the match was high-risk, although earlier last week the Turkish club Be\u015fikta\u015f moved their match against Maccabi to a neutral country, citing fear of \u201cprovocative actions\u201d. In a report published on Monday, Amsterdam city hall said a full independent inquiry was under way into the events themselves, as well as the actions of Dutch authorities including police and intelligence services before, during and after the match. The report said, in an initial conclusion, that \u201cwhat has happened over the past few days was the consequence of a toxic cocktail of antisemitism, hooliganism and anger over the war in Palestine, Israel and other countries in the Middle East\u201d. Here is what we know so far about how events unfolded and how politicians reacted. What happened on Wednesday night? The first incidents were reported on Wednesday evening, the day before the match. Police say Maccabi fans tore a Palestinian flag down from the facade of a building and burned it, shouted \u201cfuck you, Palestine\u201d, and vandalised a taxi. After a radio callout a number of taxi drivers converged on a casino on the nearby Max Euweplein, where about 400 Israeli supporters had gathered. Police dispersed the taxi drivers and escorted supporters out of the casino. Verified social media videos show Maccabi fans setting off flares and fireworks and chanting in Hebrew \u201col\u00e9, ol\u00e9, let the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] win, we will fuck the Arabs\u201d. The Dutch national broadcaster NOS, other local media outlets and Amsterdam city hall officials also reported that fans chanted that there were \u201cno children\u201d left in Gaza. Amsterdam has a large Muslim community and has allowed more than 2,500 protests against the war in Gaza so far this year. What happened the next day? There were further clashes on Thursday afternoon on the central Dam Square, where a large crowd of Maccabi supporters had gathered. Police said pro-Palestine demonstrators tried to reach the square. Two arrests were made. Maccabi supporters were filmed chanting anti-Arab slogans on their way to the Johan Cruyff Arena. Police escorted the 2,600 fans to the game and dispersed protesters defying a ban on a pro-Palestinian demonstration outside the stadium. After the match, which Ajax won 5-0, there were numerous attacks, described by Halsema as \u201chit and run\u201d, on Maccabi supporters across the city centre. Footage showed masked youths on scooters and ebikes seeking out, chasing down and beating victims \u2013 mostly in Maccabi colours \u2013 until about 4am. Witness accounts and screenshots of mobile phone message exchanges suggest some were targeted as Jews, being asked if they were Jewish or to show their passports. False reports circulated that Maccabi supporters had gone missing or been taken hostage. Five people were hospitalised and 20 to 30 slightly injured. Footage has also emerged of Maccabi supporters close to Amsterdam central railway station setting off fireworks, chanting anti-Palestine slogans and taking iron scaffolding tubes and wooden planks from a building site to use as weapons. Other footage shows Maccabi fans running through the streets swinging belts. Tensions remain: on Monday night, dozens of people carrying sticks and firecrackers set an empty tram on fire and smashed its windows in western Amsterdam. Footage showed many people on the square throwing fireworks, poles and wooden pallets. How did the authorities respond? About 800 police made a total of 62 arrestsbefore, during and after the match, mostly for public order offences. The city hall report released on Monday said 10 Israelis had been among those detained. Most of the 62 were released with a fine but four men \u2013 Dutch nationals aged between 16 and 26 \u2013 are still in custody. One man was arrested on Saturday after being identified from CCTV images and police announced a further five arrests on Monday, all men aged 18 to 37 from Amsterdam or surrounding towns. A partial state of emergency was declared in Amsterdam and the surrounding area, giving police the right to carry out random stop-and-search operations. Extra police were drafted in, security stepped up at Jewish buildings, and protests banned. At a press conference on Friday, Halsema said the violence \u201cbrings back memories of pogroms. It is deeply damaging to the city. Jewish culture has been deeply threatened. This is an outburst of antisemitism that I hope to never see again.\u201d About 75% of Dutch Jews, most living in Amsterdam, were killed in the Holocaust, the highest proportion in western Europe. The public prosecutor, Ren\u00e9 de Beukelaer, said the investigation would focus on antisemitism as a motive. Police were analysing footage to identify the perpetrators and social media to establish how far the attacks were organised, he said. Officials are also looking into claims that Israel had warned Dutch authorities of potential trouble. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he was dispatching two planes with soldiers and medical teams to evacuate Israelis, but they never materialised and the Maccabi supporters ended up going home on El Al flights. What was the political fallout? Netanyahu rapidly condemned a \u201cplanned antisemitic attack against Israeli citizens\u201d, later comparing the violence to the murder of an estimated 91 Jews in Nazi Germany in 1938, describing it as \u201cKristallnacht \u2026 on the streets of Amsterdam\u201d. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, called the events \u201can antisemitic pogrom\u201d and \u201ca warning sign for any country that wishes to uphold the values of freedom\u201d. The Dutch king said Jewish people must feel safe in the Netherlands. \u201cWe failed the Jewish community of the Netherlands during the second world war,\u201d Willem-Alexander said, \u201cand last night we failed again\u201d. The US president, Joe Biden, called the violence \u201cdespicable\u201d and an echo of \u201cdark moments in history\u201d. The Dutch prime minister, Dick Schoof, called it \u201cshameful\u201d, \u201cunacceptable\u201d and a \u201cturning point\u201d. He invited Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Gideon Sa\u2019ar, for talks in The Hague, where the two agreed on the urgency of fighting rising antisemitism. Schoof added on Monday that he was aware of the allegations of racism and violence against Maccabi fans, \u201cbut there is a big difference between destroying things and hunting Jews. Nothing, absolutely nothing can excuse for the deliberate searching and hunting down of Jews,\u201d he said. Geert Wilders, whose anti-Islam Freedom party finished first in the most recent Dutch elections but who has no formal role in the government himself, called in a series of inflammatory social media posts for Halsema to resign. There had been \u201ca Jew hunt\u201d in Amsterdam, posted Wilders, who has called Islam \u201can ideology of a retarded culture\u201d and Moroccans \u201cscum\u201d. He added: \u201cMuslims with Palestinian flags hunting down Jews.\u201d He vowed to \u201cstop and expel Islamic radicals\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 November 2024. An earlier version said \u201cverified social media videos\u201d showed Maccabi fans chanting that there were \u201cno children\u201d left in Gaza any more.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Donald Trump has reportedly picked China critics Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz for the respective roles of secretary of state and national security adviser. Rubio, who was arguably the most hawkish option on the president-elect\u2019s list, advocating the adoption of a hardline foreign policy against the US\u2019s geopolitical adversaries, has relaxed some of his positions over the years to align more closely with Trump\u2019s. On the campaign trail, Trump accused past leaders of dragging the US into costly wars, and many Republicans have complained that American allies in Europe are not paying enough for their defense. Sources told Reuters that Trump on Monday appeared settled on the Florida senator as his pick, though this could always change. Waltz, a Republican congressman in Florida, has criticized Chinese activity in the Asia-Pacific and has called for the US to be ready for conflict in the region. Who has been confirmed for Trump\u2019s cabinet? The immigration hardliner Stephen Miller (as deputy chief of staff for policy); Susie Wiles (chief of staff); Lee Zeldin (Environmental Protection Agency administrator); and Tom Homan (\u201cborder tsar\u201d). What does his EPA pick mean for the environment? Trump said Zeldin\u2019s appointment would \u201censure fair and swift deregulatory decisions\u201d. Zeldin said in 2018 that he did not support the Paris climate agreement. Democrat Ruben Gallego beats far-right Republican Kari Lake to win Arizona senate seat Arizona has elected its first Latino senator, Ruben Gallego, after the Democrat defeated the far-right figure Kari Lake who had called herself \u201cTrump in a dress\u201d. The final Senate race to be announced leaves the Republicans with 53 seats in the upper chamber of Congress against the Democrats\u2019 47. Gallego, a progressive congressman, will replace the Democrat turned independent senator Kyrsten Sinema, who consistently blocked her party\u2019s goals while it had a razor-thin majority.

Israeli attacks on Lebanon have killed more than 3,000 people and displaced a further 1.2 million. In a social media post, Katz said: \u201cWe will continue to hit Hezbollah with full force until the goals of the war are achieved.\u201d Katz said the war\u2019s aims were to disarm Hezbollah, force the group to withdraw beyond the Litani River, and return Israeli residents of the country\u2019s north \u201csafely to their homes\u201d. Tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee in northern Israel by rockets launched from southern Lebanon. When and why was Katz appointed? Katz replaced Yoav Gallant last week after Benjamin Netanyahu fired him, citing disagreements over strategy. The international criminal court has requested arrest warrants for Gallant and Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.

Climate check: Shell wins appeal against court ruling ordering cut in carbon emissions As the UN secretary general told the Cop29 climate conference that 2024 has been a \u201cmasterclass in climate destruction\u201d, news emerged that Shell had successfully appealed against a landmark climate ruling in the Netherlands. In 2021, the country ordered the oil and gas company to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030. Shell appealed \u2013 arguing that it was a political not judicial matter, and that another company would exploit any fossil fuels it did not extract \u2013 and won.

      "bodyText": "The British arthouse cinema chain Curzon has been acquired by the US investment firm that owns Poundstretcher and Majestic Wine. Fortress Investment Group has bought the chain, which has more than 350 employees at 16 cinemas across the UK, for an undisclosed sum. Curzon was put up for auction along with its distribution arm and streaming platform earlier this year. One of the UK\u2019s oldest cinema chains, Curzon became part of the auction process after its parent company, Cohen Media Group, was forced to offload assets by a New York state supreme court judge in August. The billionaire Charles Cohen acquired Curzon in 2019, a year after buying Landmark Theatres in the US, and used the cinema chains and other property assets to secure a $534m (\u00a3417m) loan from Fortress. Earlier this year, Fortress sued Cohen for default, resulting in the court ruling that the assets should be auctioned in bid to recoup at least part of the value of the loans. Curzon was established in 1934 by Harold Wingate and its first site, in London\u2019s Mayfair, is still in operation after fighting off potential closure because of legal action over noise from a property developer in 2016. The chain built its reputation by bringing international cinema to British audiences. In recent years, the company, which according to court documents is loss-making, has expanded its theatrical presence with new venues in Hoxton and Camden in London, as well as Kingston upon Thames and Canterbury. Curzon was an early mover in the streaming space, launching its own service in 2010, and was happy to strike deals to put Netflix films on screen at a time when most chains were wary of the disruption the US giant was causing to the traditional movie industry. \u201cCurzon is an iconic film company, with global recognition for its long legacy of releasing and connecting independent and critically acclaimed films to UK audiences,\u201d said Allison Swayze, the managing director at Fortress. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to acquire Curzon, and bring our support to the company\u2019s dedicated team.\u201d Fortress said the deal would secure the jobs of 350 staff and \u201chelps Curzon continue to offer film fans a range of independent and blockbuster movies both in cinema and at home\u201d.

White male anger, especially at the nation\u2019s inclusion of African Americans, has repeatedly privileged white supremacy over the viability of the United States. During the war of independence, when the nation was fighting to become the United States, South Carolina\u2019s government fumed at Congress\u2019s request to arm the enslaved and give them their freedom in exchange for fending off a British force that was more than 10 times the size of what those in Charleston could muster. Government officials flat out refused and barked that they weren\u2019t sure that the US \u201cwas a nation worth fighting for\u201d and would rather take their chances with the king of England. In short, enslaving those of African descent was infinitely more important than the United States.</p> <p>Later on, during the subsequent battles over drafting the Constitution, far too many white slaveholding men were willing to hold the United States hostage unless they got their way. That meant reinforcing slavery and the power of slaveholders, despite the document\u2019s language of \u201cjustice,\u201d \u201ctranquility,\u201d and \u201cliberty.\u201d They threatened. They raged. They schemed. And they succeeded.</p> <p>The three-fifths clause, which partially counted each enslaved human being by that fraction, gave the slaveholding south disproportionate and unearned power in the US House of Representatives. The Fugitive Slave Clause allowed them to hunt down beyond their state borders those seeking that elusive freedom from bondage. The additional 20 years of the Atlantic Slave Trade meant they could secure more human cargo directly from Africa to engorge the coffers of those placing racialized slavery above democracy.</p> <p>The disastrous contradictions embedded in the founding of the United States could not help but erupt into civil war. Once again, a group of white men <a href=\"https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states\">were angry</a>. Angry that the country <a href=\"https://nerd.wwnorton.com/ebooks/epub/amerele3hs/EPUB/content/4.1.5-chapter13.xhtml\">had elected a man</a> who did not want to see slavery spread beyond the South. Angry that Abraham Lincoln\u2019s position meant a diminution of the south\u2019s national political power. Angry that Lincoln was a Republican, a party founded on anti-slavery.

      "body": "<p>In 2018, then acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) Thomas Homan <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/thomas-homan-trump-ice-director_n_5acbae94e4b09d0a11964dc4\">told HuffPost</a> that Congress needed to fix immigration laws because: \u201cI\u2019m the first one to say, I can\u2019t arrest 11 million people.\u201d</p> <p>Now, newly tapped as Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d, he will be tasked with just that. The president-elect said on Monday that Homan, a former law enforcement official who has served in immigration enforcement under multiple presidencies, would be \u201cin charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin\u201d.</p> <p>Homan has been describing mass deportation in stark terms for the past year, angling for a role in helping Trump with his signature campaign promise. Asked about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/30/trump-deportation-plan-economic-disaster\">high price tag</a> of a mass deportation, he turned the question back on 60 Minutes: \u201cWhat price do you put on our national security? Is it worth it?\u201d When the outlet followed up to ask if there was a way for mass deportations not to separate families with mixed immigration statuses, Homan responded: \u201cFamilies can be deported together.\u201d</p> <p>It is a likely next step for a man who served as acting director of Ice for 16 months under Trump in what was seen as a period of intense controversy for the agency. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/09/trump-administration-family-separation-policy-immigration/670604/\">The Atlantic documented</a> how Homan was the \u201cfather\u201d of the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy, tracing its roots to a 2014 meeting during which Homan pushed the idea. He defended the policy to the outlet by saying: \u201cThe goal wasn\u2019t to traumatize. The goal was to stop the madness, stop the death, stop the rape, stop the children dying, stop the cartels doing what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> <p>This year, his speech at the Republican national convention started with a folksy \u201chow you doin\u2019\u201d and a shoutout to New York, his home state.

      "bodyText": "In 2018, then acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) Thomas Homan told HuffPost that Congress needed to fix immigration laws because: \u201cI\u2019m the first one to say, I can\u2019t arrest 11 million people.\u201d Now, newly tapped as Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d, he will be tasked with just that. The president-elect said on Monday that Homan, a former law enforcement official who has served in immigration enforcement under multiple presidencies, would be \u201cin charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin\u201d. Homan has been describing mass deportation in stark terms for the past year, angling for a role in helping Trump with his signature campaign promise. Asked about the high price tag of a mass deportation, he turned the question back on 60 Minutes: \u201cWhat price do you put on our national security? Is it worth it?\u201d When the outlet followed up to ask if there was a way for mass deportations not to separate families with mixed immigration statuses, Homan responded: \u201cFamilies can be deported together.\u201d It is a likely next step for a man who served as acting director of Ice for 16 months under Trump in what was seen as a period of intense controversy for the agency. The Atlantic documented how Homan was the \u201cfather\u201d of the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy, tracing its roots to a 2014 meeting during which Homan pushed the idea. He defended the policy to the outlet by saying: \u201cThe goal wasn\u2019t to traumatize. The goal was to stop the madness, stop the death, stop the rape, stop the children dying, stop the cartels doing what they\u2019re doing.\u201d This year, his speech at the Republican national convention started with a folksy \u201chow you doin\u2019\u201d and a shoutout to New York, his home state. He then launched into an impassioned speech defending Trump and lambasting the Biden administration on immigration, saying Joe Biden\u2019s policies were essentially \u201cnational suicide\u201d. \u201cAs a guy who spent 34 years deporting illegal aliens, I got a message to the millions of illegal aliens that Joe Biden\u2019s released in our country in violation of federal law: you better start packing now \u2013 you\u2019re damn right \u2013 because you\u2019re going home,\u201d he said, to raucous applause.

You can rebuild a house, but as a farmer, when you lose your yields over many seasons, you lose everything,\u201d says George Mitri, director of the Land and Natural Resources programme at Lebanon\u2019s University of Balamand.</p>    <p>Mitri has been assessing the land destruction. \u201cWe are using satellite data, since field visits are not possible at the moment,\u201d he says. \u201cUntil the beginning of October, 4,500 hectares [11,100 acres] of land had been burned as a direct result of the bombings.

Zein and his wife, Maryam Bashan, left behind orchards of citrus fruits and avocado. Soon, right after the ashta, the avocados will ripen. \u201cWe have always lived from the land. We planted it with our own hands,\u201d Zein says. The air raids on their village came as part of an Israeli military campaign launched against south Lebanon, the Bekaa valley and Beirut, with Israel\u2019s stated aim of targeting Hezbollah, the armed group and political party with infrastructure in these regions. As of 11 November, 3,189 people had been killed and 14,078 wounded in Lebanon, according to the ministry of public health. More than a million have had to leave their homes. Across south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley, important agricultural regions, fields and crops are being hit in the attacks. \u201cThe damage we see from this destruction is much more than destroying buildings. You can rebuild a house, but as a farmer, when you lose your yields over many seasons, you lose everything,\u201d says George Mitri, director of the Land and Natural Resources programme at Lebanon\u2019s University of Balamand. Mitri has been assessing the land destruction. \u201cWe are using satellite data, since field visits are not possible at the moment,\u201d he says. \u201cUntil the beginning of October, 4,500 hectares [11,100 acres] of land had been burned as a direct result of the bombings. And we\u2019re now in November, so I estimate that we are way above 5,000 hectares.\u201d This includes forests, grasslands and fields with crops such as tobacco (a major cash crop for villages on the border), citrus and olives. As much as 80% of GDP in the south comes from agriculture, and 22% of all citrus grown in the country and 38% of olives come from the south. \u201cOlive trees catch fire very easily. I call these monumental trees because they survive over such a long time. They are like relics. And now you see them burn in just a few seconds,\u201d Mitri says. On the hillsides of Baanoub, a tiny village in the mountains near Sidon, the largest city in southern Lebanon, grow ancient olive trees, many dating back more than 2,000 years. Yasmina Zaher manages the land with her husband. \u201cI think of everything that these trees have endured: occupations, calamities, wars, fires, earthquakes. And they are still here,\u201d she says. Zaher is separating harvested olives from leaves and stems, the last step before taking them to the olive press. \u201cWe are at the southernmost limit of where people can harvest this year. Farther south, very few people are able to harvest their olives,\u201d she says. Mitri says at least 22% of the olive production was lost this year. Olives are an important crop, a tenth of agricultural output in a country of more than 12m olive trees. Jad Awada, at Jibal, an environmental and social justice organisation, says: \u201cWe rely on olive oil for consumption but it also has a tremendous unseen and emotional value. Olive oil is our history. \u201cFor a lot of people, olives are a huge source of income. Many farmers who lost their lands are completely without support at the moment.\u201d Most agricultural workers, and almost all Syrians living in the country \u2013 who play a key role in Lebanon\u2019s farming economy \u2013 work informally in a sector where social protection is absent. Four men work with Zaher in the olive groves. They climb the old trees and hit the branches to send the fruit to nets below. The men arrived in Baanoub recently, after being displaced twice from the south. Several months ago, they had to leave the rural area where they were working near Bint Jbeil as it came under attack. When the bombardment reached the town where they were sheltering, they had to escape again. \u201cWe left with our children on our motorbikes. We left everything. But the important thing is that we are safe, for now,\u201d one of the men, Zahreddine Kolin, says. Awada opens a video on his computer. It shows the destruction of the border village of Kfarkela. One of the ruined homes, with broken trees around it, is that of his grandparents. Satellite footage shows the similar destruction of other border villages. Before the large-scale attacks began on 23 September, more than 50,000 homes had been partly or fully destroyed in Lebanon. Now, according to a Washington Post analysis of satellite footage, nearly a quarter of all the south\u2019s buildings have been destroyed. Many are family homes built on ancestral land, passed down through generations. Balakrishnan Rajagopal, the UN special rapporteur on housing, said on social media that Israel was committing domicide in Lebanon. Mitri says tests need to be conducted to see the impact of the destruction on water, air and soil. Several bodies, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the UN\u2019s Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (Escwa), last year documented Israel\u2019s use of white phosphorus, a substance prohibited in civilian areas by UN convention. Besides severely wounding people by sticking to skin and clothing, it has long-term effects on the environment, including soil contamination, which causes diminished fertility. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker environment minister, Nasser Yassin, says about 5 sq km of land have been burned with white phosphorus. The war was already forcing farmers to abandon their crops and animals. In early 2024, 26% of farmers in southern Lebanon could not access fields because of the conflict. Nojoud Mohammad al-Obeid, a farmer in Ain Arab in the Nabatieh region, was displaced in September when the intensified bombardments started. But she has not been able to harvest her olives for more than a year. \u201cWe have not been able to reach our land at all since the beginning of the war in Gaza. We don\u2019t know if it has been hit; no one is able to go to that area,\u201d she says. Her family produced dairy products \u2013 cheese and the rural fermented speciality kishk. \u201cWe lost one of our cows when we had to escape. These animals are very dear to us,\u201d Obeid says. Her family is staying with relatives in the Bekaa valley. But here too farmers cannot go to their fields, says her sister, Nazha al-Obeid. \u201cThey bombed right near the fields where we were working one day. We saw the whole sky lit up. We just ran away.\u201d Escwa says that the war, coupled with the economic crisis in Lebanon since 2019, has driven poverty in south Lebanon up to about 90%. In Hammana, the sun is low in the sky. Zein and his wife sit on the porch with cups of strong coffee. They discuss Mansouri and their childhood memories. \u201cThe border is very close, you can almost walk there. Once, I remember my uncle coming from Palestine on the train with a watermelon this size,\u201d says Bashan and stretches her arms wide. \u201cWe can grow the very best produce here,\u201d says Zein. \u201cWe have a saying \u2013 that the land is a treasure chest. It gives what you need in abundance.\u201d",

One of the losers was prop 4, Florida\u2019s abortion rights measure, which received a whopping 57% of the vote but failed to meet the state\u2019s unusually high 60% threshold, meaning that the state\u2019s six-week ban will remain in place. Asked about the Florida abortion rights proposition ahead of the election, Trump said that when he went to cast his ballot near Palm Beach, he would vote against it.</p> <p>It has always been a little hard to believe that Donald Trump personally hates abortion, even if it is abundantly clear how little he thinks of women. Trump, after all, has claimed to have numerous conflicting positions on abortion rights throughout his life. And his brand of masculinity is boorish, vulgar, and above all, sexually entitled \u2013 far from the priggish, repressed moralism of more classical anti-abortion figures like Mike Pence.</p> <p>Maybe this is why, though Trump appointed three of the six justices who overturned Roe v Wade and has boasted about his role in ending the right to an abortion, many voters seem to not quite believe that he will continue to suppress the procedure further in his coming second term. Abortion rights measures won in several states that Trump carried on Tuesday \u2013 including Arizona, Nevada, Montana and Missouri, all states that Trump won. A lot of people, it seems, voted for abortion rights in their own states, and then also voted for Donald Trump \u2013 who, make no mistake, will move to restrict abortion access nationwide when he returns to the White House next year.</p> <p>Trump, of course, has insisted that this will not happen \u2013 which on its own might be a decent indication that it will. But there is evidence that the new Trump administration will pursue a broad agenda restricting women\u2019s rights, including nationwide attacks on abortion access, even beyond that offered by Trump\u2019s habitual pattern of self-serving dishonesty.</p> <p>Republicans have won control of the Senate and are likely to capture the House of Representatives; if they do, they may well advance legislation to ban abortion nationwide. (And to pass it: there is no reason to believe that a Republican governing trifecta will preserve the filibuster.) A bill like this would probably not be termed a \u201cban\u201d by its sponsors: Republicans, wary of the public disapproval of abortion bans, have started calling their new abortion restrictions by chillingly imprecise euphemisms, such as \u201cstandard\u201d or even \u201cprotection\u201d. But the effect of the laws are the same: to outlaw abortions. This could take the form of a gestational limit, or of the federal recognition of fetal personhood. Trump may well sign such legislation into law, eliminating abortion rights even in Democratic-controlled states and those that have recently passed abortion rights referendums with the stroke of a pen.</p> <p>But Republicans do not even need to manage to pass a bill through Congress to make abortion much more difficult to get. Trump can simply restrict abortion through federal agencies. He will soon be in control of the FDA, for example, which regulates the abortion drug mifepristone, part of a two-drug regimen that now accounts for most abortions in the United States. Mifepristone is a safe, effective drug that allows abortions to be performed in the privacy of patients\u2019 homes, with little of the expensive clinical involvement and overhead that makes surgical abortions more time-intensive and costly for providers and patients alike.</p> <p>Naturally, the anti-abortion movement hates it. Since Dobbs, a coalition of anti-choice groups and Republican attorneys general have been suing the FDA, seeking to overturn the agency\u2019s 2000 approval of the drug. Trump will be able to rescind access to it almost immediately, taking the drug off the legal US market. If he gives the anti-choice movement what they want, he may also direct the FDA to revoke approval of the most reliable forms of female-controlled contraception, like Plan B, IUDs, and certain birth control pills, which the anti-choice movement falsely claims cause abortions.</p> <p>Trump is likely to also revive enforcement of the Comstock Act, a long-dormant 1873 law that bans the shipment of anything that could be used to induce an abortion through the US mail. The Comstock Act has not been enforced in decades \u2013 parts of it were repealed in the 20th century, and other sections were long rendered moot by supreme court precedents like Roe and Casey<em> </em>\u2013 and would have the effect of criminalizing much abortion care. Since Dobbs, several Democratic-controlled states have passed what are called shield laws, which protect doctors who mail abortion drugs from states where the procedure is legal into states that have bans. This mail-order abortion operation is, for now, technically legal: it has preserved women\u2019s independence and dignity and no doubt saved thousands of lives.</p> <p>But when the Comstock Act is enforced, much of this sector of abortion provision will disappear. Combined with the revocation of FDA approval for mifepristone, this will inevitably mean that many women seeking abortions will turn to black market surgical abortion providers, and suffer the risks attendant to such procedures. A return to pre-Roe levels of abortion ban-related mortality could probably follow.</p> <p>Trump is also likely to reverse the Biden administration\u2019s guidance on Emtala, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, a federal law that requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing care to all patients facing health crises. Emtala has been the subject of much post-Dobbs litigation, as states like Idaho and Texas have sought to argue that their abortion bans supersede the federal law, thus requiring hospitals in their states to withhold emergency abortions from women in medical emergencies who will suffer or die without them. The US supreme court declined to decide the issue last summer; a Trump administration may help to resolve it for them.</p> <p>This is all just what Trump could do on his own in his first years back in office. But the impact of a Trump term on American women\u2019s access to abortion will be felt long after Trump himself is no longer with us.

      "body": "<p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d always thought of the Troubles as a male story,\u201d says the US author and journalist Patrick Radden Keefe, when asked what first attracted him to the events covered in his 2018 bestselling nonfiction book Say Nothing. \u201cSo, part of it for me was the novelty of the idea that there was this woman in the IRA and she had gone on hunger strike with her sister in 1973.\u201d</p> <p>Now an executive producer on the TV adaptation of his book, Keefe first heard about its subjects in 2013, when he read a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/world/europe/dolours-price-defiant-ira-bomber-dies-at-61.html\">New York Times obituary</a> of the IRA volunteer Dolours Price, which mentioned the abduction and disappearance of widowed mother of 10 Jean McConville. \u201cRight there, in this little article, were the seeds for the whole thing: the idea that there were these two very different women, and how they were connected by these acts of violence.\u201d</p> <p>This duality is present from the outset of the new series, made \u2013 somewhat incongruously \u2013 for Disney+. It opens in 1972, within the bustling home that McConville shares with her children in Belfast\u2019s Divis flats. What follows will be familiar to those who grew up knowing one of the most harrowing stories of the conflict, or anyone who\u2019s read Keefe\u2019s book in the years since: a group of IRA members enter McConville\u2019s flat and march her away from her children for a \u201ctalk\u201d, amid accusations that she\u2019s a British informant. She is never seen again.</p>    <p>Instead, over the course of nine episodes, it is Dolours Price who takes centre stage. Her trajectory from nonviolent protester to the inner sanctum of the Provisional IRA forms the backbone of the series. That evolution is told via the true-to-life framing device of the interviews she gave decades later, on the proviso they be released after her death (Price died in 2013). The interviews clearly delineate her connection to the McConville case itself.</p> <p>It\u2019s an unflinching, sometimes harrowing watch, buoyed throughout by exquisite performances from its leads. \u201cI was familiar with the story,\u201d says Lola Petticrew, the actor tasked with bringing the younger Dolours to life (with Maxine Peake playing her older, more regretful counterpart), \u201cbut after reading the book it turned out there was a lot I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Petticrew is, like Price, a west Belfast native who was aware of the story of Dolours \u2013 and that of her sister, and fellow IRA volunteer, Marian \u2013 from an early age.

      "bodyText": "\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d always thought of the Troubles as a male story,\u201d says the US author and journalist Patrick Radden Keefe, when asked what first attracted him to the events covered in his 2018 bestselling nonfiction book Say Nothing. \u201cSo, part of it for me was the novelty of the idea that there was this woman in the IRA and she had gone on hunger strike with her sister in 1973.\u201d Now an executive producer on the TV adaptation of his book, Keefe first heard about its subjects in 2013, when he read a New York Times obituary of the IRA volunteer Dolours Price, which mentioned the abduction and disappearance of widowed mother of 10 Jean McConville. \u201cRight there, in this little article, were the seeds for the whole thing: the idea that there were these two very different women, and how they were connected by these acts of violence.\u201d This duality is present from the outset of the new series, made \u2013 somewhat incongruously \u2013 for Disney+. It opens in 1972, within the bustling home that McConville shares with her children in Belfast\u2019s Divis flats. What follows will be familiar to those who grew up knowing one of the most harrowing stories of the conflict, or anyone who\u2019s read Keefe\u2019s book in the years since: a group of IRA members enter McConville\u2019s flat and march her away from her children for a \u201ctalk\u201d, amid accusations that she\u2019s a British informant. She is never seen again. Instead, over the course of nine episodes, it is Dolours Price who takes centre stage. Her trajectory from nonviolent protester to the inner sanctum of the Provisional IRA forms the backbone of the series. That evolution is told via the true-to-life framing device of the interviews she gave decades later, on the proviso they be released after her death (Price died in 2013). The interviews clearly delineate her connection to the McConville case itself. It\u2019s an unflinching, sometimes harrowing watch, buoyed throughout by exquisite performances from its leads. \u201cI was familiar with the story,\u201d says Lola Petticrew, the actor tasked with bringing the younger Dolours to life (with Maxine Peake playing her older, more regretful counterpart), \u201cbut after reading the book it turned out there was a lot I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Petticrew is, like Price, a west Belfast native who was aware of the story of Dolours \u2013 and that of her sister, and fellow IRA volunteer, Marian \u2013 from an early age. One scene, eventually cut from the series, required wearing the uniform of the sisters\u2019 alma mater, St Dominic\u2019s Grammar School, the very uniform Petticrew had worn as a child. Despite such connections, there was much in Keefe\u2019s book that jolted. \u201cIt made me cry a lot. I had to leave a coffee shop I was reading it in a few times and take breaks.\u201d The series tracks the sisters\u2019 ascent through the republican movement. Bloodied by their experience at 1969\u2019s Burntollet Bridge attack (in which a peaceful march was ambushed by 400 loyalists \u2013 including 100 off-duty members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary \u2013 bearing rocks and nail-clubs), the sisters renounce nonviolence and join the paramilitary cause championed by their staunchly republican family. From there, they enter the milieu of the Provisional IRA, namely the fearless Brendan \u201cDark\u201d Hughes, and his quietly charismatic commander, Gerry Adams (whose denial of ever having held such a position is featured as a disclaimer at each episode\u2019s end). They rob banks, plot attacks, attempt to smoke out double agents and mastermind the 1973 Old Bailey bombing: the first IRA attack on English soil during this era, and the eventual cause of the sisters\u2019 imprisonment and subsequent hunger strike. \u201cI went to St Louise\u2019s on the Falls Road,\u201d says Anthony Boyle (Masters of the Air, Shardlake), who plays Hughes, \u201cso I walked past a mural of Brendan Hughes going to school.\u201d He maintains that his knowledge going in was \u201cbasic stuff\u201d, but admits to early trepidation about taking part in a show written by outsiders. \u201cI was a bit like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this project if it\u2019s an American writing it.\u2019 And then I was reading it, and it was so amazing and so well researched, [there\u2019s] so much of the current day you could take into this.

You need to hear the real music of the language.\u201d Disney\u2019s involvement, says Doupe, was far from a hindrance. \u201cWe were really blessed by the fact we were doing it with American producers and American money, which gives us a wider lens,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were able to look into the detail of the horrors happening on both sides.\u201d Boyle hopes the show\u2019s broadcaster will give it a chance to break out beyond local interest and make a splash farther afield: \u201cI think with all good drama, it\u2019s human and universal.

The dispute is threatening to damage Iran\u2019s current efforts to form closer relations with its Gulf partners, and has also turned into an additional roadblock to improving Iran\u2019s relations with the European Union. The issue is hugely sensitive inside Iran and became more urgent when the EU issued a joint statement at the end of its first summit with the Gulf Cooperation Council last month that included a denunciation of the Iranian \u201coccupation of the islands\u201d, which it said was in breach of the UN charter and a violation of the sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates.

He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that Welby\u2019s admission that he had not done enough since 2013 \u201cis enough in my mind to confirm that Justin Welby along with countless other Anglican church members were part of a cover-up about the abuse\u201d. He added: \u201cI think he should resign; I think the church is incredibly stringent with its rules for everyday vicars and those lower down the scale about what to do when abuse is reported to you. \u201cThe archbishop has himself admitted that he failed in 2013 and I think for that reason, although on a personal level I know how difficult it is not to hold on to secrets and particularly secrets in which you yourself come out maybe with a degree of shame, I believe that now is an opportunity for him to resign. \u201cI say opportunity in the sense that this would be an opportunity for him to stand with the victims of the Smyth abuse and all victims that have not been treated properly by the Church of England in their own abuse cases.\u201d Over five decades between the 1970s until his death, Smyth is said to have subjected as many as 130 boys and young men in the UK and Africa to traumatic physical, sexual, psychological and spiritual attacks, permanently marking their lives. Pressure has been mounting on Welby to stand down including from Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Newcastle, who on Monday said his position was untenable. This was followed on Tuesday by similar calls from the dean of chapel at King\u2019s College, Cambridge. Stephen Cherry, who is also a former canon of Durham Cathedral, told the Today programme: \u201cI think he really needs to now tender his resignation and allow there to be significant change. \u201cThere are circumstances in which something happens whereby a person in a position of prominent leadership essentially loses the trust and the confidence and the capacity to do that really wonderful thing that someone like an archbishop does, which is represent everyone at a certain moment, publicly. \u201cAnd the pain in the victim community and the history of not listening to people and not responding to people who are profoundly hurt by those in positions of power means that this is no longer a person who can carry the representative role of that office. \u201cThat\u2019s my strongest thought today.\u201d In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac) offers support for adult survivors on 0808 801 0331. In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453. In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800; adult survivors can seek help at Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657 380.

He had already made the difficult decision to tell his parents that he and his wife, Maram, were leaving Gaza with their three young children; the checkpoint was on the road to the Rafah crossing into Egypt. He greeted people he recognised, tried to reassure his children. And then he was called out of the queue. \u201cThe young man with the black backpack who is carrying a red-haired boy. Put the boy down and come my way.\u201d</p> <p>Abu Toha was born in Gaza and had lived there for most of his 31 years, frequently under Israeli bombardment, but this was the first time he had encountered Israeli soldiers in person. He was ordered, by megaphone, to strip naked. When dressed again he was blindfolded, and a numbered bracelet attached to his wrist. He was sworn at, punched and kicked, including in the face, and forced into a truck; when the blindfold was pulled off, \u201ca soldier is aiming an M16 at my head,\u201d he wrote, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/01/01/a-palestinian-poets-perilous-journey-out-of-gaza\">a month later, in the New Yorker</a>. \u201cAnother soldier, behind a computer, asks questions and takes a photo of me. Another numbered badge is fastened to my left arm.\u201d He spent much of two days kneeling on the rubbled ground.</p> <p>The ordeal ended as abruptly as it had begun. \u201cWe are sorry about the mistake. You are going home.\u201d</p> <p>Maram had contacted friends abroad, who had applied pressure for his release. Abu Toha has an international profile: as an award-winning poet, published in the US, who received a Harvard fellowship for scholars at risk; as the founder, in 2017, of Gaza\u2019s first English-language library, the Edward Said library; and more recently as an essayist.</p> <p>His <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/mosab-abu-toha\">series in the New Yorker</a> won an <a href=\"https://opcofamerica.org/Awardarchive/the-flora-lewis-award-2023/\">Overseas Press Club award</a> last year. Here, in unadorned, direct prose full of unforgettable sights and sounds and smells, he has been chronicling his life \u2013 and, by extension, what it has been like to be Gazan \u2013 since 7 October 2023.</p> <p>An essay about fleeing his home in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, was followed by one about visiting it in a lull in the bombing to fetch food from the fridge and sit for a quiet minute among his books, now covered in dust. By the time he was next published, two weeks later, that home, which was also his parents\u2019 home, and the home of his two brothers, and, after 7 October, shelter for his three married sisters and their children, no longer existed.</p> <p>Then came the essay about fleeing Gaza altogether. \u201cI think about the hundreds or thousands of Palestinians, many of them likely more talented than me,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwho were taken from the checkpoint. Their friends could not help them.\u201d Not long afterwards he read in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz of some who had died from the same treatment, in the same detention centre in the Negev. The library <a href=\"https://librarianswithpalestine.org/gaza-report-2024/\">he founded is also gone</a>.</p> <p>Abu Toha is in a hotel room in San Francisco when we speak by video call, partway through a book tour for his second volume of poems, Forest of Noise. He has just been to DC, New York City, Boston, Cambridge and Portland. He will be in Phoenix next, then Berkeley, then France and Spain. \u201cI was at the Harvard bookstore two days ago. And it was fully packed. Even the shelving spaces. So many people are coming, you know, to listen to my poetry, but, at the same time, to listen to the stories I\u2019m telling about the people about whom the poems were written, and some of whom have died, some of whom <em>will</em> die.\u201d</p> <p>He seems younger than his 31 years, with a polite smile that reminds me of smiles you sometimes see on the news, from an accident victim, or bystander, where the distance between facial expression and the subject of conversation is a gulf. He talks fast, urgently, launching into what he wants to say while I\u2019ve hardly started asking, lit by an intensity that may partly be jetlag, partly character, partly the effect of talking, talking, talking to audience after audience for days, but partly is something else altogether, a kind of sober fever of witness, the compulsion of a bright-eyed Mariner.</p>    <p>When he rises to draw the blind against the California sun, I see the front of his hoodie is emblazoned with a line from his first collection: \u201cA rose shoulders up.\u201d (\u201cDon\u2019t ever be surprised,\u201d reads the poem, \u201cto see a rose shoulder up / among the ruins of the house: / This is how we survived.\u201d)</p> <p>His poetry, and his prose, are full of these fragile mundanities \u2013 old rugs, the smells of food, tea on \u201ca table under the orange or the guava tree\u201d, his brother-in-law Ahmad\u2019s cornfields. When a bomb hits a neighbour\u2019s house, in his first, pre-7 October, collection of poems, Things You May Find Hidden in My Ear, he is surprised: \u201cI never knew my neighbours still had that small TV, / that the old painting still hung on their walls / that their cat had kittens.\u201d</p> <p>Abu Toha was born in a refugee camp, Al-Shati, but in 2000, at the beginning of the second intifada, the family moved to Beit Lahia, a border town in northern Gaza. His parents \u201cplanted fruit trees \u2013 guava, lemon, orange, peach, and mango \u2013 and vegetables\u201d. His father raised hens, ducks, rabbits and pigeons. This move, \u201cfrom a very, very compact place to a wide area of land,\u201d is, he thinks, what made him a poet. Suddenly \u201cI could see the sun clearly. I could see the clouds. I could see the plants growing.\u201d</p> <p>After he married in 2015, \u201cI built my apartment on top of theirs. My wife and I could see the border with Israel out our bedroom window. My children could see our neighbour\u2019s olive and lemon trees.\u201d Blossom, puppies, a mother breastfeeding; \u201crain waters the stories that sleep on the old, tiled floor\u201d, as he puts it in Forest of Noise \u2013 but also, this being Gaza, \u201cthe drone [that] watches over all\u201d.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>The poems are about things that the news fails to capture,\u201d he says now. On the news \u201cmaybe if someone is lucky, they would say their names or maybe the family name or the area where the bombing took place. But what the media fails to do is tell the stories of these people who got killed.\u201d Palestinian culture is already communitarian, everyone bringing food after a death, for example, or for a wedding, living in multi-generational homes; in the camps, where two people often cannot pass through an alley abreast, this is intensified, and since 7 October, more intensified still, because \u201cwhen Israel invades an area, people tend to move and stay with other families\u201d.</p> <p>Last October, \u201cthirty-one members of my uncle\u2019s family were killed in one airstrike. I mean, the whole family, the grandfather, the children and the grandchildren. Only two babies survived with one mother.\u201d A few weeks ago <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mosab_abutoha/p/DBOlR6gOrcx/\">he posted online</a>: \u201cMy aunt\u2019s house and her husband\u2019s family are now besieged inside by tanks and soldiers. The Israeli soldiers are firing at the ground floor. She has five children and there are more than 30 persons in the building, mostly children. The house is opposite Shadia Abu Ghazala school in Jabalia. Please help.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty hours later, he says, \u201cthe house was bombed and my aunt lost one child, Sama, seven years old, and still under the rubble until now are about 16 people, including my grandmother\u2019s sister, who I used to call grandma.\u201d</p> <p>Two weeks ago, his family were on a train from New York City to Syracuse, where they are currently living, when they heard that 25 members of his wife\u2019s uncle\u2019s family had been killed. This is one of the reasons being away from Maram and his children for the book tour makes him anxious, he says: this can happen at any time, to anyone they know, and they need to be together to face the news.</p> <p>And, he says, \u201cI know not only the people who live in my neighbourhood, but throughout the city where I lived. In Beit Lahia, I can walk in the street and name the people in each house. I know the kids, to which school they go, and when they go to the beach.\u201d He was a student of English language and literature at the Islamic University of Gaza, where his interest in English poetry was sparked by reading the Romantics, so I mention John Donne: \u201cNo man is an island / Entire of itself; / Every man is a piece of the continent, / A part of the main.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cThe loss that we are facing is not only individual loss. It\u2019s not personal loss. It\u2019s a collective loss. When we lose a family, it\u2019s <em>my</em> family. When a house is bombed, it is <em>my</em> house.\u201d</p> <p>He was interviewed on BBC Newshour when his wife\u2019s relatives were killed, and was told, \u201cand I quote here, that the Israeli army said they carried out a \u2018precise airstrike\u2019. The next day, I opened my phone. And I found this.\u201d He leans into the screen to show me. \u201cThis is a house. And this is another house, you see? This is a \u2018precise airstrike\u2019 on five houses. So whoever they are targeting existed at the same time in five houses.\u201d</p> <p>And, by the way, the aftermaths have changed, he says. There are so few emergency personnel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/07/targeting-healthcare-workers-airstrikes-constant-fear-uk-doctors-gaza\">and they also have been targeted</a>. Now neighbours dig through the rubble with their hands. And Abu Toha gets texts and calls, begging him to use any connections he has \u2013 \u201cnot asking me to end this. No, they asked me if I have some people that I know who could let some ambulances through to transport the people who were injured.\u201d</p> <p>This is something that runs through the poetry, too, this sense of shrunken horizons. It took weeks for Abu Toha to begin to grasp the size of America when he first arrived, Gaza being a speck in comparison (he was also terrified the first time he heard a commercial jetliner taking off. At 27 he <a href=\"https://lithub.com/founding-the-first-english-language-library-in-gaza/\">knew only the sound of F-16s</a>. He was eight before he realised, watching an Apache helicopter smash a rocket into a building, that this was perhaps not quite normal, and not exactly safe).</p> <p>Since then he has lost close friends, and at 16 was wounded himself, when he was on his way to buy some eggs, and shrapnel sliced through his forehead, neck and shoulder. That time there was an ambulance. \u201cSomeone throws a corpse in next to me. / The body burnt, maybe no head. I don\u2019t look at it. / The smell is so bad. I\u2019m so sorry, whoever you are.\u201d The English department where he studied language and literature at the Islamic University of Gaza was levelled in 2014, a month before his graduation.</p> <p>\u201cFamilies of the dead attended,\u201d he wrote in his poem Palestine A-Z, \u201cto receive not a degree, but a portrait of their child.\u201d He rescued a Norton Anthology of American Literature from the rubble, the irony of which was not lost on him, given who funds many of the bombs.</p>    <p>He thinks now that he didn\u2019t really have a childhood, not as those in safer places might think of childhood, a time of possibility and play. In a place where nearly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/10/19/1206479861/israel-gaza-hamas-children-population-war-palestinians\">50% of the population is under 18</a>, a new acronym has become common: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/22/the-plight-of-gazas-wcnsfs-wounded-child-no-surviving-family\">WCNSR (Wounded Child, No Surviving Relatives)</a>.</p> <p>This was in the end why he and Maram decided to leave. \u201cI mean, my son who was eight years old should be playing in a park, should be in school, should be watching movies, should be playing with other children. But instead, he was looking for firewood and cardboard boxes, you know, to help his mother and me bake or cook food.\u201d In My Son Throws a Blanket Over My Daughter, he describes his then-five-year-old trying to protect his four-year-old from the bomb they can hear falling. <a href=\"https://progressive.org/magazine/my-son-throws-a-blanket-over-my-daughter-toha-20231130/\">\u201c</a><em><a href=\"https://progressive.org/magazine/my-son-throws-a-blanket-over-my-daughter-toha-20231130/\">You can hide now</a></em><a href=\"https://progressive.org/magazine/my-son-throws-a-blanket-over-my-daughter-toha-20231130/\">, he assures her.\u201d</a></p> <p>Part of the attraction of the Romantics was how they expanded space. \u201c\u2019I wandered lonely as a cloud\u2019 \u2013 I cannot forget this opening line,\u201d he told an interviewer a couple of years ago. \u201cIt gave me another world to think about and live in.\u201d His new book is fronted by a phrase from Audre Lorde, \u201cPoetry is not a luxury\u201d, and I ask what that means to him. I had expected something along similar lines \u2013 but no. This poetry is an act of witness, of reportage. \u201cIt\u2019s not a luxury because of the things that I\u2019m writing about. And sharing it with other people is not a luxury,\u201d but a vain attempt to say, this happened, \u201cmake sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. But it happened again and again.\u201d And not just the bombing in general, he says, but moments in that bombing.</p> <p>He reminds me of his poem The Moon \u2013 almost unreadable in its open-eyed bleakness \u2013 about a small girl lying dead next to her father on the asphalt, and a hungry cat pacing. \u201cAnd just three days ago, a video was uploaded from my city of two cats eating from a corpse that was left in the street. You see the cat? No? \u201cOK. Let me show you the video.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at it flickering through the interference of two screens, though at first I have to admit I am just saying yes. I don\u2019t want to look. But that doesn\u2019t feel right, so I look properly and there is the cat\u2019s head rising and then dipping again. \u201cThere is that definition of poetry, you know, the best words in the best order. And for me, as a Palestinian poet, I would add one other thing, which is in the best time. I mean, I can\u2019t wait for my poems to be published two years later.\u201d</p> <p>So he puts them on Instagram. His friend Refaat Alareer did the same with one of his own last October. Abu Toha wrote a response in November. By December <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/08/palestinian-poet-refaat-alareer-killed-in-gaza\">Refaat and many of his family were dead</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s poetry as memorial, too. In a poem that responds to Elizabeth Bishop\u2019s No Art (\u201cThe art of losing isn\u2019t hard to master\u201d), Abu Toha notes that as well as friends, and a city, he\u2019s lost \u201ca language to fear\u201d. What does this mean? It\u2019s very striking. \u201cI mean \u2026\u201d he slows down, thinking. \u201cWe are so traumatised that we have stopped using our language to describe what\u2019s happening to us. For example, when my wife lost her uncle and all his family, she just cried for a few minutes and then stopped. She never talked about it. We fear even talking about the dead because we know 100% that the next day we will lose more.\u201d And anyway, what is the point, when the person you tell is likely to have lost even more than you?</p> <p>Now people bury their dead, \u201cand then the next day they take their bucket and look for a tap to fill it. Stand in queues, you know, to get a loaf or two loaves of bread. We don\u2019t even sit and give them their time, you know, remembering them and paying them tributes.\u201d A sudden rush of urgency \u2013 and \u201cthis is terrifying, this is terrifying! Sometimes I forget that I lost a relative of mine. Last month I told my wife: \u2018You know, Maram, we haven\u2019t talked to Aunt Aliya for some time,\u2019 and she said: \u2018Oh, did you forget she passed away?\u2019\u201d </p> <p>He is concerned about generational forgetting, too. He grew up with stories of his paternal grandfather, who left his home in Yaffa in 1948 believing he would be away for only a few days, and was never able to return, and of the key to the house the family have kept since; his daughter is named Yaffa. But his children \u2013 will they ask only about the 2009 war, or 2012, 2014, 2021, 2024? They will loom so large it will be hard to see around them. </p> <p>\u201cOn the morning of October 7th,\u201d he wrote in the New Yorker, \u201cwhen Hamas began to launch rockets at Israel, I was wearing some new clothes, and my wife was taking a photo of me. The sound of rockets made Yaffa cry, so I showed her some YouTube videos on my phone. My father and brothers were on different floors of the house, and we started to shout a conversation out the windows. What\u2019s happening? Is this some kind of test?\u201d</p> <p>People in Gaza are angry, he tells me in an email later, at both Hamas and Fatah, because of the political rift that started especially in 2007, a year after Hamas won the election and the siege began \u2013 \u201ca rift that cost us so much and which has been fuelled by Israel and the west\u201d. But mostly, he says, they are angry about being abandoned by the world, ever since 1948, about not being recognised \u201cas a people with human and political rights to be protected. How many UN resolutions have been dismissed?\u201d As for the situation now, he says, in our interview: \u201cHow many times has the United Nations warned that Gaza would be unlivable by 2020? What has the world done to change this?\u201d</p> <p>So, too often, the anger, he says, unheard, now turns inward, at each other, to fighting over food, over water, over aid. \u201cJust imagine you are now in London and you are allowing just five trucks of food into the city. Of course you would take to the streets and maybe fight with your neighbour because you want to feed your children.\u201d</p> <p>As for him, how is he coping? His parents are still in Gaza, his sister is expecting to give birth as we speak. \u201cMaybe she gave birth today? I don\u2019t know whether she had access to any ambulances or any hospitals, etc. But I, as a human being, I feel like I\u2019m on the run. I\u2019m just running, running. Reading and translating and posting and giving readings and talking to people and giving interviews. I can\u2019t stop, because if I stopped, I would fall.\u201d</p> <p><em>Forest of Noise is published by Fourth Estate (\u00a310.99). </em><em>To support the Guardian and Observer, buy your copy from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/forest-of-noise-9780008738839/\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a>. </em><em>P&amp;P charges may apply.</em></p>",

When he rises to draw the blind against the California sun, I see the front of his hoodie is emblazoned with a line from his first collection: \u201cA rose shoulders up.\u201d (\u201cDon\u2019t ever be surprised,\u201d reads the poem, \u201cto see a rose shoulder up / among the ruins of the house: / This is how we survived.\u201d) His poetry, and his prose, are full of these fragile mundanities \u2013 old rugs, the smells of food, tea on \u201ca table under the orange or the guava tree\u201d, his brother-in-law Ahmad\u2019s cornfields.

But what the media fails to do is tell the stories of these people who got killed.\u201d Palestinian culture is already communitarian, everyone bringing food after a death, for example, or for a wedding, living in multi-generational homes; in the camps, where two people often cannot pass through an alley abreast, this is intensified, and since 7 October, more intensified still, because \u201cwhen Israel invades an area, people tend to move and stay with other families\u201d. Last October, \u201cthirty-one members of my uncle\u2019s family were killed in one airstrike. I mean, the whole family, the grandfather, the children and the grandchildren. Only two babies survived with one mother.\u201d A few weeks ago he posted online: \u201cMy aunt\u2019s house and her husband\u2019s family are now besieged inside by tanks and soldiers. The Israeli soldiers are firing at the ground floor. She has five children and there are more than 30 persons in the building, mostly children. The house is opposite Shadia Abu Ghazala school in Jabalia. Please help.\u201d Twenty hours later, he says, \u201cthe house was bombed and my aunt lost one child, Sama, seven years old, and still under the rubble until now are about 16 people, including my grandmother\u2019s sister, who I used to call grandma.\u201d Two weeks ago, his family were on a train from New York City to Syracuse, where they are currently living, when they heard that 25 members of his wife\u2019s uncle\u2019s family had been killed. This is one of the reasons being away from Maram and his children for the book tour makes him anxious, he says: this can happen at any time, to anyone they know, and they need to be together to face the news. And, he says, \u201cI know not only the people who live in my neighbourhood, but throughout the city where I lived. In Beit Lahia, I can walk in the street and name the people in each house. I know the kids, to which school they go, and when they go to the beach.\u201d He was a student of English language and literature at the Islamic University of Gaza, where his interest in English poetry was sparked by reading the Romantics, so I mention John Donne: \u201cNo man is an island / Entire of itself; / Every man is a piece of the continent, / A part of the main.\u201d \u201cYeah yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cThe loss that we are facing is not only individual loss. It\u2019s not personal loss. It\u2019s a collective loss. When we lose a family, it\u2019s my family. When a house is bombed, it is my house.\u201d He was interviewed on BBC Newshour when his wife\u2019s relatives were killed, and was told, \u201cand I quote here, that the Israeli army said they carried out a \u2018precise airstrike\u2019. The next day, I opened my phone. And I found this.\u201d He leans into the screen to show me. \u201cThis is a house. And this is another house, you see? This is a \u2018precise airstrike\u2019 on five houses. So whoever they are targeting existed at the same time in five houses.\u201d And, by the way, the aftermaths have changed, he says. There are so few emergency personnel, and they also have been targeted. Now neighbours dig through the rubble with their hands. And Abu Toha gets texts and calls, begging him to use any connections he has \u2013 \u201cnot asking me to end this. No, they asked me if I have some people that I know who could let some ambulances through to transport the people who were injured.\u201d This is something that runs through the poetry, too, this sense of shrunken horizons. It took weeks for Abu Toha to begin to grasp the size of America when he first arrived, Gaza being a speck in comparison (he was also terrified the first time he heard a commercial jetliner taking off. At 27 he knew only the sound of F-16s. He was eight before he realised, watching an Apache helicopter smash a rocket into a building, that this was perhaps not quite normal, and not exactly safe). Since then he has lost close friends, and at 16 was wounded himself, when he was on his way to buy some eggs, and shrapnel sliced through his forehead, neck and shoulder. That time there was an ambulance. \u201cSomeone throws a corpse in next to me. / The body burnt, maybe no head. I don\u2019t look at it. / The smell is so bad. I\u2019m so sorry, whoever you are.\u201d The English department where he studied language and literature at the Islamic University of Gaza was levelled in 2014, a month before his graduation. \u201cFamilies of the dead attended,\u201d he wrote in his poem Palestine A-Z, \u201cto receive not a degree, but a portrait of their child.\u201d He rescued a Norton Anthology of American Literature from the rubble, the irony of which was not lost on him, given who funds many of the bombs. He thinks now that he didn\u2019t really have a childhood, not as those in safer places might think of childhood, a time of possibility and play. In a place where nearly 50% of the population is under 18, a new acronym has become common: WCNSR (Wounded Child, No Surviving Relatives). This was in the end why he and Maram decided to leave. \u201cI mean, my son who was eight years old should be playing in a park, should be in school, should be watching movies, should be playing with other children. But instead, he was looking for firewood and cardboard boxes, you know, to help his mother and me bake or cook food.\u201d In My Son Throws a Blanket Over My Daughter, he describes his then-five-year-old trying to protect his four-year-old from the bomb they can hear falling. \u201cYou can hide now, he assures her.\u201d Part of the attraction of the Romantics was how they expanded space. \u201c\u2019I wandered lonely as a cloud\u2019 \u2013 I cannot forget this opening line,\u201d he told an interviewer a couple of years ago. \u201cIt gave me another world to think about and live in.\u201d His new book is fronted by a phrase from Audre Lorde, \u201cPoetry is not a luxury\u201d, and I ask what that means to him. I had expected something along similar lines \u2013 but no. This poetry is an act of witness, of reportage. \u201cIt\u2019s not a luxury because of the things that I\u2019m writing about. And sharing it with other people is not a luxury,\u201d but a vain attempt to say, this happened, \u201cmake sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. But it happened again and again.\u201d And not just the bombing in general, he says, but moments in that bombing. He reminds me of his poem The Moon \u2013 almost unreadable in its open-eyed bleakness \u2013 about a small girl lying dead next to her father on the asphalt, and a hungry cat pacing. \u201cAnd just three days ago, a video was uploaded from my city of two cats eating from a corpse that was left in the street. You see the cat? No? \u201cOK. Let me show you the video.\u201d I stare at it flickering through the interference of two screens, though at first I have to admit I am just saying yes. I don\u2019t want to look. But that doesn\u2019t feel right, so I look properly and there is the cat\u2019s head rising and then dipping again. \u201cThere is that definition of poetry, you know, the best words in the best order. And for me, as a Palestinian poet, I would add one other thing, which is in the best time. I mean, I can\u2019t wait for my poems to be published two years later.\u201d So he puts them on Instagram. His friend Refaat Alareer did the same with one of his own last October. Abu Toha wrote a response in November. By December Refaat and many of his family were dead. It\u2019s poetry as memorial, too. In a poem that responds to Elizabeth Bishop\u2019s No Art (\u201cThe art of losing isn\u2019t hard to master\u201d), Abu Toha notes that as well as friends, and a city, he\u2019s lost \u201ca language to fear\u201d. What does this mean? It\u2019s very striking. \u201cI mean \u2026\u201d he slows down, thinking. \u201cWe are so traumatised that we have stopped using our language to describe what\u2019s happening to us. For example, when my wife lost her uncle and all his family, she just cried for a few minutes and then stopped. She never talked about it. We fear even talking about the dead because we know 100% that the next day we will lose more.\u201d And anyway, what is the point, when the person you tell is likely to have lost even more than you? Now people bury their dead, \u201cand then the next day they take their bucket and look for a tap to fill it. Stand in queues, you know, to get a loaf or two loaves of bread. We don\u2019t even sit and give them their time, you know, remembering them and paying them tributes.\u201d A sudden rush of urgency \u2013 and \u201cthis is terrifying, this is terrifying! Sometimes I forget that I lost a relative of mine. Last month I told my wife: \u2018You know, Maram, we haven\u2019t talked to Aunt Aliya for some time,\u2019 and she said: \u2018Oh, did you forget she passed away?\u2019\u201d He is concerned about generational forgetting, too. He grew up with stories of his paternal grandfather, who left his home in Yaffa in 1948 believing he would be away for only a few days, and was never able to return, and of the key to the house the family have kept since; his daughter is named Yaffa. But his children \u2013 will they ask only about the 2009 war, or 2012, 2014, 2021, 2024? They will loom so large it will be hard to see around them. \u201cOn the morning of October 7th,\u201d he wrote in the New Yorker, \u201cwhen Hamas began to launch rockets at Israel, I was wearing some new clothes, and my wife was taking a photo of me. The sound of rockets made Yaffa cry, so I showed her some YouTube videos on my phone. My father and brothers were on different floors of the house, and we started to shout a conversation out the windows. What\u2019s happening? Is this some kind of test?\u201d People in Gaza are angry, he tells me in an email later, at both Hamas and Fatah, because of the political rift that started especially in 2007, a year after Hamas won the election and the siege began \u2013 \u201ca rift that cost us so much and which has been fuelled by Israel and the west\u201d. But mostly, he says, they are angry about being abandoned by the world, ever since 1948, about not being recognised \u201cas a people with human and political rights to be protected. How many UN resolutions have been dismissed?\u201d As for the situation now, he says, in our interview: \u201cHow many times has the United Nations warned that Gaza would be unlivable by 2020? What has the world done to change this?\u201d So, too often, the anger, he says, unheard, now turns inward, at each other, to fighting over food, over water, over aid. \u201cJust imagine you are now in London and you are allowing just five trucks of food into the city. Of course you would take to the streets and maybe fight with your neighbour because you want to feed your children.\u201d As for him, how is he coping? His parents are still in Gaza, his sister is expecting to give birth as we speak. \u201cMaybe she gave birth today? I don\u2019t know whether she had access to any ambulances or any hospitals, etc. But I, as a human being, I feel like I\u2019m on the run. I\u2019m just running, running. Reading and translating and posting and giving readings and talking to people and giving interviews. I can\u2019t stop, because if I stopped, I would fall.\u201d Forest of Noise is published by Fourth Estate (\u00a310.99).

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s most vital campaign did not involve his political consultants, the hysteria of his rallies, the paranoid TV spots about migrant murderers and transgender bogeymen, his blathering on \u201cbro\u201d podcasts or the prancing of a hopped-up Elon Musk. Nor was it about a garbage can in the ocean, eating pets or divine intervention.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s vulnerability was always at the forefront of his mind. He knew he could have been eliminated at crucial moments before election day. He was anxious about more than an assassination. He understood that his most threatening adversary was the criminal justice system. Trump had to get away with his crimes to survive. The making of the president required the unmaking of justice.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s bravado excited his Maga faithful even as it masked his furtive, frantic and desperate efforts to escape legal judgment. He committed new crimes to obstruct justice, to hide evidence for which he was additionally indicted. In all, he faced 54 felony charges apart from the 34 felony counts on which he was found guilty in the election and business fraud case involving hush money in New York. Among the federal charges against him were conspiracy to defraud the American people of a free and fair election, conspiracy against rights and corruptly concealing and destroying classified defense documents under the Espionage Act. In the Georgia state election interference case, he was indicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (Rico) Act along with 18 co-conspirators.</p> <p>The first result of Trump\u2019s re-election was the removal of his existential threat. If he had lost, he would have faced his trials and their consequences for the rest of his life. But on the morning after, the justice department informed the press that it would seek to close the cases against Trump. Under the policy of a 2000 <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/146241-0/dl?inline\">memo</a> from the justice department\u2019s office of legal counsel, a prosecution of a president would \u201cunduly interfere in a direct or formal sense with the conduct of the presidency\u201d. The old memo is Trump\u2019s get out of jail card.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/11/presidential-election-trump-total-votes\">Trump didn\u2019t just win. He expanded his voter base | John Zogby</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That document was a revised version of a post-Watergate OLC memo issued in 1973. The 2000 memo concurred with the conclusion of the earlier one: \u201cIn light of the effect that an indictment would have on the operations of the executive branch, \u2018an impeachment proceeding is the only appropriate way to deal with a President while in office.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But the OLC memo is just a policy memo, not a judicial ruling, which was not updated to account for the new reality of alleged crimes of a former president. After Trump, it was complacently left to stand. Now that he has been elected again, the policy is being applied to the unanticipated and unique situation of years long ongoing cases to shutter the rule of law. Trump will be scot-free.</p> <p>The hammer blows that would have shattered his campaign never came. The gavel laid flat on the bench. As Trump eluded trial after trial, their looming shadows faded. If he had faced the music, he would have been convicted as an insurrectionist, thief of national security secrets and obstructer of justice and he would have been sentenced to prison months before the election. His strategy was justice delayed is justice denied.</p> <p>Instead of Trump\u2019s dominant message being his war against the law, he was permitted to fill the space with variations on the racist great replacement theory. \u201cPoison in the blood\u201d was heard rather than \u201cLadies and Gentlemen of the jury\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s strongman image inflated every time he beat the process. Whenever he delayed justice his legend grew. Every time he should have been subject to the law and wasn\u2019t, he appeared too big to fall. The inability to bring him to trial made the system seem weak and suspect. The law was anemic; he was indestructible. No man was above the law \u2013 with one exception. Without the presentation of the evidence in a courtroom setting and the verdict of a jury, he was able to sow doubt with the public about the charges and present himself as a political martyr. He played to the galleries he assembled, not juries empaneled under the law.</p> <p>Despite Trump\u2019s incessant motions and filings to delay and distract in his court cases, he did not hold back the wheels of justice all by himself. He alone could not fix it. For Trump to succeed, justice had to fail. It did not fail passively. He was rescued from judgment by four people, acting sequentially on wholly different motives, but leading to the same conclusion of letting the culprit run loose. Without his enablers, Trump would not have been protected. He confounded, thwarted and escaped the law because of the perverse decisions of the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, the chief justice, John Roberts and the US district court judge Aileen Cannon.</p> <p>None of the four had a more sustained personal relationship with Trump than McConnell. From his proximity he came to regard him as a \u201cdespicable human being\u201d, \u201cstupid as well as being ill-tempered\u201d, with \u201ccomplete unfitness for office\u201d, as he told an oral historian, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/10/mitch-mcconnell-trump-worst-political-miscalculation/680412/\">according</a> to his authorized biographer, Michael Tackett, in The Price of Power. McConnell stated that Trump\u2019s defeat in 2020 \u201conly underscores the good judgment of the American people. They\u2019ve just had enough of the misrepresentations, the outright lies almost on a daily basis, and they fired him. And for a narcissist like him, that\u2019s been really hard to take.\u201d</p> <p>After Trump was impeached for the insurrection on January 6, McConnell wavered on voting guilty. If Trump were to be found guilty, he could never again run for federal office. McConnell fell back on his political instinct that Trump was utterly discredited, though there was a risk that he might support Maga candidates to primary Republican senators who voted guilty as revenge. Before the vote on 13 February 2021, McConnell <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2021-02-14/read-mcconnell-speech-after-trumps-impeachment-trial-acquittal\">declared</a> Trump \u201cpractically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day\u201d, but sidestepped convicting him by asserting that the penalty could not be applied because Trump was no longer president.</p> <p>McConnell pointed out that Trump would be held accountable in criminal trials. \u201cBut this just underscores that impeachment was never meant to be the final forum for American justice,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed, Justice [Joseph] Story specifically reminded that while former officials were not eligible for impeachment or conviction, they were \u2013 and this is extremely important \u2013 \u2018still liable to be tried and punished in the ordinary tribunals of justice\u2019. Put another way, in the language of today: President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office, as an ordinary citizen, unless the statute of limitations has run, still liable for everything he did while in office, didn\u2019t get away with anything yet \u2013 yet. We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/11/election-harris-gaza-policy\">Not changing course on Gaza was a colossal mistake by Kamala Harris | Moustafa Bayoumi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Joe Biden appointed Merrick Garland as his attorney general. Garland had a sterling and bipartisan record. He had sat as a judge on the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit since 1997, including seven years as chief judge, been a prosecutor at the justice department, notably handling the Oklahoma City bombing case and had a reputation for integrity and decency. He was extraordinarily collegial with Republicans. He had served as a moderator on at least 10 panels at the Federalist Society.</p> <p>When President Obama nominated him for the US supreme court, Garland seemed the ideal candidate. McConnell rejected him outright, not because of his qualifications, but because he played for keeps. McConnell wanted the seat available for a Republican president to fill, and it was filled by Trump, who followed the appointment of Neil Gorsuch with Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett off the Federalist Society list. McConnell felt he had used Trump for his own purposes. Then, when Biden named Garland to head the justice department, McConnell voted for his confirmation. It would be up to Garland to deal with Trump\u2019s crimes.</p> <p>On his first day at the Department of Justice, in his speech to its employees, Garland explained that he had in his \u201cDNA\u201d the \u201cnorms\u201d upheld by his hero, Edward Levi, the post-Watergate attorney general, a moderate Republican who acted above partisanship. \u201cThat there not be one rule for Democrats and another for Republicans\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-garland-addresses-115000-employees-department-justice-his-first\">said</a> Garland. And that was the \u201conly way we can succeed and retain the trust of the American people \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Garland was punctilious in his belief that pursuing Trump reflected a partisan impulse. \u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s painstaking approach to investigating Trump can be traced to Garland\u2019s desire to turn the page from missteps, bruising attacks and allegations of partisanship,\u201d the Washington Post later <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2023/06/19/fbi-resisted-opening-probe-into-trumps-role-jan-6-more-than-year/\">reported</a>. \u201cInside Justice, however, some lawyers have complained that the attorney general\u2019s determination to steer clear of any claims of political motive has chilled efforts to investigate the former president. \u2018You couldn\u2019t use the T word,\u2019 said one former Justice official briefed on prosecutors\u2019 discussions.\u201d</p> <p>Garland\u2019s hero-worship of Levi was historically misplaced as a guide to his own role. Levi presided after the Watergate affair was wrapped up. But events had not cast Garland as Levi but potentially to be Judge John Sirica, who broke the conspiracy open. Garland\u2019s prosecution of the mob that attacked the Capitol was based on the theory of working from the bottom up. Those down the chain would then provide evidence against the crime boss.</p> <p>But Garland operated on the wrong theory of the case. He suffered a failure of imagination, unable to grasp he was dealing with an attempted coup, not merely a destructive riot. The evidence of the coup was clearly before him. Trump\u2019s fake elector scheme to prevent certification of the election occurred in plain sight in real time as it was happening. Trump\u2019s tape of pressuring Georgia election officials to forge ballots was publicly revealed three days before January 6.</p> <p>In the sort of investigation that Garland was conducting it might take months, if not years, for a low-level mafioso to wear a wire that might produce such incriminating evidence. Garland vowed to go after \u201call January 6th perpetrators, at any level\u201d, but as he racked up hundreds of cases against the Capitol mob he shied away from acting against the kingpin.</p> <p>On 12 May 2021, Liz Cheney was removed as chair of the House Republican conference. She had voted for Trump\u2019s impeachment and favored a congressional investigation into the January 6 insurrection. Those opposed to the rulings of the courts about January 6, she said, were \u201cat war with the constitution\u201d.</p> <p>A week later, on 19 May, McConnell refused to support the creation of a bipartisan joint committee to investigate. He <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/19/mcconnell-opposes-houses-bipartisan-jan-6-commission-bill-489573\">claimed</a> it would be \u201cslanted\u201d, and there were \u201cno new facts\u201d. The House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, rejected cooperation with any new probe. The House committee included Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, from Illinois, as the two Republicans. They were both censured by the Republican National Committee, which passed off the insurrection as \u201clegitimate political discourse\u201d.</p> <p>On 28 March 2022, the US district court judge David Carter, in <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.841840/gov.uscourts.cacd.841840.260.0.pdf\">ruling</a> that Trump\u2019s legal adviser John Eastman must turn over his relevant emails to the committee, stated that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he and Trump \u201ccorruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021\u201d, and that they staged \u201ca coup in search of a legal theory\u201d.</p> <p>After Trump\u2019s former senior aides refused to honor the committee\u2019s subpoenas, they were referred to the DoJ for prosecution for contempt of Congress. Garland would not act.</p> <p>\u201cAttorney General Garland, do your job so we can do ours,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/jan-6-panel-pressures-attorney-general-garland-to-charge-trump-allies\">beseeched</a> Representative Elaine Luria of Virginia on 1 April. \u201cWe are upholding our responsibility. The Department of Justice must do the same,\u201d echoed Representative Adam Schiff of California.</p> <p>\u201cMr Meadows and Mr Scavino unquestionably have relevant knowledge about President Trump\u2019s role in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election and the events of January 6th.

But the justice department declined to indict Trump\u2019s former chief of staff Mark Meadows and social media director Dan Scavino.</p> <p>At last, in April, after Carter\u2019s decision and the January 6 committee members\u2019 public criticism, the FBI launched an investigation into the fake elector scheme. It had taken Garland 15 months after assuming office to begin exploring the coup as something beyond a riot.</p> <p>On 8 August, FBI agents with a warrant entered Trump\u2019s residence in Florida, Mar-a-Lago, to seize classified national security material he had secreted there and refused to return to the government after longstanding multiple requests.</p> <p>On 15 November, Trump announced his presidential campaign. Three days later, Garland appointed Jack Smith, a DoJ prosecutor, as the independent special counsel to investigate both January 6 and the government documents cases. It was 21 months since Garland had become attorney general. He had fervently sought to avoid any taint of partisanship, but because of the delay the special counsel now worked under the color of a campaign.</p> <p>Smith worked swiftly. His indictments of Trump in the documents case came on 9 June 2023, following by additional ones for obstruction on 27 July. Then, on 1 August, he indicted Trump for January 6. The road to oblivion began.</p> <p>The US district court judge Tanya Chutkan set a trial date for 6 March 2024. Trump\u2019s lawyers filed numerous motions to delay, including the claim that as president Trump enjoyed complete immunity over what were official acts. Chutkan rejected the motions as preposterous, but Trump\u2019s stalling tactic worked, as she had to move back the trial date while a panel of three judges on the US court of appeals considered Trump\u2019s immunity claim.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24250214/special-counsel-trump-immunity-filing-dc-circuit-12-23-23.pdf\">response</a> on 23 December 2023 to Trump\u2019s filing must rank as the most intriguing document in the investigation. It received little attention. In it, the special counsel suggested a series of crimes that \u201ca President\u201d might commit with impunity on the basis of Trump\u2019s immunity claim. He could not accuse Trump of crimes for which he lacked the evidence. Yet his filing\u2019s hypotheticals seemed to describe grave offenses.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s \u201csobering\u201d immunity theory might cover \u201ca President who accepts a bribe in exchange for directing a lucrative government contract to the payer; a President who instructs the FBI Director to plant incriminating evidence on a political enemy; a President who orders the National Guard to murder his most prominent critics; or a President who sells nuclear secrets to a foreign adversary \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Did the special counsel have any evidence that pointed to any of those crimes? He presented them not as suspicions, but as logical extensions of Trump\u2019s radical theory \u2013 \u201cin each of these scenarios, the President could assert that he was simply executing the laws; or communicating with the Department of Justice; or discharging his powers as Commander-in-Chief; or engaging in foreign diplomacy.\u201d</p> <p>The three-judge appeals court panel ruled expeditiously against Trump on 6 February that \u201cany executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution\u201d.</p> <p>Trump appealed to the supreme court. It took its time to hear arguments on 25 April. Then, it waited until 1 July, the last day of its term, to issue its decision that Trump as a former president and private citizen had a presumption of \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d for his \u201cofficial actions\u201d. Roberts\u2019s opinion was a restatement of Smith\u2019s wild hypothetical version of Trump\u2019s immunity theory. The prosecution was ordered to tailor its indictment on those grounds, deleting anything to do with Trump\u2019s \u201cofficial actions\u201d.</p> <p>Roberts had positioned himself as a high-minded institutionalist, whose principal concern was the reputation of the court as Olympian in its deliberations. But the curtain had been pulled back to reveal a fast and furious trade in cash gifts and luxury vacations lavished by self-interested Republican donors on justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Ginni Thomas, a veteran far-right activist, was a cheerleader for the January 6 insurrection, especially the fake elector scheme in Arizona. Martha Ann Alito flew insurrectionist flags at the Alito house.</p> <p>Despite Roberts\u2019s pose, his main contributions as a jurist were to trash the crown jewel of the civil rights movement, the Voting Rights Act, and to eviscerate campaign finance reform through the Citizens United decision, which opened the sluice gates for unregulated big money. Despite his rulings that transparently empowered the Republican party, he fretted about criticism of the court as having any partisan leaning.</p> <p>The conservative majority adhered to the dogma of \u201coriginalism\u201d, claiming divination of the inner thoughts of the founders as a kind of legal scriptural fundamentalism. Yet Roberts\u2019s unprecedented ruling on immunity established a charter for the kind of unaccountable authoritarian presidency that the founders sought to prevent in the constitution. His opinion severed the conservatives from their originalist mythology to shield Trump. At the entrance of the marble temple of the supreme court are engraved the words, \u201cEqual Justice Under Law\u201d, which are now an enduring tribute to its hypocrisy.</p> <p>Following the court\u2019s new guidelines, Smith filed his new brief on 2 October. While it cut out some of the most dramatic evidence against Trump involving his pressure on Vice-President Mike Pence to toss out the legal electoral college votes and his manipulation of the justice department, the filing was still damning. It included the story of Trump\u2019s response to being told Pence was endangered by the mob. \u201cSo what?\u201d he replied. But the possibility for a trial before the election was by now long closed.</p> <p>In the documents case, the US district court judge Aileen Cannon ruled again and again to Trump\u2019s advantage. She is a thoroughly processed product of the Federalist Society transmission belt, from law school to the federal bench. Cannon was on the Federalist Society list when Trump ticked her off for appointment. She is, as the communists used to say, a reliable.</p> <p>In decision after decision, Cannon\u2019s reasoning was murky, her logic twisted and her rulings tilted. She denied Smith\u2019s request for a December 2023 trial date, moving it to 20 May 2024 after the Republican primaries. After seemingly endless motions in which she created every obstacle for delay, on 15 July, the first day of the Republican national convention, she dismissed the entire case on the absurd notion that the justice department had no authority to appoint a special counsel \u201cthreatening the structural liberty inherent in the separation of powers\u201d. That exact argument had been signaled in Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s opinion in the presidential immunity case issued two weeks earlier.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s appeal on 26 August noted that the DoJ had been naming special counsels for 150 years and that the Congress had passed four enabling pieces of legislation and provided funding for the office. But, again, Trump had already succeeded, with the timely aid of a helpful judge, in moving any trial beyond the election. A month before, in October, the Trump campaign <a href=\"https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/judge-aileen-cannon-emerges-as-one-of-the-2024-elections-most-influential-players-and-maybe-one-of-the-biggest-winners-as-ag-and-scotus-rumors-swirl/\">leaked</a> that Cannon was under consideration to succeed Garland as attorney general.</p> <p>By acting as the indispensable servants of Trump\u2019s lawlessness his helpers destroyed what they most venerated. McConnell had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/politics/mcconnell-trump-gop-new-book/index.html\">confided</a> that \u201cthe Maga movement is completely wrong\u201d and that President Ronald Reagan \u201cwouldn\u2019t recognize it today\u201d. Just before the election, however, ever the myopic cynic, he <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/17/mcconnell-trump-comments-00184188\">remarked</a>, \u201cWe\u2019re all on the same team now.\u201d Garland, by his desire to avoid being seen as partisan, created the critical space for Trump to re-emerge. Garland inadvertently tarnished the rule of law. Roberts, anxious about the court\u2019s reputation, has shredded its legitimacy. But for Cannon, the Maga apparatchik, all is perfection.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s squalor goes on. Smith can write a final report to be released before Trump takes office. Garland can make it public as his ultimate gesture. The Georgia Rico case has been on ice as a judge determines whether the prosecutor, Fani Willis, can continue in her role.</p> <p>If and when the case proceeds, Trump as president cannot be tried until his second term ends in 2029. But his 18 co-defendants, including Meadows, Eastman, Rudy Giuliani, and former acting attorney general Jeffrey Clark would face drawn-out trials that highlight Trump\u2019s plot. It\u2019s possible, however, that the Georgia judge overseeing the case may simply dismiss it in light of Trump\u2019s re-election. In New York, on 26 November, Trump will appear in a courtroom to be sentenced for his 34 felonies falsifying business records to cover up hush-money payments during the 2016 campaign that also factors in his 10 counts of contempt of court.</p> <p>In Arizona, the state fake elector case there of 11 Arizona Republican officials and seven former Trump associates on nine felony counts of conspiracy, fraud and forgery, including Giuliani, Meadows, Eastman and Trump lawyer Boris Epshteyn, is scheduled for trial on 5 January 2026. The indicted former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis has flipped to cooperate with the prosecution.</p> <p>Trump cannot pardon his co-conspirators at the state level. They are left to their fates. Meanwhile, he has pledged to pardon the imprisoned felons from the mob that attacked the Capitol on January 6, whom he calls \u201chostages\u201d. The pardons he signs will be symbols of his contempt for the law.</p> <p>Trump himself has escaped into the White House, which the US supreme court has declared the citadel of official immunity.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s most vital campaign did not involve his political consultants, the hysteria of his rallies, the paranoid TV spots about migrant murderers and transgender bogeymen, his blathering on \u201cbro\u201d podcasts or the prancing of a hopped-up Elon Musk. Nor was it about a garbage can in the ocean, eating pets or divine intervention. Trump\u2019s vulnerability was always at the forefront of his mind. He knew he could have been eliminated at crucial moments before election day. He was anxious about more than an assassination. He understood that his most threatening adversary was the criminal justice system. Trump had to get away with his crimes to survive. The making of the president required the unmaking of justice. Trump\u2019s bravado excited his Maga faithful even as it masked his furtive, frantic and desperate efforts to escape legal judgment. He committed new crimes to obstruct justice, to hide evidence for which he was additionally indicted. In all, he faced 54 felony charges apart from the 34 felony counts on which he was found guilty in the election and business fraud case involving hush money in New York. Among the federal charges against him were conspiracy to defraud the American people of a free and fair election, conspiracy against rights and corruptly concealing and destroying classified defense documents under the Espionage Act. In the Georgia state election interference case, he was indicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (Rico) Act along with 18 co-conspirators. The first result of Trump\u2019s re-election was the removal of his existential threat. If he had lost, he would have faced his trials and their consequences for the rest of his life. But on the morning after, the justice department informed the press that it would seek to close the cases against Trump. Under the policy of a 2000 memo from the justice department\u2019s office of legal counsel, a prosecution of a president would \u201cunduly interfere in a direct or formal sense with the conduct of the presidency\u201d. The old memo is Trump\u2019s get out of jail card. That document was a revised version of a post-Watergate OLC memo issued in 1973. The 2000 memo concurred with the conclusion of the earlier one: \u201cIn light of the effect that an indictment would have on the operations of the executive branch, \u2018an impeachment proceeding is the only appropriate way to deal with a President while in office.\u2019\u201d But the OLC memo is just a policy memo, not a judicial ruling, which was not updated to account for the new reality of alleged crimes of a former president. After Trump, it was complacently left to stand. Now that he has been elected again, the policy is being applied to the unanticipated and unique situation of years long ongoing cases to shutter the rule of law. Trump will be scot-free. The hammer blows that would have shattered his campaign never came. The gavel laid flat on the bench. As Trump eluded trial after trial, their looming shadows faded. If he had faced the music, he would have been convicted as an insurrectionist, thief of national security secrets and obstructer of justice and he would have been sentenced to prison months before the election. His strategy was justice delayed is justice denied. Instead of Trump\u2019s dominant message being his war against the law, he was permitted to fill the space with variations on the racist great replacement theory. \u201cPoison in the blood\u201d was heard rather than \u201cLadies and Gentlemen of the jury\u201d. Trump\u2019s strongman image inflated every time he beat the process. Whenever he delayed justice his legend grew. Every time he should have been subject to the law and wasn\u2019t, he appeared too big to fall. The inability to bring him to trial made the system seem weak and suspect. The law was anemic; he was indestructible. No man was above the law \u2013 with one exception. Without the presentation of the evidence in a courtroom setting and the verdict of a jury, he was able to sow doubt with the public about the charges and present himself as a political martyr. He played to the galleries he assembled, not juries empaneled under the law. Despite Trump\u2019s incessant motions and filings to delay and distract in his court cases, he did not hold back the wheels of justice all by himself. He alone could not fix it. For Trump to succeed, justice had to fail. It did not fail passively. He was rescued from judgment by four people, acting sequentially on wholly different motives, but leading to the same conclusion of letting the culprit run loose. Without his enablers, Trump would not have been protected. He confounded, thwarted and escaped the law because of the perverse decisions of the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, the chief justice, John Roberts and the US district court judge Aileen Cannon. None of the four had a more sustained personal relationship with Trump than McConnell. From his proximity he came to regard him as a \u201cdespicable human being\u201d, \u201cstupid as well as being ill-tempered\u201d, with \u201ccomplete unfitness for office\u201d, as he told an oral historian, according to his authorized biographer, Michael Tackett, in The Price of Power. McConnell stated that Trump\u2019s defeat in 2020 \u201conly underscores the good judgment of the American people. They\u2019ve just had enough of the misrepresentations, the outright lies almost on a daily basis, and they fired him. And for a narcissist like him, that\u2019s been really hard to take.\u201d After Trump was impeached for the insurrection on January 6, McConnell wavered on voting guilty. If Trump were to be found guilty, he could never again run for federal office. McConnell fell back on his political instinct that Trump was utterly discredited, though there was a risk that he might support Maga candidates to primary Republican senators who voted guilty as revenge. Before the vote on 13 February 2021, McConnell declared Trump \u201cpractically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day\u201d, but sidestepped convicting him by asserting that the penalty could not be applied because Trump was no longer president. McConnell pointed out that Trump would be held accountable in criminal trials. \u201cBut this just underscores that impeachment was never meant to be the final forum for American justice,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, Justice [Joseph] Story specifically reminded that while former officials were not eligible for impeachment or conviction, they were \u2013 and this is extremely important \u2013 \u2018still liable to be tried and punished in the ordinary tribunals of justice\u2019. Put another way, in the language of today: President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office, as an ordinary citizen, unless the statute of limitations has run, still liable for everything he did while in office, didn\u2019t get away with anything yet \u2013 yet. We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one.\u201d Joe Biden appointed Merrick Garland as his attorney general. Garland had a sterling and bipartisan record. He had sat as a judge on the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit since 1997, including seven years as chief judge, been a prosecutor at the justice department, notably handling the Oklahoma City bombing case and had a reputation for integrity and decency. He was extraordinarily collegial with Republicans. He had served as a moderator on at least 10 panels at the Federalist Society. When President Obama nominated him for the US supreme court, Garland seemed the ideal candidate. McConnell rejected him outright, not because of his qualifications, but because he played for keeps. McConnell wanted the seat available for a Republican president to fill, and it was filled by Trump, who followed the appointment of Neil Gorsuch with Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett off the Federalist Society list. McConnell felt he had used Trump for his own purposes. Then, when Biden named Garland to head the justice department, McConnell voted for his confirmation. It would be up to Garland to deal with Trump\u2019s crimes. On his first day at the Department of Justice, in his speech to its employees, Garland explained that he had in his \u201cDNA\u201d the \u201cnorms\u201d upheld by his hero, Edward Levi, the post-Watergate attorney general, a moderate Republican who acted above partisanship. \u201cThat there not be one rule for Democrats and another for Republicans\u201d, said Garland. And that was the \u201conly way we can succeed and retain the trust of the American people \u2026\u201d Garland was punctilious in his belief that pursuing Trump reflected a partisan impulse. \u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s painstaking approach to investigating Trump can be traced to Garland\u2019s desire to turn the page from missteps, bruising attacks and allegations of partisanship,\u201d the Washington Post later reported. \u201cInside Justice, however, some lawyers have complained that the attorney general\u2019s determination to steer clear of any claims of political motive has chilled efforts to investigate the former president. \u2018You couldn\u2019t use the T word,\u2019 said one former Justice official briefed on prosecutors\u2019 discussions.\u201d Garland\u2019s hero-worship of Levi was historically misplaced as a guide to his own role. Levi presided after the Watergate affair was wrapped up. But events had not cast Garland as Levi but potentially to be Judge John Sirica, who broke the conspiracy open. Garland\u2019s prosecution of the mob that attacked the Capitol was based on the theory of working from the bottom up. Those down the chain would then provide evidence against the crime boss. But Garland operated on the wrong theory of the case. He suffered a failure of imagination, unable to grasp he was dealing with an attempted coup, not merely a destructive riot. The evidence of the coup was clearly before him. Trump\u2019s fake elector scheme to prevent certification of the election occurred in plain sight in real time as it was happening. Trump\u2019s tape of pressuring Georgia election officials to forge ballots was publicly revealed three days before January 6. In the sort of investigation that Garland was conducting it might take months, if not years, for a low-level mafioso to wear a wire that might produce such incriminating evidence. Garland vowed to go after \u201call January 6th perpetrators, at any level\u201d, but as he racked up hundreds of cases against the Capitol mob he shied away from acting against the kingpin. On 12 May 2021, Liz Cheney was removed as chair of the House Republican conference. She had voted for Trump\u2019s impeachment and favored a congressional investigation into the January 6 insurrection. Those opposed to the rulings of the courts about January 6, she said, were \u201cat war with the constitution\u201d. A week later, on 19 May, McConnell refused to support the creation of a bipartisan joint committee to investigate. He claimed it would be \u201cslanted\u201d, and there were \u201cno new facts\u201d. The House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, rejected cooperation with any new probe. The House committee included Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, from Illinois, as the two Republicans. They were both censured by the Republican National Committee, which passed off the insurrection as \u201clegitimate political discourse\u201d. On 28 March 2022, the US district court judge David Carter, in ruling that Trump\u2019s legal adviser John Eastman must turn over his relevant emails to the committee, stated that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he and Trump \u201ccorruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021\u201d, and that they staged \u201ca coup in search of a legal theory\u201d. After Trump\u2019s former senior aides refused to honor the committee\u2019s subpoenas, they were referred to the DoJ for prosecution for contempt of Congress. Garland would not act. \u201cAttorney General Garland, do your job so we can do ours,\u201d beseeched Representative Elaine Luria of Virginia on 1 April. \u201cWe are upholding our responsibility. The Department of Justice must do the same,\u201d echoed Representative Adam Schiff of California. \u201cMr Meadows and Mr Scavino unquestionably have relevant knowledge about President Trump\u2019s role in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election and the events of January 6th. We hope the Department provides greater clarity on this matter,\u201d the committee replied. But the justice department declined to indict Trump\u2019s former chief of staff Mark Meadows and social media director Dan Scavino. At last, in April, after Carter\u2019s decision and the January 6 committee members\u2019 public criticism, the FBI launched an investigation into the fake elector scheme. It had taken Garland 15 months after assuming office to begin exploring the coup as something beyond a riot. On 8 August, FBI agents with a warrant entered Trump\u2019s residence in Florida, Mar-a-Lago, to seize classified national security material he had secreted there and refused to return to the government after longstanding multiple requests. On 15 November, Trump announced his presidential campaign. Three days later, Garland appointed Jack Smith, a DoJ prosecutor, as the independent special counsel to investigate both January 6 and the government documents cases. It was 21 months since Garland had become attorney general. He had fervently sought to avoid any taint of partisanship, but because of the delay the special counsel now worked under the color of a campaign. Smith worked swiftly. His indictments of Trump in the documents case came on 9 June 2023, following by additional ones for obstruction on 27 July. Then, on 1 August, he indicted Trump for January 6. The road to oblivion began. The US district court judge Tanya Chutkan set a trial date for 6 March 2024. Trump\u2019s lawyers filed numerous motions to delay, including the claim that as president Trump enjoyed complete immunity over what were official acts. Chutkan rejected the motions as preposterous, but Trump\u2019s stalling tactic worked, as she had to move back the trial date while a panel of three judges on the US court of appeals considered Trump\u2019s immunity claim. Smith\u2019s response on 23 December 2023 to Trump\u2019s filing must rank as the most intriguing document in the investigation. It received little attention. In it, the special counsel suggested a series of crimes that \u201ca President\u201d might commit with impunity on the basis of Trump\u2019s immunity claim. He could not accuse Trump of crimes for which he lacked the evidence. Yet his filing\u2019s hypotheticals seemed to describe grave offenses. Trump\u2019s \u201csobering\u201d immunity theory might cover \u201ca President who accepts a bribe in exchange for directing a lucrative government contract to the payer; a President who instructs the FBI Director to plant incriminating evidence on a political enemy; a President who orders the National Guard to murder his most prominent critics; or a President who sells nuclear secrets to a foreign adversary \u2026\u201d Did the special counsel have any evidence that pointed to any of those crimes? He presented them not as suspicions, but as logical extensions of Trump\u2019s radical theory \u2013 \u201cin each of these scenarios, the President could assert that he was simply executing the laws; or communicating with the Department of Justice; or discharging his powers as Commander-in-Chief; or engaging in foreign diplomacy.\u201d The three-judge appeals court panel ruled expeditiously against Trump on 6 February that \u201cany executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution\u201d. Trump appealed to the supreme court. It took its time to hear arguments on 25 April. Then, it waited until 1 July, the last day of its term, to issue its decision that Trump as a former president and private citizen had a presumption of \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d for his \u201cofficial actions\u201d. Roberts\u2019s opinion was a restatement of Smith\u2019s wild hypothetical version of Trump\u2019s immunity theory. The prosecution was ordered to tailor its indictment on those grounds, deleting anything to do with Trump\u2019s \u201cofficial actions\u201d. Roberts had positioned himself as a high-minded institutionalist, whose principal concern was the reputation of the court as Olympian in its deliberations. But the curtain had been pulled back to reveal a fast and furious trade in cash gifts and luxury vacations lavished by self-interested Republican donors on justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Ginni Thomas, a veteran far-right activist, was a cheerleader for the January 6 insurrection, especially the fake elector scheme in Arizona. Martha Ann Alito flew insurrectionist flags at the Alito house. Despite Roberts\u2019s pose, his main contributions as a jurist were to trash the crown jewel of the civil rights movement, the Voting Rights Act, and to eviscerate campaign finance reform through the Citizens United decision, which opened the sluice gates for unregulated big money. Despite his rulings that transparently empowered the Republican party, he fretted about criticism of the court as having any partisan leaning. The conservative majority adhered to the dogma of \u201coriginalism\u201d, claiming divination of the inner thoughts of the founders as a kind of legal scriptural fundamentalism. Yet Roberts\u2019s unprecedented ruling on immunity established a charter for the kind of unaccountable authoritarian presidency that the founders sought to prevent in the constitution. His opinion severed the conservatives from their originalist mythology to shield Trump. At the entrance of the marble temple of the supreme court are engraved the words, \u201cEqual Justice Under Law\u201d, which are now an enduring tribute to its hypocrisy. Following the court\u2019s new guidelines, Smith filed his new brief on 2 October. While it cut out some of the most dramatic evidence against Trump involving his pressure on Vice-President Mike Pence to toss out the legal electoral college votes and his manipulation of the justice department, the filing was still damning. It included the story of Trump\u2019s response to being told Pence was endangered by the mob. \u201cSo what?\u201d he replied. But the possibility for a trial before the election was by now long closed. In the documents case, the US district court judge Aileen Cannon ruled again and again to Trump\u2019s advantage. She is a thoroughly processed product of the Federalist Society transmission belt, from law school to the federal bench. Cannon was on the Federalist Society list when Trump ticked her off for appointment. She is, as the communists used to say, a reliable. In decision after decision, Cannon\u2019s reasoning was murky, her logic twisted and her rulings tilted. She denied Smith\u2019s request for a December 2023 trial date, moving it to 20 May 2024 after the Republican primaries. After seemingly endless motions in which she created every obstacle for delay, on 15 July, the first day of the Republican national convention, she dismissed the entire case on the absurd notion that the justice department had no authority to appoint a special counsel \u201cthreatening the structural liberty inherent in the separation of powers\u201d. That exact argument had been signaled in Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s opinion in the presidential immunity case issued two weeks earlier. Smith\u2019s appeal on 26 August noted that the DoJ had been naming special counsels for 150 years and that the Congress had passed four enabling pieces of legislation and provided funding for the office. But, again, Trump had already succeeded, with the timely aid of a helpful judge, in moving any trial beyond the election. A month before, in October, the Trump campaign leaked that Cannon was under consideration to succeed Garland as attorney general. By acting as the indispensable servants of Trump\u2019s lawlessness his helpers destroyed what they most venerated. McConnell had confided that \u201cthe Maga movement is completely wrong\u201d and that President Ronald Reagan \u201cwouldn\u2019t recognize it today\u201d. Just before the election, however, ever the myopic cynic, he remarked, \u201cWe\u2019re all on the same team now.\u201d Garland, by his desire to avoid being seen as partisan, created the critical space for Trump to re-emerge. Garland inadvertently tarnished the rule of law. Roberts, anxious about the court\u2019s reputation, has shredded its legitimacy. But for Cannon, the Maga apparatchik, all is perfection. Trump\u2019s squalor goes on. Smith can write a final report to be released before Trump takes office. Garland can make it public as his ultimate gesture. The Georgia Rico case has been on ice as a judge determines whether the prosecutor, Fani Willis, can continue in her role. If and when the case proceeds, Trump as president cannot be tried until his second term ends in 2029. But his 18 co-defendants, including Meadows, Eastman, Rudy Giuliani, and former acting attorney general Jeffrey Clark would face drawn-out trials that highlight Trump\u2019s plot. It\u2019s possible, however, that the Georgia judge overseeing the case may simply dismiss it in light of Trump\u2019s re-election. In New York, on 26 November, Trump will appear in a courtroom to be sentenced for his 34 felonies falsifying business records to cover up hush-money payments during the 2016 campaign that also factors in his 10 counts of contempt of court. In Arizona, the state fake elector case there of 11 Arizona Republican officials and seven former Trump associates on nine felony counts of conspiracy, fraud and forgery, including Giuliani, Meadows, Eastman and Trump lawyer Boris Epshteyn, is scheduled for trial on 5 January 2026. The indicted former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis has flipped to cooperate with the prosecution. Trump cannot pardon his co-conspirators at the state level. They are left to their fates. Meanwhile, he has pledged to pardon the imprisoned felons from the mob that attacked the Capitol on January 6, whom he calls \u201chostages\u201d. The pardons he signs will be symbols of his contempt for the law. Trump himself has escaped into the White House, which the US supreme court has declared the citadel of official immunity.

      "bodyText": "Elon Musk\u2019s influence on a Donald Trump administration could lead to tougher safety standards for artificial intelligence, according to a leading scientist who has worked closely with the world\u2019s richest person on addressing AI\u2019s dangers. Max Tegmark said Musk\u2019s support for a failed AI bill in California underlined the billionaire\u2019s continued concern over an issue that did not feature prominently in Trump\u2019s campaign. However, Musk has warned regularly that unrestrained development of AI \u2013 broadly, computer systems performing tasks that typically require human intelligence \u2013 could be catastrophic for humanity. Last year, he was one of more than 30,000 signatories to a letter calling for a pause in work on powerful AI technology. Speaking to the Guardian at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Tegmark said Musk, who is expected to be heavily influential in the president-elect\u2019s administration, could persuade Trump to introduce standards that prevent the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), the term for AI systems that match or exceed human levels of intelligence. \u201cI do think that if Elon manages to get Trump\u2019s ear on AI issues we\u2019re more likely to get some form of safety standards, something that prevents AGI,\u201d he said. Tegmark, a professor specialising in AI at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, added: \u201cHe might help Trump understand that an AGI race is a suicide race.\u201d Tegmark said Musk\u2019s support for the SB 1047 bill in California, in the face of opposition from many of his tech peers, was a positive sign for AI safety campaigners. The bill, which required companies to stress-test large AI models before releasing them, was vetoed by the California governor, Gavin Newsom, after he said it could drive AI businesses from the state and hinder innovation. \u201cElon Musk came out and said I\u2019m for it, I want the regulation. I do think it\u2019s not completely implausible he could persuade Trump that AI needs to be controlled,\u201d Tegmark said. Musk was an early supporter and financial backer of Tegmark\u2019s Future of Life Institute, which campaigns for safer use of cutting-edge technology. The Tesla chief executive and owner of X\u2019s personal fortune has swelled significantly since Trump\u2019s victory last week. Musk launched his own AI startup last year and said the world needed to worry about a \u201cTerminator future\u201d in order to head off the worst-case scenario of AI systems evading human control. Other AI professionals have argued that focusing on apocalyptic concerns distracts from focusing on short-term problems with AI systems, such as manipulated and misleading content. Trump has vowed to repeal a Biden administration executive order on AI safety; the Republican party\u2019s election platform described it as a set of restrictions that \u201cimposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology\u201d. The order includes requiring companies developing high-risk systems \u2013 AI models that pose a threat to national security, economic security or health and safety \u2013 to share their safety test results with the government.",

A court of appeal ruled on Tuesday that, while Shell does have a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to cut its emissions as a big oil company, this would not be achieved by imposing a specific legal goal. Shell had appealed against a lower court ruling in 2021 that it must cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels. It was the first such ruling against a company in the world. Shell\u2019s chief executive, Wael Sawan, welcomed the appeal decision, saying it was \u201cthe right one for the global energy transition, the Netherlands and our company\u201d.

That is why we will continue to tackle major polluters, such as Shell.\u201d Shell was originally told it must slash emissions within its own operations, as well as those of its suppliers and buyers, in line with the Paris climate agreement. During its appeal, Shell argued in court that corporate emissions were a matter for politicians, not the judiciary, and that any fossil fuels it chose not to extract would simply be exploited by another company. The appeals court said Milieudefensie had the right to bring such a claim even though political choices must be made to combat dangerous climate change. But it was not convinced that a reduction obligation imposed on a specific company would have the effect of limiting emissions from its customers, \u201cespecially if this reduction obligation can also be realised by selling less fossil fuels\u201d. Milieudefensie had accused Shell of failing to comply with the initial court ruling, which explicitly said the company should begin to act on the judgment immediately regardless of any appeal. The NGO gave evidence to the court that, despite increasing its volume of renewables, Shell was also planning to develop hundreds of new oil and gas fields despite the International Energy Agency warning against investments in any new fossil fuel extraction.

After all, when anyone can click a mouse and instantly resemble anyone of their choosing, maybe there\u2019s a newfound cachet in just organically looking a little bit like someone else. Maybe these lookalike competitions are a fight to keep humanity\u2019s soul. Maybe this is how we beat the machines. Theory four: young people are stupid and will do anything for attention. Actually, yes, let\u2019s just go with this for now.",

      "body": "<p><strong>We found a buyer for our leasehold flat, but on the day of exchange their lender declined to offer a mortgage, despite having previously agreed in principle. The reason was a provision in the lease for the ground rent, currently \u00a3200 per annum, to be amended every 25 years according to the market value of the property. We had no trouble securing a mortgage when we purchased the property, and it has not prevented sales of other flats in the building. We have subsequently spent thousands in legal fees trying to secure a deed of variation on the leasehold agreement to amend the ground rent clause but this has been endlessly held up by the freeholder. We now stand to lose our onward purchase.</strong></p> <p><em><strong>RC, London</strong></em></p> <p>You and your buyer have fallen victim to an iniquitous money-printing licence that lines the coffers of speculators. Ground rent is an annual fee paid to a freeholder to \u201crent\u201d the plot of land on which the property is built. Formerly it was a token amount, but in recent years it\u2019s become big business. Some ground rents of newer developments are allowed, by small print in the lease, to double every 10 or 20 years, or, in your more unusual case, to rise with the value of the property. Developers can make big profits by writing onerous clauses into the leases, then selling the freehold to investors, who are guaranteed an income stream in return for \u00adnothing at all.</p> <p>Campaigners urged the last government to cap existing rents, which can cripple unwary buyers, but their demands were omitted from the leasehold and freehold reform bill, which became law in July. However, another piece of legislation, the Leasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Act, prohibited monetary ground rents on leases issued after 2022.</p> <p>According to Sebastian O\u2019Kelly of the campaign group Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, it\u2019s a lease extension, rather than a deed of variation, that you need \u2013 a point you may want to explore with your own solicitors. A lease extension is a whole new contract and since ground rents are now forbidden in new leases it would mean the new owner wouldn\u2019t have to pay anything \u2013 but it costs a lot, as you have to pay the freeholder for the extension as well as a lawyer to draw it up. </p> <p>\u201cThis is an example of the property sector dumping new homeowners into highly complex ground rent terms,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dozy banks that initially lent on these properties have now woken up to the implications of highly aggressive lease terms. The obvious question is: why did they not spot these rip-offs when the leases were first sold and tell the housebuilder to rewrite them or they would not lend?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s unsurprising that your buyer\u2019s bank was nervous. Who, for instance, gets to decide on the market value of the property when the time comes to re-set the rent? The banking trade body UK Finance says that lenders are required to assess onerous lease terms that could affect borrowers\u2019 ability to repay a loan or the future saleability of a property. A good conveyancing solicitor should point out the potential impact of extra costs such as this.</p> <p><em>Email <a href=\"mailto:your.problems@observer.co.uk\">your.problems@observer.co.uk</a>.

      "bodyText": "We found a buyer for our leasehold flat, but on the day of exchange their lender declined to offer a mortgage, despite having previously agreed in principle. The reason was a provision in the lease for the ground rent, currently \u00a3200 per annum, to be amended every 25 years according to the market value of the property. We had no trouble securing a mortgage when we purchased the property, and it has not prevented sales of other flats in the building. We have subsequently spent thousands in legal fees trying to secure a deed of variation on the leasehold agreement to amend the ground rent clause but this has been endlessly held up by the freeholder. We now stand to lose our onward purchase. RC, London You and your buyer have fallen victim to an iniquitous money-printing licence that lines the coffers of speculators. Ground rent is an annual fee paid to a freeholder to \u201crent\u201d the plot of land on which the property is built. Formerly it was a token amount, but in recent years it\u2019s become big business. Some ground rents of newer developments are allowed, by small print in the lease, to double every 10 or 20 years, or, in your more unusual case, to rise with the value of the property. Developers can make big profits by writing onerous clauses into the leases, then selling the freehold to investors, who are guaranteed an income stream in return for nothing at all. Campaigners urged the last government to cap existing rents, which can cripple unwary buyers, but their demands were omitted from the leasehold and freehold reform bill, which became law in July. However, another piece of legislation, the Leasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Act, prohibited monetary ground rents on leases issued after 2022. According to Sebastian O\u2019Kelly of the campaign group Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, it\u2019s a lease extension, rather than a deed of variation, that you need \u2013 a point you may want to explore with your own solicitors. A lease extension is a whole new contract and since ground rents are now forbidden in new leases it would mean the new owner wouldn\u2019t have to pay anything \u2013 but it costs a lot, as you have to pay the freeholder for the extension as well as a lawyer to draw it up. \u201cThis is an example of the property sector dumping new homeowners into highly complex ground rent terms,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dozy banks that initially lent on these properties have now woken up to the implications of highly aggressive lease terms. The obvious question is: why did they not spot these rip-offs when the leases were first sold and tell the housebuilder to rewrite them or they would not lend?\u201d It\u2019s unsurprising that your buyer\u2019s bank was nervous. Who, for instance, gets to decide on the market value of the property when the time comes to re-set the rent? The banking trade body UK Finance says that lenders are required to assess onerous lease terms that could affect borrowers\u2019 ability to repay a loan or the future saleability of a property. A good conveyancing solicitor should point out the potential impact of extra costs such as this. Email your.problems@observer.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

Because in the postseason every mistake is magnified, and every big play is bigger.</p> <p>So, here are five of the NFL\u2019s most credible contenders, and the one potentially fatal flaw that could boot each one of those squads out of the race to Super Bowl LIX. The list is far from exhaustive \u2013 there are plenty of other teams who could win the title \u2013 feel free to add your own choices, and their weaknesses, below.</p> <h2><strong>Kansas City Chiefs (9-0)</strong></h2> <p><strong>Weakness: </strong>A lack of explosive offensive playmakers.</p> <p>The Chiefs are like Bill Belichick\u2019s best New England teams \u2013 no matter what weakness you think you can exploit, they\u2019ll develop another part of their game to beat you instead. And that\u2019s why these Chiefs are undefeated. But they\u2019re undefeated despite a severe lack of explosive plays, especially in the passing game. This season, Patrick Mahomes has just four completions of 20 or more air yards on 14 attempts for 168 yards, three touchdowns, three interceptions, and a passer rating of 77.1.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/11/angry-teammates-and-redemption-week-10-showed-kickers-really-do-matter\">Angry teammates and redemption: NFL week 10 showed kickers matter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To put that into perspective, Jordan Love of the Green Bay Packers leads the NFL with 15 such completions, and only two qualified quarterbacks \u2013 Jacoby Brissett of the New England Patriots and Deshaun Watson of the Cleveland Browns \u2013 have fewer than Mahomes. Neither Brissett nor Watson are starters on their own teams.</p> <p>Mahomes has much more going for him than Brissett and Watson, and the Chiefs\u2019 run game, defense, and special teams are keeping them afloat. But there has to be some concern in Kansas City about the lack of playmakers who can set opposing defenses on edge when it really matters. If the Chiefs go up against a more explosive offense in the postseason, and Steve Spagnuolo\u2019s excellent defense can\u2019t counter, what will the Chiefs\u2019 response be?</p> <h2><strong>Detroit Lions (8-1)</strong></h2> <p><strong>Weakness: </strong>A pass rush that may not be good enough.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to bet against the Lions after they overcame a 23-7 half-time deficit and Jared Goff\u2019s five interceptions to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671787/lions-texans\">beat a very game Houston Texans team</a> on Sunday night. But as we\u2019ve said, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK3Jx2yvtVE\">we\u2019re talking about the playoffs</a>. And in the playoffs, any flaw will be magnified. For the Lions, it\u2019s a pass rush that has obviously suffered since elite edge-rusher Aidan Hutchinson suffered a broken tibia and fibula in Week 6. With Hutchinson, the Lions had 18 sacks. In his absence, they\u2019ve managed just nine.</p> <p>The Lions\u2019 pressure rate is actually slightly better without Hutchinson, but that\u2019s because defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn has dialed up blitzes at a much higher rate \u2013 from 31.6% to 38.9% of their defensive snaps coming into the Texans game. That\u2019s all well and good, but blitzing at a higher rate makes you more vulnerable because there are fewer players to cover receivers. And when a defense has fewer sacks from more pressures, that tells you that defenders aren\u2019t getting to the quarterback as often. Yes, pressures are also important, but sacks stop the play.</p> <p>The recent trade for edge defender Za\u2019Darius Smith <a href=\"https://x.com/NFL_DougFarrar/status/1853932619689554167\">may fill in the crater left by Hutchinson\u2019s departure to a point</a>, but if it doesn\u2019t, that defense could be much more vulnerable to high-level passing games as the season progresses. Head coach Dan Campbell\u2019s optimism has done wonders, but it can\u2019t put quarterbacks on the ground.</p>    <h2><strong>Buffalo Bills (8-2)</strong></h2> <p><strong>Weakness: </strong>Having to build the whole plane out of Josh Allen \u2026 again.</p> <p>Buffalo\u2019s Sean McDermott should be considered for coach of the year, because this was supposed to be a rebuilding season for the team. Instead, these Bills look as dangerous as anyone when everything\u2019s working. A defense with many new parts and an entirely new secondary has clamped down pretty well, and the offense with Allen can be a serious problem for any defense.</p> <p>But throughout the Allen era, which really began in 2020 when he raised his game to the highest level, the Bills have tended to rely on their quarterback too much. This season is no different. James Cook and Ray Davis are decent running backs, but Allen has been the team\u2019s best rusher for years. And as much as Allen can win games as a passer, he hasn\u2019t had an alpha receiver in a long time. This season, the trade for former Browns receiver Amari Cooper has helped a bit, but first-round rookie Keon Coleman is still struggling with consistency, and the best receiver on the team is slot maven Khalil Shakir.</p> <p>There\u2019s no question that this is a brilliantly coached team on both sides of the ball, but relying too heavily on Allen has stopped the Bills from their Super Bowl goals over and over in recent years \u2013 usually at the altar of the Chiefs. And while Allen wouldn\u2019t be the first quarterback to go on a thermonuclear streak in the playoffs to nab a Lombardi Trophy, that\u2019s a lot to expect \u2013 no matter how good that quarterback may be.</p> <h2><strong>Pittsburgh Steelers (7-2)</strong></h2> <p><strong>Weakness: </strong>What if Russell Wilson is a mirage?</p> <p>The one thing you\u2019ll hear above all else when it comes to Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin is that he\u2019s never had a losing season, and this is his 18th year at the helm. That\u2019s a remarkable record. But Tomlin has had to paste things together at quarterback over the last few seasons, basically ever since Ben Roethlisberger started to decline in his final years with the Steelers.</p> <p>The 2024 Steelers bypassed the draft to solve their quarterback problem and instead traded for Justin Fields, and signed Wilson after he was released by the Denver Broncos. Fields was seen as a raw quarterback who needed the right environment, and Wilson was perceived to be the veteran whose best days were past him. Tomlin began the season with Fields as the starter, but went with Wilson instead in Week 7.</p> <p>Since Wilson became starter, the Steelers are averaging 30.3 points and 382 yards per game, as opposed to 20.7 points and 298 yards per game with Fields. Offensive coordinator Arthur Smith seems to understand what the Wilson offense has to be \u2013 a dynamic run game, with Wilson\u2019s deep-ball shots off play-action. That\u2019s what worked for Wilson in Seattle, and that\u2019s what Sean Payton didn\u2019t give him in Denver.</p> <p>This could propel Pittsburgh to a place it hasn\u2019t been in a while \u2026 but Wilson is also known to break down for stretches, and if he doesn\u2019t stay within himself, the Steelers could easily be back to relying on defense and special teams to scrounge them wins.</p> <h2><strong>Baltimore Ravens (7-3)</strong></h2> <p><strong>Weakness: </strong>A defense that is falling apart.</p> <p>In 2023, the Ravens had the NFL\u2019s best defense by pretty much every measure. They <a href=\"https://ftnfantasy.com/dvoa/nfl/defense-team-dvoa\">led the league in FTN\u2019s Defensive DVOA</a>, a metric that tabulates opponent-adjusted efficiency. They led the NFL in fewest points allowed at 280. They tied with the Browns and the New York Jets for the league\u2019s lowest yards per play average at 4.6. They allowed a league-low 19 passing touchdowns, and they had 15 interceptions. Only the Detroit Lions and the San Francisco 49ers had more total pressures than Baltimore\u2019s 308. This was an utterly dominant unit from front to back.</p> <p>Now, without former defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald, who left to become head coach of the Seattle Seahawks, and with rookie DC Zach Orr as his replacement, the Ravens rank 16th in Defensive DVOA. They\u2019ve allowed the NFL\u2019s third-most points at 253. They\u2019ve allowed 5.7 yards per play, tied with the New York Giants and Patriots for fourth-worst in the league. They\u2019ve allowed 22 passing touchdowns (the most in the league), and they have just six interceptions. Last season, opposing quarterbacks managed a passer rating of 77.9 against Baltimore\u2019s defense, behind only the New York Jets. This season, they\u2019ve allowed a passer rating of 102.0, which is sixth-worst.</p> <p>The Ravens are still a Super Bowl threat because their offense is firing on all cylinders, and Lamar Jackson may well win his second-straight MVP and third overall. But, at this rate, the Ravens offense will have to carry the defense for the rest of the season. <br><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK can strike a US trade deal with Donald Trump while also rebuilding EU relations after Brexit to cement its status as a \u201cbeacon of stability\u201d in an increasingly volatile world, a leading economist has said. Andy Haldane, the former Bank of England chief economist, said Keir Starmer\u2019s government could show the UK was \u201copen for business at a time when so much else of the world is looking inward \u2013 whether to the EU, or the US, it could really pay dividends\u201d. After Trump\u2019s election victory the prime minister has faced competing demands urging him to pick a side in trade talks with Washington and Brussels, just as he had begun a push to mend fences with Europe. However, Haldane suggested the UK government could have both with a trade policy straddling the Atlantic. \u201cI hope the government is in a position to really pat its head and rub its tummy at the moment,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cOf course we should pursue energetically an improved deal with the EU, although that won\u2019t be straightforward.

At least now we can commence that conversation. I\u2019d really love if we could do something on both sides,\u201d he added. However, other experts have argued an incoming Trump administration gives Britain new impetus to move closer to the EU, and warned that the UK would face tough demands for a US trade deal that would be harder to bargain for alone. On Monday, Starmer joined Emmanuel Macron in Paris for the French Armistice Day service, in a pointed show of European solidarity, amid growing alarm across global capitals over Trump reigniting trade conflicts worldwide. Trump threatened during his election campaign to impose tariffs of up to 20% on all US goods imports, and up to 60% and 100% for China and Mexico, in a ramping-up of the protectionist policies of his first administration. Haldane, who is now the chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts thinktank, warned this could reignite global inflationary pressures, generating a \u201cdowndraft\u201d for Britain\u2019s economy and driving up borrowing costs for UK households. However, he said he was more broadly \u201cvery optimistic about the UK in general\u201d because Britain appeared to be a relative safe haven on the world stage with a stable government that was committed to driving up investment in the economy. \u201cWe could be a beneficiary of some of these uncertainties and fractures appearing elsewhere around the world,\u201d he said. The economist said Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget had been \u201cpro business\u201d despite a \u201cfixation on the extra taxes\u201d from some bosses and the media because it stood as a downpayment on repairing battered public services and supporting growth-enhancing investment in infrastructure. \u201cLook, what were they [higher taxes] for?

Far from signalling an autocratic takeover, his rise shows a political landscape in flux. The 2008 crash and its <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-united-states-economy-why-such-a-weak-recovery/\">uneven recovery</a> marked the decline of the old economic order. But in 2016, the rise of Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left highlighted a real shift, as neoliberalism\u2019s grip loosened, making space for once marginalised ideas.</p> <p>Since then, two US presidencies have acknowledged the need to rebuild an economy that supports <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/30/voter-drive-biden-and-trump-battle-for-blue-collar-votes-in-auto-heartland\">blue-collar workers</a> affected by free trade, immigration and globalisation. While neither administration <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trumps-trade-war-what-was-it-good-for-not-much-147247\">succeeded</a> \u2013 and paid for it at the ballot box \u2013 the result has been a growing constituency on both sides of the American political divide that takes seriously, albeit often rhetorically, <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2024/11/american-industry-must-rise-again/\">economic injustice</a>. But for any political movement to become dominant, it has to shape the core ideas that matter to everyone, not just its diehard supporters.</p> <p>A subtle shift is taking place: once-taboo \u201cprotectionism\u201d is now a bipartisan issue, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/14/joe-biden-tariff-chinese-made-electric-vehicles\">Joe Biden upholding</a> Trump\u2019s tariffs on China. The two presidents have encouraged US companies to <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/the-ira-and-chips-act-are-supercharging-us-manufacturing-construction/\">reshore</a> manufacturing. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/02/marco-rubio-industrial-policy-done-right/\">Industrial policy</a>, missing since the 1990s, and antitrust actions now find advocates on both <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/technology/election-2024-ftc-lina-khan.html\">sides</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.niskanencenter.org/elizabeth-warren-wants-an-industrial-policy-here-are-the-traps-to-avoid/\">aisle</a>. Both Trump and Harris gauged voters\u2019 indifference to near-trillion-dollar deficits, promising on the campaign trail to protect <a href=\"https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/what-was-bidenomics/\">social security and Medicare</a>.</p> <p>While the methods are shared, the goals diverge. The US became the <a href=\"https://x.com/Peters_Glen/status/1855874423288369241\">world\u2019s top oil</a> and gas producer in the last decade. Biden sought to cultivate a green economy, while Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/10/trump-rallies-extreme-heat\">promoted fossil fuels</a> so aggressively that it bordered on self-parody.</p> <p>Biden fell short of delivering the transformation he had promised. He set out to tackle inequality, improve public services and address the climate crisis with a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/29/biden-4-trillion-spending-plan-485055\">$4tn plan</a> funded by taxing the wealthy \u2013 a mission to unite social liberalism with economic fairness. But his ambitious plans were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/the-guardian-view-on-bidens-green-deal-leadership-after-trumps-denialism\">shrunk</a> by lobbying by corporate interests and resistance from centrist Democrats.</p> <p>After Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Biden shifted away from economic radicalism. When inflation surged, instead of controlling prices, he allowed the cost of essentials to soar, causing the <a href=\"https://archive.ph/autrx\">steepest food-price hike</a> since the 1970s. In 2022, the poorest 20% of Americans spent nearly a third of their income on food, while the wealthiest fifth spent just 8%. Biden avoided emergency price controls, unlike <a href=\"https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/09/22/nixons-famous-price-freeze-did-stop-inflation/\">Richard Nixon</a> who implemented them in 1971 \u2013 and won a landslide reelection the following year.</p> <p>Biden learned the lesson too late, promising to tackle \u201c<a href=\"https://www.neweconomybrief.net/the-digest/greedflation-in-the-us-and-uk\">greedflation</a>\u201d as part of his reelection campaign. Once he dropped out, Harris said she would enact the \u201cfirst ever federal ban\u201d on food-price gouging. That was slamming the stable door shut long after the horse had bolted. However, in a sign that price controls were becoming mainstream in national politics, Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25woJjl6rk\">promised</a> to cap credit card interest rates.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric resonated with disillusioned voters, yet his first term\u2019s policies had often mirrored the establishment he criticised, blending and betraying the US\u2019s pro-market ideals. As the historian <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/us-2024-election-biden-disadvantaged-despite-major-policy-achievements-by-gary-gerstle-2024-06\">Gary Gerstle</a> writes in his book The Rise and Fall of the Neoliberal Order: \u201cIf [the administration\u2019s] deregulation, judicial appointments, and tax cuts pointed toward the maintenance of a neoliberal order \u2026 Trump\u2019s assault on free trade and immigration aimed at its destruction.\u201d Trump presents free trade and open borders as threats to US prosperity, advocating for strict controls that admit only goods and people aligned with American interests.</p> <p>The president-elect has abandoned the neoliberal tradition of keeping markets shielded from direct political influence, openly using his power to favour allies and enrich elites. While centrist Democrats support corporate interests by <a href=\"https://archive.ph/D9VsT\">blocking</a> progressive reforms, Trump aligns directly with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/07/trump-victory-adds-record-wealth-richest-top-10\">billionaires</a>, promoting a culture where justice serves the wealthy, prejudice is trivialised and power diminishes equality.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s unpredictable style and electoral success reflect a turbulent era when neither progressives nor authoritarians have secured control. Far from signalling an autocratic takeover, his rise shows a political landscape in flux. The 2008 crash and its uneven recovery marked the decline of the old economic order. But in 2016, the rise of Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left highlighted a real shift, as neoliberalism\u2019s grip loosened, making space for once marginalised ideas. Since then, two US presidencies have acknowledged the need to rebuild an economy that supports blue-collar workers affected by free trade, immigration and globalisation. While neither administration succeeded \u2013 and paid for it at the ballot box \u2013 the result has been a growing constituency on both sides of the American political divide that takes seriously, albeit often rhetorically, economic injustice. But for any political movement to become dominant, it has to shape the core ideas that matter to everyone, not just its diehard supporters. A subtle shift is taking place: once-taboo \u201cprotectionism\u201d is now a bipartisan issue, with Joe Biden upholding Trump\u2019s tariffs on China. The two presidents have encouraged US companies to reshore manufacturing. Industrial policy, missing since the 1990s, and antitrust actions now find advocates on both sides of the aisle. Both Trump and Harris gauged voters\u2019 indifference to near-trillion-dollar deficits, promising on the campaign trail to protect social security and Medicare. While the methods are shared, the goals diverge. The US became the world\u2019s top oil and gas producer in the last decade. Biden sought to cultivate a green economy, while Trump promoted fossil fuels so aggressively that it bordered on self-parody. Biden fell short of delivering the transformation he had promised. He set out to tackle inequality, improve public services and address the climate crisis with a $4tn plan funded by taxing the wealthy \u2013 a mission to unite social liberalism with economic fairness. But his ambitious plans were shrunk by lobbying by corporate interests and resistance from centrist Democrats. After Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Biden shifted away from economic radicalism. When inflation surged, instead of controlling prices, he allowed the cost of essentials to soar, causing the steepest food-price hike since the 1970s. In 2022, the poorest 20% of Americans spent nearly a third of their income on food, while the wealthiest fifth spent just 8%. Biden avoided emergency price controls, unlike Richard Nixon who implemented them in 1971 \u2013 and won a landslide reelection the following year. Biden learned the lesson too late, promising to tackle \u201cgreedflation\u201d as part of his reelection campaign. Once he dropped out, Harris said she would enact the \u201cfirst ever federal ban\u201d on food-price gouging. That was slamming the stable door shut long after the horse had bolted. However, in a sign that price controls were becoming mainstream in national politics, Trump promised to cap credit card interest rates. Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric resonated with disillusioned voters, yet his first term\u2019s policies had often mirrored the establishment he criticised, blending and betraying the US\u2019s pro-market ideals. As the historian Gary Gerstle writes in his book The Rise and Fall of the Neoliberal Order: \u201cIf [the administration\u2019s] deregulation, judicial appointments, and tax cuts pointed toward the maintenance of a neoliberal order \u2026 Trump\u2019s assault on free trade and immigration aimed at its destruction.\u201d Trump presents free trade and open borders as threats to US prosperity, advocating for strict controls that admit only goods and people aligned with American interests. The president-elect has abandoned the neoliberal tradition of keeping markets shielded from direct political influence, openly using his power to favour allies and enrich elites. While centrist Democrats support corporate interests by blocking progressive reforms, Trump aligns directly with billionaires, promoting a culture where justice serves the wealthy, prejudice is trivialised and power diminishes equality. This trickle-down bigotry will ultimately create a system where servility to power and social division become normalised, eroding fairness for everyone. Whether Trump can mobilise popular discontent over social and economic inequalities without alienating the oligarchs who support him remains an open question. In the months ahead, a struggle will unfold among factions within Trump\u2019s circle. Economic populists such as the Republican senator Josh Hawley and the vice-president-elect, JD Vance, will differ from libertarians such as Vivek Ramaswamy and the self-interested deregulatory agenda of Elon Musk. Trump\u2019s aim isn\u2019t to lift all boats, but rather to lift enough to convince voters to tolerate the corruption, consumer scams and environmental degradation that enrich a plutocratic class. This strategy, boosted by a pliant mediasphere, enables him to present a party of private power as the voice of the ordinary voter. American political life often oscillates between \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201crevolutionary\u201d phases \u2013 periods of stability interspersed with upheaval, where ideological shifts reshape public policy. After the crash but before Trump, the Tea Party was a rightwing populist movement frustrated by globalisation yet anti-worker in orientation. Revolutionary moments \u2013 such as the rise of nativist populism or democratic progressivism \u2013 trigger profound ideological shifts that reshape public values and policy. Trump\u2019s victory was historic, but it is not yet ideologically cohesive or triumphant. If that changes, it could permanently shift certain constituencies. In 1948, Democratic support for civil rights led African Americans to abandon their traditional allegiance to the Republicans. They left the party of emancipation for the party of Jim Crow. Betting that working-class voters have nowhere else to go is a gamble centrist politicians will profoundly regret. For Democrats, the traditional strategy of pairing social liberalism with modest economic reform no longer connects with today\u2019s voters.

      "bodyText": "What we learned: Tuesday 12 November We\u2019re going to wrap the blog up here for the day, thanks for following along, here\u2019s what happened today: Around 2,500 homes and businesses in Muswellbrook were left without power following the 4.1 magnitude earthquake around midday. The earthquake is likely part of an \u201cearthquake swarm\u201d that has been affecting the region for several months, said a government seismologist, who said the swarm could see \u201chundreds to thousands\u201d of small to moderate shocks. The NSW Nurses and Midwives Association has announced that its members will be striking for 24 hours from the start of tomorrow\u2019s morning shift over their ongoing pay dispute with the state government. This comes on the heels of the NSW police yesterday announcing a 40% wage increase, compared with the 15% wage increase nurses and midwives have been demanding. Rallies are being planned for Sydney and in regional centres. NSWNMA general secretary, Shaye Candish, said members were \u201cfurious\u201d over the government\u2019s actions, which they said \u201csnubbed\u201d the state\u2019s largest female-dominated workforce. The Coles chair, James Graham, has told the supermarket\u2019s annual general meeting it had been \u201cdisappointing to see how cost-of-living issues have been politicised\u201d as he defended the company\u2019s profit levels. Representatives of Coles and rival Woolworths have appeared at several parliamentary inquiries, and the major chains are the target of a government-ordered examination of their pricing and business practices, conducted by the competition regulator. La Ni\u00f1a might be off but summer on the east coast is still predicted to be a damp one, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Despite the BoM saying yesterday it is likely we won\u2019t have a La Ni\u00f1a event later this year (or in early 2025), those hoping for a return to a sunnier summer are likely to be disappointed, with the BoM\u2019s long-range forecasts putting the odds on the summer being a relatively damp one for eastern Australia. A 53-year-old man has been charged after the body of a woman, aged 50, was found in a Penrith hotel on Sunday, NSW police report. We\u2019ll see you back here tomorrow. Asic sues Cbus, alleging systemic failures in handling of claims Asic has announced it is suing the Construction and Building Unions Superannuation Fund (Cbus), alleging systemic failures in the handling of claims by its members and claimants, saying the fund \u201cfailed its members and claimants at their most vulnerable time\u201d. More than 10,000 members and claimants of the Cbus fund were impacted by death benefits and total and permanent disability (TPD) insurance claims taking more than 90 days to be processed, according to allegations contained in documents lodged by Asic in the federal court today. The civil penalty proceedings filed by Asic against United Super Pty Ltd (United Super), the trustee of Cbus, allege that from September 2022 to November 2024, it failed to act efficiently, honestly and fairly in the handling of claims for death benefits and TPD insurance. The financial loss has been estimated by Cbus to be $20m to members and claimants. The Asic deputy chair, Sarah Court, said: \u201cDelays in claims processing like those alleged by Asic cause real harm to families who may be relying on the payments to meet critical expenses. This adds to difficult personal circumstances, whether grieving for a loved one or dealing with severe injury or illness. The additional anxiety and pain these delays caused compounded the issues these members and their families faced. \u201cBy late 2022, more than 6,000 Cbus members and claimants had their payments delayed by more than 12 months. Extraordinarily, that equates to more than 50% of Cbus\u2019 total claims at that time. We allege they are yet to completely rectify these issues.\u201d Victoria police negotiating with armed man in Weir Views Victoria police have said officers are negotiating with a man armed with a gun at a property on Leon Drive in Weir Views, on the western outskirts of Melbourne. In a statement, police said the man fired shots at the officers before entering the house, with no one injured. The area surrounding has been cordoned off while the incident is under way. Police have said they will provide further information when it becomes available. Again, we\u2019ll keep you updated as we learn more. Human Rights Law Centre condemns announcement of new penalties for those who obstruct railways during protests More reaction to the announcement today by the NSW government, of stronger penalties for those who obstruct railways as part of protests. In a statement, the premier, Chris Minns, and the attorney general, Michael Daley, said new legislation would be introduced this week to implement a maximum fine of $22,000 for \u201cobstructing a railway\u201d on top of two years\u2019 imprisonment. The Human Rights Law Centre has issued a statement condemning what they described as \u201cMinns\u2019 latest attempt to stifle peaceful protest\u201d. Earlier this year, the Human Rights Law Centre\u2019s Protest in Peril report found that anti-protest laws disproportionately target environmental defenders and people advocating for action on climate change. \u201cNSW already has some of the most heavy-handed anti-protest laws in the country, with successive governments enacting the highest number of anti-protest laws over the last two decades,\u201d said David Mejia-Canales, senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre. Peaceful protest has been critical to advancing reforms we now take for granted, like women\u2019s voting rights, workplace safety, and the protection of the environment from pollution. Instead of criminalising peaceful protesters with draconian laws, Premier Minns should be listening to the urgent calls for climate action. Head of group in charge of take-off and landing slots at Sydney airport defends system The head of the group that allocates take-off and landing slots to airlines at Sydney airport held back tears as she defended against accusations her organisation had granted favourable access to the airport to its majority owners Qantas and Virgin. Petra Popovac, the CEO of the Capacity Optimisation Group \u2013 formerly known as Airport Coordination Australia which counts Qantas Group and Virgin Australia as its largest shareholders \u2013 appeared before a Senate committee hearing on Tuesday examining proposed reforms to the legislation governing Sydney airport. The hearing earlier heard from Qantas representatives who categorically denied that the airline schedules more flights than it intends to operate out of Sydney before strategically cancelling services so as to not lose its slots to new entrants wanting to launch rival services. The existing system, which allows airlines to keep their slots so long as they don\u2019t cancel a service more than 20% of the time, has been labelled as inappropriate by aviation experts and former competition watchdog chair Rod Sims, amid claims that Qantas and Virgin are hoarding slots to block competition. However on Tuesday, Popovac hit out at Sims\u2019 previous criticisms of the slot system at Sydney airport, which have included labelling the collapse of Rex\u2019s jet operations between metropolitan cities a public policy failure. Popvac said: \u201cI especially question the remarks made by Rod Sims as it is evident he lacks knowledge on the topic and is providing misleading information to the public\u201d. In contrast to claims from submissions and previous evidence before the committee, Popovac said Sydney \u2013 which is limited by law to 80 take-off and landing movements per hour \u2013 had no slot issues, and was \u201cone of the least congested airports\u201d that her group coordinates. She also blasted what she said had been a \u201cperceived bias\u201d against her group \u2013 due to its majority shareholders \u2013 and said part of the reason for rebranding the group was to move past the reputation. Popovac also referenced claims from the heads of fallen airline Bonza, and Rex\u2019s leaders before entering administration, about the challenges of getting access to slots at peak times at Sydney airport, insisting they never formally applied for such slots. A man has been charged after the body of a woman was found in a Penrith hotel on Sunday, NSW police report. Emergency services were called to a hotel on Mulgoa Road about 1pm on Sunday 10 November 2024, after the discovery of the woman\u2019s body, in the same room as a man suffering cuts to his arms. The man was treated by NSW Ambulance paramedics before being airlifted to Westmead hospital for further treatment. The woman is believed to be aged 50. Following inquiries, detectives charged a 53-year-old man with murder. He was refused bail at a bedside court hearing today and will appear before Penrith local court tomorrow. Victoria police respond to incident at Weir Views Victoria police have said they are attending to an incident at Weir Views, a suburb south of Melton on the western outskirts of Melbourne. Police issued a statement about the incident a short time ago, telling residents who live near Leon Drive they should stay inside their homes until they receive further advice. Police have not provided any more details at this stage, but said they would provide further information when it was available. We will keep you updated as we learn more. A 4.1 magnitude earthquake that rocked the Upper Hunter town of Muswellbrook today is likely part of an \u201cearthquake swarm\u201d that has been affecting the region for several months, said a government seismologist, who said the swarm could see \u201chundreds to thousands\u201d of small to moderate shocks. Today\u2019s earthquake is the fourth event over magnitude four in three months in the Hunter region. On 23 August, a 4.7 magnitude earthquake hit Muswellbrook. \u201cIf the earthquake follows a \u2018main shock, aftershock\u2019 sequence, the largest aftershock we generally expect to be one unit of magnitude is smaller than the main shock,\u201d said Hadi Ghasemi, senior seismologist at Geoscience Australia. \u201cBut what we are observing here is a series of magnitude four and above earthquakes. \u201cIn this case, we have had, I think, four, magnitude four and above events in the sequence so far,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are observing in general is the earthquake swarm activity \u2013 a series of moderate-sized events, happening close to each other, both in time and space \u2026 and they may continue for months to come. \u201cAnd you know, each swarm sequence may include hundreds to thousands of small to moderate side events,\u201d he said. Ghasemi said a \u201cmoderate\u201d shock, which he said was not a technical term, but to him meant an earthquake of magnitude five or below, could see property damage such as cracks in the walls, and items falling off shelves, and that people close to the epicentre would experience \u201ca strong level of ground shaking\u201d. Man charged after alleged assault on Oxford Street, Sydney A man has been charged as investigations continue into an assault in Darlinghurst over the weekend. An 18-year-old was arrested and charged with affray and stalk/intimidate intend fear physical etc harm (personal), after an incident on Oxford Street, about 3.30am on Saturday 9 November 2024. Police were told a 19-year-old man was walking through Taylor Square with a friend, when they were allegedly approached by a group of men. The group of men allegedly yelled homophobic slurs before assaulting the 19-year-old man. He was treated by NSW Ambulance paramedics for facial injuries. Following inquiries, around 10.30am on Sunday 10 November 2024, detectives attended a home in Malabar and arrested an 18-year-old man. He was taken to Maroubra police station where he was charged. He was granted conditional bail to appear before Downing Centre local court on Monday 9 December 2024. Victorian coal plant goes offline after leak in boiler tube One of Victoria\u2019s biggest power stations, EnergyAustralia\u2019s Yallourn plant, went offline this morning without notice. According to a company spokesperson, Unit Three at the coal-fired station \u201csuffered a leak in a boiler tube\u201d. \u201cWhile removing that unit from service, automatic safety protections were tripped, forcing the other units offline,\u201d he said. Importantly, no one was hurt and EA\u2019s teams are working to have all four units up and running by tomorrow morning. The plant can supply more than a fifth of Victoria\u2019s electricity, and its sudden exit from the grid caused a drop in frequency below the normal operations band, according to industry analysts, Watt Clarity. It\u2019s a been a volatile few days for the national electricity market with some big price spikes in wholesale power markets in NSW and Queensland in recent evenings. That\u2019s partly been the result of an extended heatwave across northern Australia. Let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t too many sudden outages from (ageing) power stations when summer pushes up power demand more broadly across eastern states. La Ni\u00f1a might be off but that doesn\u2019t mean summer won\u2019t be a damp one As flagged yesterday, the Bureau of Meteorology\u2018s fortnightly update of the climate drivers influencing Australia\u2019s weather reinforces the likelihood that we won\u2019t have a La Ni\u00f1a event later this year (or in early 2025). Those hoping the absence of La Ni\u00f1a (which would have been four out of five years) might mean a return to a more typical summer (think sunshine) for eastern Australia are likely to be disappointed. BoM\u2019s long-range forecasts don\u2019t quite declare summer to be cancelled but the odds certainly favour it being a relatively damp one. Relatively warm seas around Australia is one factor and globally, there were near record warm levels as of the end of October, BoM says. And yes, the background heating of climate change means most of Australia faces warmer than usual day and night temperatures on land. \u201cMuggy\u201d looks to be in season for a while. Supreme court judge to resign after losing \u2018moral authority\u2019 in wake of assault conviction A Supreme court judge who could receive a jail sentence for assaulting and emotionally abusing his then-partner will resign from the position, AAP reports. Tasmanian Justice Gregory Geason struck the woman at a Hobart home in October 2023 and pushed her, causing her to fall into a mantelpiece and suffer concussion and bruising, He was found guilty on October 16 of assault and one count of emotional abuse or intimidation, which involved tracking her movements, being jealous, aggressive and calling her names. During sentencing submissions on Tuesday, Geason\u2019s lawyer Fabiano Cangelosi told Hobart magistrates court his client would resign as a supreme court judge. \u201c(Geason) considers he has lost the moral authority necessary for any judicial officer to sit in judgment over other human beings,\u201d Mr Canglosi said. \u201cThe defendant has reached the conclusion he is not able to sit as a judge.\u201d Tasmania\u2019s parliament in December abandoned an attempt to suspend Geason, who has been on leave since November 2023, because of constitutional worries. No date was aired in court for the resignation of Geason, 63, who is expected to be sentenced on Thursday. The maximum penalties for common assault were 12 months jail and a $4,040 fine, while emotional abuse carried a maximum two-year jail term and $8,080 fine, the court was told. Director of public prosecutions Daryl Coates SC said Geason\u2019s offending was a serious example of common assault and a jail term, suspended or not, should be considered. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Kate Lyons will be here to take you through the rest of our rolling coverage. \u2018No people smuggling ventures have been successful under our government,\u2019 government spokesperson A spokesperson for the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, has released a statement following reports of four unlawful maritime arrivals in the Northern Territory: No people smuggling ventures have been successful under our government. People who come to Australia by boat have zero chance of success. Continuing from our last post, the LNP government in Queensland has used the past few days to make a series of announcements and statements claiming budget blowouts in the final throes of the former Labor government. Comments querying the PsiQuantum arrangement came in addition to claimed blowouts in costs for construction of Olympic venues and key transport projects. The government today said there had been unannounced cost increases to the Cross-River Rail project \u2013 about $490m \u2013 signed off in September, just before the former government went into caretaker mode. Queensland premier responds to reports treasurer sought briefings on PsiQuantum future The Queensland premier, David Crisafulli, says it would be \u201cpremature for me to even speculate\u201d about whether the state might cancel a $470m investment in a quantum supercomputer being built in Brisbane. The Australian reported today that the treasurer, David Janetzki, had sought briefings about the PsiQuantum project to build the world\u2019s first fault-tolerant quantum computer. The federal and Queensland governments plan to invest a combined $1bn in the project. Asked whether the state might cancel its investment \u2013 or if it could face financial penalties for doing so \u2013 Crisafulli said the new government\u2019s position remained unchanged from when it had raised questions about the plan while in opposition. He said Janetzki was seeking a briefing to better understand the nature of the deal and the government\u2019s commitment: It would be premature for me to even speculate on that. Before the election, during the course of estimates, as well as publicly, we asked questions about how the deal was struck. We\u2019ll ask the same questions after. Asked if he had an opinion about the merits of the quantum computer project, Crisafulli said: \u201clet\u2019s have a look at the deal\u201d. It\u2019s early days, [Janetzki] has only just sought that [briefing]. We\u2019d like answers to questions we asked nearly a year ago. Queenslanders could have been furnished with all of this, we asked what we thought were mature and relevant questions. Unlawful arrivals the latest \u2018shocking\u2019 border security failure, opposition says The shadow minister for home affairs, James Paterson, says reports of four unlawful maritime arrivals in the Northern Territory represent \u201cthe latest shocking border security failure under the Albanese Labor government\u201d. In a statement he said that if confirmed, this would be the eighth boat to breach Australia\u2019s borders and reach the Australian territory since Labor was elected and the 23rd attempted people-smuggling venture to attempt the journey to Australia. This comes after the Department of Home Affairs admitted at Senate estimates last week that it was setting itself easier homework by removing the performance target for aerial and maritime surveillance of our borders from its latest annual report in the knowledge that, as in previous years, these targets would not be met. This latest boat arrival is an unfortunate but predictable consequence of Labor\u2019s continued neglect of our border protection architecture, which has seen a decrease in aerial flying hours of 21.4% and a decrease of 16% in ABF maritime patrol days compared to 2020-21 levels since Labor took government. Paterson said the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, must \u201cimmediately act to correct the government\u2019s failed border policies\u201d and restore the Coalition\u2019s Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB) policy. The NSW Nurses and Midwives Association has announced that its members will be striking for 24 hours from the start of tomorrow\u2019s morning shift over their ongoing pay dispute with the state government. This comes on the heels of the NSW police yesterday announcing a 40% wage increase, compared to the 15% wage increase nurses and midwives have been demanding. Rallies are being planned for Sydney and in regional centres including Armidale, Broken Hill, Coffs Harbour, Crookwell, Moruya, Lismore, Port Macquarie, Taree, and Tweed. NSWNMA general secretary, Shaye Candish, said members were \u201cfurious\u201d over the government\u2019s actions: Once again, the NSW government has snubbed nurses and midwives, leaving behind the state\u2019s largest female-dominated workforce. The decision to give police more than double the offer for nurses, speaks volumes. The message to NSW women, who make up 86% of our nursing and midwifery workforce, is clear: their hard work is worth less in the eyes of this government. The government cannot continue to ignore the reality that NSW\u2019s healthcare system is crumbling due to severe understaffing and unfair wages. They cannot avoid the responsibility of fixing this crisis any longer. Our nurses and midwives are at breaking point and are crying out for help; they can\u2019t work in these conditions any longer. Minimal, life-preserving staffing will be maintained in all public hospitals and health services during the 24-hour strike. Wildlife Victoria recorded its highest volume of calls in a single day yesterday, since the service began 35 years ago. The wildlife emergency response service said it received 1,032 requests for assistance yesterday, with calls sky-rocketing this spring. October was its biggest month ever with 21,644 calls for help from the public. But over 1,000 calls in 24 hours is unprecedented and a red flag for Victoria\u2019s wildlife, the service said. Lisa Palma, its CEO, said: Our native wildlife are under ever increasing pressure and the number of calls for assistance indicates the level of concern from Victorians when it comes to the protection of our native animals. We\u2019re committed to ensuring every call is answered and every animal reported receives the appropriate care. But we\u2019re doing it extremely tough. The most common reason for calls were reports of sick, injured, or orphaned kangaroos, with many individual animals reported multiple times by concerned callers. More than 180 kangaroos required volunteer assistance across all parts of the state, from a kangaroo trapped in Melbourne Airport\u2019s short-term parking complex, to another hopping down a busy Newport street, to Geelong and a kangaroo trapped in a residential backyard. Senator Tammy Tyrrell to oppose government\u2019s misinformation and disinformation bill Independent Tasmanian senator Tammy Tyrrell says she will be voting against the government\u2019s misinformation and disinformation bill. In a post to X, she listed her reasoning: Putting the responsibility onto social media companies to decide what is or isn\u2019t misinformation in Australia is a slippery slope. The definitions of misinformation and disinformation are vague and I\u2019m not convinced this bill can actually be enforced. One person\u2019s truth can be another person\u2019s lie, and both sides have the evidence to back up their arguments. What is and isn\u2019t truth or the facts isn\u2019t always clear cut \u2013 I mean, have you met politicians? Thousands of people reached out to me concerned about this bill. I understand the intent behind this. But it\u2019s important to me that people feel free to express different opinions without fear of being shut down. Having conversations that challenge our views is how we grow. South Australian SES testing warning systems The South Australian SES said it would be testing its warning systems today, \u201ccommencing shortly\u201d. It said it will issue numerous warnings over the next few hours, marked \u201cTEST\u201d, on social media, and will issue another public notice to advise once testing is completed. We ask that you do not act upon any of these public notices or warnings and thank you for your patience. Woman dies in collision in NSW A woman has died in a two-vehicle collision north-west of Sydney. According to NSW police, a Holden and a Toyota Landcruiser collided at Wilberforce about 12.40pm. The driver of the Holden, a woman believed to be aged in her 70s, died at the scene. The driver of the Toyota, a 57-year-old man, and his two passengers were uninjured. The man will be taken to hospital for mandatory testing, police said. A crime scene has been established and police have commenced inquiries. A report will also be prepared for the coroner. Putty Road is closed in both directions, with motorists advised to avoid the area. Qantas has sought to quell frustration at fresh data showing that airfares had spiked since Rex\u2019s metropolitan city flights collapsed, insisting a reported 13% rise in ticket prices nationally over the past quarter unfairly captured a surge in demand from a Coldplay concert in Melbourne. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission\u2019s (ACCC) quarterly domestic airline monitoring report was released today, which found Qantas and Virgin\u2019s duopoly had surged to 98% market dominance since the liquidation of Bonza and collapse of Rex\u2019s jet operations. The ACCC analysed transport department data and found that since Rex suspended its jet operations between metropolitan cities across 11 routes and entered administration, the average airfare on all major city routes increased by 13.3% in the quarter to September 2024. The average cheapest economy tickets increased dramatically on routes formerly serviced by Rex: Adelaide to Melbourne services jumped 95% to $296; Melbourne to Gold Coast was up 70% to $432; and Canberra to Melbourne rose 54% to $298. Qantas hit back at the framing of the data, claiming the fare data quoted by the ACCC \u201cdoes not reflect the average fares customers are actually paying\u201d. Qantas said: The data is from the government\u2019s monthly fare monitoring which expressly states that it does not measure \u2018average fares paid by passengers\u2019. It is a snapshot of the lowest fares available to purchase on a particular day three weeks prior to travel and does not factor in events which may impact demand and fares. The day selected in the latest report was 31 October, which is when Melbourne was hosting Coldplay. As such, demand was significantly higher on flights into Melbourne which means lower fares were snapped up early and the fares left available to purchase three weeks out were higher than usual. The average fare increase on these routes between July and October was significantly lower. Power restored to 1,700 following earthquake in the Lower Hunter An Ausgrid spokesperson has confirmed that power has been restored to 1,700 customers in the Muswellbrook region following today\u2019s 4.1 magnitude earthquake. It said the last 800 affected customers should have power returned \u201cwithin the next hour\u201d. Crews are also continuing to patrol the area checking for faults and electrical hazards. As we flagged earlier, the ABC has reported that four foreign nationals were found on remote Croker Island in the Northern Territory yesterday. The four foreign nationals are no longer in Australia. Guardian Australia has asked the government to clarify if this means they have been taken back to their country of departure, of origin, or to Nauru. Mt Arthur coalmine the epicentre of 4.1 magnitude earthquake, according to map According to Geoscience Australia\u2019s earthquake map, the epicentre of the earthquake appears to be at the Mt Arthur coalmine \u2013 just outside Muswellbrook. We\u2019ve contacted BHP for more information, and will bring you the latest when we can. A number of people on social media have reported feeling the quake, with \u201cfelt\u201d reports on Geoscience Australia reaching more than 370. St James\u2019 primary school in Muswellbrook said it had no power and would need an inspection, asking parents to come and collect their children. Around 2,500 homes and businesses in Muswellbrook are without power following the 4.1 magnitude earthquake around midday, which we flagged earlier. The earthquake struck near the NSW Upper Hunter region town at 12.12pm. According to Ausgrid, 2,509 customers are impacted by the outage, with an expected restoration time of 2.30pm. Muswellbrook public school posted to Facebook that everyone is safe and well, and the school would remain operational. Goodstart Early Learning centre said it had power and there was no need to pick up children. Muswellbrook Doctors said it was experiencing issues with its phone line and \u201care working hard to resolve the problem\u201d. At this stage, we\u2019re unsure when the phones will be back up and running. Queensland town faces anxious wait as bushfire fight continues The remote Queensland town of Forsayth is facing an anxious wait as firefighters combat a looming blaze that has burned for almost a week, leaving a 70km trail of damage. As AAP reports, the blaze destroyed a house after it first began near Einasleigh six days ago and has since burned more than 56,000 hectares, damaging railway lines and bridges. The Gulf Country town was not pinning its hopes on forecast showers reducing the fire risk, with strong northeasterly winds and another day of 40C-plus temperatures set to again test fatigued crews. A \u201cprepare to leave\u201d warning for Forsayth, northwest of Townsville, has been downgraded to a \u201cstay informed\u201d alert. Backup has arrived from around the region to relieve exhausted crews who have been battling the blaze on the ground and in the air. Almost a dozen crews were at one stage fighting the fire \u2013 including four planes and a Black Hawk helicopter \u2013 along with rangers, council workers and local farmers. The local mayor Barry Hughes said fatigue was \u201cplaying a huge role across the front-line fire fighters\u201d. Temperatures are set to hit 41C at Forsayth, extending a run of hot weather in the region. The state\u2019s north-west is predicted to break a November record of ten straight days above 40C, last recorded back in 2015. \u2018We will miss her like crazy\u2019: Family issues statement on death of kindergarten worker The family of 43-year-old kindergarten worker Eleanor Bryant has released a statement, after she died saving her young students from an out-of-control truck yesterday. The statement, released by Victoria police on behalf of the family, says: We are devastated by the loss of our beautiful Eleanor. She was the light of our lives: a cherished mother, wife, daughter and sister, and beloved by all her family and enormous network of friends. Her infectious smile, sense of humour and passion for life made her a joy to be around. There is an enormous hole in our hearts today. We thank the emergency services for their tireless work and the public for their beautiful tributes. We will miss her like crazy. We thank you for respecting our privacy at this difficult time. BoM issues thunderstorm warning for NSW The Bureau of Meteorology says severe thunderstorms may develop around northern NSW today, particularly the Northern Tablelands. Heavy rain, damaging wind gusts and large hail are possible, it said. This comes as widespread thunderstorms are expected every day this week across large swathes of the country. Four foreign nationals found in remote part of Northern Territory: ABC The ABC is reporting that four foreign nationals have been found on remote Croker Island in the Northern Territory. The Northern Land Council told the ABC the four men were found by traditional owners in the area and were suffering from exhaustion amid the ongoing heatwave. The men reportedly told traditional owners they had paid someone to be taken to Australia. In a statement, the Australian Border Force said it \u201cdoes not confirm or comment on operational matters\u201d. Magnitude 4.1 earthquake felt in NSW Hunter A magnitude 4.1 earthquake has been felt at Muswellbrook, in the NSW Hunter region. According to Geoscience Australia, nearly 300 \u201cfelt\u201d reports have been lodged so far, since it struck at 12.12pm. In September, the region \u2013 about 125km north-west of Newcastle \u2013 experienced an \u201cearthquake swarm\u201d, with a series of moderate to large earthquakes with their own aftershock sequences. The Liddell power station, one of seven sites where the Coalition has proposed a nuclear power station, is less than 20km away from Muswellbrook. Here is what we reported at the time: Nature Conservation Council says renewable transition \u2018once in a generation\u2019 opportunity to restore degraded habitat The Nature Conservation Council of NSW has welcomed a commitment from the state government to reduce planning delays for renewable energy projects (more on this earlier in the blog). CEO Jacqui Mumford said the state needs a four-fold increase in wind farm construction \u201cto provide clean, cheap electricity ahead of the closure of the state\u2019s aging coal-fired power stations\u201d. The state is behind on its legislated climate targets and has already made the costly and polluting decision to extend the largest coal power station\u2019s closure date by two years. Mumford also labelled the renewable energy transition as a \u201conce in a generation\u201d opportunity to restore degraded habitat. She said: Where developers are siting projects on already cleared land, they should be looking at opportunities to restore damaged creek lines or revegetate, for example. We are in a biodiversity crisis \u2013 only half of NSW\u2019s threatened species are expected to survive in 100 years due to pressures of climate change and land clearing. Action is needed now to strengthen nature laws and use the renewable transition to reach emissions reductions and biodiversity goals. Victorian Greens criticise changes to structure of councils Further to the Victorian Greens leader Ellen Sandell\u2019s comments we brought to you earlier about the party\u2019s local government election results, they have released a statement criticising changes to the structure of councils. The Greens local government spokesperson, Sarah Mansfield, said while the party had increased its overall vote across the state, it had elected 28 councillors \u2013 8 fewer than elected at the 2020 local government elections. Mansfield puts the blame on changes introduced by the state Labor government following 2020, which imposed single-member wards. She said: We\u2019ve seen huge swings to the Greens in many communities across the state, and based on the way people voted we should have even more councillors elected but Labor\u2019s undemocratic single-member wards are distorting the will of communities. Despite Labor\u2019s best effort to wipe out the Greens with single-member wards, we\u2019ve proved that can\u2019t be done. Manfield said in Merri-Bek, the Greens vote nearly doubled and they won four out of nine council seats, as well as picking up three council seats in Maribyrnong and Darebin and electing councillors for the first time in regional areas like Bass Coast and Mount Alexander. A previous version of this post incorrectly stated the Greens had elected 11 fewer councillors across the state. Victoria\u2019s Indigenous truth-telling inquiry has called on Jamie Oliver to engage with the commission and learn about Australia\u2019s history after he pulled his children\u2019s book from sale over backlash for stereotyping First Nations people. The British celebrity chef has issued apologies after his fantasy novel for children received condemnation from First Nations communities. The commission\u2019s deputy chair, Sue-Anne Hunter, has released a statement saying Yoorrook has invited Oliver to \u201cengage with the truth-telling commission and meet with First Peoples as part of a learning and healing process\u201d: Too often we see people who mean well cause harm or offence because they don\u2019t know the full story of our shared history in Australia. The publication of Billy and the Epic Escape shows why truth-telling is so important \u2013 to learn and understand history from First Peoples\u2019 perspective. We hope this can be the start of a positive process that also helps foster greater understanding among everyday Australians. Guardian Australia understands Yoorrook has written to Oliver\u2019s agent and publisher. Spending on concerts, sporting events jumps Consumers splashed out in October on tickets to Oasis, Luke Combs, Metallica, next year\u2019s Melbourne Formula One race as well as household goods, new figures show. As AAP reports, money flowed into recreation \u2013 especially ticketing services \u2013 and online marketplaces, hardware stores and discount department stores in October, contributing to a 0.8% increase in Commonwealth Bank\u2019s household spending index. CBA chief economist Stephen Halmarick said lower fuel prices, energy bill help and income tax cuts created some breathing room in household budgets to spend on nice-to-haves. It\u2019s important to note however that this increase in discretionary spending only partially offsets the fall seen in September as the October boost was driven by a number of one-off major events. Spending on ticketing services was up a massive 27% for the month. Spending was higher across most categories in October, aside from education and utilities, the index based on customer payments showed. First of Asian elephant herd arriving in South Australia The first of South Australia\u2019s new Asian elephant herd is arriving today. Burma is arriving at Monarto Safari Park in Adelaide, having been transferred from Auckland Zoo. She will immediately begin a standard 30-day quarantine period. Montaro Safari Park said in an earlier statement: We are thrilled to welcome [Burma] to her forever home, where she is the first of five Asian elephants who will form a herd by the end of 2025. Burma will have her own police escort after touching down at Adelaide Airport, guiding her along a planned route to the park around 5pm. Premier Peter Malinauskas told ABC News Breakfast earlier this morning everyone was \u201cpretty excited\u201d. It\u2019s an iconic venue and something unique around the country \u2026 It\u2019s been a long time coming. NSW Greens responds to new anti-protest laws from Minns government The NSW Greens\u2019 democracy spokesperson, Kobi Shetty, has responded to news the state government is introducing tougher penalties for railway protests (see more earlier in the blog here). She labelled the move as \u201canother shameful attack on the right to protest\u201d from the Minns government and said in a statement: This is a knee-jerk response and little to no information has been provided to the crossbench on the justification for these severe penalties. It is a targeted attack intended to silence the voices of people concerned about the government\u2019s woeful inaction on the climate crisis. The government is doubling down on their anti-protest laws despite the fact they have still failed to release the findings of the review into these laws which was meant to be tabled in October. The so-called review of anti-protest laws has been exposed as a sham. This government has no intention of tabling its findings or repealing laws that the Supreme Court has found partially unconstitutional. Instead, they are expanding undemocratic laws to limit our fundamental right to protest. Shetty said she has introduced a Greens bill to repeal \u201cdraconian\u201d anti-protest laws and will be encouraging the government to support the legislation. Albanese fields even more questions on election timing Anthony Albanese is also getting a number of questions today on election timing (because that\u2019s the kind of questions politicians get when there\u2019s not immediately a big political news yarn of the day). The prime minister bat away questions about an article in the papers that the Western Australian government is looking at the potential to shift its March election date if the federal government chooses to hold its poll sometime around that time. Albanese poured scorn on \u201cspeculation\u201d about federal election dates, noting constant media speculation around various dates that have come and gone. What I have been focused on is governing. Peter Dutton earlier accused Albanese of seeking a \u201ctricky\u201d plan around election timing and called on him to be upfront about the date. Albanese countered: Peter Dutton needs to be upfront to the Australian people about anything at all. Anything will do. Can we have a single costed policy? Protesters chant \u2018save the Maugean skate\u2019 at Albanese press conference The protesters at Anthony Albanese\u2019s news conference were chanting various slogans including what sounds like \u201csave the Maugean skate\u201d \u2013 an endangered species of ray found only in Tasmania, which is being affected by salmon farming in its local habitat. It\u2019s a major environmental issue in the Apple Isle, with governments balancing conservation of the skate against the jobs in salmon farming. The Albanese government this morning gave cash to the issue, including $21m to boost oxygenation in Macquarie harbour, $5m for Maugean skate breeding programs, and $2.5m to skate population and environmental monitoring (see more earlier in the blog). Amid the protesters\u2019 chants, Albanese said the announcements were \u201cimportant measures.\u201d The task of government is to make sure that industry can operate, jobs are created, but that we have protection of the environment and sustainable industry. I support the industry. I support the jobs that come from economic activity here in Tasmania. I\u2019ve made it very clear. But we need to make sure that the industry operates in a sustainable way. NAB\u2019s monthly business survey sees confidence climbing highest since early 2023 We are accustomed to hearing things are gloomy but on both the business and consumer fronts confidence is quietly edging back to almost two-year highs. The latest NAB business survey out this morning found sentiment \u201crose sharply\u201d in the past month, and the improvement was broad-based. Services were particularly strong. And while business conditions were steady, they remain at \u201caround average\u201d levels over the past five years. There was also mildly positive news on the price front, with Input cost pressures easing further. In October, labour cost growth eased to 1.4% in quarterly equivalent terms, down from 1.9% in September, while purchase cost growth eased to 0.9% from 1.3%, NAB said. Gareth Spence, NAB\u2019s head of Australian economics, said: It appears that businesses are less able to pass on cost pressures as consumer demand growth slows. ANZ\u2019s latest weekly consumer survey they do with Roy Morgan found a similar story. Confidence edged up 0.2 points last week to 86.7pts, while the four-week moving average rose 0.8pts to 86.8pts, its highest level since January 2023. Not going quite in the desired direction, though, were inflationary expectations. These rose 0.1 percentage point to a rolling four-week average of 4.7%. The Reserve Bank, among others, would like to see that trend point lower. Former Tasmanian opposition leader Rebecca White has been selected as Labor\u2019s federal candidate for Lyons for the next election. She is at a press conference in Tasmania now, appearing with the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, who is on a swing through the state. We\u2019ll bring you more from that press conference \u2013 Albanese\u2019s second in one morning in Tasmania \u2013 shortly. The PM is being heckled by some protesters who have appeared at the back of the media event. Lyons is held by Labor, but only on a razor-thin 0.9% margin. It is being targeted by the Coalition, and Albanese is on a trip through Tasmania to shore up support ahead of what\u2019s expected to be a tight election sometime early in 2025. Current Labor MP Brian Mitchell had been tipped to step aside. The ABC reported just last month that he would be happy to stand aside for White to run in his seat, praising the former state Labor leader as a \u201conce-in-a-generation talent in Tasmania\u201d. AFP union say NSW police wage deal in \u2018jarring contrast\u2019 to their offer The union representing Australian federal police employees says the New South Wales police wage deal \u201cstands in jarring contrast\u201d to the deal the Albanese government wants AFP officers to accept. NSW police officers will receive a pay rise of up to 40% over the next four years, whereas the AFP is being offered 11.2% over three years. The Australian Federal Police Association president, Alex Caruana, said the difference in the deals was stunning and it was tough to see the offer as \u201canything short of blatant disrespect.\u201d From a moral perspective the Albanese government\u2019s deal is clearly inadequate. AFP officers put their safety and health on the line dealing with the worst of humanity so the rest of us don\u2019t have to worry about it. The Albanese government has dragged AFP officers through months and months of gruelling negotiation before deciding on a lowball offer. Unless they genuinely believe that AFP officers are nowhere near as important as state police then they need to do better. New South Wales has been the laggard among the states in terms of approving new renewable energy projects for a while, with one industry study last year finding a new wind farm took an average of 3,488 days (almost a decade) to get the nod. By contrast, in Queensland the average time to assess a windfarm was just 190 days, 384 days in Victoria and 533 in South Australia, that report found. After much urging and feedback by would-be investors, the government has issued its new guidelines that it hopes will draw more investment into the state at a pace commensurate with the exit of coal-fired power plants (and the need to carbonise). We haven\u2019t waded through the multiple side reports (such as on wind, solar, community benefits sharing, etc) yet but will do when time permits. The fine print that investors will look at will include how much setbacks will be needed, say, for wind turbines to minimise their visual impacts, to what extent \u201chypothetical dwellings\u201d can be used by neighbours to limit turbine or solar panel locations nearby, and so on. The Minns government, for instance, touts the prospect of \u201cover $400m\u201d in extra funds slowing to \u201csupport community and local government initiatives\u201d from the changes. The \u201csuggested rate\u201d a year includes $850 per megawatt for a solar farm, $1,050/megawatt yearly for a windfarm and $150/Mwhour hour per annum for stand-alone big batteries in rural zones. These sums would be indexed to the consumer price index. That sounds good but here too its success will hinge a lot on locals either getting their mitts on the money or at least getting a say on what local governments do with any extra cash. Labor senator ready to run for federal lower house seat Labor senator Anne Urquhart is stepping down to run for a federal lower house seat in Tasmania, AAP reports, ahead of an expected tight election race for the party across Australia. Anthony Albanese wants to retain majority government after next year\u2019s national vote, despite opinion polls showing Labor is behind the coalition. The seat of Braddon in north-west Tasmania is held by Liberal Gavin Pearce on an 8% margin. It\u2019s seen as a key seat for Labor, given Pearce will not stand for re-election. Urquhart was first elected to represent the Apple Isle in 2010 and was re-elected in 2016 and 2022. Her current term expires in 2028, meaning Labor will need to appoint a replacement to fill the vacancy in the upper house. Albanese will soon announce Labor\u2019s candidate for the neighbouring seat of Bass, held by Liberal MP Bridget Archer on a slim 1.4% margin. Labor is also looking to sandbag the adjoining seat of Lyons, which it holds by less than 1%. All three Tasmanian seats defied the national trend and swung towards the Liberal Party in the 2022 federal election. The agriculture, fisheries and forestry minister Julie Collins holds the Tasmanian seat of Franklin by almost 14%. But she took a sizeable 7.3% hit to her primary vote in 2022, before surviving with a small 1.5% swing towards her after preferences. Victorian man sentenced to four-and-a-half-year\u2019s jail for exit trafficking A Victorian man who tricked his wife into travelling to Sudan and abandoned her there without her two young children and passport for almost 18 months has been sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison. In April the man, 52, became the first Victorian convicted of exit trafficking \u2013 where someone is coerced, threatened or tricked into leaving Australia against their will. The maximum penalty for the commonwealth offence is 12 years\u2019 imprisonment. The man appeared in the Victorian county court this morning. Judge Frank Gucciardo says the man\u2019s offending required a degree of planning: You treated her as a chattel that could be simply discarded. A Victorian county court jury found him guilty of the federal offence after a month-long trial. The man pleaded not guilty to the charge and denied having deceived the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Domestic airfares have increased by 13% after the collapse of Rex\u2019s flights between capital cities, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has found, as Qantas and Virgin\u2019s duopoly surges to 98% market dominance. The ACCC, in its latest domestic airline monitoring report, found that since Rex suspended its jet operations between metropolitan cities across 11 routes and entered administration, the average air fare on all major city routes increased by 13.3% in the quarter to September 2024. Flights are also fuller as a result of Rex\u2019s exit from the market, with the number of seats on these routes falling by 6% despite passenger numbers remaining stable. ACCC commissioner Anna Brakey said the 13% spike in air fares corresponded with \u201ca less competitive domestic airline sector\u201d. Despite jet fuel prices falling by 41% in the 12 months to September, air fares have remained similar. The average cheapest economy tickets also increased dramatically on routes formerly serviced by Rex, with Adelaide to Melbourne services up 95%. While we also typically see a seasonal peak in air travel in September due to major sporting events and school holidays, there were additional pricing pressures this year. Passengers were no longer able to access the lower fares that Rex offered, and airline seating capacity decreased following Rex\u2019s exit. This in turn has contributed to higher air fares. Brakey noted the airline sector had become drastically less competitive after the collapse of Bonza and Rex\u2019s jet operations in 2024. Earlier this year, almost half of all passengers flew on routes with either three or four airline groups, the ACCC said, but by November, there is no domestic route serviced by more than two major airline groups, with Qantas Group (including budget operator Jetstar) and Virgin Australia servicing 98% of domestic passengers. The domestic airline industry has become even further concentrated, and it may be some time before a new airline emerges to compete on popular services between metropolitan cities, with normal barriers to entry and growth exacerbated by aircraft fleet supply chain issues and pilot and engineer shortages. Qantas blasted for failing to provide specific data The opposition transport spokeswoman, Bridget McKenzie, has blasted Qantas representatives for failing to turn up to a Senate committee hearing with specific data. A Senate committee hearing into reforms proposed by Labor in February to amend the strict laws governing airlines\u2019 access Sydney airport has heard from Qantas representatives about the impact the amendments would have on its operations. We had more on this earlier in the blog, here, where Qantas said it does not expect the reforms to dent its dominant hold of slots at the airport. Markus Svensson, the chief executive of Qantas\u2019 domestic operations, was asked by the committee about cancellation figures in and out of Sydney airport but provided only Qantas\u2019 national average cancellation figure of about 2%. McKenzie said: My question again is not about how many flights you cancel into Devonport or Burney or Cairns. This bill is all about Sydney \u2026 The slots into Sydney that you hold, how many of those allocated are regularly affected by cancellations? Svensson replied: I don\u2019t have the data for Sydney specifically. I\u2019ll have to take that on notice. McKenzie then replied: Of course, because we were always going to be discussing Perth in this inquiry. Australian Unity\u2019s latest wellbeing index has found that satisfaction with life in Australia has hit a record low. The survey was conducted in partnership with Deakin University in June and measured subjective wellbeing in more than 2,000 adults across areas such as the economy, health, and community connectedness. The key findings included: Australians\u2019 overall satisfaction with their personal lives remained close to its lowest level recorded, while satisfaction with life in Australia reached its lowest level in the survey\u2019s 24-year history. Adults aged 18-34 years reported the highest feelings of mental distress and loneliness and some of the lowest levels of personal wellbeing of any group across the adult lifespan. One in two adults under 55 years old reported going without essential items because of money pressures and felt financially worse off than their parents were at their age. The results show that satisfaction with life in Australia dropped to its lowest level on record since 2002. Lead researcher Dr Kate Lycett said the findings \u201cgo against our expectations of social progress, where each generation will be better off than the next, and point to an urgent need to tackle growing national inequities\u201d. In 2024, we need to ask ourselves, and particularly those in power, what type of country do we want to be \u2013 if we want to boost our collective wellbeing, we need to deal with the big issues facing our nation and stop tinkering at the edges. Qantas isn\u2019t worried it will lose slots under reforms Qantas has told a Senate committee that it does not expect government reforms proposed to help boost competition in and out of Sydney airport will actually dent its dominant hold of slots at the airport. A Senate committee hearing is under way into reforms proposed by Labor in February to amend the strict laws which limit Sydney airport to 80 takeoff and landing movements \u2013 known as slots \u2013 per hour, as well as an overnight curfew. Despite the scarcity of slots at the airport, allocation at Sydney airport follows the global standard, which allows an airline to retain its slot so long as it doesn\u2019t cancel a service more than 20% of the time. For years, aviation experts, the competition watchdog, and smaller airports have accused Qantas and Virgin of strategically spreading their flight cancellations in and out of Sydney so as to not cancel any service more than 20% of the time, and retain the slots to block a new entrant from launching a rival service. Qantas and Virgin have consistently denied they engage in so-called \u201cslot hoarding\u201d, however experts point to the airlines\u2019 cancellation rates that near 10% some months for routes out of Sydney to Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra, while airlines such as Rex sometimes had zero monthly cancellations when they operated such routes. The proposed reforms do not tighten the 80:20 slot cancellation \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d rule, something Sydney airport had itself called for due to the overall scarcity of slots and the dominance of the existing duopoly in being able to spread out cancellations. Markus Svensson, the chief executive of Qantas\u2019 domestic operations, has told the committee that Qantas was likely to support the proposed amendments \u2013 pending final details \u2013 in part because they appeared to help airlines recover after delays due to weather. He also said the airline did not expect to lose any of its unused or underutilised slots into Sydney airport as a result of the amendments \u2013 a compliance move which its critics have long been calling for. We do not apply for slots without having intention to operate them. I categorically deny that the slots are hoarded and [that we\u2019re] trying to play any games here. A preschool worker who died saving her young students from an out-of-control truck has been remembered as a kind and generous person who lit up every room. As AAP reports, police are investigating after a 68-year-old driver, suspected of suffering a medical episode, veered his water tanker off the road and ploughed into the preschool\u2019s playground, north-west of Melbourne, yesterday. Eleanor Bryant, a 43-year-old speech pathologist who worked at the preschool, died at the scene while a three-year-old boy was taken to the Royal Children\u2019s hospital. In an emotional tribute this morning, Nine\u2019s Today presenter Alex Cullen described his childhood friend as \u201ca light that lit up every room and never had a bad word to say about anyone\u201d. There are people in this world who you can\u2019t quite believe are so kind, so generous, so wonderful and caring. Eleanor Bryant, or EJ, as she was to us, was one of those people. He said the community was hurting after Bryant\u2019s death. It does not surprise me one bit that Eleanor pushed those schoolkids out of the way yesterday to ultimately save their lives. She always, always put others first and was a great example to all of us. We will miss you, Eleanor, and thank you for everything you gave us. She was an accomplished speech pathologist who grew up in Coonamble in central-western NSW and leaves behind a husband, 11-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter. The Coles chair, James Graham, has opened the supermarket\u2019s annual general meeting by defending the company\u2019s profit levels and criticising \u201cpoliticised\u201d attacks. Graham told shareholders in Melbourne today that: In this context, it has been disappointing to see how cost-of-living issues have been politicised and targeted at supermarket operations. This is in sharp contrast to the level of engagement and support of supermarkets by governments and regulators during the Covid lockdown years. Representatives of Coles and rival Woolworths have appeared at several parliamentary inquiries, and the major chains are the target of a government-ordered examination of their pricing and business practices, conducted by the competition regulator. Separately, Coles and Woolworths are being sued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over allegations they misled shoppers by offering \u201cillusory\u201d discounts on hundreds of common supermarket products. Graham said today that its profit margin \u201cremained essentially constant\u201d over the past five years. Guardian Australia analysis has consistently found that profit metrics at the major supermarkets are now significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, and have jumped ahead of most of their international peers. Dutton: Labor needs to work \u2018with and not against our most important ally\u2019 Sticking with US politics, Peter Dutton was asked if he believes Australia will be excluded from Donald Trump\u2019s table? He responded: When we government we were able to negotiate with the Trump administration and exemption from tariffs that were being applied at that time. The onus will be on the prime minister to negotiate a similar outcome with the Trump administration and that will be a question for him as to whether or not they are able to craft that. But I think it is obvious America has charted a different course now and the government here needs to course correct and make sure they are working with and not against our most important ally. The prime minister says that we live in the most precarious period since the Second World War, but we need to have a very strong and trusted relationship with our Five Eyes partners including the United States. A reporter asked Peter Dutton what \u201cinspiration\u201d he draws from Donald Trump\u2019s win. He responded that a clear outcome of the US election is that \u201cfamilies in the US are hurting under higher inflation and unsurprisingly, that is exactly what is happening in our country.\u201d Secondly, incumbent governments that do not read the room and do not understand the priorities that people have will be punished for it. And the Albanese government has got themselves into all sorts of a problem and a muddle at the moment because they have made bad decisions early in this term. He argued they did \u201cnothing\u201d to prepare for inflationary concern off the back of Covid, and criticised government spending: We saw the government announce a $16bn program to cut back some of the debt that people have got [from their] university degrees but the fact is that every other Australian is going to pay for that. $16bn does not just materialise. It is paid for by someone, and it is going to be tradies and workers at the moment who face higher taxes under this government. Peter Dutton addresses media in Brisbane The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is speaking to reporters in Brisbane. He criticised prime minister Anthony Albanese for discussing a second-term agenda when \u201cI just don\u2019t know what the first term agenda has been about and what have they achieved?\u201d. We have six months of this term left, if the prime minister is planning to go earlier in March, that is at odds with what he said earlier, when he said he would go full term. And now it seems he\u2019s trying to do some tricky deal with the WA premier to move their fixed term and I just do not think the Prime Minister has been open and honest or transparent with the Australian public. Albanese was asked about this at an earlier press conference, and you can read his answer here. Dutton argued that if Albanese wants to call an early election, \u201che is in all sorts of trouble.\u201d I think Jim Chalmers and Tony Burke and others would challenge him in a heartbeat \u2026 Maybe he wants an early election before there is leadership chatter within the Labor party. Victorian Greens leader on latest polling: \u2018The Greens aren\u2019t going anywhere\u2019 The Victorian Greens leader, Ellen Sandell, has been asked about new polling in Nine newspapers showing the party\u2019s primary vote has fallen to a nine-month low, amid a poor showing at the Queensland state election and in some Victorian local government elections. Sandell, however, says it\u2019s a minor drop and instead has pointed to other figures in the poll, including support for policies such as making visits to doctors, psychologists and dentists free was backed by 73% of voters. What this poll shows, if we actually look at the poll not just the headlines, is actually broad support for the Greens policies, because we\u2019re out there talking about the things that matter to people, about getting people into housing, about dealing with cost of living, about dealing with climate change. She said the state may have lost councillors in some areas but gained in others and its share of the vote actually increased. If you look at the inner city, which everyone seems to be quite interested in, we\u2019ve got three in Darebin, three in Maribyrnong, four in Merri-bek, two in Yarra, two in Boroondara. We\u2019ve elected where we haven\u2019t had councilors before, like places like Boroondara, and we\u2019ve seen big swings towards us, even in places where we might have lost seats. In places like Stockington, Glen Eira, we\u2019ve lost councillors, but we\u2019ve actually had huge swings towards us ... The Greens aren\u2019t going anywhere. Abortion likely to keep \u2018bubbling up\u2019 and Victoria isn\u2019t immune, Greens says The Victorian Greens health spokesperson Dr Sarah Mansfield has been speaking outside parliament about her bill to enshrine abortion protections in the constitution. She said it\u2019s her hope to debate it early next year: We have seen all around the country, all it can take is a change in government for this issue to be brought up again, to be made a political football. We\u2019ve seen it in Queensland recently during their election, and it\u2019s likely that\u2019s going to continue to be an issue in that state for some time. We\u2019ve recently seen in South Australia a bill to restrict or a motion to restrict access to abortion, only narrowly defeated. We\u2019ve seen federal Nationals trying to raise the issue of abortion and restrict access to abortion at the federal level. So this is an issue that is continually bubbling up. Victoria isn\u2019t immune, and it\u2019s really important that the gains that we have made are protected and enshrined in the Constitution. Two e-scooter fires a week this year in NSW, superintendent says Continuing from our last post, Fire and Rescue NSW superintendent Adam Dewberry told Sunrise the burn patterns indicate a faulty e-scooter battery sparked the fire: These fires out of e-scooters this year, [we\u2019ve had] two a week at this stage. A fortunate escape for the people here because these fires take hold rapidly. Be careful where you\u2019re buying them from, don\u2019t charge them when you\u2019re asleep and always make sure you have that working smoke alarm. A faulty lithium-ion battery is suspected to be the cause of an intense garage and house fire in Sydney\u2019s south this morning. Fire and Rescue NSW crews were called to a home at Woronora just before 3am, where the garage of the home was fully engulfed by fire and threatening the main residence. Three fire trucks and 12 firefighters battled the blaze for 90 minutes, preventing the flames spreading to the main residence and neighbouring homes. Three people were transported to hospital for smoke inhalation, with one suffering serious burns to their lower limbs, FRNSW said in a statement. After conducting initial inspections, FRNSW investigators believe the battery of a charging e-scooter failed and went into \u201cthermal runaway,\u201d sparking the blaze. Thermal runaway is a phenomenon where the lithium-ion cell enters an uncontrollable, self-heating state. FRNSW has responded to 81 micromobility incidents this year, which is an average rate of two per week. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has been asked about a bill the Greens will introduce to parliament\u2019s upper house to enshrine abortion into the constitution. She said she hasn\u2019t seen its contents yet, but didn\u2019t shut the door on supporting it. I was very proud to be a member of the Labor government and a member of this parliament in 2008 that decriminalised abortion in this state, that gave women the right to have choice and agency over their body, and also protected the medical professionals who wanted to support women to have that choice. I am personally very committed to looking at what more needs to be done to strengthen the safe access for women to reach stronger reproductive choices, because we are seeing here in Australia and indeed globally that there are some who want to take away that right for women to have choice over their bodies. That\u2019s not right. Allan also said she wanted those in opposition to abortion to \u201ccome out of the shadows\u201d. I haven\u2019t seen the content of what [the Greens] are proposing, so I\u2019m speaking very much in a personal capacity, because I feel deeply committed to this issue \u2026 I remain firmly committed to looking at what more we can do, in a climate where there are some who want to take those rights away and they should be called out, they should come out of the shadows and be identified as to who wants to take these hard worked for rights for women\u2019s reproductive choices, away from women around the state. Albanese on calls for him to visit Trump during upcoming travel The shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, has said the PM should try to meet Donald Trump while he is overseas. Will he consider flying past Florida on his way home? Anthony Albanese responded that \u201cif you have a look at the map, it\u2019s actually not on the way,\u201d but continued: Simon Birmingham does two things - one, he says I do too [many] trips, and secondly he says I should do more. Simon Birmingham is someone who never has much constructive to say at all. I had a really constructive discussion with president-elect Trump last week, it was a very good beginning to our relationship. \u2018We do need reform\u2019: PM on SA\u2019s move to ban political donations from state elections Anthony Albanese was asked about moves from the South Australian government to ban political donations and boost public funding for candidates, as we flagged earlier. Would the government take the same approach in its electoral reform bill? The PM responded: We think there needs to be electoral reform. Premier [Peter] Malinauskas has taken very strong action. What we\u2019ll be doing is hopefully getting support for our legislation that we\u2019re hoping to advance before the election. It won\u2019t take effect, of course, it\u2019s too late to take effect for the next election, but we are keen on electoral reform because a system whereby an individual can spend over $100m \u2013 as we\u2019ve seen occur in the last two elections \u2013 is one that I think undermines democracy by giving one person a lot of say, or a lot of input, as well. We do need reform. There has been reform of electoral systems in state and territory governments, in New South Wales, in South Australia now proposed by Premier Malinauskas, and Don Farrell, our minister, will have more to say about that in coming weeks. Albanese criticises Dutton on comments suggesting Labor won\u2019t form majority Responding to comments from Peter Dutton that the Albanese government wouldn\u2019t be able to form a majority at the next election, the prime minister responded: We are now in the thralls, apparently, of an election campaign \u2026 [but] Peter Dutton does not have a single costed policy out there. Not one. He has one policy which is for nuclear energy sometime in the 2040s \u2013 no plan for what happens with energy security in the meantime \u2013 just a plan for negativity. Albanese hits back at questions on date of upcoming federal election The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking to reporters in Tasmania. He was questioned on the date of the upcoming federal election, and responded: I\u2019m focused on governing, that\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on. I will leave the speculation to others. I have said repeatedly and I repeat again today \u2013 I support four-year terms and I wish it was four-year fixed terms so this obsession with dates that begins halfway through a term didn\u2019t continue. He was also asked about reports that WA premier Roger Cook was looking to change the state election date to avoid any dislike that voters may have towards federal Labor. He responded: Media reports every week about election dates, nothing new in that. It was going to be August 30, then September, then November, then December 7. The election, I said the whole way through, will be in 2025, it will be called April or before, but I\u2019m focused on governing. Asked if the South Australian government would also look at lobbying, Malinauskas suggested this was worth looking at: I do think that reforms around lobbyists, what happens to MPs post their political life, I think these are question marks that are worthy of pursuit. He said the state government had three objectives this term \u2013 to ban political donations, teach civics in school, and implement social media age limits. These are the reforms we\u2019re focused on in our first term and those other types of reforms we would love to have an opportunity to look at further into the future. I think this is necessary and we should probably talk about it as a country more than we do. Malinauskas on plan to ban political donations from state elections Earlier, South Australian premier Peter Malinauskas spoke with ABC News Breakfast about plans to ban political donations from state elections to everyone but newcomers. The program reported that the premier had found support from the Liberal party and the crossbench on this. Malinauskas said that people\u2019s \u201cconfidence in democracy globally throughout the west is on the decline\u201d and that Australia is not immune from this: A contributing factor \u2013 not the only factor, but a contributing factor \u2013 is the sense that the democratic process is somehow divorced or out of reach of every Australian, and I think one of the things that informs that view is the idea that if you pay big money and you\u2019re a donor to a political party you somehow get access that others don\u2019t. We should remove that from the equation entirely, hence had the ambitious reform to take all donations out of politics \u2013 whether from unions, business or wealthy individuals \u2013 take it all out of the process so that we\u2019ve got a relatively level playing field. Malinauskas announced plans for the changes in June: Millions of dollars will be spent boosting water quality and environmental conditions in a Tasmanian waterway dominated by salmon farming to save the endangered Maugean skate, AAP reports. Anthony Albanese has announced a $28m boost for new measures in Macquarie Harbour, including scaling up oxygenation to offset the effects of human activities on the endangered species. About $5m of the funding will invested into skate breeding programs which hatch eggs and raise juveniles for release while environmental conservation efforts work to improve its habitat. Another $2.5m will go towards monitoring the skate population and compliance in the community. There are an estimated 40-120 adult Maugean skates remaining in the wild, according to environmental campaigners. The government\u2019s own conservation advice called for urgent action to eliminate or significantly reduce fish farming impacts on the harbour\u2019s oxygen levels to help safeguard the skate. A decision to increase the skate\u2019s status to critically endangered was pushed back until after the federal election. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, is announcing a tobacco licensing scheme for the state, which she says is the \u201ctoughest in the nation\u201d. Victoria is the only state without any kind of registration or licensing scheme in place, which has hampered police in their efforts to crackdown on the illegal tobacco trade. Police established taskforce lunar in October last year to stamp out firebombing and arson on tobacco stores, of which there have been more than 100 attacks. Under the bill, to be introduced to parliament today, people will only be able to sell tobacco with a licence. A licence will only available for \u201cfit and proper persons\u201d who pass a strict test, and people can be refused a licence based on criminal history and known associates. A new tobacco regulator will also be set up, with dedicated inspectors to enforce the scheme, which was a key request of Victoria police. The regulator will be given the power to search shops, suspend licences and seize illegal items, and can pass on intelligence to police. Victoria police\u2019s search powers will also be beefed up to make it easier and quicker to raid, search and seize illicit products from a retailer suspected of having links to organised crime. Allan said the scheme will also be coupled with tougher penalties. People found to be selling illicit tobacco will face fines of more than $355,000 or up to 15 years in jail, while businesses will face fines of more than $1.7m. She said: This new strict new licensing regime includes more boots on the ground, more resources on the ground, more powers, particularly power for Victoria Police to crack down on the illicit tobacco trade. And there will be massive consequences, massive penalties for people who breach this regime. And these penalties are the toughest penalties in the nation. Call for children to be allowed super contributions A new report from the Super Members Council has found that workers aged under 18 across the country could each have $10,000 more at retirement if an \u201coutdated exclusion\u201d denying them super contributions is abolished. Currently, under-18s are denied compulsory super contributions unless they work more than 30 hours a week. The report found about nine in 10 teenagers do not reach the 30-hour work threshold each week \u2013 denying about 505,000 teenage workers about $368m in total super contributions a year. Super Members Council CEO Misha Schubert said: Australians strongly support universal super \u2013 and know it\u2019s a workplace right. Super should be for everyone, paid from the first hour of your first job, and fixing this outdated exclusion is overdue. As every smart investor knows, thanks to the magic of compound returns, a dollar invested early in life in super has the most power to grow our retirement savings exponentially over our lives. SMC research shows 85% of Australians think anyone who does paid work should get super contributions. More than 50,000 public nurses and midwives in New South Wales are perplexed by a seismic pay overhaul for police and will resist calls to back down from a 24-hour strike, AAP reports. The female-dominated workforce demands a one-off pay increase of 15% to help address a gender pay gap in hospitals. A 24-hour strike and large rally are planned for Wednesday. While the Labor government maintains the nurses\u2019 claim would be unaffordable, it raised eyebrows yesterday when tabling a major pay deal for police. The offer would lift lower-ranked officers\u2019 wages by an average of 26% over four years, making them the best paid in the nation. Police deserved the boost but nurses had been \u201cfurious\u201d to hear a \u201creasonable\u201d offer had not also come their way, Nurses and Midwives Association NSW general secretary Shaye Candish said. We\u2019ve now seen the teachers, the police, paramedics, cleaners and administrative staff, special constables [get offers], the list grows. The biggest public sector, female-dominated workforce is being left behind. The NSW health minister Ryan Park said that \u201cwhile I urge the Association not to proceed with this strike, NSW Health has begun contingency planning to mitigate risks to patients and the community.\u201d The government says its offer of 10.5% over three years is \u201cfair\u201d and comes after major boosts to workforce numbers and staff-to-patient ratios. Rishworth responds to data showing three in five Australian renters expect to never own home As Cait Kelly reports, new research from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute has found three in five Australian renters expect to never own their own home \u2013 a significant shift that requires rethinking of tax and housing systems, it said. The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, was on ABC News Breakfast earlier where she was asked about this, and responded: Look, we want to see people have home ownership as an aspiration if that\u2019s what they want. And that\u2019s why our focus when it comes to housing is about putting more supply, building more homes \u2026 It\u2019s something we are very much focused on. And of course part of that includes, for example, our shared home equity scheme \u2013 which has been blocked in the Senate by the Liberals and the Greens. So, look, we want to make home ownership an aspiration people believe they can achieve, and we\u2019ll work towards that. NSW government\u2019s anti-protest laws have \u2018chilling effect\u2019 on social progress, group says The NSW Council for Civil Liberties has labelled stronger sanctions for obstructing railways as \u201cdraconian\u201d and argued growing protest laws \u201chave created a chilling effect on civil movements and social progress.\u201d NSWCCL president Timothy Roberts said in a statement that the Council was formed in 1963 in response to a crackdown on peaceful protest by NSW police \u2013 and that these new laws from the Minns government \u201crepresent a return to dark and shameful days where the right to protest was curtailed, criminalised and where protestors were vilified in the press and arrested en masse\u201d. The introduction of another tranche of draconian anti-protest laws represents another betrayal of the public\u2019s trust by those who should stand to strengthen and defend civil liberties \u2026 The Council will continue to fight for the right to protest and will stand beside peaceful protestors. It is shameful that NSW continues to refuse to introduce a state based human rights charter that would protect the right to protest. Roberts argued that you \u201ccannot arrest your way towards social cohesion\u201d and you \u201ccannot protect democracy by fundamentally restricting the cornerstone civil liberties that create it.\u201d This is the action of an unthinking premier who seeks only to pander to the right wing media, emboldened by those in his party who have demonstrated a lack of courage in not standing up, speaking out and demanding that fundamental civil liberties be protected \u2013 not just today, but tomorrow and for generations to come \u2026 [The NSWCCL] calls on all sectors of civil society as well as members of the public to oppose the laws. Our efforts and campaigns for the right to protest must continue to be coordinated, diverse and fearless. The New South Wales government has announced stronger sanctions for obstructing railways as part of illegal protests. In a statement, premier Chris Minns and attorney general Michael Daley said new legislation would be introduced this week to implement a maximum fine of $22,000 for \u201cobstructing a railway\u201d. The current offence provision under the Crimes Act does not specifying a fine. A fine would now be in place for those found guilty of obstructing a railway \u2013 or damaging or disrupting major facilities \u2013 or up to two years\u2019 imprisonment, or both. The statement said this would align with changes to laws in 2022 making it an offence to block or obstruct major roads, bridges and tunnels and major facilities like ports and railway stations. The statement continues: Many of the recent protesters causing mayhem in the Hunter Valley were charged with obstructing a railway. This provision also covers people found to have assisted those who directly commit the offence. By strengthening the penalty, this aims to deter extremely dangerous conduct that puts train driver, rail worker and passenger safety at risk. Blocking railway tracks disrupts commuters and commerce and diverts the precious resources of NSW Police. The change would apply to every railway line in the state as well as light rails, the statement said. The Liberal senator Jon Duniam said the Coalition remains committed to its net zero commitment by 2050. We\u2019ve said we remain committed there, and we are going to continue to do things that are in our interests, not necessarily follow suit with the United States. There are some things they do which makes sense, there are others which are suited to them and not to Australia. Several Nationals backbenchers have suggested Coalition support for net zero by 2050 should be reconsidered, and Senator Matt Canavan has said Australia should withdraw from the Paris agreement. But Duniam said the Coalition\u2019s key policies were not being reconsidered: We are currently committed to, and as far as I\u2019m aware, remain committed to net zero by 2050 \u2013 that\u2019s not the policy in question. What we need to do is, while we seek to do what we can to achieve those goals, which \u2013 including this government, doesn\u2019t seem to be occurring too positively \u2013 is ensure that Australians don\u2019t pay inordinate amounts of the things they need to do every day \u2013 electricity, getting about in their vehicles, so making sure that the goods so bad at the supermarket are not at increased cost. So there are a range of things we need to do there, but walking away from net zero as a standalone policy is not something that we are contemplating. Coalition environment spokesperson touts cheap energy when asked about Trump\u2019s climate policies The Coalition\u2019s environment spokesperson, Jon Duniam, was also up on ABC RN this morning to discuss net zero policy. Host Steve Cannane asked him: Donald Trump has signalled he\u2019s looking to repeal Biden\u2019s signature climate law, pull out of the Paris Agreement, get rid of many of the Biden administration\u2019s regulations intended to cut carbon emissions, and essentially, drill baby drill. Will the Trump presidency be good for the world\u2019s environment? Duniam responded by talking about the benefits of cheap energy: Having cheap energy so that countries can come out of developing status into developed is as important as protecting the environment. I don\u2019t think necessarily the two are mutually exclusive. I think that there are a great many innovators in the US who continue to innovate, despite the change of government, change of policy direction, and have improved technologies that improve outcomes for the environment. I don\u2019t think necessarily Donald Trump being elected to the White House means we are going to see a downward trajectory in environmental outcomes. Carr urges Albanese government to recognise Palestinian statehood by next federal election Moving to the Middle East and what a second Trump presidency means for this, Bob Carr said he doesn\u2019t see Trump retreating from the alliance between Israel and the US. I think the wily fox Netanyahu is going to win this one. [He] will be able to continue this ruinous war and inhumane war in Gaza without the threats coming from an American president that he will be penalised with a loss of military supplies. Carr has previously said he wants the Albanese government to recognise Palestinian statehood before the next federal election. Asked about this, he told ABC RN it\u2019s \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d: It sends a message to the Palestinians that there can be hope if they adhere to a peaceful path to negotiated statehood and avoid the temptation, in desperation and despair, to support the murderers of Hamas \u2026 It also sends a message to Israel that what you are doing in Gaza \u2013 in destroying 80% of the housing of the people, in allowing terrible atrocities \u2026 in denying medicines to the hospitals and clean drinking water to a population being forced to evacuate towns over and over again to avoid bombing \u2013 what you\u2019re doing there is intolerable [and you will] lose the support of a country like Australia as a result of pursuing such policies. Carr argued the Albanese government could end up in a minority government if it doesn\u2019t recognise Palestinian statehood: Then, it\u2019ll be taunted with only moving because it came under cross bench pressure, or if worse \u2013 Labor went into opposition \u2013 it can have no reputable dialogue with Arab background Australians and others who, for different reasons, support recognition of Palestine, given that we didn\u2019t move when we had the power to move on this. Carr says \u2018militarisation\u2019 of northern Australia has happened with \u2018scandalous lack of consultation\u2019 Bob Carr was also asked about the statement from the former PM Paul Keating, suggesting the Albanese government is out of touch with the Australian public on foreign policy matters. Carr said in his view, the \u201cmilitarisation\u201d of northern Australia has \u201ctaken place with a scandalous lack of consultation with the Australian people\u201d. It\u2019s quite striking given the weight of anti Chinese commentary that\u2019s dominated the Australian media in the last eight years, but you\u2019ve got 57% of the population \u2013 according to the Resolve Political Monitor poll \u2013 \u2026 who agreeing with the proposition that Australia should avoid taking sides in a US-China conflict. Only 16% are taking a contrary view \u2026 Australian diplomacy should be quietly working, not only with America and with China, but with partners in Asia, Japan and India, towards the notion of a detente between America and China. If you\u2019re able to build areas of cooperation and reduce areas of adversarial conflict between the Soviet Union under Leonard Brezhnev and the United States under Richard Nixon and later under Ronald Reagan, it\u2019s not this bigger task to aspire to increasing areas of cooperation and diminishing areas of conflict between China and the US, and that ought to be a goal of Australian diplomacy. The former NSW premier and Labor foreign minister Bob Carr is speaking with ABC RN about Aukus \u2013 and said he is not confident the deal is safe under a Trump presidency. In fact, skepticism about it is is more widespread than is being admitted publicly in Canberra security circles and elsewhere. Carr said that America is \u201cengaged in a competition over boat numbers with China\u201d and that its shipyards are \u201cterribly constrained and are performing badly.\u201d We\u2019ve reach a point \u2013 and it could be under Trump, it could be under the president who follows Trump \u2013 where a secretary of defence will say to the president, we simply cannot achieve [our] targets \u2026 and we can\u2019t peel off from our order of battle attack class submarines that are needed in the competition with China to give to Australia. It\u2019s almost inevitable that that is going to happen, and we will be offered a new view of Aukus, which means American attack class subs being stationed on a virtually permanent basis in Australia ports \u2026 One of the prizes you pay for being such a compliant, non-argumentative ally is that you get taken for granted, and will be taken for granted on this when we are presented [with it] in a few years time \u2026 with a reinterpretation or re-weaving of the Aukus narrative. Meteorologists are forecasting that thunderstorms will develop over large swathes of the country every day this week, and likely into next. Ben Domensino from Weatherzone has outlined the forecast as follows: Early in the week, showers and thunderstorms will target central, eastern, southern and southeastern Australia on Monday and Tuesday. Severe thunderstorms are likely in parts of NSW and [Queensland] on both days and are also possible in other states. Storms will become more focussed on a broad arc stretching across Australia\u2019s eastern and northern states and down into the WA interior through the middle of the week. Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra will all be at risk of severe thunderstorm activity on Wednesday. Showers and thunderstorms will continue then over Australia\u2019s east and north on Thursday and Friday, while also extending towards the south of WA due to the passage of a cold front. This frontal system, combined with deepening low pressure troughs over Australia, will lead to further widespread thunderstorm activity over Australia from this weekend into early next week. We\u2019ll bring you more weather updates throughout the day as we learn more. More than 100 firefighters worked to contain a large fire in a south-west Sydney auto repair shop overnight. It took crews around two hours to contain the \u201cintense fire\u201d which started around 6pm, Fire and Rescue NSW said, in an industrial area at Stubbs Street in Auburn. The roof of the building had started to collapse but firefighters protected neighbouring properties, including an adjoining timber warehouse and petrol station. Last night it was unsafe for firefighters to enter the collapsed building to fully extinguish it. A number of people were evacuated from surrounding businesses and residents were urged to stay inside, with a large amount of smoke. Two people in the auto repair shop were taken to hospital with smoke inhalation and burns. Operations were expected to continue throughout the night. Parramatta Road was closed in both directions between Rawson Street and St Hilliers Road, but was reopened early this morning. Embattled regional airline Rex has been thrown an operations lifeline, AAP reports, after it went into voluntary administration in July and its management was handed to administrators EY Australia. Transport minister Catherine King and workplace minister Murray Watt have today announced the government would provide up to $80m and grant early access to entitlements for Rex\u2019s former employees. Rex\u2019s administrators plan to apply to the federal court to extend the voluntary administration to 30 June 2025. If the application is granted the government will continue to guarantee ticket sales made throughout the administration period to that date. The ministers said the guarantee has been effective so far, \u201cand has yet to be used with flight bookings holding up well.\u201d More than 600 workers were made redundant as it was revealed Rex was struggling under the weight of $500m of debt. In August, the federal government stepped in to guarantee bookings on regional flights, but resisted calls for a bailout. The administration process for Rex was progressing, the government said as it noted the recent sale of its Pel Air Aviation business to Helicorp Pty Ltd, which is part of Toll Aviation. The sale proceeds will be used to repay secured creditors. The Victorian Greens will use the second last week of parliament for the year to push to enshrine abortion services into the state\u2019s constitution. While both major parties have no plans to change abortion laws in the state, the Greens say the issue is becoming increasingly politicised and access much be safe guarded. The party\u2019s health spokesperson, Dr Sarah Mansfield, says access was already a postcode lottery in Victoria and the state \u201ccan\u2019t afford to be sent backwards\u201d. Around the world, and here in Australia, we are seeing many in power increasingly emboldened to attack reproductive rights for political purposes. Reproductive rights have been hard-won, but it\u2019s clear the fight isn\u2019t over. Governments shouldn\u2019t be able to restrict access to fundamental health care based on political agendas. The change requires a supermajority of 60% of votes in the parliament to pass. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has vowed to protect abortion rights in the state despite \u201cfrightening\u201d debate in South Australia and Queensland.

Australian author shortlisted for Booker prize Charlotte Wood, who has been shortlisted for the Booker prize, \u201cis a writer of the most intense attention\u201d, according to the British screenwriter Frank Cottrell-Boyce\u2019s review of her shortlisted book, Stone Yard Devotional. The book\u2019s protagonist is a woman retreating from the world to a convent in New South Wales and is the story, Cottrell-Boyce writes, \u201cof a small group of people in a tiny town, but its resonance is global. This is a powerful, generous book\u201d. She is an 11-2 outsider to win the \u00a350,000 ($100,000) prize, with the American Percival Everett and Briton Samantha Harvey the bookies\u2019 favourites. You can read our full story here: And then there is Cottrell-Boyce\u2019s review: Jim Chalmers also pointed to the importance of economic ties when building stronger diplomatic relations with Pacific partners. The treasurer said recent work in his portfolio had led to restoring Australia as the Pacific nations\u2019 partner of choice. Chalmers confirmed he was in the final stages of negotiations with ANZ to ensure it continued its presence in the Pacific The major Australian bank\u2019s nine existing operations, which include services in Vanuatu and Fiji, will continue operating, he said. The deal we\u2019re working on is another big part of our efforts to keep communities and economies connected, and finance flowing in our neighbourhood. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has warned that decoupling from major trading partners, such as China, presents a great risk to Australia\u2019s economy, but \u201cderisking\u201d key supply chains could leave the country in a better position than most of the world. In a speech delivered at an Australian Institute of International Affairs forum in Canberra last night, Chalmers said derisking trade relations was sometimes necessary in the face of unreliable supply chains and other forms of economic or geopolitical tension. Chalmers said: Most countries are doing this in one way or another and we are no exception ... Because of our combination of industrial, geographical, geological, meteorological, and geopolitical advantages, we stand to be among the biggest beneficiaries of de-risking. Chalmers conceded Australia was \u201cmore exposed than others\u201d in the \u201cglobal fragmentation\u201d of trade, noting recent IMF\u2019s findings that trade ties have deepened between geopolitically aligned countries, while declining between those who are not. But he said Australia\u2019s energy, technology and critical minerals would be key in building regional and global supply chains. Developing new industries in green metals and green hydrogen would also contribute to global demand. Nobody wins from a trade war, but we have more at stake than most. In the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s win in the US election, the world\u2019s economies are watching closely. During his campaign, the US president-elect said he would place baseline tariffs of 10% on all imported goods, with up to 60% and 100% for China and Mexico respectively. The ripples of such a policy shift on tariffs could lead to lower growth and higher inflation in a number of countries who trade with the US. The treasurer warned Australia would not be immune from the flow-on effects of escalating trade tensions but insisted the Albanese government was \u201cwell-placed and well-prepared\u201d. Qantas officials will be grilled on allegations the carrier has been misusing slots at Australia\u2019s busiest airport, AAP reports. A Senate inquiry is examining proposed laws on flights at Sydney airport, which result in penalties for airlines which deliberately cancel services to maintain valuable slots at terminals. Markus Svensson, chief executive of Qantas\u2019s domestic operations, will appear before the inquiry on Tuesday, along with officials from regional airline FlyPelican. Slots at Sydney airport are limited to 80 take-offs and landings per hour. But the Australian Airports Association, which is also appearing at the inquiry today, said large cancellation numbers represented a concern. The association said in its submission to the inquiry: These higher cancellation rates suggest that \u2026 unnecessary flights are scheduled and cancelled for strategic slot-retention purposes. [This] has become a barrier to competition, allowing a duopoly that stifles the entry of new carriers and ultimately limits consumer choice. Under the proposed laws, the federal transport department would have powers to force airlines to provide information on alleged misuse. Qantas Group and Virgin have consistently denied they misuse slots. In its submission, Qantas said there was a common interest to ensure capacity at Sydney airport was used effectively: We look forward to working with the government to understand how the bill, regulations, slot management scheme and any associated guidance material will work in practice. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories before I hand the news baton to Emily Wind. Amid the swirl of concern about Donald Trump pressing reset on global economic norms, Jim Chalmers has warned that de-coupling from major trading partners presents a great risk to Australia\u2019s economy. \u201cNobody wins from a trade war, but we have more at stake than most,\u201d the treasurer said in a speech last night. Full details coming up. Three in five Australian renters expect to never own their own home, research from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute has found, describing it as a significant shift that requires rethinking of tax and housing systems. Meanwhile the principal of a branch of one of Australia\u2019s largest real estate companies has admitted using Chat GPT to generate property listings after a rental home was advertised as being close to two \u201cexcellent\u201d schools that didn\u2019t exist. Charlotte Wood, the Australian author of Stone Yard Devotional, has been shortlisted for the Booker prize but is an outside bet against favourites Percival Everett and Samantha Harvey. Full details coming up. And Qantas is up before a Senate inquiry today, ahead of proposed laws that look to make sure precious flight slots at Australia\u2019s busiest airport are not being misused to suppress competition.

After a county court trial in Melbourne, the 52-year-old man in April became the first Victorian convicted of exit trafficking \u2013 where someone is coerced, threatened or tricked into leaving Australia against their will. It is a growing form of human trafficking in Australia. What is exit trafficking? It refers to a person being coerced, deceived or threatened into leaving Australia against their will. The practice is illegal and is treated as a form of people trafficking under commonwealth law. How common is it? The Australian federal police said a they received 35 reports of exit trafficking in the last financial year. This is up from 30 in the 2022-23 financial year. But research has estimated only 20% of human trafficking and slavery cases in Australia are detected. Australia has seen an overall annual increase in the number of exit trafficking reports. In the 2018-19 financial year there were just 13 reported cases. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Anti-Slavery Australia, a human rights centre at the University of Technology Sydney that runs a legal practice, identified the first case of exit trafficking that resulted in prosecution in 2017, after a referral from a community agency. It resulted in the AFP laying charges that led to the first conviction of exit trafficking in Australia in 2021. Who is at risk? The AFP warns that tactics used by human traffickers are evolving and victims are often closely monitored and controlled by the offender. An AFP spokesperson said examples of a victim being dependent on the offender include if they are unable to speak the language of the country they reside in, not eligible to work, have no access to money and no understanding of laws or their human rights. Head of the Australian Red Cross\u2019s federally funded Support for Trafficked People program, Lina Garcia Daza, said in June almost 90% of clients referred to the program after experiencing exit trafficking are women. The director of Anti-Slavery Australia, Prof Jennifer Burn, has previously said the most common form of exit trafficking the organisation has seen is young female Australian citizens and residents trafficked overseas for forced marriages. She said there was also a rise in women, often on temporary visas, being trafficked overseas by their intimate partners. The AFP has asked the public to \u201cfamiliarise themselves with the potential indicators for human trafficking on the AFP website and to make a report if they suspect a vulnerable person may be at risk. You could save a life.\u201d Information and confidential advice are also available from the Australian Red Cross, by calling (03) 9345 1800 or visiting the Red Cross website. Further What are the penalties? The maximum penalty for the offence is 12 years\u2019 imprisonment. An AFP spokesperson said prosecuting exit trafficking presents a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d for law enforcement due to victims\u2019 lack of awareness of their rights and fear of retribution, especially when the perpetrators are from their own communities or families. The under-reporting of the crime and language barriers are other hurdles. There are also legal challenges including collection of evidence from other countries and reliance on victim testimony which can be difficult to obtain. \u2022 If you or someone you know is a victim of human trafficking, contact the Australian federal police on 131 237.

There is a cheesy lasagne, a savoury Mexican casserole, and a spicy chilli con carne<strong>.</strong> Biting in to each one in turn, I savour the familiar taste of ground beef. Or is it?</p> <p>The dishes come from Pronofa Asa, a Scandinavian company whose purpose is to make new and sustainable protein sources. In 2022, it acquired the Swedish research company Marine Taste and expanded on its work turning ciona \u2013 or \u201csea squirts\u201d to you and me \u2013 into mincemeat. The dishes in Fredrikstad were prototypes, but Pronofa plans to have its mincemeat on supermarket shelves in Norway and Sweden before the end of the year, it says, and will aim to expand throughout Europe in the coming years.</p> <p>Ciona is naturally rich in proteins, and can be used as an alternative feed for fish or animals as well as people.</p> <p>\u201cThe sea squirt is the only organism that produces 100% pure cellulose,\u201d says Hans Petter Olsen, the CEO of Pronofa. \u201cSo there are some fibres in the meat and we had to work on how to process them so the mouthfeel would be similar to meat.\u201d</p>    <p>Pronofa, and a number of companies like it, are developing alternative protein sources for kitchen tables around the world, which have a minimal carbon footprint but that taste like family favourites. The Food Standards Agency said in October that cell-cultivated meat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/08/cell-cultivated-lab-grown-meat-sold-uk-regulator\">could be on sale in the UK</a> within a few years. Cultivated chicken was approved for sale to consumers in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/02/no-kill-lab-grown-meat-to-go-on-sale-for-first-time\">Singapore in 2020</a> and in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/21/us-lab-grown-meat-sold-public\">US in 2023</a> and cultivated steak was approved in <a href=\"https://aleph-farms.com/journals/aleph-farms-granted-worlds-first-regulatory-approval-for-cultivated-beef/\">Israel in 2024</a>. Scores of companies around the world are developing similar products, including using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/23/lab-grown-meat-animals-climate\">pork</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/28/from-petri-dish-to-plate-meet-the-company-hoping-to-bring-lab-grown-fish-to-the-table\">fish</a>.</p> <p>Ciona are umami flavoured, but naturally have a slight seafood taste and a texture reminiscent of calamari. There are no additives \u2013 this transformation to \u201cfake meat\u201d is accomplished simply by the way that the company processes the sea squirt, says Olsen.</p> <p>Changing the sea squirt into something that looks enticing is important as ciona does not look appetising. Burping and bubbling in the freezing waters of the North Sea, sea squirts are translucent tubes that resemble gelatinous sacs. They will grow on almost any solid surface in the sea, from rocks and driftwood to deliberately placed ropes.</p> <p>They have two siphons on the top of their tubular bodies: one for pulling in nutrient-rich sea water, the other for expelling filtered water. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you drive close to one of our farms, the ocean will be like the Mediterranean \u2013 crystal clear waters</p> <footer> <cite>Hans Petter Olsen, CEO, Pronofa</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet, once processed, ciona can be consumed in surprisingly traditional recipes. \u201cWe had to work on how to eliminate the marine taste,\u201d says Olsen. \u201cBecause it should not taste marine or fish-like at all. It is going to taste like meat.\u201d</p> <p>But sea squirts are more than just another alternative protein source. Farming ciona is \u201csuper-sustainable\u201d, according to Olsen, in part because they require almost no input from the farmer. Ropes are seeded with ciona larvae, similar to farming oysters or mussels. The farmer\u2019s labour is required at harvest time, when the long ropes covered in sea squirts are hauled from the ocean, the ciona removed, and then processed. </p> <p>Often considered a highly invasive species, varieties of tunicates (of which ciona are just one) appear uninvited on ropes, buoys, bowlines and docks around the world. Most have potential for culinary uses, but Pronofa\u2019s recipes are specially formulated for the ciona that thrive in the North Sea. In spite of being an invasive species, ciona and other tunicates can be of tremendous value to the environments they grow in, filtering out nitrogen from the ocean waters.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the side effects of agriculture is the nitrogen surplus,\u201d says Olsen, \u201cSurplus that is running into the rivers and causing the algae to grow too much. But if you drive close to one of our tunicate farms, the ocean will be like the Mediterranean \u2013 crystal clear waters, and visibility of 30 metres.\u201d</p>    <p>However, sea squirt farming is not without its difficulties. A venture to farm the variety <em>haloceynthia roretzi</em>, or sea pineapple, for human consumption in Korea has struggled to have any impact due to continued <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130302122523/http://www.lib.noaa.gov/retiredsites/korea/main_species/sea_squirt.htm\">events of mass mortality</a>. Scientists in Korea believe the die-offs are <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022201113001870\">caused by a parasite</a> whose destructive capabilities may be increased by the monoculture nature of tunicate farms.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Pronofa hopes that its work with the invertebrates will turn it into a food staple rather than just another fashionable and short-lived meat alternative.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/28/from-petri-dish-to-plate-meet-the-company-hoping-to-bring-lab-grown-fish-to-the-table\">From petri dish to plate: meet the company hoping to bring lab-grown fish to the table</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFor us, it is very important not to be put on the same shelf as Beyond Meat and all those other meat replacements,\u201d says Olsen. \u201cEventually, we want to compete on scale with the salmon industry in Norway, and we want to deliver millions of tonnes of our products.\u201d The Norwegian <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/norway-salmon-farming-industry-grapples-with-harsh-climate-effects-2024-08-06/\">salmon industry makes up 2% of Norway\u2019s GDP</a> and is worth more than $10bn (\u00a37.7bn) annually, according to the Norwegian Seafood Council.</p> <p>Olsen\u2019s bold vision starts with a plate of convincingly meat-like ciona mince, drenched in tomato sauce, cheese and sandwiched between sheets of pasta. It looks like meat, and one forkful confirms, it tastes like meat. Ciona mincemeat could be the next ground beef \u2013 without the environmentally destructive processes associated with cattle farming. But for now, it\u2019s a case of watch this space.</p>",

The dishes come from Pronofa Asa, a Scandinavian company whose purpose is to make new and sustainable protein sources. In 2022, it acquired the Swedish research company Marine Taste and expanded on its work turning ciona \u2013 or \u201csea squirts\u201d to you and me \u2013 into mincemeat. The dishes in Fredrikstad were prototypes, but Pronofa plans to have its mincemeat on supermarket shelves in Norway and Sweden before the end of the year, it says, and will aim to expand throughout Europe in the coming years. Ciona is naturally rich in proteins, and can be used as an alternative feed for fish or animals as well as people. \u201cThe sea squirt is the only organism that produces 100% pure cellulose,\u201d says Hans Petter Olsen, the CEO of Pronofa. \u201cSo there are some fibres in the meat and we had to work on how to process them so the mouthfeel would be similar to meat.\u201d Pronofa, and a number of companies like it, are developing alternative protein sources for kitchen tables around the world, which have a minimal carbon footprint but that taste like family favourites. The Food Standards Agency said in October that cell-cultivated meat could be on sale in the UK within a few years. Cultivated chicken was approved for sale to consumers in Singapore in 2020 and in the US in 2023 and cultivated steak was approved in Israel in 2024. Scores of companies around the world are developing similar products, including using pork and fish. Ciona are umami flavoured, but naturally have a slight seafood taste and a texture reminiscent of calamari. There are no additives \u2013 this transformation to \u201cfake meat\u201d is accomplished simply by the way that the company processes the sea squirt, says Olsen. Changing the sea squirt into something that looks enticing is important as ciona does not look appetising. Burping and bubbling in the freezing waters of the North Sea, sea squirts are translucent tubes that resemble gelatinous sacs. They will grow on almost any solid surface in the sea, from rocks and driftwood to deliberately placed ropes. They have two siphons on the top of their tubular bodies: one for pulling in nutrient-rich sea water, the other for expelling filtered water. Yet, once processed, ciona can be consumed in surprisingly traditional recipes. \u201cWe had to work on how to eliminate the marine taste,\u201d says Olsen. \u201cBecause it should not taste marine or fish-like at all. It is going to taste like meat.\u201d But sea squirts are more than just another alternative protein source. Farming ciona is \u201csuper-sustainable\u201d, according to Olsen, in part because they require almost no input from the farmer. Ropes are seeded with ciona larvae, similar to farming oysters or mussels. The farmer\u2019s labour is required at harvest time, when the long ropes covered in sea squirts are hauled from the ocean, the ciona removed, and then processed. Often considered a highly invasive species, varieties of tunicates (of which ciona are just one) appear uninvited on ropes, buoys, bowlines and docks around the world. Most have potential for culinary uses, but Pronofa\u2019s recipes are specially formulated for the ciona that thrive in the North Sea. In spite of being an invasive species, ciona and other tunicates can be of tremendous value to the environments they grow in, filtering out nitrogen from the ocean waters. \u201cOne of the side effects of agriculture is the nitrogen surplus,\u201d says Olsen, \u201cSurplus that is running into the rivers and causing the algae to grow too much. But if you drive close to one of our tunicate farms, the ocean will be like the Mediterranean \u2013 crystal clear waters, and visibility of 30 metres.\u201d However, sea squirt farming is not without its difficulties. A venture to farm the variety haloceynthia roretzi, or sea pineapple, for human consumption in Korea has struggled to have any impact due to continued events of mass mortality. Scientists in Korea believe the die-offs are caused by a parasite whose destructive capabilities may be increased by the monoculture nature of tunicate farms. Nevertheless, Pronofa hopes that its work with the invertebrates will turn it into a food staple rather than just another fashionable and short-lived meat alternative. \u201cFor us, it is very important not to be put on the same shelf as Beyond Meat and all those other meat replacements,\u201d says Olsen. \u201cEventually, we want to compete on scale with the salmon industry in Norway, and we want to deliver millions of tonnes of our products.\u201d The Norwegian salmon industry makes up 2% of Norway\u2019s GDP and is worth more than $10bn (\u00a37.7bn) annually, according to the Norwegian Seafood Council. Olsen\u2019s bold vision starts with a plate of convincingly meat-like ciona mince, drenched in tomato sauce, cheese and sandwiched between sheets of pasta. It looks like meat, and one forkful confirms, it tastes like meat. Ciona mincemeat could be the next ground beef \u2013 without the environmentally destructive processes associated with cattle farming. But for now, it\u2019s a case of watch this space.",

That\u2019s because this boat bar was one of Belgrade\u2019s \u201csplavs\u201d, raft houses that have been built on Belgrade\u2019s two rivers, the Danube and the Sava, since the 1960s.

DJ Marko Milic\u0301 said this summer\u2019s attendance was good, as Belgraders flocked to support their favourite splavs despite the change of location. Now, however, the barge is fairly dead. Milic\u0301 used to play to hundreds on the weekend but on a warm October Saturday night, he spun beats for just five people. \u201cWe are too far away so nobody can be bothered to come down here any more,\u201d he said. He believes they have two years before they are moved on again \u2013 far beyond town.</p>    <p>Zappa was lucky, relatively speaking. Many other smaller, independent rafts, such as iconic dance club 20/44 were towed 12 miles (20km) upriver to a kind of splav graveyard where they were left to rot or be looted. Little warning was given to the owners. The city council simply cut their electricity and water supply before descending upon them with a tow boat.</p> <p>Belgrade is divided over the clean-up of the party rafts. Milica Jovanovic is one of the many Belgraders who was deeply saddened by the loss of the 20/44 club. \u201cIt was my church and that can\u2019t be replaced,\u201d she said as she looked around on a last visit. Jovanovic added that with the removal of the splavs, \u201cthe whole social scene of a generation was wiped out\u201d.</p>    <p>Other Belgraders are more relaxed about the loss. The owner of the 30-year-old boat bar <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Splav+Brodi%C4%87/@44.7971131,20.4286879,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x475a7b43c49d727b:0xc8e81959f83a5245!8m2!3d44.7971818!4d20.4335034!16s%2Fg%2F11h75jprfm?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTEwNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D\">Brodi\u0107</a>, Bane Susi\u0107, said he would welcome a more peaceful life if he was moved further down the river. \u201cWe have had our best days here already. Now the waterfront looks cleaner, more like a modern functioning city, without all these structures choking the river.\u201d</p> <p>Some initially backed the measures, but now have regrets. Maja Djuri\u0107 was keen on the regulation for environmental reasons, but realised that the organic social function served by many of the splavs is being replaced with a sterile, flashy riverside, catering mostly to the elite. \u201cWhat we are witnessing is the creep of commercialisation with very little transparency and even less community consultation,\u201d Djuri\u0107 said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>What we are witnessing is the creep of commercialisation with very little transparency and even less community consultation</p> <footer> <cite>Maja Djuri\u0107</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One example is the huge and controversial <a href=\"https://www.belgradewaterfront.com/en/about-us/\">Belgrade Waterfront</a> development, which was drawn up in 2014 and has seen ongoing building works along the river. Whole swathes of old Belgrade were cleared to make way for a development of luxury flats, swanky bars and shops. Locals were pushed out of their homes and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/serbs-rally-against-shady-demolitions-after-masked-crew-tied-up-witnesses\">mass protests took place across the city</a>.</p>    <p>But few protests are erupting for the splav clearances because they are happening in a more subtle, gradual way. Yet it\u2019s part of a wider trend of Belgrade losing its underground bars and independent venues to fast-paced development. This shift is pushing people back on to private, domestic splavs.</p> <p>One advocate for the home splav lifestyle is Irena Luki\u0107, whose family has owned a beautiful wooden rafthouse for 40 years on the peaceful side of Ada Ciganlije peninsula, four miles from Belgrade\u2019s city centre. The area is surrounded by nature and feels miles from urban life, though it\u2019s only 20 minutes by bus and walkable from Ada lake. To Luki\u0107, splavs are friend- and family-focused and have \u201cnothing to do with the party boats that popped up in the 1990s. We simply come here with friends to barbecue, to swim, to relax after work. Neighbours help each other out, we\u2019re all from different backgrounds but we all have the rafts in common. This is the splav life,\u201d he said.<br><br></p>",

Now the waterfront looks cleaner, more like a modern functioning city, without all these structures choking the river.\u201d Some initially backed the measures, but now have regrets. Maja Djuri\u0107 was keen on the regulation for environmental reasons, but realised that the organic social function served by many of the splavs is being replaced with a sterile, flashy riverside, catering mostly to the elite. \u201cWhat we are witnessing is the creep of commercialisation with very little transparency and even less community consultation,\u201d Djuri\u0107 said. One example is the huge and controversial Belgrade Waterfront development, which was drawn up in 2014 and has seen ongoing building works along the river. Whole swathes of old Belgrade were cleared to make way for a development of luxury flats, swanky bars and shops. Locals were pushed out of their homes and mass protests took place across the city. But few protests are erupting for the splav clearances because they are happening in a more subtle, gradual way. Yet it\u2019s part of a wider trend of Belgrade losing its underground bars and independent venues to fast-paced development. This shift is pushing people back on to private, domestic splavs. One advocate for the home splav lifestyle is Irena Luki\u0107, whose family has owned a beautiful wooden rafthouse for 40 years on the peaceful side of Ada Ciganlije peninsula, four miles from Belgrade\u2019s city centre. The area is surrounded by nature and feels miles from urban life, though it\u2019s only 20 minutes by bus and walkable from Ada lake. To Luki\u0107, splavs are friend- and family-focused and have \u201cnothing to do with the party boats that popped up in the 1990s. We simply come here with friends to barbecue, to swim, to relax after work. Neighbours help each other out, we\u2019re all from different backgrounds but we all have the rafts in common. This is the splav life,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>Good morning. It is 11 years since the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, was told of allegations against a sadistic abuser of children groomed at evangelical Christian camps. It is seven years since a Channel 4 investigation into John Smyth\u2019s abuse, and six years since Smyth died in South Africa.

In 2022, when he was asked about whether he intended to serve until the mandatory retirement age, <a href=\"https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2022/29-july/news/uk/archbishop-welby-to-stay-in-post-until-2026-if-people-are-happy\">he said</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s what\u2019s best for the church. I will certainly take advice, and if my health is good and people are happy that I\u2019m still there, then I\u2019ll still be there.\u201d</p> <p>But now, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/church-of-england-covered-up-attacks-serial-abuser-john-smyth-review\">a long-awaited independent review</a> led by former social services director Keith Makin concluded that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that Welby knew nothing of concerns about John Smyth (above), the question of what is best for the church looks like a very difficult one. \u201cWelby is under a huge amount of pressure,\u201d Harriet Sherwood said. \u201cHe has repeatedly apologised. But for many of the survivors of Smyth\u2019s abuse, that is not enough.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What did </strong><strong>Smyth do?</strong></p> <p>The public view of Smyth in the 1970s and 80s was as a crusader for traditional \u201cvalues\u201d. He was a senior QC who represented Mary Whitehouse in a blasphemy case against Gay News (over a poem about a centurion\u2019s love for Christ) and a gross indecency case over a play that depicted a man being raped. \u201cHe was a very powerful and charismatic figure,\u201d said Harriet.</p> <p>The truth about Smyth was horrifically different. Smyth was the chair of the Iwerne Trust, a group that ran Christian camps in Dorset. He groomed boys who he met through those camps, many of them pupils at the private school Winchester college, and violently beat them in the garden shed of his family home. His own seven-year-old son was among his victims, believed to number about 130 in total. One survivor said he received more than 1,000 strokes with a cane on a single occasion; some had to wear nappies to contain the bleeding. This description is only the most superficial account of a years-long pattern of sadistic abuse.</p> <p>\u201cMany of the victims were unsurprisingly deeply traumatised,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cSome tried to take their own lives.\u201d </p> <p>Winchester college cut all ties with Smyth in 1982, but they did not report him to the authorities. With no blemish to his reputation, he moved to Zimbabwe and later South Africa, where he appears to have continued his abusive behaviour. He was charged but never convicted of the manslaughter of a 16-year-old boy who had attended one of his summer camps.</p> <p>After the Channel 4 investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded in August 2018 that Smyth had a case to answer in the UK; he died, of an apparent heart attack, in South Africa the same month.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>How did the church handle the scandal?</strong></p> <p>In 2012, one of Smyth\u2019s victims reached out to a fellow survivor who was an officer of the Church of England and asked for help. Welby was confirmed as archbishop of Canterbury a year later; by July of that year, a church safeguarding adviser was aware of at least three victims, and possibly five or six others.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the critical point,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cWelby was informed, and so were other senior figures. But they didn\u2019t tell the authorities in the UK or South Africa. And between 2013 and [Smyth\u2019s] death five years later, he continued to present a threat. He didn\u2019t have to face up to what he\u2019d done, and he didn\u2019t face any consequences.\u201d The allegations against Smyth were not made public until three years later.</p> <p>While there is no excuse for Winchester college\u2019s failure to notify the authorities in the 1980s, Harriet said: \u201cIt was typical of the time \u2013 there was perhaps not a reckoning with the way that people carry abuse and trauma through their whole lives. But that was just not an excuse in 2013. It was widely understood and accepted by then how damaging this kind of abuse could be.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you talk to survivors \u2013 and I\u2019ve talked to a lot \u2013 they say that the cover-up, and not being listened to, is as large a part of the trauma for them as the abuse itself.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Why is </strong><strong>Welby under pressure?</strong></p> <p>Welby\u2019s connection to the scandal stretches back well before he became the archbishop of Canterbury. Welby was a volunteer at the same holiday camps where Smyth groomed some of his victims in the 1970s, and the Makin review notes two critical claims that he would have had at least some sense of Smyth\u2019s actions.</p> <p>Makin writes that a \u201ccontributor to this review\u201d said that in 1978 they had overheard Welby having a \u201cgrave\u201d conversation about Smyth with the Rev Mark Ruston, who would later produce a report about Smyth\u2019s abuse for Winchester college. And Welby acknowledged to Makin that in 1981 he was told by the rector of a church in Paris where Smyth brought a group of boys en route to a skiing trip in France that he was \u201creally not a nice man\u201d and that \u201cone of the boys had a chat with me\u201d.</p> <p>Welby insists that he has no recollection of the 1978 conversation and that he put the 1981 warning down to \u201cincompatible personalities\u201d. But the Makin review concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the balance of probabilities, it is the opinion of the Reviewers that it was unlikely that Justin Welby would have had no knowledge of the concerns regarding John Smyth in the 1980s in the UK. He may not have known of the extreme seriousness of the abuse, but it is most probable that he would have had at least a level of knowledge that John Smyth was of some concern.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>As London vicar Giles Fraser, one of those calling for Welby\u2019s resignation, <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2024/11/why-justin-welby-must-go/\">notes here</a>, Welby has himself acknowledged that if he had known about the abuse before 2013, that would be grounds for resignation. Even setting all that aside, there is the question of how Welby and the Church of England handled the allegations when they became formally aware of them.</p> <p>Taken together, Harriet said, \u201cit\u2019s really not surprising that all of this has led to calls for his resignation\u201d. It is true that the criticisms of Welby come within a context where he faces critics from both the church\u2019s liberal and conservative wings as he tries to hold a fraying communion together \u2013 a task that Harriet characterised as an \u201cimpossible job\u201d. But it is also true that \u201cfor lots of survivors, this report puts him clearly in the frame\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Will Welby survive?</strong></p> <p>\u201cThat is a really, really difficult question to answer,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cBut it does seem clear that this report has real traction.</p> <p>\u201cWelby is 69 in January, and 70 the year after that \u2013 and that\u2019s when he is supposed to retire. He is supposed to give a year\u2019s notice of when he intends to do so, which means that it will all be happening quite soon, and he will obviously not want that announcement to be connected with this. So it may be that he tries to hold out.\u201d</p> <p>Whether he stays or goes, she notes, \u201cone of the tragedies of this is how it represents the church today. It has invested a huge amount of money and resources in safeguarding, and at a local level it\u2019s pretty good. And you have loads of really good people, in the clergy and in the pews, who spend their time running food banks or shelters for homeless people.</p> <p>\u201cBut all of that gets overshadowed by this story. The church has, gradually, been learning the lessons about scandals like this. But it\u2019s taken a long, long time.\u201d</p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>The Guardian\u2019s new project, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2024/nov/11/this-is-climate-breakdown-i-heard-on-the-scanner-theres-a-child-in-the-water\">This is climate breakdown</a>, shares powerful testimonies from people facing the most devastating impacts of the <strong>climate crisis</strong>.

Israel-Gaza war | The amount of aid reaching Gaza has dropped to the lowest level since December, official Israeli figures show, despite the US last month issuing a 30-day ultimatum threatening sanctions if there was no increase in humanitarian supplies reaching the territory. US election | President-elect Donald Trump has reportedly decided to appoint Republican congressman and China hawk Mike Waltz of Florida as his national security adviser. Meanwhile, Florida senator Marco Rubio was reported to be favourite for secretary of state. Music | Art Garfunkel has described a recent tearful reunion with Paul Simon, in which the pair moved past old enmities. Garfunkel, 83, said that the meeting over lunch was the \u201cfirst time we\u2019d been together in many years\u201d and \u201cwas about wanting to make amends before it\u2019s too late\u201d. In depth: \u2018For many survivors, an apology is not enough\u2019 Justin Welby is due to step down as the archishop of Canterbury when he turns 70 in January 2026. In 2022, when he was asked about whether he intended to serve until the mandatory retirement age, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s what\u2019s best for the church. I will certainly take advice, and if my health is good and people are happy that I\u2019m still there, then I\u2019ll still be there.\u201d But now, after a long-awaited independent review led by former social services director Keith Makin concluded that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that Welby knew nothing of concerns about John Smyth (above), the question of what is best for the church looks like a very difficult one. \u201cWelby is under a huge amount of pressure,\u201d Harriet Sherwood said. \u201cHe has repeatedly apologised. But for many of the survivors of Smyth\u2019s abuse, that is not enough.\u201d *** What did Smyth do? The public view of Smyth in the 1970s and 80s was as a crusader for traditional \u201cvalues\u201d. He was a senior QC who represented Mary Whitehouse in a blasphemy case against Gay News (over a poem about a centurion\u2019s love for Christ) and a gross indecency case over a play that depicted a man being raped. \u201cHe was a very powerful and charismatic figure,\u201d said Harriet. The truth about Smyth was horrifically different. Smyth was the chair of the Iwerne Trust, a group that ran Christian camps in Dorset. He groomed boys who he met through those camps, many of them pupils at the private school Winchester college, and violently beat them in the garden shed of his family home. His own seven-year-old son was among his victims, believed to number about 130 in total. One survivor said he received more than 1,000 strokes with a cane on a single occasion; some had to wear nappies to contain the bleeding. This description is only the most superficial account of a years-long pattern of sadistic abuse. \u201cMany of the victims were unsurprisingly deeply traumatised,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cSome tried to take their own lives.\u201d Winchester college cut all ties with Smyth in 1982, but they did not report him to the authorities. With no blemish to his reputation, he moved to Zimbabwe and later South Africa, where he appears to have continued his abusive behaviour. He was charged but never convicted of the manslaughter of a 16-year-old boy who had attended one of his summer camps. After the Channel 4 investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded in August 2018 that Smyth had a case to answer in the UK; he died, of an apparent heart attack, in South Africa the same month. *** How did the church handle the scandal? In 2012, one of Smyth\u2019s victims reached out to a fellow survivor who was an officer of the Church of England and asked for help. Welby was confirmed as archbishop of Canterbury a year later; by July of that year, a church safeguarding adviser was aware of at least three victims, and possibly five or six others. \u201cThat\u2019s the critical point,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cWelby was informed, and so were other senior figures. But they didn\u2019t tell the authorities in the UK or South Africa. And between 2013 and [Smyth\u2019s] death five years later, he continued to present a threat. He didn\u2019t have to face up to what he\u2019d done, and he didn\u2019t face any consequences.\u201d The allegations against Smyth were not made public until three years later. While there is no excuse for Winchester college\u2019s failure to notify the authorities in the 1980s, Harriet said: \u201cIt was typical of the time \u2013 there was perhaps not a reckoning with the way that people carry abuse and trauma through their whole lives. But that was just not an excuse in 2013. It was widely understood and accepted by then how damaging this kind of abuse could be. \u201cWhen you talk to survivors \u2013 and I\u2019ve talked to a lot \u2013 they say that the cover-up, and not being listened to, is as large a part of the trauma for them as the abuse itself.\u201d *** Why is Welby under pressure? Welby\u2019s connection to the scandal stretches back well before he became the archbishop of Canterbury. Welby was a volunteer at the same holiday camps where Smyth groomed some of his victims in the 1970s, and the Makin review notes two critical claims that he would have had at least some sense of Smyth\u2019s actions. Makin writes that a \u201ccontributor to this review\u201d said that in 1978 they had overheard Welby having a \u201cgrave\u201d conversation about Smyth with the Rev Mark Ruston, who would later produce a report about Smyth\u2019s abuse for Winchester college. And Welby acknowledged to Makin that in 1981 he was told by the rector of a church in Paris where Smyth brought a group of boys en route to a skiing trip in France that he was \u201creally not a nice man\u201d and that \u201cone of the boys had a chat with me\u201d. Welby insists that he has no recollection of the 1978 conversation and that he put the 1981 warning down to \u201cincompatible personalities\u201d. But the Makin review concludes: On the balance of probabilities, it is the opinion of the Reviewers that it was unlikely that Justin Welby would have had no knowledge of the concerns regarding John Smyth in the 1980s in the UK. He may not have known of the extreme seriousness of the abuse, but it is most probable that he would have had at least a level of knowledge that John Smyth was of some concern.\u201d As London vicar Giles Fraser, one of those calling for Welby\u2019s resignation, notes here, Welby has himself acknowledged that if he had known about the abuse before 2013, that would be grounds for resignation. Even setting all that aside, there is the question of how Welby and the Church of England handled the allegations when they became formally aware of them. Taken together, Harriet said, \u201cit\u2019s really not surprising that all of this has led to calls for his resignation\u201d. It is true that the criticisms of Welby come within a context where he faces critics from both the church\u2019s liberal and conservative wings as he tries to hold a fraying communion together \u2013 a task that Harriet characterised as an \u201cimpossible job\u201d. But it is also true that \u201cfor lots of survivors, this report puts him clearly in the frame\u201d. *** Will Welby survive? \u201cThat is a really, really difficult question to answer,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cBut it does seem clear that this report has real traction. \u201cWelby is 69 in January, and 70 the year after that \u2013 and that\u2019s when he is supposed to retire. He is supposed to give a year\u2019s notice of when he intends to do so, which means that it will all be happening quite soon, and he will obviously not want that announcement to be connected with this. So it may be that he tries to hold out.\u201d Whether he stays or goes, she notes, \u201cone of the tragedies of this is how it represents the church today. It has invested a huge amount of money and resources in safeguarding, and at a local level it\u2019s pretty good. And you have loads of really good people, in the clergy and in the pews, who spend their time running food banks or shelters for homeless people. \u201cBut all of that gets overshadowed by this story. The church has, gradually, been learning the lessons about scandals like this. But it\u2019s taken a long, long time.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading The Guardian\u2019s new project, This is climate breakdown, shares powerful testimonies from people facing the most devastating impacts of the climate crisis.

That first budget was Labour to its core: after decades of money flowing from workers, it took from bosses and capital owners while lifting the minimum wage, creating <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/data-items/impact-reforms-annual-disposable-household-income-2024-25-2029-30\">a steep graph</a> that shows the rich paying most, the poorest least. It introduced VAT for private school fees. It raised capital gains tax for the very richest. Polluting private jets will eventually pay <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/10/30/private-jet-owners-face-tax-bill-1000-pounds-per-flight/#:~:text=Private%20jet%20passengers%20face%20a,to%2C%20say%2C%20California%E2%80%9D\">\u00a31,000 per passenger on intercontinental flights</a>.

Taxes on air travel and on energy and waste are not far behind. Those who earn more than \u00a375,000 a year and second-home owners top the list of those who should pay most. True, people know next to nothing about how most tax is spent (they guess that spending on migrants is second-highest, even though it takes only 0.3%). <a href=\"https://x.com/paullewismoney/status/1855264808209096945\">Paul Lewis, presenter of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Money Box</a>, finds people are in favour of inheritance tax on farms when they hear the facts.

Although this budget slightly tilting things more fairly goes with the grain of public sentiment, ministers seem markedly reluctant to talk about social justice, as if their budget choices were only due to the \u00a322bn black hole. Though Labour politicians have fairness in their marrow, they nervously refrain from voicing egalitarian instincts that would chime strongly with most people. Labour MPs are by their nature insurgent \u2013 combatants against the great social inequality ignited by Margaret Thatcher \u2013 and their leadership should let them off the leash to say it. Being a bit vanilla wins few hearts and minds.</p> <p>Lucky in its opponents, Labour can relish Kemi Badenoch falling into every trap, defending every well-off interest, every private school and private equity owner against taxes that the public supports. The Tories learned nothing from their humiliation: public opinion rejects their small state. Watch her <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/09/trade-deal-with-america-within-our-grasp-trump-eu-starmer/\">urge Starmer to speed up a US trade deal</a> \u2013 hardly politic as the world awaits Trump\u2019s trade war.

If Badenoch backs that, she alienates the public and farmers. So bring on these battles: they will only sharpen Labour\u2019s identity. If the US election has anything to teach Labour, it\u2019s this: in a raucous social media world, be bold.</p> <ul> <li><p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

At the moment, designated bathing sites are only tested for dangerous pollution that could make swimmers sick during the \u201cbathing season\u201d, which runs from May to September. Campaigners have long argued that people use waterways for recreation such as swimming, fishing and boating throughout the year, so the testing should be consistent. Additionally, the May-September period is often the driest of the year, so it is likely for there to be fewer spills from sewers during that time. In the first shake-up to bathing rules since 2013, the government is proposing measures including extending the bathing season and therefore the testing to all year round; expanding the legal definition of \u201cbathers\u201d to include participants in water sports other than swimming, including paddle boarders and surfers; and ending the automatic de-designation of bathing water status after five consecutive years of a site being rated \u201cpoor\u201d, which can damage local tourism and businesses.

Ministers are also considering testing bathing sites at several points to get a more accurate picture of pollution. Annual ratings classify each site as excellent, good, sufficient or poor on the basis of water quality. The main cause of pollutants to bathing sites are sewage spills and agricultural runoff.

The boy had been playing in a toddlers\u2019 pool adjoined to an adult pool at Crown Towers, a luxury hotel in central Melbourne, in 2021 when he slipped and fell into the deeper pool. Coroner Sarah Gebert said CCTV footage showed he struggled for more than two minutes while his mother used her mobile phone in the toddlers\u2019 pool nearby and minded her 12-month-old nephew. Her son then floated to the surface. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The boy, known as Master K for the inquest, was undiscovered by the mother and other pool patrons for more than nine minutes. \u201cMaster K\u2019s tragic death and the circumstances of his drowning highlight the need for close supervision of young children, especially in and around pools,\u201d Gebert said in her findings. \u201cThis is a safety message that is consistently repeated by a number of child and water-related authorities. \u201cI convey my sincere condolences to Master K\u2019s family for their loss and acknowledge the profound grief caused by the passing of such a young child.\u201d More than 40 Victorian children aged under four have drowned since 2010 because of inadequate supervision, Gebert found. As part of the investigation, Gebert analysed data which showed that between 1 January 2010 and 31 March 2024, there were 47 drowning deaths of children aged between newborn and four years of age in Victoria. In 43 of these deaths, inadequate supervision was a factor, she found. Of the 47 deaths, children aged one year represented the highest age group of drownings, with 16 deaths, followed by two-year-olds with 11 deaths. In 11 of the 47 cases, Gebert found, coroners previously made comments relating to the specific dangers faced by young children in the context of water safety. Gebert directed the findings be provided to the Royal Children\u2019s hospital, Ambulance Victoria, the Commission for Children and Young People, Kidsafe Victoria and Life Saving Victoria. She also noted that the Office of Public Prosecutions had advised Victoria police that charges for child homicide in circumstances of criminal negligence should not proceed in the circumstances.",

The series had been eagerly awaited, but nothing like as eagerly as the book itself. Mantel\u2019s legions of fans waited eight years from the publication of&nbsp;Bring Up the Bodies for the finale&nbsp;to arrive in 2020.</p> <p>There was a rumour at the time that Mantel had had writer\u2019s block \u2013 specifically, that she had been unable to bring herself to tackle (500-year-old spoiler alert!) Thomas Cromwell\u2019s death scene. She denied this, but an atmosphere of truth clung to it. By the time she had finished with this unlikely hero \u2013 \u201ca modern, rational, state-planning bureaucrat in the midst of all these over-ambitious nobles\u201d is how the Oxford history professor Steven Gunn puts it, which is cool, but hardly Indiana Jones \u2013 Mantel had brought Cromwell so vividly to life that it made sense that she couldn\u2019t bear to kill him.</p> <p>Wolf Hall, the first part of the trilogy, was published in 2009. It fell on fertile ground, if by \u201cfertile\u201d you mean \u201cobsessed with the Tudors\u201d. The BBC was midway through broadcasting the glitzy drama The Tudors, with one of the producers stoutly defending the radical glow-up of Jonathan Rhys Meyers \u2013 lean and elegant as Henry VIII, who was neither of those things \u2013 by saying: \u201cWe still want him to be appealing.\u201d Why, though, when he wasn\u2019t? We will come to that shortly.</p>    <p>The BBC followed that up with Tudor Monastery Farm in 2013, a classic wholemealification of an opulent historical pleasure, such as you would expect from a public service broadcaster: \u201cLet\u2019s talk about ordinary people trying to herd sheep and fish for eel,\u201d as&nbsp;Gunn recalls.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/10/six-review-henry-viii-wives-arts-theatre-london\">Then came Six</a>, the 2017 musical in which Henry\u2019s wives vie for recognition as the most suffering spouse. It\u2019s a witty, joyfully anachronistic piece. Here is Anne Boleyn on the Reformation: \u201cThe&nbsp;rules were so outdated / Us two wanted to get X-rated / Soon, ex-communicated! / Everybody chill, it\u2019s totes God\u2019s will.\u201d And it shakes the historical cliches off each queen: Anne of Cleves is no longer ugly (instead canny, hedonistic and voracious); Catherine of Aragon is no longer a longsuffering moralist (instead stubborn as hell); and Catherine Howard is \u2013 well, OK, she&nbsp;is still a&nbsp;hussy.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/21/firebrand-review-jude-laws-obese-and-oozy-henry-viii-rules-supreme-in-catherine-parr-drama\">Last year\u2019s movie Firebrand</a> was&nbsp;a biopic of Catherine Parr, the last woman standing. It featured more tremendously flattering casting for Henry, played by Jude Law, with a bit of gobsmacking ahistoricism at the end. You couldn\u2019t really call it revisionism \u2013 it was more like fan fiction. </p> <p>***</p> <p>But it all started in 2001, with Philippa Gregory. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a wave of interest in the Tudors now and I was part of generating that wave,\u201d she says, before rowing back a little: \u201cI was an early surfer.\u201d The Other Boleyn Girl was the start of 15 novels in Gregory\u2019s Plantagenet and Tudor series, a stunning, incredibly racy narrative of the Boleyn who preceded Anne in Henry\u2019s affections \u2013 her sister, Mary.</p> <p>The story came about by chance: \u201cI wanted to work on women pirates in the 1400s, so I was in the library looking up Tudor shipping and I came upon a ship called Mary Boleyn,\u201d says Gregory. She scoured the work of historians, but could only patchwork together Mary\u2019s life through footnotes and margins. The resulting book (which became a film in 2008) was enough to spark a cultural fascination with the&nbsp;Tudors.</p> <p>But it was part of a bigger plan, Gregory says: \u201cOne of the things I&nbsp;brought to it, which I thought was quite fresh, was trying to look at the wives as agents of their own lives. I was at university in the 80s and that was a time when women\u2019s studies was being taught and feminism was creeping into an&nbsp;academic consciousness.\u201d</p>    <p>Gregory summarises the story of Tudor wives laid down by traditional descriptions of the big six: \u201cHe has an older wife, gets fed up, marries a younger woman, gets fed up with her because she\u2019s promiscuous, marries a good woman, she dies, then he has Anne of Cleves, the ugly one, then Catherine Howard, then the final Catherine, whom he marries so she can nurse him. None of these characterisations come to historians from the historical record. They choose them.\u201d</p> <p>Every time we accept a version of the Tudors as handed down by the Victorians \u2013 or later, by the 1950s and 1960s \u2013 we accept the stories that they wanted to tell themselves about authority, society, leadership, politics, religion, gender, sex, violence, the works. Whenever there is a disconnect between the brute facts and the image projected on to&nbsp;culture, whether in art, cliches or education, it\u2019s by and large because we are still swallowing whole the view of the Victorians, specifically James Anthony Froude\u2019s History of&nbsp;England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Defeat of the Spanish Armada, published in 12 volumes between 1856 and 1870.</p> <p>The most obvious misrep\u00adresentation is of Henry himself. \u201cI&nbsp;think it\u2019s really chilling that he\u2019s taught, still, in primary schools as a jolly king,\u201d says Gregory. \u201cHe is a serial killer, he is an abuser of his wives, he is a tyrant. I regard him with other tyrants: Napoleon, Hitler, Stalin.\u201d </p>    <p>Some of this is simply a difference between centuries. Tudor contemporaries had no trouble naming the savagery of Henry\u2019s reign. Gunn describes Thomas Wyatt\u2019s poem with the refrain \u201c<em>circa regna tonat</em>\u201d (thunder rolls around the throne): \u201cIt\u2019s very simple in its language and very direct and very emotionally powerful. We can read that and think: my goodness. He\u2019s talking about looking out of a window in the Tower of London and watching Anne Boleyn, along with his friends, go to their deaths. Wyatt is&nbsp;a sort of Wilfred Owen of Henry\u2019s&nbsp;court \u2013 your insides are turned over.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the Victorians had no framework for understanding Henry\u2019s lack of empathy as a mental void or a disorder rather than, say, strength or authority. They had a peculiar interest in rebranding cruelty as determination or decisiveness, in describing \u201cthe massacre of conquered peoples\u201d as \u201cstrong leadership\u201d, Gregory says. It\u2019s the kind of thing you would expect from a country at the apex of its colonial activity.</p> <p>The historian John Pemble has written of Froude that he changed the telling of everything: \u201cHenry wasn\u2019t a coarse and cruel tyrant, but the deliverer of his people and the founder of the modern state. Anne Boleyn wasn\u2019t the innocent victim of a monster\u2019s caprice, but a nymphomaniac \u2026 who was properly tried and legally executed. Thomas More, the genial philosopher, was not a saint, but a sadistic bigot.</p> <p>\u201cMary, Queen of Scots wasn\u2019t a tragic romantic heroine, but a lethal combination of beauty, intelligence and homicidal infatuation. Elizabeth I wasn\u2019t an Amazonian mastermind rallying the free world against the forces of darkness \u2026 she was muddled, volatile, indecisive and impulsive, and would have floundered without [her chief adviser, Lord] Burghley.\u201d</p> <p>Here you can see not only imperial self-justification, but also complicated anti-Catholicism (Froude had beef with the cardinal John Henry Newman, but we will have to do that another time) and a&nbsp;profound fear of female sexuality and women\u2019s worldly and&nbsp;political&nbsp;power.</p> <p>\u201cMost of our views on this are really dictated by the Victorians, who offer us the maiden in the tower,\u201d Gregory says. \u201cBut in the medieval period, we\u2019ve got heroines who have consciousness and ideas and desires. Women were recognised as being politically and economically and sexually active.\u201d In her latest book, Normal Women: 900 Years of Making History, Gregory illustrates \u201cthe empowerment of women being taken from them, women being pushed out of guilds, out of the professions. And the big push back comes at the turn of the 1800s.\u201d</p>    <p>The next big wave of Tudor retellings was in the 1950s and 1960s. Again, certainly in terms of the blockbuster output \u2013 the Academy award-winning Man for All Seasons in 1966; Anne of the Thousand Days in 1969; The Six Wives of Henry VIII, a 1970 BBC series \u2013 the era is defined by Henry\u2019s libido, which stands in for&nbsp;ungovernable male desire.</p> <p>\u201cPeople overplay the libido thing,\u201d Gunn says. \u201cHenry would have pointed out that, compared with Francis I of France, he was a model of marital probity.\u201d Perhaps they overplay it for a reason, because the other pan on that scale&nbsp;is murdered women.</p> <p>The BBC series reheats Victorian&nbsp;portraits of the six wives, if anything more intensely coddling the male ego. Catherine of Aragon is needy and dowdy; Anne Boleyn insufferably jealous; Jane Seymour scheming and unsisterly, but undone by her feminine conscience; Anne of Cleves still ugly; Catherine Howard a slut; and, finally, Catherine Parr, in a rage after Henry\u2019s death that Thomas Seymour would dare, as a lesser man, to propose to her, although she marries him anyway. This is hilarious, as Seymour \u201cwas the sexiest man in court and she married him for love\u201d, says&nbsp;Gregory.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In so many ways, this century\u2019s Tudor revisionism \u2013 fictionalised by Gregory in so many works, including The Boleyn Inheritance, The Taming of the Queen and The Last Tudor; by Mantel, of course; and in popular historical works by Antonia Fraser and Tracy Borman&nbsp;\u2013 has been about breaking history out&nbsp;of the straitjacket constructed for it by the neuroses of the past.</p> <p>\u201cCatherine Parr is an autodidact, she teaches herself Greek, she translates the psalms. And the Victorians see her primarily as Henry\u2019s nurse,\u201d Gregory says. Henry, meanwhile, \u201cthinks he\u2019s quite dutiful, but his attention span isn\u2019t what it could be\u201d, says Gunn. \u201cHe thinks: \u2018All monarchs have to be learned and all learned people need to know Greek,\u2019 and tries to learn it. He sticks at that for about two weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Henry had a jousting injury towards the end of his life and chronic pain (not to mention the smell of his injuries) made him less lovable than ever. Also, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a lot more ambassadors by the time of his reign\u201d, Gunn says. Accounts sent home by the dignitaries in Henry\u2019s court were granular. Mantel describes Henry\u2019s marriage to Jane Seymour thus: \u201cNo one understood what Henry saw in Jane, who was not pretty and not young. The imperial ambassador sneered that \u2018no doubt she has a very fine <em>enigme</em>\u2019: which is to say, secret part.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/nov/10/wolf-hall-the-mirror-and-the-light-review-bbc-one\">Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light review \u2013 six hours of utter TV magic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The broad result \u2013 beyond Seymour\u2019s fantasy vagina (for God\u2019s sake, men of the past!) \u2013 is that we know much more about Henry\u2019s volatile mood, his day-to-day emotional weather-making. \u201cMaybe Henry VII got grumpy too, but we don\u2019t have the same record,\u201d says Gunn.</p> <p>Mantel\u2019s trilogy didn\u2019t just create&nbsp;Cromwell and \u201cthe sense that he\u2019s almost one of us, suddenly dropped into the middle of this strange world\u201d, Gunn says. \u201cWhen the second volume came out, people were saying: \u2018This is astonishing \u2013 she\u2019s made us think about Thomas Cromwell and his entire household completely differently.\u2019 That comes from the research of Mary Robertson, at the Huntington library in San Marino [in California].\u201d</p> <p>Mantel <a href=\"https://huntington.org/verso/remembering-hilary-mantel\">left all her own papers to the library</a>; she also crafted, and proselytised, a version of statecraft, masculinity, class mobility and sensibility that had its origins in Robertson\u2019s 1975 PhD thesis \u2013 ideas that the Victorians wouldn\u2019t have been able to conceive or accommodate. In other words, it\u2019s not just a feminist retelling that we are living through. (Ha, \u201cjust\u201d feminist! The very idea.)</p> <p>There is one other thing that may explain the present fascination. Upheavals such as splitting from Rome were often justified in terms of constitutional absolutes. Securing an heir \u2013 what you might call the ultimate concern of sovereignty&nbsp;\u2013 was presented as the overwhelming concern, worth any price.</p> <p>\u201cThe shadow of the Wars of the Roses still hangs over the Tudors and over their subjects, which is part of the reason they go along with what Henry is doing,\u201d says Gunn. \u201cThe acts of proclamation often begin by saying: \u2018It\u2019s terrible not knowing who the next leader is&nbsp;going to be.\u2019\u201d Splitting from Europe; tyrannical, feckless leaders getting away with whatever they like because nothing is more important than sovereignty: does it remind you of anything? \u201cAs fish, we can\u2019t help but swim around in the water of the current historical view,\u201d says Gunn. \u201cWe can\u2019t see our&nbsp;own biases.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 November 2024 to correct two instances of misspelling of James Anthony Froude\u2019s surname.</p>",

They had a peculiar interest in rebranding cruelty as determination or decisiveness, in describing \u201cthe massacre of conquered peoples\u201d as \u201cstrong leadership\u201d, Gregory says. It\u2019s the kind of thing you would expect from a country at the apex of its colonial activity. The historian John Pemble has written of Froude that he changed the telling of everything: \u201cHenry wasn\u2019t a coarse and cruel tyrant, but the deliverer of his people and the founder of the modern state. Anne Boleyn wasn\u2019t the innocent victim of a monster\u2019s caprice, but a nymphomaniac \u2026 who was properly tried and legally executed. Thomas More, the genial philosopher, was not a saint, but a sadistic bigot. \u201cMary, Queen of Scots wasn\u2019t a tragic romantic heroine, but a lethal combination of beauty, intelligence and homicidal infatuation. Elizabeth I wasn\u2019t an Amazonian mastermind rallying the free world against the forces of darkness \u2026 she was muddled, volatile, indecisive and impulsive, and would have floundered without [her chief adviser, Lord] Burghley.\u201d Here you can see not only imperial self-justification, but also complicated anti-Catholicism (Froude had beef with the cardinal John Henry Newman, but we will have to do that another time) and a profound fear of female sexuality and women\u2019s worldly and political power. \u201cMost of our views on this are really dictated by the Victorians, who offer us the maiden in the tower,\u201d Gregory says. \u201cBut in the medieval period, we\u2019ve got heroines who have consciousness and ideas and desires. Women were recognised as being politically and economically and sexually active.\u201d In her latest book, Normal Women: 900 Years of Making History, Gregory illustrates \u201cthe empowerment of women being taken from them, women being pushed out of guilds, out of the professions. And the big push back comes at the turn of the 1800s.\u201d The next big wave of Tudor retellings was in the 1950s and 1960s. Again, certainly in terms of the blockbuster output \u2013 the Academy award-winning Man for All Seasons in 1966; Anne of the Thousand Days in 1969; The Six Wives of Henry VIII, a 1970 BBC series \u2013 the era is defined by Henry\u2019s libido, which stands in for ungovernable male desire. \u201cPeople overplay the libido thing,\u201d Gunn says. \u201cHenry would have pointed out that, compared with Francis I of France, he was a model of marital probity.\u201d Perhaps they overplay it for a reason, because the other pan on that scale is murdered women. The BBC series reheats Victorian portraits of the six wives, if anything more intensely coddling the male ego. Catherine of Aragon is needy and dowdy; Anne Boleyn insufferably jealous; Jane Seymour scheming and unsisterly, but undone by her feminine conscience; Anne of Cleves still ugly; Catherine Howard a slut; and, finally, Catherine Parr, in a rage after Henry\u2019s death that Thomas Seymour would dare, as a lesser man, to propose to her, although she marries him anyway. This is hilarious, as Seymour \u201cwas the sexiest man in court and she married him for love\u201d, says Gregory. *** In so many ways, this century\u2019s Tudor revisionism \u2013 fictionalised by Gregory in so many works, including The Boleyn Inheritance, The Taming of the Queen and The Last Tudor; by Mantel, of course; and in popular historical works by Antonia Fraser and Tracy Borman \u2013 has been about breaking history out of the straitjacket constructed for it by the neuroses of the past. \u201cCatherine Parr is an autodidact, she teaches herself Greek, she translates the psalms. And the Victorians see her primarily as Henry\u2019s nurse,\u201d Gregory says. Henry, meanwhile, \u201cthinks he\u2019s quite dutiful, but his attention span isn\u2019t what it could be\u201d, says Gunn. \u201cHe thinks: \u2018All monarchs have to be learned and all learned people need to know Greek,\u2019 and tries to learn it. He sticks at that for about two weeks.\u201d Henry had a jousting injury towards the end of his life and chronic pain (not to mention the smell of his injuries) made him less lovable than ever. Also, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a lot more ambassadors by the time of his reign\u201d, Gunn says. Accounts sent home by the dignitaries in Henry\u2019s court were granular. Mantel describes Henry\u2019s marriage to Jane Seymour thus: \u201cNo one understood what Henry saw in Jane, who was not pretty and not young. The imperial ambassador sneered that \u2018no doubt she has a very fine enigme\u2019: which is to say, secret part.\u201d The broad result \u2013 beyond Seymour\u2019s fantasy vagina (for God\u2019s sake, men of the past!) \u2013 is that we know much more about Henry\u2019s volatile mood, his day-to-day emotional weather-making. \u201cMaybe Henry VII got grumpy too, but we don\u2019t have the same record,\u201d says Gunn. Mantel\u2019s trilogy didn\u2019t just create Cromwell and \u201cthe sense that he\u2019s almost one of us, suddenly dropped into the middle of this strange world\u201d, Gunn says. \u201cWhen the second volume came out, people were saying: \u2018This is astonishing \u2013 she\u2019s made us think about Thomas Cromwell and his entire household completely differently.\u2019 That comes from the research of Mary Robertson, at the Huntington library in San Marino [in California].\u201d Mantel left all her own papers to the library; she also crafted, and proselytised, a version of statecraft, masculinity, class mobility and sensibility that had its origins in Robertson\u2019s 1975 PhD thesis \u2013 ideas that the Victorians wouldn\u2019t have been able to conceive or accommodate. In other words, it\u2019s not just a feminist retelling that we are living through. (Ha, \u201cjust\u201d feminist! The very idea.) There is one other thing that may explain the present fascination. Upheavals such as splitting from Rome were often justified in terms of constitutional absolutes. Securing an heir \u2013 what you might call the ultimate concern of sovereignty \u2013 was presented as the overwhelming concern, worth any price. \u201cThe shadow of the Wars of the Roses still hangs over the Tudors and over their subjects, which is part of the reason they go along with what Henry is doing,\u201d says Gunn. \u201cThe acts of proclamation often begin by saying: \u2018It\u2019s terrible not knowing who the next leader is going to be.\u2019\u201d Splitting from Europe; tyrannical, feckless leaders getting away with whatever they like because nothing is more important than sovereignty: does it remind you of anything? \u201cAs fish, we can\u2019t help but swim around in the water of the current historical view,\u201d says Gunn. \u201cWe can\u2019t see our own biases.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 12 November 2024 to correct two instances of misspelling of James Anthony Froude\u2019s surname.",

      "bodyText": "Nearly 200 care providers have been given government licences to bring foreign nurses to the UK despite having previously violated labour laws, according to a study that highlights widespread employment problems in the social care sector. The report by the Work Rights Centre shows 177 companies in England have been given licences to sponsor carers, even while publicly available information shows them to have violated workers\u2019 protections in the past. The study gives further evidence of major gaps in the government\u2019s oversight of its foreign carer regime, under which hundreds of thousands of nurses and carers have travelled to Britain for work, only for many to experience exploitation and poor working conditions. It will now prove an early test for Labour\u2019s new employment rights enforcer, which the government has promised as part of its workers\u2019 rights package. Dora-Olivia Vicol, chief executive of the Work Rights Centre, said: \u201cOur research finds that breaches of employment rights are endemic in the care sector. This cannot come as a surprise to the Home Office, which granted licences to companies with a history labour violations. \u201cFor those who have been exploited, the fear of retaliation from their sponsor employer is enough to force them into silence. On top of this, working conditions are barely tolerable, with work schedules either all-consuming and exhausting, or so sparse that they do not provide enough income to make ends meet.\u201d The previous government turned to foreign workers to plug huge job gaps in the social care sector in the wake of the pandemic, with 350,000 foreign carers travelling to work in Britain last year alone. The Guardian revealed this year that many of those who come for work are not given the jobs or the hours they were promised, despite in many cases having paid tens of thousands of pounds to companies to secure their jobs and travel. Foreign carers have reported employers threatening them with deportation if they speak out about their experiences, with some forced to take irregular work on the side to pay the bills. Experts say the government has exercised little oversight of the system, allowing some care companies to continue bringing workers from abroad despite clear evidence they are mistreating people. The Work Rights Centre study shows at least 1 in every 14 companies with a licence to sponsor foreign workers has previously violated employment regulations, whether by offering substandard care, paying less than the minimum wage or breaching health and safety rules. The organisation also spoke to 92 different carers and found nearly two-thirds reported health and safety breaches, bullying or discrimination at work. Over half also said they were given unsustainable working hours, for example being asked to be on duty for as long as 100 hours a week despite only seeing clients for a fraction of that time. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, promised an investigation into the sector before Labour came to power, but has not said anything about holding one since the election. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are deeply concerned by reports of unethical practices within the adult social care sector, and we will continue to act where evidence of abuse is found. \u201cThe government recognises the scale of reforms needed to make the adult social care sector attractive, to support workforce growth and improve the retention of the domestic workforce. However, the sector also needs to help ensure international recruitment in the care system is both ethical and sustainable.\u201d",

Here\u2019s what else happened on Tuesday: Donald Trump has announced that he will nominate Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, saying the former New York congressman and gubernatorial candidate will focus on cutting regulations. Trump, who oversaw the rollback of more than 100 environmental rules when he last was US president, said Zeldin was a \u201ctrue fighter for America First policies\u201d and that \u201che will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions.\u201d Trump confirmed that New York Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik would be nominated as the US ambassador to the United Nations in his administration. \u201cShe will be an incredible ambassador to the United Nations, delivering peace through strength and America First National Security policies!\u201d, Trump said in a statement. He also pointed to her efforts against antisemitism on college campuses amid the war on Gaza. Trump has reportedly selected longtime adviser Stephen Miller, an immigration hardliner, to be the deputy chief of policy in his new administration. Miller is one of Trump\u2019s longest-serving aides, and has been a central figure in many of his policy decisions, particularly on immigration. Since leaving the White House, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal, an organisation of former Trump advisers fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union. Oklahoma senator Markwayne Mullin is reportedly being considered for a position to lead the Department of Interior or Veterans Affairs in Trump\u2019s administration. Axios reported that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s envoy, Ron Dermer, met Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday, and that Dermer also met Trump\u2019s son in law, Jared Kushner. Kamala Harris made her first public appearance since her concession speech at a Veterans Day ceremony. The vice-president did not speak at the event. Democrat Cleo Fields has won Louisiana\u2019s congressional race in a recently redrawn second majority-Black district. That flips a once reliably Republican seat blue, according to the Associated Press. Juan Merchan, the judge presiding over Trump\u2019s business fraud trial in New York that saw him convicted of 34 felonies earlier this year, will decide on Tuesday whether to overturn the verdict, Reuters reports. The case is the only one of Trump\u2019s four criminal indictments to reach a verdict, and Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on 26 November \u2013 though now that he is headed back to the White House, it is unclear if that will happen.",

V\u00e9lez lead the Primera Divisi\u00f3n with 43 points, while Deportivo Riestra are ninth with 31 points in their maiden campaign in the top flight.",

The supermarket\u2019s chair, James Graham, used his address at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on Tuesday to argue it was wrong to blame supermarkets for rising prices because inflation is a complex, global issue. \u201cIn this context, it has been disappointing to see how cost-of-living issues have been politicised and targeted at supermarket operations,\u201d Graham said in Melbourne. \u201cThis is in sharp contrast to the level of engagement and support of supermarkets by governments and regulators during the Covid lockdown years.\u201d Representatives of Coles and rival Woolworths have appeared at several parliamentary inquiries, and the major chains are the focus of a government-ordered examination of their pricing and business practices, conducted by the competition regulator. Graham said there had been a \u201cwider ambition of some behind those inquiries\u201d to provide answers to global inflation issues. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Australia\u2019s major supermarkets have seen their reputations severely damaged amid rising anger over their ability to generate elevated profits at a time of intensifying living costs, marked by high-cost groceries. Coles recorded a surge in revenue from its groceries business last financial year, which underpinned a robust rise in net profit to $1.1bn. Its larger rival, Woolworths, recorded a $1.7bn net profit result, slightly down on the prior year\u2019s strong result. Coles fell 221 places from Australia\u2019s fourth most trusted brand to one of the country\u2019s most distrusted brands in just a few months, according to results released by researcher Roy Morgan in May. This contrasts with the affinity afforded to the major chains during lockdowns, when they were seen as a lifeline for households. The major chains have faced intense scrutiny over their pricing practices as well as price gouging claims, and have drawn criticism from all political parties before an election expected to be fought on cost-of-living pressures. Guardian Australia analysis has consistently found that profit margins at the major supermarkets are now significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, and have jumped ahead of most of their international peers. Coles uses an alternative, rarely used metric to argue its profits have \u201cremained essentially constant\u201d over the past five years. Graham used his address on Tuesday to defend the company against accusations by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that Coles and rival Woolworths misled shoppers by offering \u201cillusory\u201d discounts on hundreds of common supermarket products. The regulator has argued that the supermarkets briefly increased prices on hundreds of products before placing them in discount promotions. The promotional prices were misleading, according to the regulator, because they were higher than or the same as the product\u2019s regular long-term price before the temporary price spike. But Graham said that suppliers had requested price increases amid an outbreak of inflation, and then the supermarket had run promotions on those prices. \u201cThe subsequent discounts offered to customers on these items were the result of promotional investment by the supplier and Coles, which delivered a reduction in the shelf price at a time when households were under significant cost-of-living pressure,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe are very conscious of the significance of these allegations.

White, 34, is facing a trial that could last three weeks after he pleaded not guilty to one count of manslaughter. White\u2019s barrister, Troy Edwards SC, has told the court that it is not in dispute that the injuries caused by White Tasering Nowland ultimately killed her. But he argued that White\u2019s use of the Taser involved a reasonable use of force. Prosecutor Brett Hatfield SC has argued that White was guilty of manslaughter by way of criminal negligence or by way of an unlawful and dangerous act. Dr Sairita Maistry, a forensic pathologist who performed Nowland\u2019s autopsy, appeared as a witness on Tuesday. She told the court she had concluded Nowland died of blunt force trauma to the head and complications. The court heard the autopsy found Nowland had bruising and bleeds in part of her brain and a laceration that penetrated her brain \u201cMultiple types of blunt force trauma were present,\u201d Maistry told the court. A senior technical officer for the NSW police, who appeared as a witness, told the court that White discharged a visual and sound warning before firing the Taser. Asked by Hatfield what the warning sounded like, he responded: \u201cQuite loud, frightening.\u201d Under cross-examination by Edwards, the officer was asked if the purpose of using a Taser was to briefly incapacitate a person rather than achieve compliance through pain. \u201cWell pain comes with that, with electricity,\u201d the officer responded. Edwards then asked again if that was not the actual purpose of it, and the officer said that was correct. The court also heard witness statements from two elderly men who lived at the nursing home where Nowland was Tasered. They both described how at some point during the evening of the incident, Nowland had entered their rooms. One, a 90-year-old man, said in a statement that he saw two knives in Nowland\u2019s hand, which was rested on her walking frame. He said he attempted to usher her out of the room until a nurse came to help. The other, who was 84 years old, said in his statement that Nowland had waved a knife around while nurses tried to get her out of his room.

      "bodyText": "The average domestic airfare increased by 13% after the collapse of Rex flights between capital cities, the consumer watchdog has found, as Qantas and Virgin\u2019s duopoly surged to 98% market dominance. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) found that since Rex suspended operations across 11 routes and entered administration, the average airfare on all major city routes increased by 13.3% in the quarter to September. The average cheapest economy tickets increased dramatically on routes formerly serviced by Rex: Adelaide-Melbourne jumped 95% to $296; Melbourne-Gold Coast was up 70% to $432; and Canberra-Melbourne rose 54% to $298. Four operators competed on the Melbourne-Gold Coast route before low-cost carrier Bonza\u2019s collapse \u2013 now just two remain. The price index for best discount airfares also rose sharply on several holiday routes, with Canberra-Gold Coast tickets rising 171% over the quarter to $490; Brisbane-Hamilton Island up 122% to $871; and Cairns-Sydney up 43% to $380. Flights are fuller after Rex\u2019s exit, with the number of seats on capital city routes falling by 6% despite passenger numbers remaining stable, according to the ACCC\u2019s latest domestic airline monitoring report. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The ACCC commissioner, Anna Brakey, said the 13% average spike in airfares corresponded with \u201ca less competitive domestic airline sector\u201d. Despite jet fuel prices falling by 41% in the 12 months to September, domestic airfares have remained steady. Meanwhile, average international airfares departing Australia decreased by 5-10% in the same period, the ACCC said, citing data from Flight Centre. Qantas attempted to play down the department data the ACCC report relied on, claiming a surge in demand from a Coldplay concert in Melbourne artificially inflated advertised airfares. \u201cIt is a snapshot of the lowest fares available to purchase on a particular day three weeks prior to travel and does not factor in events which may impact demand and fares,\u201d the Qantas domestic CEO Markus Svensson said. Brakey noted the airline sector had become drastically less competitive following the collapse of Bonza and Rex\u2019s jet operations in 2024. \u201cThis in turn has contributed to higher airfares,\u201d she said. Earlier this year, almost half of all passengers flew on routes with either three or four airline groups, the ACCC said. But by November, no domestic route is serviced by more than two major airline groups, with Qantas Group (including budget operator Jetstar) and Virgin Australia servicing 98% of domestic passengers. The ACCC also cited Treasury research which found Qantas Group\u2019s size means its behaviour \u201cstrongly determines\u201d the overall market. It found Qantas reduces airfares when a rival airline enters one of the routes it operates on. However, when Qantas Group enters Jetstar as a budget option on a route it already services, the company increases the airfares of its premium carrier. \u201cThe domestic airline industry has become even further concentrated, and it may be some time before a new airline emerges to compete on popular services between metropolitan cities, with normal barriers to entry and growth exacerbated by aircraft fleet supply chain issues and pilot and engineer shortages,\u201d Brakey said. Meanwhile, the future of regional carrier Rex remains uncertain. On Tuesday, the government announced an additional $80m to help finance its scaled-back regional operations, as its administration period to find a new buyer is set to be extended until June. The CEO of Accommodation Australia, James Goodwin, said Rex\u2019s woes and the lack of airfare competition was harming the accommodation sector. \u201cConsumers (are) reluctant to make forward bookings despite the government guarantee,\u201d he said. Also on Tuesday, Qantas told a Senate committee it does not expect government reforms proposed to boost competition at Sydney airport will loosen its hold on slots at the airport. The Senate committee is canvassing feedback into reforms proposed by Labor in February to amend laws which limit Sydney airport to 80 take off and landing movements \u2013 known as slots \u2013 per hour. Despite the scarcity of slots, allocation at Sydney airport follows the global standard, which allows an airline to retain its slot so long as it doesn\u2019t cancel a service more than 20% of the time. Scott Charlton, the CEO of Sydney airport, told the committee the global 80:20 rule is actually more generously applied in Australia, because cancellations due to inclement weather are exempt from the threshold. The ACCC and others have long accused Qantas and Virgin of strategically spreading their flight cancellations in and out of Sydney to avoid cancelling any service more than 20% of the time. Qantas and Virgin have consistently denied they engage in so-called \u201cslot hoarding\u201d.

Few wanted to work for Biden and even fewer wanted to move to Wilmington, where the campaign was headquartered. One campaign aide said a few of those who were hired for senior roles were, in reality, years too junior for their responsibilities. Even when Biden was still on the ticket, aides who had run national campaigns noticed that the infrastructure was severely lacking. And when the candidate switch occurred, seasoned people who wanted to come on found it difficult to navigate the existing infrastructure. They believed that it was unlikely that Harris understood the teetering giant she inherited. And even if she did, it would have been too costly timewise to rebuild in 100 days.</p> </blockquote> <p>It also says that despite a jump in voter enthusiasm once Harris entered the race, the campaign was not equipped to make the most of it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Biden campaign was also not ready for the energy and support that rushed in from Democrats when Harris first took over. One operative outside the campaign told NOTUS that during the first hours after Harris got into the race, thousands of donors who contributed to ActBlue were prompted to tip the service after they donated. When asked by Harris aides if a volunteer registration form could replace it to capture the newly interested Democrats, the campaign didn\u2019t have such a form available. (The campaign said the link was added to the site several hours later and able to capture 170,000 volunteers that day.)</p> <p>\u201cThere were things that could not be operationalized because the infrastructure was so limited,\u201d said a second outside ally. Another said it was impossible to scale up at the pace required to keep up with the surge of enthusiastic Democrats wanting to volunteer and give money to Harris, because of the complicated way the campaign was initially stood up by Biden.</p> </blockquote> <p>It also offers some insights into the saga that played out at the Democratic national convention, where party officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/22/democratic-national-convention-uncommitted-delegates-protest-palestine\">blocked the Uncommitted movement\u2019s effort</a> to have a Palestinian speaker address delegates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Senior allies to Harris pushed the campaign and the DNC to have a Palestinian speaker onstage at the August convention, trying to further the goodwill Harris had earned from the Arab and Muslim communities furious over Gaza, but they were denied. One person said it was at the behest of the national security team.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-11T18:01:12.824Z\">at 6.01pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-67323e3f8f088fa22a5bdd23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-11T17:31:05.204Z\">5.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The tone of Joe Biden\u2019s speeches has shifted slightly, with his departure from the White House growing nearer and the election having concluded.</strong></p> <p>Veterans Day is usually a somber and formal occasion, and Biden kept that tone in a brief speech from Arlington national cemetery earlier today, while noting that it would be his last time marking the day as president.</p> <p>\u201cThis the last time I will stand here at Arlington as commander-in-chief,\u201d Biden said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been the greatest honor of my life to lead you, to serve you, care for you, to defend you, just as you defended us, generation, after generation, after generation.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-11T17:35:01.573Z\">at 5.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-67323ae08f08ef6f10472711\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-11T17:13:15.676Z\">5.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>While we still do not know all the names Donald Trump will pick for his cabinet positions, the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/roberttait\">Robert Tait</a> reports that the president-elect wants the chamber\u2019s next Republican leader to allow him to circumvent the normal confirmation process to get his appointees in:</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/11/us-election-briefing-donald-trump-latest-news-updates-putin-house-senate\">demanded</a> that the three frontrunners to lead the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate\">Senate</a> allow him to appoint officials to his new administration without confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill, as a future <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republican</a> government began to take shape the week after his election victory.</p> <p>In a demonstration of his political muscle, the US president-elect urged support for \u201crecess appointments\u201d, which allow the president to make appointments while the Senate is temporarily paused, and can be used to circumvent the confirmation process, which can result in appointments being delayed or blocked.</p> <p>The demand amounted to a full-frontal intervention in this week\u2019s GOP\u2019s election for a new Senate leader to replace Mitch McConnell, the party\u2019s longtime leader who is retiring.

      "bodyText": "Here are the key recent developments: Democratic Representative Mark Takano won reelection to a US House seat representing California on Monday. Takano defeated Republican David Serpa, the Associated Press reports. The congressman is a longtime incumbent, the ranking member on the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs and also sits on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Takano was previously a classroom teacher and a community college trustee. The Wall Street Journal and CNN reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, that Trump has chosen Florida congressman Mike Waltz as his national security adviser. The post does not require Senate confirmation and is highly influential. Waltz is also on the Republican\u2019s China taskforce and has argued the US military is not as prepared as it needs to be if there is conflict in the Indo-Pacific region. Trump is reportedly expected to name Marco Rubio as secretary of state. The New York Times reports that Trump is expected to name Florida senator Marco Rubio his secretary of state. The paper cites three unnamed sources \u201cfamiliar with [Trump\u2019s] thinking\u201d. Donald Trump has announced that he will nominate Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, saying the former New York congressman and gubernatorial candidate will focus on cutting regulations. Stephen Miller, an architect of the hardline immigration policies Donald Trump enacted during his first term, appears to be heading back to the White House. The president-elect has also appointed Tom Homan, who was one of the main officials behind Trump\u2019s family separation policy, as his \u201cborder czar\u201d. Kamala Harris made her first public appearance since her concession speech at a Veterans Day ceremony. The vice-president did not speak at the event, and has since ended her public itinerary for the day after returning to Washington DC. Oklahoma senator Markwayne Mullin is reportedly being considered for a position to lead the Department of Interior or Veterans Affairs under Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Trump\u2019s new \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan made clear in an interview he is prepared to pursue hardline immigration policies. He told Fox News: \u201cIf sanctuary cities don\u2019t want to help us, then get the hell out of the way, because we\u2019re coming.\u201d Democrat Cleo Fields has won Louisiana\u2019s congressional race in a recently redrawn second majority-Black district. That flips a once reliably Republican seat blue, according to the Associated Press. Juan Merchan, the judge presiding over Trump\u2019s business fraud trial in New York that saw him convicted of 34 felonies earlier this year, will decide on Tuesday whether to overturn the verdict, Reuters reports. The case is the only one of Trump\u2019s four criminal indictments to reach a verdict, and Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on 26 November \u2013 though now that he is headed back to the White House, it is unclear if that will happen. This live coverage is ending soon, thanks for following along. Democratic Representative Mark Takano won reelection to a US House seat representing California on Monday. Takano defeated Republican David Serpa, the Associated Press reports. The congressman is a longtime incumbent, the ranking member on the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs and also sits on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Takano was previously a classroom teacher and a community college trustee. The 39th congressional District covers communities in Riverside County southeast of Los Angeles. The Associated Press declared Takano the winner at 9.08pm EST. Vietnam\u2019s Communist Party head To Lam congratulated Donald Trump in a phone call on Monday and the two discussed ways their countries could boost economic ties, the country\u2019s communist party said. The US is Vietnam\u2019s largest export market, and in September last year the two countries upgraded their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest level in Vietnam\u2019s ranking. \u201cVietnam is ready to promote stable and long-term development of bilateral relations for the benefit of the people of the two countries,\u201d Lam said during the call, according to a statement posted on the communist party\u2019s website. The statement said Trump expressed his respect for the relationship with Vietnam and Vietnam-US economic cooperation, and wanted to further promote it. While the New York Times has reported that Donald Trump has picked Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state, the report also says \u201cMr. Trump could still change his mind at the last minute.\u201d Rubio is arguably the most hawkish option on Trump\u2019s shortlist for secretary of state, Reuters reports, and he has in years past advocated for a muscular foreign policy with respect to America\u2019s geopolitical foes, including China, Iran and Cuba. Over recent years he has softened some of his stances to align more closely with Trump\u2019s views. The president-elect accuses past US presidents of leading America into costly and futile wars and has pushed for a more restrained foreign policy. Rubio has said in recent interviews that Ukraine needs to seek a negotiated settlement with Russia rather than focus on regaining all territory that Russia has taken in the last decade. He was also one of 15 Republican senators to vote against a $95 billion military aid package for Ukraine, passed in April. Rubio is also a top China hawk in the Senate. Most notably, he called on the Treasury Department in 2019 to launch a national security review of popular Chinese social media app TikTok\u2019s acquisition of Musical.ly, prompting an investigation and troubled divestment order. As shell-shocked Democrats try to understand why working-class Americans \u2013 once the cornerstone of their political base \u2013 chose a billionaire over them, progressives argue the path forward is to champion \u201cpopular and populist\u201d economic policies. Democratic recriminations have intensified in the nearly seven days since their devastating electoral losses, which may yet deliver a new era of unified Republican governance in Washington, after Donald Trump stormed to a second term while his party easily flipped the Senate and is on the verge of winning a majority in the House. Divisions have deepened, with progressives blaming the party\u2019s embrace of corporate America and swing-state Democrats accusing the left of tarnishing its appeal with ex-urban and rural voters. \u201cClearly not enough voters knew what Democrats were going to do to make their lives better, particularly poor and working-class Americans across this country,\u201d Representative Pramila Jayapal, chair of the congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Monday: The New York Times reports that Trump is expected to name Florida senator Marco Rubio his secretary of state. The paper cites three unnamed sources \u201cfamiliar with [Trump\u2019s] thinking\u201d. Axios reports that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s cenvoy, Ron Dermer, met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday, and that Dermer also met with Trump\u2019s son in law, Jared Kushner. Axios cites to unnamed two Israeli officials and two US officials with knowledge of the meeting, reporting: An Israeli official said the meeting was aimed at passing messages from Netanyahu to Trump and briefing the president-elect on Israel\u2019s plans in Gaza, Lebanon and Iran for the next two months before Trump takes office. \u201cOne of the things the Israelis wanted to sort out with Trump is what are the issues he prefers to see solved before 20 January and what are the issues he prefers the Israelis to wait for him,\u201d a US official said. The US officials mentioned the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire efforts, the plan for Gaza after the war ends and Israeli-Saudi normalization efforts as issues the Israelis want to take Trump\u2019s pulse on. Dermer also met with Jared Kushner, a source with knowledge of the meeting said. On Ukraine, Waltz has said his views have evolved, Reuters reports. After Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, he called for the Biden administration to provide more weapons to Kyiv to help them push back Russian forces. But during an event last month, Waltz said there had to be a reassessment of the United States\u2019 aims in Ukraine. \u201cIs it in America\u2019s interest, are we going to put in the time, the treasure, the resources that we need in the Pacific right now badly?\u201d Waltz asked. Waltz has praised Trump for pushing Nato allies to spend more on defense, but unlike the president-elect has not suggested the United States pull out of the alliance. \u201cLook we can be allies and friends and have tough conversations,\u201d Waltz said last month Reuters has more information about Mike Waltz, who is reportedly Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser. If selected, Waltz will be responsible for briefing Trump on key national security issues and coordinating with different agencies. While slamming the Biden administration for a disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Waltz has publicly praised Trump\u2019s foreign policy views. \u201cDisruptors are often not nice \u2026 frankly our national security establishment and certainly a lot of people that are dug into bad old habits in the Pentagon need that disruption,\u201d Waltz said during an event earlier this year. \u201cDonald Trump is that disruptor,\u201d he said. Waltz was a defense policy director for defense secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates and was elected to Congress in 2018. He is the chair of the House Armed Services subcommittee overseeing military logistics and also on the select committee on intelligence. Waltz is also on the Republican\u2019s China taskforce and has argued the US military is not as prepared as it needs to be if there is conflict in the Indo-Pacific region. In a book published earlier this year titled \u201cHard Truths: Think and Lead Like a Green Beret,\u201d Waltz laid out a five part strategy to preventing war with China, including arming Taiwan faster, re-assuring allies in the Pacific, and modernizing planes and ships. Decision Desk HQ, an organisation that uses models to project how the vote count will unfold, is predicting that the Republicans will win a majority in the House. With a Republican Senate majority already won, this would mean Trump controls both houses of Congress when he takes office in January, making it significantly easier to pass legislation. The Associated Press, which the Guardian relies on to call races, has not yet confirmed that the Republicans have won the four seats needed for a House majority. There is more information now about California Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s plans to meet with the Biden administration this week to discuss zero-emission vehicles and disaster relief. The Democratic governor is leaving for Washington on Monday and will return home Wednesday, his office said. Newsom will also meet with California\u2019s congressional delegation, the Associated Press reports. He is seeking federal approval for state climate rules, a $5.2bn reimbursement for emergency funding during the Covid-19 pandemic and updates to the state\u2019s Medicaid program, along with other priorities. The trip comes days after Newsom called for state lawmakers to convene a special session in December to protect California\u2019s liberal policies ahead of Trump\u2019s return to office in January. Trump then criticized the governor on social media, calling out the high cost of living in California and the state\u2019s homelessness crisis. He said Newsom was \u201cstopping all of the GREAT things that can be done to \u2018Make California Great Again.\u2019\u201d California won against most of the Trump administration\u2019s legal challenges over the state\u2019s environmental and other progressive policies during the Republican\u2019s first term, said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at the University of California San Diego. \u201cThe question is: Has Donald Trump changed the legal playing field so much through the court appointments of his first term that he\u2019ll be able to win on policies in his second term?\u201d he said. As president, Trump appointed more than 230 federal judges, including three justices to the US Supreme Court. A former US army green beret, who now serves as a congressman for Florida, Michael Waltz has solidified his reputation as a leading advocate for a tougher stance on China within the House of Representatives. He played a leading role in sponsoring legislation aimed at reducing the US\u2019s dependence on minerals sourced from China. Waltz is known to have a solid friendship with Trump and has also voiced support for US assistance to Ukraine, while concurrently pushing for greater oversight of UStaxpayer funds allocated to support Kyiv\u2019s defense efforts. He has been tipped in the US media as a contender for either defense secretary or secretary of state. Read the full story here: Waltz is a retired army green beret who has been a leading critic of China. A Trump loyalist, he also served in the national guard as a colonel, has criticised Chinese activity in the Asia-Pacific and has voiced the need for the United States to be ready for a potential conflict in the region. CNN is also reporting Trump\u2019s pick of Waltz as national security adviser \u2013 again citing an unnamed source familiar. The Wall Street Journal is reporting, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, that Trump has chosen Florida congressman Mike Waltz as his national security adviser. The post does not require Senate confirmation and is highly influential. The rightwing Heritage Foundation, which is coordinating Project 2025, has released a statement welcoming the appointment of Tom Homan as \u201cborder czar\u201d in Trump\u2019s administration. Homan is a \u201cvisiting fellow\u201d at the Heritage Foundation. Proposals for a second Trump administration include political purges of the federal government and attacks on minority rights and environmental protections among many other hard-right policy ideas. The Heritage president, Kevin Roberts, said: Tom Homan is precisely the leader America needs to tackle the crisis at our border and restore order. There\u2019s no one better to restore the rule of law within our broken immigration system and ensure that those who have entered our country illegally will be returned home. With decades of dedicated service under both Republican and Democratic administrations, he brings unmatched experience and a steadfast commitment to securing our nation. He knows what it takes to swiftly end Biden\u2019s border invasion. House Democrats are looking into strategies to limit the impact of the Trump administration\u2019s expected policy changes. House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries and other Democratic leaders, including those from minority and progressive caucuses, are working on ways to protect marginalized communities, safeguard existing programs, and accelerate Biden\u2019s executive actions, Axios reported. \u201cWe as Democrats have to roll up our sleeves and get into defense and protection mode,\u201d Democratic representative Delia Ramirez told Axios. Voters in Oakland, California, have ousted Mayor Sheng Thao just two years after she narrowly won office to lead the liberal California Bay Area city. The Associated Press called the race Monday. \u201cThank you for choosing me to serve as your mayor. As the first Hmong American woman to become the mayor of a major American city, it has been the honor of my lifetime,\u201d she said in a statement last week. She committed to ensuring a smooth transition. Thao must vacate the office as soon as election results are certified 5 December and the Oakland city council declares a vacancy at its next meeting, which would be 17 December, Nikki Fortunato Bas, city council president, said in a statement. A special election for a new mayor will be held within 120 days, or roughly four months. Until then, Bas \u2013 as president of the city council \u2013 would serve as interim mayor unless she wins a seat on the Alameda county board of supervisors. As of Monday, Bas was trailing in that race. California governor Gavin Newsom will meet with the Biden administration to discuss zero-emission vehicles and disaster relief, issues that have been targeted in the past by president-elect Donald Trump, the Associated Press reports. The Democratic governor is leaving for Washington on Monday and will return home on Wednesday, his office said. Newsom will also meet with California\u2019s congressional delegation. The trip comes days after Newsom called for state lawmakers to convene a special session in December to protect California\u2019s liberal policies ahead of Trump\u2019s return to office in January. Here\u2019s more on Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency pick, Lee Zeldin: Donald Trump has picked Lee Zeldin, a former New York congressman, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), vowing the appointment will \u201censure fair and swift deregulatory decisions\u201d by the regulator. Trump, who oversaw the rollback of more than 100 environmental rules when he last was US president, said that Zeldin was a \u201ctrue fighter for America First policies\u201d and that \u201che will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet\u201d. Zeldin, a Republican who was in the House of Representatives until last year as a member for a New York district that covers part of Long Island, said the nomination was an \u201chonor\u201d and that he was looking forward to cutting red tape as the EPA administrator. \u201cWe will restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI,\u201d Zeldin wrote on X. \u201cWe will do so while protecting access to clean air and water.\u201d Zeldin, 44, is considered a close Trump ally and ran in a surprisingly close race for New York governor in 2022, before being pipped by Kathy Hochul, a Democrat. During the campaign, Zeldin attacked Hochul\u2019s \u201cfar-left climate agenda\u201d and assailed Democrats for allegedly forcing people to drive electric cars. Read the full story here: Donald Trump has announced that he will nominate Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, saying the former New York congressman and gubernatorial candidate will focus on cutting regulations. Stephen Miller, an architect of the hardline immigration policies Donald Trump enacted during his first term, appears to be heading back to the White House. The president-elect has also appointed Tom Homan, who was one of the main officials behind Trump\u2019s family separation policy, as his \u201cborder czar\u201d. Kamala Harris made her first public appearance since her election loss at a Veterans Day ceremony. The vice-president did not speak at the event, and has since ended her public itinerary for the day after returning to Washington DC. Oklahoma senator Markwayne Mullin is reportedly being considered for a position to lead the Department of Interior or Veterans Affairs under Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Trump\u2019s new \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan made clear in an interview he is prepared to pursue hardline immigration policies. He told Fox News: \u201cIf sanctuary cities don\u2019t want to help us, then get the hell out of the way, because we\u2019re coming.\u201d Democrat Cleo Fields has won Louisiana\u2019s congressional race in a recently redrawn second majority-Black district. That flips a once reliably Republican seat blue, according to the Associated Press. Juan Merchan, the judge presiding over Trump\u2019s business fraud trial in New York that saw him convicted of 34 felonies earlier this year, will decide on Tuesday whether to overturn the verdict, Reuters reports. The case is the only one of Trump\u2019s four criminal indictments to reach a verdict, and Trump is currently scheduled to be sentenced on 26 November \u2013 though now that he is headed back to the White House, it is unclear if that will happen. That\u2019s all from me, Coral Murphy Marcos, for today. My colleague Helen Sullivan will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from the US elections. The Washington Post editorial board published an op-ed urging senators to resist pressure from president-elect Donald Trump to allow recess appointments, which would let him bypass the Senate confirmation process for his appointees. The op-ed says: Mr. Trump wants opportunities to circumvent the Senate confirmation process even though Republicans will have a clear majority of seats \u2014 at least 52, according to the latest count \u2014 signaling his intention to elevate appointees whom even some Republicans cannot tolerate. Senators should refuse to squander their constitutional prerogatives in this way. Democrat Cleo Fields has won Louisiana\u2019s congressional race in a recently redrawn second majority-Black district. That flips a once reliably Republican seat blue, according to the Associated Press. His win marks a major victory for Democrats in a state where they will hold two congressional seats for the first time in a decade. This is only the second time in nearly 50 years that a Democrat has won in Louisiana\u2019s sixth Congressional district, where new political boundaries were drawn by lawmakers earlier this year. Asked about criticism that the party is too focused on cultural issues and not economic issues, progressives pushed back. Greg Casar said the American people made clear they want a Democratic party that will be \u201cchampions for everyday people, for working people and for civil rights\u201d. Sarah McBride, the congresswoman-elect from Delaware who made history as the first openly trans person elected to Congress, said she ran a campaign that was centered on the economic pain voters in her state were feeling. \u201cWhat I was hearing was that the American Dream is increasingly unaffordable and inaccessible,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was campaigning on. I didn\u2019t run on my identity, but my identity was not a secret.\u201d Delaware is the Philadelphia media market, she noted, meaning many voters in the state saw the anti-trans ads that the Trump campaign ran against Kamala Harris and still cast their ballots for her. \u201cThe party that was focused on culture wars, the party that was focused on trans people, was the Republican Party. It was Donald Trump. It was the $100m, $200m that they spent on television ads,\u201d she said. She continued: \u201cWe have to be crystal clear as we move forward, that we are going to call out the hypocrisy of Donald Trump, of disingenuously claiming that he is a fighter for working people, when his agenda is pro-higher cost and pro-inflation,\u201d she said. Congresswoman Elise Stefanik said she was \u201cdeeply humbled\u201d in a statement accepting her appointment to serve in Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet as ambassador to the United Nations. The New York Republican congresswoman said: President Trump\u2019s historic landslide election has given hope to the American people and is a reminder that brighter days are ahead \u2013 both at home and abroad. America continues to be the beacon of the world, but we expect and must demand that our friends and allies be strong partners in the peace we seek. Representative Pramila Jayapal said House progressives are prepared to lead a \u201chistoric resistance\u201d to a second Trump presidency and a potential Republican governing trifecta in Washington. Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, acknowledged that the \u201cfight ahead is going to be hard\u201d but said Republicans did not have a plan to lower costs and expand healthcare \u2013 issues that voters are now expecting them to deliver on. She pointed to the passage of \u201cpopular, populist initiatives\u201d like raising the minimum wage and paid sick leave, which red states voters approved. As shellshocked Democrats begin to pick up the pieces, progressives say their freshman class \u2013 among them the first openly trans congresswoman and a protege of Kamala Harris \u2013 show the path to winning back working-class voters who sided with a billionaire over their party. \u201cThey said it\u2019s not immigrants that are driving up housing prices, it\u2019s Wall Street. It\u2019s not trans people that are causing your worsening healthcare. It\u2019s big pharma. These are the members that are authentic, that are proud, that are from their communities, that have promised to deliver to their communities, and are unafraid of standing up to the real powers that be, and that\u2019s the core of who the Democratic Party is,\u201d said the Texas representative Greg Casar, the Congressional Progressive Caucus whip. Oklahoma senator Markwayne Mullin is reportedly being considered for a position to lead the Department of Interior or Veterans Affairs under Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Mullin led the Trump campaign\u2019s Native American outreach and is considered for the Department of Interior given his background and expertise, according to NOTUS. The senator was appointed to the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 2023. He\u2019s also advocated for tribal sovereignty and for the US government to uphold the treaties with Native American tribes. President-elect Donald Trump has confirmed the New York Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik as his pick to serve as the US ambassador to the United Nations under his administration. \u201cShe will be an incredible Ambassador to the United Nations, delivering Peace through Strength and America First National Security policies!,\u201d reads a statement from Trump. Trump praised Stefanik\u2019s Harvard education and her early endorsement of his presidency. He also pointed to her efforts against antisemitism on college campuses amid the war on Gaza. In response to the news that Tom Homan would be serving as president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d, Congresswoman Delia Ramirez said: \u201cWe know exactly who Tom Homan is. He is the architect of the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that separated thousands of migrant children from their parents with no plan for reunification,\u201d said Ramirez, who\u2019s also the founder of the Congressional Caucus on Global Migration. \u201cHe demonstrates cold disregard for the U.S. citizenship of the at least 4 million children with an undocumented parent, suggesting to keep families together, they should be deported together.\u201d Earlier today Donald Trump appointed as his \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan, a former acting chief of immigration and customs enforcement (Ice) who played a role in instituting Trump\u2019s family separation policy. Homan was on Fox News earlier today, where he made clear he was prepared to pursue hardline immigration policies in the role, which is tasked with securing US borders. Here\u2019s what he had to say: Donald Trump has announced that he will nominate Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, saying the former New York congressman and gubernatorial candidate will focus on cutting regulations. \u201cLee, with a very strong legal background, has been a true fighter for America First policies. He will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet. He will set new standards on environmental review and maintenance, that will allow the United States to grow in a healthy and well-structured way,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cI have known Lee Zeldin for a long time, and have watched him handle, brilliantly, some extremely difficult and complex situations. I am very proud to have him in the Trump Administration, where he will quickly prove to be a great contributor!\u201d Lee Zeldin, a Republican former congressman who ran unsuccessfully for governor of New York, will be Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, the New York Post reports. \u201cI am deeply honored to have been asked by President Trump to serve in his Cabinet. As EPA Administrator, we will restore American energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, make the United States the global leader of Artificial Intelligence advancement, and slash the red tape holding back American workers from upward economic mobility,\u201d Zeldin told the Post. \u201cWe will accomplish all this while conserving our environment, protecting access to clean air and water, and keeping the American people healthy. I look forward to contributing to President Trump\u2019s agenda to build a more prosperous future for our nation.\u201d We do not know yet too much more yet about how Zeldin would lead an agency where staffers fear their mandate to fight air pollution and the climate crisis will be undercut by the incoming Republican administration. Here\u2019s more about that: Kamala Harris appeared alongside Joe Biden earlier today at a ceremony to mark Veterans Day at Arlington national cemetery in Virginia. The vice-president did not speak at the event, and has since ended her public itinerary for the day after returning to Washington DC. Here are photos of her appearance alongside Biden, which was their first joint appearance since Harris lost the presidential election: Wiley Nickel, an outgoing Democratic congressman representing North Carolina, has an idea for keeping his party relevant in the upcoming Trump years. It\u2019s something our British readers know all about. Nickel made his proposal public, in the Washington Post: Here\u2019s an idea for how to organize our opposition: We need to borrow from our British friends and appoint a shadow cabinet to fight back against the worst excesses of a second Trump administration. \u2026 So, what would a shadow cabinet look like here in the United States? We have an amazing wealth of talent on the Democratic side of the aisle in Congress \u2014 people loyal to the Constitution and ready to serve in opposition. Democratic leaders Hakeem Jeffries (New York) in the House and Charles E. Schumer (New York) in the Senate could appoint 26 members of Congress to go one-on-one with each member of Trump\u2019s Cabinet. If Trump attempts to weaponize the justice system against his political opponents, we could see Sen. Adam Schiff (California), as our shadow attorney general, arguing against replacing our independent prosecutors with Trump loyalists. If Trump seeks to eliminate the Education Department, Rep. Jahana Hayes (Connecticut), a former teacher of the year, could step up as shadow education secretary to loudly defend it. If Trump tries to hand Ukraine and much of Eastern Europe to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Rep. Gregory W. Meeks (New York), as shadow secretary of state, could be a strong voice in support of maintaining international relationships and protecting democracy at home and abroad. In response to the news that Stephen Miller would be returning to the White House under Donald Trump, co-president of progressive consumer advocacy group Public Citizen Robert Weissman had this to say: Stephen Miller\u2019s record is one of cruelty, xenophobia, racism \u2013 and there\u2019s little doubt he is set to be appointed Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy precisely because of that record. He will enable Donald Trump\u2019s worst tendencies and singularly unqualified to lead the policy agenda for the White House. Greece\u2019s prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotaki spoke with Donald Trump on Monday to congratulate him on his election victory, Mitsotakis\u2019s office said. Mitsotakis invited Trump to visit Greece, while also underlining the importance of a strategic partnership between the two countries, his office said in a statement. The Greek leader also told the US president-elect that he sought close cooperation with the US administration, his office said. Conservative attorney Mark Paoletta, who is helping plan Donald Trump\u2019s transition, warned lawyers at the justice department that those who refuse to work on advancing Trump\u2019s agenda should resign or risk being fired. Paoletta, in a post on X responding to a Politico story on widespread fear among the DoJ, wrote: \u201cOnce the decision is made to move forward, career employees are required to implement the President\u2019s plan.\u201d Paoletta is reportedly being considered for the role of attorney general under the Trump administration. Others under consideration include Missouri senator Eric Schmitt, Utah senator Mike Lee; Trump\u2019s former director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, and Matt Whitaker, who was acting attorney general under Trump, according to NBC News. Bob Casey, the Democratic incumbent Pennsylvania senator, has refused to concede the race to David McCormick, arguing that \u201cPennsylvanians deserve to have their voices heard.\u201d In a statement on Monday, Casey\u2019s campaign spokesperson said: \u201cAs state officials have made clear, counties across Pennsylvania are still processing ballots and need time to tabulate remaining votes. There are more than 100,000 ballots left to be counted \u2013 including tens of thousands of provisional ballots in counties favorable to Senator Casey \u2013 and just yesterday, officials reaffirmed that tens of thousands of mail ballots remain.\u201d The US climate envoy, John Podesta, has said the fight \u201cfor a cleaner, safer\u201d planet will not stop under a re-elected Donald Trump even if some progress is reversed. \u201cAlthough under Donald Trump\u2019s leadership the US federal government placed climate-related actions on the back burner, efforts to prevent climate change remain a commitment in the US and will confidently continue,\u201d Podesta, who is leading the Biden administration\u2019s delegation at the annual talks, said at the Cop29 UN climate talks on Monday as they opened in Baku, Azerbaijan. Trump has pledged to deregulate the energy sector, allow the oil and gas industry to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d, and pull the US from the Paris climate agreement, which committed countries to taking steps to avoid the worst impacts of the crisis. Yet while Trump will try to reverse progress, \u201cthis is not the end of our fight for a cleaner, safer planet\u201d, Podesta said. Stephen Miller, an architect of the hardline immigration policies Donald Trump enacted during his first term, appears to be heading back to the White House. While the appointment has not been officially announced yet, CNN reports that Miller will serve as Trump\u2019s deputy chief of staff, and JD Vance publicly congratulated Miller on getting the job. The president-elect has also appointed Tom Homan, who was one of the main officials behind Trump\u2019s family separation policy, as his \u201cborder czar\u201d. Homan has spent much of the past four years promising to carry out mass deportations, and will now be in a position to make good on that. Here\u2019s what else has happened today: Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign was hobbled by Joe Biden\u2019s failed re-election bid, and by a strategy that failed to preserve the momentum generated once the vice-president launched her bid for the White House, Notus reports. Harris and Biden appeared together at Arlington national cemetery to mark Veterans Day. In a brief and somber speech, Biden noted this would be his last time celebrating the occasion as president. Who else might make it into Trump\u2019s cabinet? Many names have been floated, but only a few will be chosen. Here\u2019s what we know. Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign was felled by an ineffective strategy that failed to preserve the momentum she generated upon entering the presidential race, while also being hobbled by Joe Biden\u2019s aborted attempt to win a second term, Notus reports. Expect lots of Harris campaign postmortems to be published in the days and weeks to come as Democrats look for lessons in a campaign that was started under Biden, passed at the last minute to Harris, and ultimately failed to prevent Donald Trump from returning to the White House. The story, based on interviews with former campaign staffers and others close to the effort, begins by noting that Biden\u2019s campaign struggled to hire because of the president\u2019s unpopularity: Multiple sources who spoke with NOTUS lamented how difficult it was to hire staff at the inception of Biden\u2019s reelection campaign. Few wanted to work for Biden and even fewer wanted to move to Wilmington, where the campaign was headquartered. One campaign aide said a few of those who were hired for senior roles were, in reality, years too junior for their responsibilities. Even when Biden was still on the ticket, aides who had run national campaigns noticed that the infrastructure was severely lacking. And when the candidate switch occurred, seasoned people who wanted to come on found it difficult to navigate the existing infrastructure. They believed that it was unlikely that Harris understood the teetering giant she inherited. And even if she did, it would have been too costly timewise to rebuild in 100 days. It also says that despite a jump in voter enthusiasm once Harris entered the race, the campaign was not equipped to make the most of it: The Biden campaign was also not ready for the energy and support that rushed in from Democrats when Harris first took over. One operative outside the campaign told NOTUS that during the first hours after Harris got into the race, thousands of donors who contributed to ActBlue were prompted to tip the service after they donated. When asked by Harris aides if a volunteer registration form could replace it to capture the newly interested Democrats, the campaign didn\u2019t have such a form available. (The campaign said the link was added to the site several hours later and able to capture 170,000 volunteers that day.) \u201cThere were things that could not be operationalized because the infrastructure was so limited,\u201d said a second outside ally. Another said it was impossible to scale up at the pace required to keep up with the surge of enthusiastic Democrats wanting to volunteer and give money to Harris, because of the complicated way the campaign was initially stood up by Biden. It also offers some insights into the saga that played out at the Democratic national convention, where party officials blocked the Uncommitted movement\u2019s effort to have a Palestinian speaker address delegates: Senior allies to Harris pushed the campaign and the DNC to have a Palestinian speaker onstage at the August convention, trying to further the goodwill Harris had earned from the Arab and Muslim communities furious over Gaza, but they were denied. One person said it was at the behest of the national security team. The tone of Joe Biden\u2019s speeches has shifted slightly, with his departure from the White House growing nearer and the election having concluded. Veterans Day is usually a somber and formal occasion, and Biden kept that tone in a brief speech from Arlington national cemetery earlier today, while noting that it would be his last time marking the day as president. \u201cThis the last time I will stand here at Arlington as commander-in-chief,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s been the greatest honor of my life to lead you, to serve you, care for you, to defend you, just as you defended us, generation, after generation, after generation.\u201d While we still do not know all the names Donald Trump will pick for his cabinet positions, the Guardian\u2019s Robert Tait reports that the president-elect wants the chamber\u2019s next Republican leader to allow him to circumvent the normal confirmation process to get his appointees in: Donald Trump has demanded that the three frontrunners to lead the Senate allow him to appoint officials to his new administration without confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill, as a future Republican government began to take shape the week after his election victory. In a demonstration of his political muscle, the US president-elect urged support for \u201crecess appointments\u201d, which allow the president to make appointments while the Senate is temporarily paused, and can be used to circumvent the confirmation process, which can result in appointments being delayed or blocked. The demand amounted to a full-frontal intervention in this week\u2019s GOP\u2019s election for a new Senate leader to replace Mitch McConnell, the party\u2019s longtime leader who is retiring. The three men tipped to lead the Senate \u2013 Rick Scott, John Thune and John Cornyn \u2013 all quickly agreed to Trump\u2019s request. One of the biggest decisions Donald Trump has to make is who will be his attorney general. The appointee will play a leading role in prosecuting the president-elect\u2019s opponents, should Trump make good on his promise to do so. Semafor reports that one potential candidate for the job has dropped out: Vice-president-elect JD Vance has congratulated immigration hardliner JD Vance on being appointed to a top White House position by Donald Trump: Unusually, Trump has not announced the appointment, and Vance is instead reacting to CNN\u2019s reporting that Miller\u2019s appointment is imminent. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are at Arlington national cemetery in Virginia, where they have just laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in honor of Veterans Day. It is their first joint public appearance since Kamala Harris lost last week\u2019s presidential election to Donald Trump. In addition to pursuing hardline immigration policies, Stephen Miller was earlier this year reported to be putting together a plan to tackle \u201canti-white racism\u201d, the Guardian\u2019s Martin Pengelly reports. Expect to hear more about that, if Miller is indeed appointed to a job in Donald Trump\u2019s second administration: The anti-immigration extremist, white nationalist and former Trump White House adviser Stephen Miller is helping drive a plan to tackle supposed \u201canti-white racism\u201d if Donald Trump returns to power next year, Axios reported. \u201cLongtime aides and allies \u2026 have been laying legal groundwork with a flurry of lawsuits and legal complaints \u2013 some of which have been successful,\u201d Axios said on Monday. Should Trump return to power, Axios said, Miller and other aides plan to \u201cdramatically change the government\u2019s interpretation of civil rights-era laws to focus on \u2018anti-white racism\u2019 rather than discrimination against people of colour\u201d. Such an effort would involve \u201celiminating or upending\u201d programmes meant to counter racism against non-white groups. The US supreme court, dominated 6-3 by rightwing justices after Trump installed three, recently boosted such efforts by ruling against race-based affirmative action in college admissions. America First Legal, a group founded by Miller and described by him as the right\u2019s \u201clong-awaited answer\u201d to the American Civil Liberties Union, is helping drive plans for a second Trump term, Axios said. In 2021, an AFL suit blocked implementation of a $29bn Covid-era Small Business Administration programme that prioritised helping restaurants owned by women, veterans and people from socially and economically disadvantaged groups. Miller called that ruling \u201cthe first, but crucial, step towards ending government-sponsored racial discrimination\u201d. Stephen Miller, an architect of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, is expected to return to the White House as his deputy chief of staff for policy, CNN reports, citing two sources familiar with the plan. Here\u2019s more, from CNN: Miller, who served as a senior adviser to Trump during his first administration and has been a leading advocate for more restrictive immigration policy, is expected to take on an expanded role in the president-elect\u2019s second term. Miller is also a lead architect of Trump\u2019s plans for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. He has said that a second Trump administration would seek a tenfold increase in the number of deportations to more than one million per year. \u201cPresident-elect Trump will begin making decisions on who will serve in his second administration soon. Those decisions will be announced when they are made,\u201d Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told CNN. With congresswoman Elise Stefanik heading to the United Nations and former acting Ice chief Tom Homan tasked with border security, who else may Donald Trump appoint to his cabinet? The Guardian\u2019s Lorenzo Tondo has a look at the reported contenders for top roles: With Democrats heading for the minority in the Senate, some party thinkers are encouraging liberal supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayor to step down. That would clear the way for Democrats \u2013 in their final weeks controlling the Senate \u2013 to confirm a younger replacement for the 70-year-old, and perhaps prevent Republicans from making any new appointments to the court. But CNN reports that the justice has no plans to retire: \u201cShe\u2019s in great health, and the court needs her now more than ever,\u201d said one person close to the justice. Over the weekend, Bernie Sanders, an influential progressive senator who is allied with Democrats, poured cold water on Sotomayor stepping down, saying he did not think it would be a good idea: The war in the Middle East was a major issue in last week\u2019s election, with many Muslims and Arab Americans incensed by Joe Biden\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s invasions of Gaza and Lebanon. That indignation played a part in handing Michigan, a swing state that\u2019s home to some of the largest communities of the two groups in the United States, to Donald Trump. The Associated Press reports that Trump has become the first Republican candidate in 24 years to win the city of Dearborn, where almost half of residents are of Arab descent, and many did not trust Kamala Harris to restrain Israel. Here\u2019s more from the AP: In Dearborn, where nearly half of the 110,000 residents are of Arab descent, Vice President Kamala Harris received over 2,500 fewer votes than Trump, who became the first Republican presidential candidate since former President George W. Bush in 2000 to win the city. Harris also lost neighboring Dearborn Heights to Trump, who in his previous term as president banned travel from several mostly-Muslim countries. Harris lost the presidential vote in two Detroit-area cities with large Arab American populations after months of warnings from local Democrats about the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s unwavering support for Israel in the war in Gaza. Some said they backed Trump after he visited a few days before the election, mingling with customers and staff at a Lebanese-owned restaurant and reassuring people that he would find a way to end the violence in the Middle East. Others, including Amen, were unable to persuade themselves to back the former president. She said many Arab Americans felt Harris got what she deserved but aren\u2019t \u201cjubilant about Trump.\u201d \u201cWhether it\u2019s Trump himself or the people who are around him, it does pose a great deal of concern for me,\u201d Amen said. \u201cBut at the end of the day when you have two evils running, what are you left with?\u201d As it became clear late Tuesday into early Wednesday that Trump would not only win the presidency but likely prevail in Dearborn, the mood in metro Detroit\u2019s Arab American communities was described by Dearborn City Council member Mustapha Hammoud as \u201csomber.\u201d And yet, he said, the result was \u201cnot surprising at all.\u201d The shift in Dearborn \u2014 where Trump received nearly 18,000 votes compared with Harris\u2019 15,000 \u2014 marks a startling change from just four years ago when Joe Biden won in the city by a nearly 3-to-1 margin. The Republican House majority leader, Steve Scalise, is celebrating congresswoman Elise Stefanik\u2019s appointment as Donald Trump\u2019s UN ambassador. Scalise said, in a statement: President Trump has made a fantastic choice with Conference Chair Elise Stefanik for US Ambassador to the United Nations. I will miss Elise, who has become a dear friend in the House as well as a respected leader as our Republican Conference Chair. She is extremely qualified for this new role in public service, and the House\u2019s loss will be a huge gain for the Trump Administration and the country. There is nobody better to represent President Trump\u2019s foreign policy and America\u2019s values at the United Nations than Elise Stefanik. Stefanik\u2019s departure from the House means she will need to be replaced in a special election, but her district leans Republican, meaning Democrats will have a tough road to get one of their lawmakers in. The GOP took control of the Senate in last week\u2019s elections, by winning Democratic-held seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio and Pennsylvania. But ballots are still being counted in Pennsylvania, and Politico reports that Chuck Schumer, the Democrat who remains the Senate majority leader until the next Congress begins, is not inviting Republican David McCormick to new member orientation until his win is confirmed. He is doing the same for Ruben Gallego, the Democratic Senate candidate in Arizona, where ballots are also still being counted, but Republicans are nonetheless calling foul over McCormick\u2019s exclusion. Here\u2019s more, from Politico: On Wednesday, Republican senators will vote for the next majority leader, who will begin serving in January. The three front-runners are Florida Sen. Rick Scott, South Dakota Sen. John Thune and Texas Sen. John Cornyn. When asked on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d who he would support for majority leader, McCormick told host Maria Bartiromo, \u201cI\u2019m still just now spending time with each of the candidates, and I will have an opportunity to vote this week.\u201d He added that he would not speak about the pros and cons of each candidate, but emphasized the need to be \u201cin step with President Trump.\u201d In response to Schumer\u2019s decision to prevent McCormick from participating, Republican politicians have been speaking out, including the majority leader-hopefuls. \u201cThe idea that Schumer would not allow him to participate in Senate orientation is beyond unacceptable,\u201d Thune wrote in a social media post Sunday. \u201cThe voters of Pennsylvania have spoken. Looking forward to having Dave\u2019s strong voice in the Senate Republican Conference.\u201d Scott called the move \u201cdisgusting\u201d and said, \u201cThey did the same thing to me after I beat a Democrat in 2018. We have to fight this!\u201d Cornyn called on Casey to concede and reposted a statement by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), which said: \u201cI can\u2019t think of another time when a senator-elect has been excluded from the Senate\u2019s week-long orientation for new senators.\u201d McCormick argued that there\u2019s no way Casey can gain enough votes at this point to defeat him. \u201cMathematically, there\u2019s no path for Senator Casey to win,\u201d McCormick said on Fox. \u201cCurrently, I\u2019m up by something like 40,000 votes, which is a very significant margin. And ultimately, Senator Casey\u2019s going to have to decide when he\u2019s willing to acknowledge that.\u201d Juan Merchan, the judge presiding over Donald Trump\u2019s business fraud trial in New York that saw him convicted of 34 felonies earlier this year, will tomorrow decide whether to overturn the verdict, Reuters reports. At issue is the supreme court ruling that gives presidents immunity for certain acts. Here\u2019s more: Justice Juan Merchan has said he will make his decision by Tuesday. It is the first of two pivotal choices that the judge must make after Trump\u2019s Nov. 5 election victory. Merchan also must decide whether to go ahead with sentencing Trump on Nov. 26 as currently scheduled. Legal experts have said sentencing now is unlikely to happen ahead of Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration. A favorable ruling by Merchan for Trump on the immunity question or a sentencing delay would pave the way for him to return to the White House largely unencumbered by any of the four criminal cases that once appeared to threaten his ambitions to win back the White House. Officials at the U.S. Justice Department are assessing how to wind down the two federal criminal cases brought against Trump by Special Counsel Jack Smith due to its longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting president. A separate case in Georgia involving state criminal charges concerning Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss remains in limbo. Trump, 78, pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing in all four cases, which he portrayed as political persecutions by allies of Democratic President Joe Biden designed to thwart his campaign. \u201cIt is now abundantly clear that Americans want an immediate end to the weaponization of our justice system,\u201d Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement on Friday. The case is the only one of Trump\u2019s four criminal indictments to reach a verdict, and Trump is currently scheduled to be sentenced on 26 November \u2013 though now that he is headed back to the White House, it is unclear if that will happen. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will both take part in ceremonies honoring Veterans Day today. The presidents will host an event with veterans and members of the military at the White House at 9am, then head to Arlington national cemetery for a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Harris will join him for that, and will be there for the speech he has scheduled for 11.15am at a cemetery amphitheater. The UK\u2019s defence secretary, John Healey, has said Donald Trump is expected to support Ukraine for \u201cas long as it takes to prevail\u201d over Russia, the PA news agency reports. Healey said he believes the incoming administration will be \u201csteadfast\u201d in backing Kyiv, downplaying concerns that the US will turn away from Nato under the president-elect. But he cautioned that any potential peace talks were for Ukraine alone to call after a senior Trump adviser suggested Washington would be focused on resolving the conflict rather than helping the country regain territory. Washington has provided tens of billions of dollars worth of aid to Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February 2022, funding that Trump has repeatedly criticised. The UK\u2019s prime minister Keir Starmer is meeting his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in Paris today to discuss Ukraine on Armistice Day. My colleague Andrew Sparrow has more on the UK government\u2019s relationship with Trump in this post in the UK politics blog. After several years of recovery after the tumult of Donald Trump\u2019s last administration, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is now bracing itself for even deeper cuts to staff numbers and to work protecting Americans from pollution and the climate crisis as Trump prepares to return to the White House. When he was last president, Trump gutted more than 100 environmental rules and vowed to only leave a \u201clittle bit of the EPA\u201d left \u201cbecause you can\u2019t destroy business\u201d, prompting hundreds of agency staff to leave amid a firestorm of political interference and retaliation against civil servants. An even greater exodus is expected this time, with staff fearing they are frontline targets in what could be the biggest upheaval in the agency\u2019s 50-year history. \u201cPeople are anxious and apprehensive, [and] we are preparing for the worst,\u201d said Nicole Cantello, an EPA water specialist and president of AFGE Local 704, representing agency staff in the midwest. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a taste of what will happen and how we were targeted last time,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the emails and texts I\u2019m getting, a lot of people will leave. So many things could be thrown at us that it could destroy the EPA as we know it.\u201d Cantello said the union is already seeking to shield itself by departing its office at the agency\u2019s Washington headquarters, ditching the use of EPA computers and divorcing union dues from the federal payroll system. \u201cWe have to try to protect our people by being independent of the agency,\u201d she said. \u201cBut folks will have to take stock over whether they can endure the attacks that are going to come their way.\u201d Such anxiety stems from the experiences of the last Trump administration, which removed a broad sweep of environmental regulations and attempted to cut the agency\u2019s budget by a third. You can read the full story by my colleagues, Oliver Milman and Tom Perkins, here: The US president, Joe Biden, and President-elect Donald Trump will meet on Wednesday at the White House on Biden\u2019s invitation. Trump, 78, will take office on 20 January. Biden, who has accused Trump of attempting to undermine the US\u2019s system of government, has said he is determined to ensure a smooth transition of power. \u201cAt President Biden\u2019s invitation, President Biden and President-elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday,\u201d press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. \u201cI\u2019m going to see him on Wednesday,\u201d Biden told reporters on Saturday, when asked whether Trump was a threat to democracy. Biden, a Democrat, had initially sought reelection but dropped out of the race in July after a disastrous debate against Trump. His decision to stay in the race for so long \u2013 despite concerns about his cognitive functioning \u2013 left the party without enough time to hold an open primary, something some Democrats have blamed for Kamala Harris\u2019 defeat in the presidential election. Republicans are close to clinching control of the US House of Representatives, a critical element for Donald Trump to advance his political agenda when he returns to the White House in January. The Republicans already have a majority in the Senate and need to win just a few seats to take control of the 435-member House (a party needs 218 seats to win a House majority). According to our latest tally, Republicans have 214 seats, while the Democrats have 203. Keeping hold of the House would give Republicans sweeping powers to potentially enact a broad agenda of tax and spending cuts, energy deregulation and border security controls. As well as giving the party the power to initiate spending legislation, control of the House would allow Republicans to launch impeachment proceedings against officials. Many families risk being torn apart if Trump follows through with his mass deportation promise. My colleague Justo Robles reports on the devastating human cost this policy would have on millions of people across the US. Here is an extract from his story: Immigration experts acknowledge that Trump\u2019s notion will require major infrastructure, including new detentions camps, and they expect him to do what he says he plans to do. \u201cThere are a lot of people in our community living in mixed-status families, so mass deportations are a direct threat,\u201d said Lindsay Toczylowski, executive director of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, a social justice law firm based in Los Angeles that serves people facing deportation. She added: \u201cThe [2016] Trump administration has shown a disdain for immigrant children in the past, so it\u2019s going to require organizers working with lawyers, working with communities, and we intend to challenge him in the courts\u201d Advocates warned that in his attempt to \u201csecure the border\u201d, Trump was likely to fulfill his pledge to restore many of his controversial immigration programs, such as the policy known as Remain in Mexico, which Joe Biden ended. The program forced people seeking asylum in the US to wait in Mexico while their claims were processed. Between January 2019 and June 2021, 74,000 asylum seekers were sent back to Mexico, vulnerable to kidnapping, extortion and sexual violence. \u201cWe believe that the program violated US law because of the lack of allowing people access to counsel, so we will continue to challenge that program,\u201d Toczylowski said. In an interview on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d Tom Homan said the military would not be rounding up and arresting immigrants in the country illegally and that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would move to implement Trump\u2019s plans in a \u201chumane manner\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a well-targeted, planned operation conducted by the men of ICE. The men and women of ICE do this daily. They\u2019re good at it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we go out there, we\u2019re going to know who we\u2019re looking for. We most likely know where they\u2019re going to be, and it\u2019s going to be done in a humane manner.\u201d Trump has promised that his campaign pledge to expel millions of undocumented immigrants would be implemented come what may. US president-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday that Tom Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), will be in charge of the country\u2019s borders in his new administration. Homan\u2019s areas of control will include \u201cthe southern border, the northern border, all maritime, and aviation security\u201d, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. Trump added that \u201cborder czar\u201d Homan will be in charge of the deportation of illegal immigrants. Homan, who served in Trump administration for a year and a half during his first term, is also a contender for secretary of homeland security. Mass deportations \u2013 and housing migrants in camps \u2013 were a key part of Trump\u2019s pitch on the campaign trail. Trump spoke favorably of Homan, telling Fox News host Harris Faulkner in July: \u201cI have Tom Homan lined up, we have the greatest people.\u201d A Heritage fellow and Project 2025 author, Homan told this summer\u2019s Republican national convention in Milwaukee he had \u201ca message for the millions of illegal aliens who Joe Biden allowed to enter the country in violation of federal law \u2013 start packing, because you\u2019re going home.\u201d At a panel on immigration policy in July, Homan said: \u201cTrump comes back in January, I\u2019ll be on his heels coming back, and I will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen.\u201d You can read more here: The New York Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik has accepted President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s offer to be the US ambassador to the United Nations, a role once held by former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley. Stefanik, a Trump-skeptic turned Trump-ally, is the House Republican Conference chair, making her the fourth-ranking House Republican. \u201cI am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,\u201d Trump said in a statement to the New York Post. As my colleague Peter Stone notes in this profile on Stefanik, the 40-year-old was among the first House members to endorse Trump\u2019s 2024 re-election bid and has mirrored Trump\u2019s false claims about his 2020 defeat and the January 6 insurrection by his allies who attacked the Capitol. \u201cI am truly honored to earn President Trump\u2019s nomination to serve in his Cabinet as US Ambassador to the United Nations,\u201d Stefanik said in a statement confirming her acceptance of Trump\u2019s offer. \u201cDuring my conversation with President Trump, I shared how deeply humbled I am to accept his nomination and that I look forward to earning the support of my colleagues in the United States Senate.\u201d \u201cAmerica continues to be the beacon of the world, but we expect and must demand that our friends and allies be strong partners in the peace we seek,\u201d she added. An official announcement has not yet been made yet about the UN job, which is a role that comes with offices and a residence in New York. France\u2019s foreign minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, has said the incoming US administration under Donald Trump should not be \u201cpre-judged\u201d. As we have been reporting, there is speculation that Trump may reduce military support to Kyiv in office, despite Ukrainian soldiers desperately needing weapons to fend off Russian attacks. Trump has refused to elaborate when asked whether he thinks Zelenskyy should cede territory to Russia in negotiations to end the war, which he has characterised as a drag on American resources. Stressing the need to continue supporting Kyiv, Barrot said Ukraine should determine the timing and conditions for engaging in any negotiation process. Barrot told the Paris Peace Forum: Facing the speculation on what could be the positions or initiatives of the new US administration, I think that we absolutely should not prejudge and we have to give it (the administration) time\u2026 Ukraine, and beyond that the international community, would have too much to lose if Russia imposed the law of the strongest. During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would end the war, but did not specify how. You can read more about how Trump might handle the war in Ukraine in this explainer. France\u2019s defence minister said on Sunday that Paris was sending a new batch of long-range missiles to Ukraine so it could strike behind Russian lines. \u201cPresident Volodymr Zelenskyy has met President-elect Donald Trump numerous times and I don\u2019t doubt that a strong relationship will be established with the new administration,\u201d Barrot said. The claims and counter-claims over the disputed call come amid trepidation in Europe over Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine. This morning, the British and French leaders are meeting in Paris to observe Armistice Day events but will also be discussing the implications of Trump\u2019s victory. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering UK political news and reports on the UK defence secretary John Healey talking down the risk that Trump\u2019s re-election poses to Ukraine rather than talking it up. Healey said he did not expect the US to turn away from Nato under Trump. He told Sky News: I don\u2019t expect the US to turn away from Nato. They recognise the importance of the alliance. They recognise the importance of avoiding further conflict in Europe. Healey said US support for Nato \u201cgoes back decades, and that has remained, including through the previous President Trump administration\u201d. He also said Trump had \u201crightly\u201d pushed for European nations to spend more on defence. Meanwhile, away from the disputed call, the race for a new Senate majority leader is heating up, with three Republicans vying for the spot. Senator Rick Scott of Florida has so far won the support from Trump\u2019s Maga camp, including from RFK Jr, Tucker Carlson and Elon Musk. Donald Trump has yet to announce an endorsement himself, though he said on Sunday that he would want a new leader to conduct \u201crecess appointments\u201d, a controversial method of getting cabinet members into office quickly while temporarily sidestepping a lengthy Senate confirmation process. Vladimir Putin has demanded Ukraine withdraw from swathes of its eastern and southern territory as a precondition to peace talks, Agence France-Presse reports. Following Donald Trump\u2019s election, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned there should be \u201cno concessions\u201d to Putin. Ceding land or giving in to any of Moscow\u2019s other hardline demands would only embolden the Kremlin and lead to more aggression, he said. Washington has provided tens of billions of dollars worth of US military and economic aid to Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February 2022, funding that Trump has repeatedly criticised. You can read our report on the Kremlin\u2019s denial here: During the election campaign, Trump said he would find a solution to end the Ukraine war \u201cwithin a day\u201d, but did not explain how he would do so. According to the Washington Post\u2019s report of the call the US president-elect advised the Russian leader not to escalate the war in Ukraine and reminded him of \u201cWashington\u2019s sizeable military presence in Europe\u201d. Reuters has more on the Kremlin\u2019s denial that a Trump-Putin call took place. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. This is completely untrue. This is pure fiction, it\u2019s just false information. There was no conversation. This is the most obvious example of the quality of the information that is being published now, sometimes even in fairly reputable publications.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our US politics blog as the Kremlin denies reports that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have discussed the Ukraine war in a phone call, dismissing it as \u201cpure fiction\u201d. The Washington Post first reported that the call between the Russian leader and the US president-elect took place on Thursday. On Monday morning, Reuters reported that Putin has no specific plans to speak to Trump at the present, according to his Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. Here\u2019s our report on the disputed call:",

He had received mental health treatment until 2020, and had stopped taking medication for his schizophrenia in 2019, counsel assisting Dr Peggy Dwyer SC told the court. His mental health deteriorated between then and April.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Dwyer told the court that Cauchi arrived at about 7.30am at the Kennards storage unit he rented in Waterloo, where he slept and charged his phone before leaving and returning to collect a large knife which he placed in his backpack.</p> \n<p>He entered Westfield shopping centre shortly after 3.30pm, beginning the attack at 3.32pm and 57 seconds when, after \u201cfidgeting\u201d in line at a bakery, he removed the knife from his backpack and fatally stabbed Dawn Singleton, 25. He then fatally stabbed Jade Young, 47, and Yixuan Cheng before attacking Ashlee Good, 38, from behind. The court heard that the mother turned and saw him then attacking her nine-month-old baby, who was in a pram, and received another stab wound when she intervened to \u201cundoubtedly\u201d save the life of her infant.</p> \n<p>Cauchi immediately continued his attack, killing security guard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/apr/15/bondi-knife-attack-sydney-ahmadiyya-muslims-mourn-faraz-tahir\">Faraz Tahir</a>, a 30-year-old Pakistani citizen, then Pikria Darchia, 55.</p> \n<p>Five minutes and 43 seconds after the attack began, Cauchi was shot dead by Scott, who was on duty nearby. Just over a minute passed between her arrival at Westfield and shooting him dead.</p> \n<p>Dwyer said no alarm sounded within Westfield Bondi until about one minute after Cauchi was shot.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s presently unclear why it took so long for the alarm to sound,\u201d she said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/apr/14/bondi-junction-mass-stabbing-attack-who-are-the-six-victims\">Bondi Junction mass stabbing attack: who are the six victims? </a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At the directions hearing for the inquest into the mass stabbing event, state coroner Teresa O\u2019Sullivan acknowledged the pain and loss caused that day.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt the outset, I offer my sincere condolences to the family and loved ones who are here in court today as well as those who can\u2019t be here with us in person. It\u2019s important to me and my assisting team \u2026 that you feel safe, you feel heard and you feel cared for throughout this coronal proceeding,\u201d she told the court.</p> \n<p>The court heard that Cauchi collected large knives, including a Ka-Bar USMC utility fixed blade knife \u2013 and that in early 2023, the police were twice called to Cauchi\u2019s family home, where he told officers that his knives had been stolen by his father. Investigations revealed Cauchi\u2019s father had confiscated the knives because of concerns around his son\u2019s mental health.</p> \n<p>The court heard that Cauchi\u2019s parents recognised their son from the CCTV footage shown on 6pm news on the evening of the stabbing. They called police and have assisted with investigations since.</p> \n<p>Dwyer said the inquest, set down for five weeks from 28 April 2025, will centre on six issues, including Cauchi\u2019s background, his mental health conditions and treatment in Queensland, and interactions with police before 13 April. A precise chronology of events that day will be investigated, as will the nature of the response from Westfield\u2019s owners, Scentre Group, and its security subcontractors, Glad Group and Falcon Manpower Solution.</p> \n<p>A further issue, she anticipated, will be the type of alarm that was activated and whether it was appropriate. The alarm used was so loud that it impaired first responders\u2019 capacity to communicate with each other, she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"64c905ea-9db4-4571-bb1b-e8b119a7366e\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(April 13, 2024)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>3.31pm</b> \u2013 Joel Cauchi walks over the level-four airbridge inside Westfield Bondi Junction.</p>\n    <p><b>3.32:57pm </b>- Attack begins.

      "bodyText": "A coroner\u2019s court has heard that it took just three minutes for homeless and mentally unwell man Joel Cauchi to fatally stab six people and injure 10 more in a frenzied attack in a Bondi Junction shopping centre on 13 April. On Tuesday morning, the New South Wales state coroner heard Cauchi, 40, who grew up in Toowoomba in Queensland, had been sleeping rough in Maroubra on the morning of the attack, which ended when he was shot and killed by police inspector Amy Scott. Cauchi was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenager. He had received mental health treatment until 2020, and had stopped taking medication for his schizophrenia in 2019, counsel assisting Dr Peggy Dwyer SC told the court. His mental health deteriorated between then and April. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Dwyer told the court that Cauchi arrived at about 7.30am at the Kennards storage unit he rented in Waterloo, where he slept and charged his phone before leaving and returning to collect a large knife which he placed in his backpack. He entered Westfield shopping centre shortly after 3.30pm, beginning the attack at 3.32pm and 57 seconds when, after \u201cfidgeting\u201d in line at a bakery, he removed the knife from his backpack and fatally stabbed Dawn Singleton, 25. He then fatally stabbed Jade Young, 47, and Yixuan Cheng before attacking Ashlee Good, 38, from behind. The court heard that the mother turned and saw him then attacking her nine-month-old baby, who was in a pram, and received another stab wound when she intervened to \u201cundoubtedly\u201d save the life of her infant. Cauchi immediately continued his attack, killing security guard Faraz Tahir, a 30-year-old Pakistani citizen, then Pikria Darchia, 55. Five minutes and 43 seconds after the attack began, Cauchi was shot dead by Scott, who was on duty nearby. Just over a minute passed between her arrival at Westfield and shooting him dead. Dwyer said no alarm sounded within Westfield Bondi until about one minute after Cauchi was shot. \u201cIt\u2019s presently unclear why it took so long for the alarm to sound,\u201d she said. At the directions hearing for the inquest into the mass stabbing event, state coroner Teresa O\u2019Sullivan acknowledged the pain and loss caused that day. \u201cAt the outset, I offer my sincere condolences to the family and loved ones who are here in court today as well as those who can\u2019t be here with us in person. It\u2019s important to me and my assisting team \u2026 that you feel safe, you feel heard and you feel cared for throughout this coronal proceeding,\u201d she told the court. The court heard that Cauchi collected large knives, including a Ka-Bar USMC utility fixed blade knife \u2013 and that in early 2023, the police were twice called to Cauchi\u2019s family home, where he told officers that his knives had been stolen by his father. Investigations revealed Cauchi\u2019s father had confiscated the knives because of concerns around his son\u2019s mental health. The court heard that Cauchi\u2019s parents recognised their son from the CCTV footage shown on 6pm news on the evening of the stabbing. They called police and have assisted with investigations since. Dwyer said the inquest, set down for five weeks from 28 April 2025, will centre on six issues, including Cauchi\u2019s background, his mental health conditions and treatment in Queensland, and interactions with police before 13 April. A precise chronology of events that day will be investigated, as will the nature of the response from Westfield\u2019s owners, Scentre Group, and its security subcontractors, Glad Group and Falcon Manpower Solution. A further issue, she anticipated, will be the type of alarm that was activated and whether it was appropriate. The alarm used was so loud that it impaired first responders\u2019 capacity to communicate with each other, she said. Dwyer said while an inquest is mandatory after any death in the course of a police operation, she did not anticipate any criticism of Scott\u2019s use of force. On the contrary, she said the officer\u2019s actions \u201cclearly saved lives\u201d after Cauchi \u201cposed an immediate and ongoing deadly threat to citizens\u201d. Dwyer paid her respects and expressed her deep condolences to the families of those who lost their lives that day on behalf of the bar. She said the event \u201cshocked our community\u201d and has caused \u201cunspeakable grief for the families and loved ones of those who were killed and injured\u201d. She said national and international experts, including an expert in active armed offenders from London\u2019s New Scotland Yard, will appear. Also expected to give evidence are treating doctors and mental health experts. Dwyer said gaps in the healthcare Cauchi received \u201cexposed him and the community to the risk of harm\u201d. She said she expects to hear there is a strong need for sustainable serviced housing for mentally ill people, and that such a service could have assisted in preventing the decline in Cauchi\u2019s mental health. While she said the events of 13 April were very rare and she was \u201cconscious to avoid stigmatising\u201d those living with a mental illness, she said a mental illness can be \u201ccatastrophic \u2013 as it was in this case\u201d. She said the inquest would be trauma-informed and as respectful as possible. \u201cThankfully in this country tragedies like this are rare \u2013 but when they do happen, they happen quickly and they cause chaos,\u201d she said. She added she hopes the inquest will highlight weak spots and deficiencies in procedures and prevent future deaths. \u201cIf there are flaws in systems, parties are asked to help the assisting team to identify them,\u201d she said. The coroner said she may make recommendations in relation to any matter relating to the deaths, with a view to improving the public safety. Outside the court, two of Tahir\u2019s brothers spoke about the importance of being at the court proceedings. \u201cWhat has happened cannot be changed, but we pray and hope that through the investigation, they are able to come up with better plans and better equipment for security guards,\u201d Muzafar Ahmad Tahir said through an interpreter.",

      "body": "<p>On a Monday night in October in Sydney\u2019s west, a social game of tape ball cricket served as a vision for the sport\u2019s new era. The tennis ball was wrapped in electrical tape, as is normal to the variant born in Karachi. The players were largely of Pakistani descent. Families watched, children played along the boundary.</p> <p>It was an otherwise normal game of the accessible form of cricket that has proven popular across South Asia since its development in Pakistan 60 years ago. What was different was how Cricket Australia looked at it. There was $3,000 in prize money, it was held under lights at Cricket NSW\u2019s showpiece venue Blacktown International Sports Park, and the match \u2013 won by the Cheetahs over the Falcons \u2013 decided the first winner of the trophy that carries the name of BBL club Sydney Thunder.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/23/cricket-for-climate-pat-cummins-australia-the-spin\">The Spin | Pat Cummins takes lead on climate crisis as cricketers pitch green plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cricket Australia\u2019s freshly minted Chief of Cricket, James Allsopp, said head office would never have supported such forms of the game in the past, but it now recognises they are key for making the sport more inclusive. \u201cTen years ago, we almost ignored it and didn\u2019t respect it,\u201d Allsopp said. [People thought] it\u2019s not real cricket and that can sit on the side, and it\u2019s not a part of Australian cricket.\u201d</p> <p>Now, social cricket, winter leagues and <a href=\"https://www.lastmanstands.com/\">Last Man Stands</a> \u2013 an eight-player variant where the final batter left not out can continue \u2013 are central to the game\u2019s strategy, eyeing the passion of players with South Asian backgrounds. \u201cI feel like the game has come so far now that any cricket people who play the game we love, we want to embrace it and support it and wrap our arms around it,\u201d Allsopp said.</p> <p>Junior teams are bursting with Indian, Pakistani, Afghan, Nepali, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan names, and these social, indoor and non-traditional competitions play year round. However Allsopp, who helped prepare the sport\u2019s multicultural action plan last year before taking on his current role role in July, warned there\u2019s still work to do in order to ensure representative sides reflect modern Australia.</p>    <p>Participation in Australian cricket by people with South Asian backgrounds has doubled to 20% in the past five years but among those with state contracts the proportion is just 5%, prompting research into why.</p> <p>\u201cOur hypothesis is that the South Asian communities are really, really focused on education, and at times that means that they can\u2019t put as much energy into cricket,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to understand that further, if that\u2019s the case, and how we can support that.\u201d</p> <p>The goal, set out in the multicultural action plan, to increase the share of state players to 8% by 2027 looks almost impossible to reach, and a South Asian talent camp earmarked for this year won\u2019t be rolled out until the research is completed. Yet in junior age groups players from these cultural groups are prominent. The Victorian metro men\u2019s under-19 side this summer includes five players with South Asian backgrounds, and there are six in the women\u2019s. The numbers in the Victorian schoolboys and girls under-12 teams are almost double.</p> <p>Pakistan-born Australian Test star Usman Khawaja said at last year\u2019s launch of the multicultural action plan \u201ccricket in Australia has been a very white-dominated sport\u201d and revealed he challenged Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley to be more ambitious in the space.</p> <p>Ahead of a summer which includes the first five-match Test series against India since 1992, Allsopp said there were promising players emerging in under-19s age groups, including two in the men\u2019s program and three in the women\u2019s \u2013 Hasrat Gill is the captain \u2013 and although the 2027 target may not be achieved he expected there would be an increase.</p> <p>\u201cSome of it is timing, and I think we\u2019d love to move it faster, but every year there\u2019s only x amount of contracts, and players who have got contracts are playing well so they don\u2019t move,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want to make sure we\u2019re giving all players, and particularly our South Asian talented players, every opportunity to press into those contracted roles when opportunities arise.\u201d</p>    <p>Promising cricketers in junior years have traditionally moved on to play in grade cricket, and Allsopp said this part of the game has been slow to adapt to participation trends.</p> <p>\u201cI call them roles of influence, so club presidents, the club treasurer, vice president, we\u2019re still really underrepresented,\u201d he said. \u201cThose community roles and club presidents, they\u2019re the roles I think we\u2019ve still got work to.\u201d</p> <p>Suffan Hassan, a grade cricketer for UNSW in Sydney, said he has seen the club environment change over his decade playing seniors, right down to the menu at barbecues.</p> <p>\u201cThey made it more inclusive in terms of having vegetarian food, halal food as well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only just about trying to get more South Asians involved, I think it\u2019s actually the caucasians, to get them to understand what different cultures are and what is the appropriate thing to do, and how to make it more inclusive.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/06/cricket-west-indies-rebel-tour-1983-south-africa-clyde-walcott\">The Spin | The 1983 West Indian rebel tour to South Africa that shocked cricket</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hassan works as a multicultural engagement specialist for Cricket NSW, and has helped organise social games of tape ball cricket into the Sydney Thunder Tape Ball League, which concluded its first season last month.</p> <p>\u201cThis was my idea, about three or four years ago when I first started at Cricket New South Wales to bring the tape ball league to life,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of these people just go and casually play at grounds, but giving them access to playing under lights, playing at Blacktown International Sports Park, which is a first class venue.\u201d</p> <p>The Sydney Thunder are hosting a cricket and culture festival on Sunday at Drummoyne Oval alongside the WBBL clash with the Sydney Sixers, featuring Bhangra dancers, Bollywood dancing classes, henna and face painting and tape ball games.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On a Monday night in October in Sydney\u2019s west, a social game of tape ball cricket served as a vision for the sport\u2019s new era. The tennis ball was wrapped in electrical tape, as is normal to the variant born in Karachi. The players were largely of Pakistani descent. Families watched, children played along the boundary. It was an otherwise normal game of the accessible form of cricket that has proven popular across South Asia since its development in Pakistan 60 years ago. What was different was how Cricket Australia looked at it. There was $3,000 in prize money, it was held under lights at Cricket NSW\u2019s showpiece venue Blacktown International Sports Park, and the match \u2013 won by the Cheetahs over the Falcons \u2013 decided the first winner of the trophy that carries the name of BBL club Sydney Thunder. Cricket Australia\u2019s freshly minted Chief of Cricket, James Allsopp, said head office would never have supported such forms of the game in the past, but it now recognises they are key for making the sport more inclusive. \u201cTen years ago, we almost ignored it and didn\u2019t respect it,\u201d Allsopp said. [People thought] it\u2019s not real cricket and that can sit on the side, and it\u2019s not a part of Australian cricket.\u201d Now, social cricket, winter leagues and Last Man Stands \u2013 an eight-player variant where the final batter left not out can continue \u2013 are central to the game\u2019s strategy, eyeing the passion of players with South Asian backgrounds. \u201cI feel like the game has come so far now that any cricket people who play the game we love, we want to embrace it and support it and wrap our arms around it,\u201d Allsopp said. Junior teams are bursting with Indian, Pakistani, Afghan, Nepali, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan names, and these social, indoor and non-traditional competitions play year round. However Allsopp, who helped prepare the sport\u2019s multicultural action plan last year before taking on his current role role in July, warned there\u2019s still work to do in order to ensure representative sides reflect modern Australia. Participation in Australian cricket by people with South Asian backgrounds has doubled to 20% in the past five years but among those with state contracts the proportion is just 5%, prompting research into why. \u201cOur hypothesis is that the South Asian communities are really, really focused on education, and at times that means that they can\u2019t put as much energy into cricket,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to understand that further, if that\u2019s the case, and how we can support that.\u201d The goal, set out in the multicultural action plan, to increase the share of state players to 8% by 2027 looks almost impossible to reach, and a South Asian talent camp earmarked for this year won\u2019t be rolled out until the research is completed. Yet in junior age groups players from these cultural groups are prominent. The Victorian metro men\u2019s under-19 side this summer includes five players with South Asian backgrounds, and there are six in the women\u2019s. The numbers in the Victorian schoolboys and girls under-12 teams are almost double. Pakistan-born Australian Test star Usman Khawaja said at last year\u2019s launch of the multicultural action plan \u201ccricket in Australia has been a very white-dominated sport\u201d and revealed he challenged Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley to be more ambitious in the space. Ahead of a summer which includes the first five-match Test series against India since 1992, Allsopp said there were promising players emerging in under-19s age groups, including two in the men\u2019s program and three in the women\u2019s \u2013 Hasrat Gill is the captain \u2013 and although the 2027 target may not be achieved he expected there would be an increase. \u201cSome of it is timing, and I think we\u2019d love to move it faster, but every year there\u2019s only x amount of contracts, and players who have got contracts are playing well so they don\u2019t move,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want to make sure we\u2019re giving all players, and particularly our South Asian talented players, every opportunity to press into those contracted roles when opportunities arise.\u201d Promising cricketers in junior years have traditionally moved on to play in grade cricket, and Allsopp said this part of the game has been slow to adapt to participation trends. \u201cI call them roles of influence, so club presidents, the club treasurer, vice president, we\u2019re still really underrepresented,\u201d he said. \u201cThose community roles and club presidents, they\u2019re the roles I think we\u2019ve still got work to.\u201d Suffan Hassan, a grade cricketer for UNSW in Sydney, said he has seen the club environment change over his decade playing seniors, right down to the menu at barbecues. \u201cThey made it more inclusive in terms of having vegetarian food, halal food as well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only just about trying to get more South Asians involved, I think it\u2019s actually the caucasians, to get them to understand what different cultures are and what is the appropriate thing to do, and how to make it more inclusive.\u201d Hassan works as a multicultural engagement specialist for Cricket NSW, and has helped organise social games of tape ball cricket into the Sydney Thunder Tape Ball League, which concluded its first season last month. \u201cThis was my idea, about three or four years ago when I first started at Cricket New South Wales to bring the tape ball league to life,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of these people just go and casually play at grounds, but giving them access to playing under lights, playing at Blacktown International Sports Park, which is a first class venue.\u201d The Sydney Thunder are hosting a cricket and culture festival on Sunday at Drummoyne Oval alongside the WBBL clash with the Sydney Sixers, featuring Bhangra dancers, Bollywood dancing classes, henna and face painting and tape ball games.",

Sergei Davidis, the head of Memorial\u2019s department for supporting political prisoners, said there were about 7,000 Ukrainian civilians detained by Russian authorities, repeating a count by the Ukrainian NGO Centre for Civil Liberties. Davidis said Memorial also discovered several hundred Russians being held for \u201chigh treason\u201d or \u201csabotage\u201d cases since the Ukraine invasion, and \u201cthousands\u201d of criminal cases for refusing to fight in Ukraine.

      "bodyText": "North Korea has ratified a landmark mutual defence pact with Russia, state media reported on Tuesday, weeks after sending thousands of troops to help Moscow in its war against Ukraine and sealing a deepening security cooperation between the two nations. The deal \u201cwas ratified as a decree\u201d of Kim Jong-un, the Korean Central news agency (KCNA) said. The notice comes after Russian lawmakers voted unanimously last week to ratify the deal, which President Vladimir Putin later signed. Ukraine said on Monday its hard-pressed military was battling 50,000 troops in Russia\u2019s Kursk region to its north, while also scrambling to reinforce two besieged fronts in the east and bracing to meet an infantry assault in the south. The escalating fighting along a more than 1,000km (620 miles) of frontline is stretching Ukraine\u2019s already outnumbered troops at a critical moment after Donald Trump won the US election. Ukraine\u2019s armed forces commander Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said he had travelled to the front in Russia\u2019s Kursk region. \u201c[Russian forces] are trying to dislodge our troops and advance deep into the territory we control,\u201d he said on Telegram. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine would strengthen positions on the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove fronts where Moscow has directed its offensive pressure for months. Russia has been closing in on Pokrovsk, a strategic road and rail hub that has a coalmine. The small industrial town of Kurakhove is home to a major coal-powered thermal power plant. A Ukrainian military spokesperson told Reuters that Russia was also moving trained assault groups to forward positions in the southern Zaporizhzhia region and that they were preparing to attack. The southern front has seen far less fighting since 2023 when Ukraine launched a major counteroffensive that failed to break through heavily defended and mined lands held by Russia. \u201c[The assaults] could begin in the near future, we\u2019re not even talking about weeks, we\u2019re expecting it to happen any day,\u201d said Vladyslav Voloshyn, spokesperson for the southern military sector. Although it was not clear if they would involve a single offensive push or separate assaults, intelligence assessed that Moscow\u2019s troops planned to use armoured vehicles and a considerable number of drones, Voloshyn said. \u201cThey are preparing both armoured groups and light vehicles \u2013 buggies, motorcycles \u2013 to conduct these assault operations,\u201d he added. The Kremlin has denied reports that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, spoke to the US president-elect, Donald Trump, last week calling the media reports \u201cpure fiction\u201d. The Washington Post first reported that a call had taken place, citing unidentified sources, and said Trump had told Putin he should not escalate the Ukraine war. \u201cIt is completely untrue. It is pure fiction; it is simply false information,\u201d the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said when asked about the call. \u201cThere was no conversation.\u201d Russian human rights group Memorial told AFP that Moscow\u2019s crackdown on dissent since invading Ukraine is vastly underestimated, with thousands of Russian and Ukrainians jailed for political reasons. Sergei Davidis, the head of Memorial\u2019s department for supporting political prisoners, said there were about 7,000 Ukrainian civilians detained by Russian authorities, repeating a count by the Ukrainian NGO Centre for Civil Liberties. Davidis said Memorial also discovered several hundred Russians being held for \u201chigh treason\u201d or \u201csabotage\u201d cases since the Ukraine invasion, and \u201cthousands\u201d of criminal cases for refusing to fight in Ukraine. There are also dozens of Ukrainian soldiers held in Russia who are facing prosecution instead of being treated as prisoners of war. Russian strikes on Monday damaged a dam near the frontline in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region, Ukrainian authorities said, warning nearby villages could be threatened by rising water levels. \u201cThe Russians damaged the dam of the reservoir of Kurakhove. This strike potentially threatens residents of settlements on the Vovcha River, both in Donetsk and Dnipro regions,\u201d the region\u2019s Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Russian attacks on Monday killed two in Ukraine\u2019s central-east Dnipropetrovsk region and injured at least 19, with more people likely trapped under the rubble, officials said. Shelling by artillery killed two people in Nikopol and injured five more, regional governor Serhiy Lysak said on the Telegram messenger platform. A medical facility, a cafe and shops were damaged, he added.",

The Voluntary Organisations Disability Group (VODG), which represents 100 charities in England, said Rachel Reeves\u2019s decision to raise employers\u2019 national insurance contributions (NICs) had been \u201cill thought through\u201d and would put many local charity services at risk. The warning came amid Guardian reports that the government is to offer a financial lifeline to protect hospice charities, who had said the rise in NICs would cost them \u00a330m a year and lead to end-of-life services being cut or even closing. VODG, which represents household names like Mencap and Sense as well as scores of smaller disability charities, said the NICs and national minimum wage increases would leave many members having to cut back on staff and services. The quality of services for disabled people who are being supported to live independent lives would be reduced, it said. Many disability charities would be forced to hand contracts back to local authorities because services they provide could not be delivered safely on the funding available. \u201cSocial care is designed to protect the most vulnerable members of our community, and this Labour government is letting them down,\u201d said the VODG chief executive, Rhidian Hughes. Nurseries have warned of higher fees to parents and possible closures as a result of the increases to NICs and the minimum wage, which will push the early-years sector \u201cto the brink\u201d, according to the Early Years Alliance (EYA). Voluntary sector providers of public services, who unlike the NHS and local authorities are not protected from the impact of the NICs rise, and unlike private companies cannot pass costs on to consumers, say they are increasingly alarmed at the impact of the extra costs on their financial viability. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations, which met the minister for civil society, Stephanie Peacock, last week to discuss the crisis, said more than 7,000 of its member charities had now signed an open letter to the government warning of the \u201cdire situation\u201d facing the voluntary sector as a result of rising costs. While the Treasury has so far been adamant it cannot exempt charities and private businesses from NICs rises, the prospect of an exemption for voluntary hospices has given fresh hope to the charity sector that a broader agreement can be reached. The sector sees the national insurance rises as the third financial disaster to hit it in the past five years, after Covid and the cost of living crisis. It believes failure to address it could sour attempts to establish what Keir Starmer, the prime minister, earlier this year called a \u201crenewed social contract\u201d with charities. The charity sector employs 1 million people and delivers about \u00a317bn of services a year in areas such as social care, addiction, health, homelessness and hospice care. Charities estimate they face an extra bill of \u00a31.4bn as a result of the changes. Separately, more than 100 homelessness charities, including Crisis and St Mungo\u2019s, delivered an open letter to Reeves, the chancellor, on Monday warning the NICs rises could take up to \u00a360m a year from frontline services such as street outreach, emergency beds and supported housing. Rick Henderson, the chief executive of Homeless Link, which organised the letter, said he had \u201crarely seen the sector as angry and frightened\u201d as they were by the planned NICs rise. \u201cIt is a very real threat that could impact thousands of people who are currently homeless or threatened with homelessness, leaving them without support,\u201d he said. An online survey of 1,000 nurseries in England found that 95% of EYA members were likely to have to increase fees to cover the extra costs, while two in five (40%) were likely to close permanently without additional support from the government to cover increased costs. The sector is working to deliver the biggest expansion in its history, as it implements the government\u2019s funded childcare scheme. Working parents of children over the age of nine months are now able to access 15 hours of government-funded childcare, increasing to up 30 hours a week for eligible families from next September. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe had to take difficult decisions to fix the foundations of our public services \u2013 meaning that we could bolster the health and social care system by an extra \u00a322.6bn and announce \u00a31bn to reduce homelessness. \u201cOur tax regime for charities, including an exemption from paying business rates, remains one of the most generous in the world and is worth just over \u00a36bn a year to the sector.\u201d",
