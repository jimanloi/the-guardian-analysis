Meanwhile, Steve Diamond believes Newcastle \u201cleft 10 points\u201d on the pitch following their hard-fought 17-12 win over Saracens at Kingston Park. The Falcons lifted off the foot of the Premiership table thanks to tries from Alex Hearle and Adam Radwan along with a Brett Connon penalty. Friday\u2019s victory was Newcastle\u2019s fourth successive win after three Premiership Rugby Cup triumphs and comes following reports earlier in the week that the club has been put up for sale. The director of rugby Diamond revealed he asked his side to put themselves \u201cin the shop window\u201d in recent weeks as they picked up their second Premiership win of the season. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s been some turbulence off the field, or would be perceived as turbulence ie the club going up for sale, which is a positive, a real positive. I asked the lads over the last couple of weeks to put ourselves in the shop window and they did it last week against a very strong Sale side, that went amiss \u2013 it was \u2018only the cup\u2019 as people would say. \u201cThen we got our first chance back in the league and I think we left 10 points out there if I\u2019m perfectly honest.\u201d PA Media",

The $2,000 rebate, an Australian-first program, was available to all NSW women accessing fertility services for the first time to cover some out-of-pocket expenses. It was introduced in 2022 by the former Coalition government. The Minns government announced it would scrap the rebate for many women from mid-February 2025 and introduce a means test.

Small, thoughtful changes can refine your design and transform a room\u2019s atmosphere. Whether it\u2019s introducing a table lamp or swapping out your light switches, these simple updates from experts can infuse new life into a tired space without breaking the bank.</p> <h2>Freshen up the front door</h2> <p>Never underestimate the difference a coat of paint can make to your home\u2019s curb appeal. Changing the colour of your front door is one of the easiest ways to update and create a friendly welcome every time you come home. \u201cI\u2019d always work with the existing colours of your walls, roof windows and trims, but try to be bold for a dramatic makeover,\u201d says NSW Central Coast interior designer James Treble. \u201cFor our front door I have [used a] gloss to really make a statement.\u201d He created a Palm Springs-inspired shade of yellow for a paint company, quipping, \u201cI named it Umina Springs!\u201d</p>    <h2>Update power points and light switches</h2> <p>Replacing tired or yellowing light switches and power points can instantly refresh your home and bring it bang up to date. \u201cI\u2019ve done this on multiple renos over the years, it\u2019s like a budget facelift of the house,\u201d says Treble. You can make easy updates with colour changes to existing power points at a good price: \u201cYou don\u2019t need an electrician and at about $6.50 each, you can go crazy and update the whole home on a budget.\u201d Always check the brand and style of your power points before purchasing new fitting skins.</p>    <h2>Layer your lighting</h2> <p>Incorporating two or three different light sources in a room is a technique often used by interior designers to create a sense of depth and warmth. \u201cLamps can instantly change the mood of a room,\u201d says Jenna Densten, a Rutherglen-based interior designer. She prefers a combination of floor and table lamps \u201cto create a cosy, inviting atmosphere without requiring major changes\u201d. Ambient or overhead lighting offers general illumination, while task lighting, such as bedside lamps and under-cabinet lights, focuses on specific areas. Use accent lights such as wall sconces and floor lamps to highlight artwork or architectural features, enhancing the overall appeal of the space.</p> <h2>Change your curtains</h2> <p>Swapping blinds for floor-length curtains not only softens a room but also creates an illusion of height, making ceilings appear taller and windows seem larger. This simple addition can elevate the overall feel of your space, adding comfort and character. \u201cThey\u2019re a fantastic way to balance hard surfaces like timber or tile,\u201d says Densten. Choose curtain rods that extend beyond the window frame; this technique not only makes your windows look larger but also allows more light to flood in when the curtains are drawn back. Make sure your curtains are hung at the right height \u2013 they should skim the floor or puddle slightly for a luxe look. Fabrics like linen or soft velvet can add visual interest to your space, while allowing for a beautiful balance of light and texture.</p>    <h2>Streamline your dining room</h2> <p>\u201cIncorporating a bench seat or banquette is one of my favourite space-saving solutions in a home\u201d, says Sydney interior designer Jono Fleming. He notes that while some may find this addition impractical, \u201cin small, hard to arrange rooms, it can really help with layout.\u201d</p>    <p>This affordable option not only transforms your dining area but also allows you to save on chairs, as you only need two or three to complement the bench. For those feeling creative, a DIY project can elevate the look even further, adding a backrest with foam and quality fabric to make the seating feel more integrated. \u201cIt\u2019s not for everyone nor is it for every space, but this is a great, easy way to bring that elevated restaurant-dining vibe to your home without a huge expense,\u201d he adds.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t forget to frame your artwork</h2> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever bought a print and said to yourself, \u2018I\u2019ll frame this one day,\u2019 this one\u2019s for you,\u201d says Fleming. Many of us have prints sitting unframed, or worse, Blu-Tacked to our walls. Creating an art wall showcases your style, and framing elevates it. While professional framing can be pricey, affordable options (such as Ikea and Freedom) require minimal effort.</p>    <p>Fleming advises against buying matchy-matchy frames; instead \u201cplay with different shapes, colours and tones of timber to give that lived-in eclectic feeling.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth it in the long run and will extend the longevity of your artwork.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>A lot has happened since the last Asia Pacific Triennial in 2021, which opened, quietly, during Covid border lockdowns in Queensland. Besides a global pandemic, Trump won a second term, two major wars have erupted, and climate change has marched grimly onwards, with countless extreme weather events and temperature records broken.</p> <p>Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise, then, that the billboard announcing the 11th Asia Pacific Triennial is emblazoned with the optimistic slogan: \u201cArt that lifts you up\u201d. Does it, though?

Besides a global pandemic, Trump won a second term, two major wars have erupted, and climate change has marched grimly onwards, with countless extreme weather events and temperature records broken. Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise, then, that the billboard announcing the 11th Asia Pacific Triennial is emblazoned with the optimistic slogan: \u201cArt that lifts you up\u201d. Does it, though?

But luck is hard to come by when you\u2019re rock bottom, and the decision to rule out Cameron Archer\u2019s goal for interference from the offside Adam Armstrong looked contentious at best. It really didn\u2019t look like Bart Verbruggen was affected in any significant fashion by Armstrong\u2019s fresh-air swipe as the ball came across. Then again, as so often with these borderline decisions, a case can be made either way, and with the on-field team having already called the goal offside, perhaps there wasn\u2019t enough in it to overturn. Who knows? Oh VAR. But here we are, and a point apiece is enough to send Brighton into the heady heights of second spot, for one night at least, while at the bottom Saints nudge a little closer to Crystal Palace.</p>

Welbeck\u2019s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up two goals against Bournemouth, the captain\u2019s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian H\u00fcrzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. <strong>Taha Hashim</strong></em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Southampton had only six shots against Liverpool \u2013 they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. \u201cWhat was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,\u201d Arne Slot said. \u201cToday they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I\u2019m sure they will win some games.\u201d As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. <strong>Simon Burnton</strong></em></p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action\">Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s action</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-674a10858f08613772567a87\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-29T19:07:26.053Z\">7.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Breaking news \u2026</strong> and it\u2019s something which will have some sort of effect, one way or another, on Southampton\u2019s efforts to stay in the Premier League. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/29/leicester-confirm-ruud-van-nistelrooy-manager-appointment\">Leicester confirm appointment of Ruud van Nistelrooy as manager</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-674a0fbe8f08613772567a83\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-29T19:05:20.455Z\">7.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here\u2019s a reminder of how the Premier League table looks heading into the Friday Night Football.</strong> Southampton were set a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/nov/24/southampton-v-liverpool-premier-league-live\">bottom-versus-top clash</a> last Sunday; now they\u2019ve been handed a 20th-versus-fifth-and-potentially-second test.

      "bodyText": "Ed Aarons was at the Amex tonight. Here\u2019s his report. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night! Fabian H\u00fcrzeler speaks to Sky. \u201cIt was not the best game from us regarding intensity and positional \u2026 we only deserve a result like this \u2026 normally we should have finished the game in the first half \u2026 but we didn\u2019t and then you get punished \u2026 we have to keep working \u2026 it\u2019s a process \u2026 it takes time \u2026 we have to keep going \u2026 don\u2019t focus too much on the results, focus on the performance \u2026 the results will come \u2026 small details might bring you the win \u2026 we didn\u2019t do that today \u2026 we should not think about what is possible \u2026 the reality is that we have a lot of hard work to do \u2026 I received a yellow card, players can foul an amount of times but don\u2019t receive a yellow card, it\u2019s difficult to explain.\u201d \u2026 and as for his much-criticised insistence on progressive play, he notes: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find a balance \u2026 we\u2019ve lost too many points through game management \u2026 tonight the boys managed the game better \u2026 so it\u2019s keep trying to work with the boys and make them better \u2026 there are a few scary moments but I think you have to accept that \u2026 Tyler Dibling couldn\u2019t play if we were just grinding.\u201d An irritated Russell Martin talks to Sky Sports. \u201cIn the first half we lacked a little bit of aggression and belief \u2026 I asked the players for a bit more \u2026 they were brilliant in the second half \u2026 I\u2019m fed up talking about the decisions \u2026 I don\u2019t want to be that guy \u2026 it was a brilliant, well-worked goal \u2026 if Adam Armstrong\u2019s run had moved Verbruggen at all from his position I would understand the decision \u2026 but he hasn\u2019t moved \u2026 the ball goes behind Adam and I can\u2019t see how it\u2019s affected the goalkeeper \u2026 he actually takes a step away from Adam \u2026 now it\u2019s not clear and obvious enough because the on-field decision carries weight \u2026 I\u2019m annoyed about it \u2026 but I\u2019m really happy with the performance and proud of my players.\u201d In the interests of balance \u2026 while Southampton will feel aggrieved at the decision to rule out Cameron Archer\u2019s goal, on another day Flynn Downes could have easily picked up two yellows before scoring the equaliser. Hey, half the fun of football is moaning about refereeing decisions, so it\u2019s great that both sets of supporters have something to get their teeth stuck into. That\u2019s right, yes? Saints goalscorer Flynn Downes speaks to Sky. \u201cIt\u2019s massive \u2026 to come here \u2026 we knew it would be tough \u2026 we\u2019ll take the point \u2026 what a feeling [to score] \u2026 we know our form hasn\u2019t been great but hopefully this is a turning point in our season \u2026 hopefully we can kick on.\u201d Player of the match Tyler Dibling adds: \u201cWe got another goal disallowed by VAR \u2026 we feel we\u2019ve been unlucky this season \u2026 obviously it\u2019s a good point in the table \u2026 we need to step it up from here \u2026 it\u2019s good to get a run of games and show people what I can do.\u201d On balance of play, a draw seems about right. Brighton were by far the better team in the first half; Southampton much improved after the break. But luck is hard to come by when you\u2019re rock bottom, and the decision to rule out Cameron Archer\u2019s goal for interference from the offside Adam Armstrong looked contentious at best. It really didn\u2019t look like Bart Verbruggen was affected in any significant fashion by Armstrong\u2019s fresh-air swipe as the ball came across. Then again, as so often with these borderline decisions, a case can be made either way, and with the on-field team having already called the goal offside, perhaps there wasn\u2019t enough in it to overturn. Who knows? Oh VAR. But here we are, and a point apiece is enough to send Brighton into the heady heights of second spot, for one night at least, while at the bottom Saints nudge a little closer to Crystal Palace. A furious Russell Martin makes a beeline for the referee Fabian H\u00fcrzeler but is stopped by his staff. VAR, huh. 90 min +13: Minteh curls in. Van Hecke eyebrows weakly wide right. And then the whistle goes. 90 min +12: Fernandes has the chance of releasing Sulemana down the middle, but his pass hits the substitute striker on the heel. Brighton go up the other end, and Dibling is booked for a reckless lunge on the in-flight Mitoma. One last chance for Brighton with this free kick just to the left of the box. 90 min +11: \u2026 Ferguson finds himself bundled over, but only when competing for a flicked-on ball while in a clear offside position. No penalty. For a split second there, Southampton hearts were in mouths. 90 min +10: Mitoma runs hard down the left. His cross is met by Adingra, who bundles a weak shot across Lumley and off the outside of the right-hand post! There was a deflection, so that\u2019ll be a corner. From which \u2026 90 min +9: Van Hecke pearls a long-distance shot towards the top-right corner. He\u2019s hit it well, but he\u2019s so far out, it\u2019s easy pickings for Lumley, who one loose pass apart, has looked pretty solid for Saints tonight. 90 min +8: It\u2019s petering out again. 90 min +7: Dibling embarks on a power dribble down the right and is unceremoniously checked by Wieffer, who goes into the book. 90 min +5: The folk at the Premier League Match Centre have published their reasoning for the disallowed goal. \u201cThe referee\u2019s call of no goal was checked and confirmed by the VAR as Armstrong was in an offside position and deemed to be impacting Verbruggen\u2019s ability to play the ball.\u201d Nobody knows anything any more. Partly because everyone\u2019s winging it. 90 min +4: Fraser\u2019s latest cross from the left is plucked from the sky by Verbruggen. 90 min +3: Ayari enters the Saints box down the left and goes over in the general environs of Harwood-Bellis. He wants a penalty, but neither referee nor VAR shows any interest whatsoever. And quite rightly so. 90 min +2: Minteh\u2019s cross from the right is headed goalwards by Adingra. Easy for Lumley. 90 min +1: Armstrong is replaced by a freshly shorn Brereton Diaz. 90 min: There will be ten minutes of additional time. Little wonder: a lot of subs plus that long VAR check. 89 min: Dibling and Estupinan get involved in a pointless shoving match over nothing very much at all. The referee merely waves play on. 88 min: Estupinan crosses from the left. Ferguson cushions a header down to Ayari, who slashes a wild effort over the bar from the penalty spot. He had more time than he thought. Then both teams make a change, Minteh replacing Rutter for the hosts, Sulemana coming on for Archer for the Saints. 86 min: Fraser has made a difference since coming on. A couple of crosses from the left cause the hosts some momentary bother. He looks the most likely to create something right now. 85 min: This match is slowly petering out. Can either team find the energy for a final push? 83 min: Armstrong spins and swivels his way down the left. His dinked cross is only half cleared, but Dibling\u2019s attempted volley is scuffed and easily blocked. 81 min: Ferguson manages to skittle both Fraser and Manning in one fell swoop. Some good old-fashioned number-nine play. 80 min: Lumley is fine to continue. The game restarts, and Dibling glides in from the right before bobbling a shot towards the bottom right. Easy for Verbruggen. 79 min: As the keeper gets his right knee checked, Brighton make another change, Ferguson coming on for Welbeck. 77 min: Lumley is down getting some treatment. 75 min: Brighton, full of relief, go on the attack in search of the Saints Sickener. Rutter tries an overhead that flies inches wide of the left-hand post. Dunk sends a header over. Wieffer ditto. Southampton, brought back down to earth, need to clear their heads of that crushing disappointment. 74 min: A triple change by Brighton. Wieffer, Adingra and Dunk come on for Lamptey, Pedro and O\u2019Riley. 72 min: VAR decides Armstrong\u2019s flick towards the ball constitutes interference. That\u2019s a fairly generous interpretation, it has to be said. Van Hecke was out of the game, and Verbruggen didn\u2019t seem affected. But here we are. 71 min: Archer is on! But did Armstrong \u2013 certainly in an offside position by the near post, ahead of Van Hecke, neither of them close to Archer stood behind them in the centre \u2013 make a movement towards the ball that had an impact on play? 70 min: This is really tight. Archer in the centre looks off to the naked eye, but Lamptey, in the right-back position could be playing him on. 69 min: \u2026 but VAR is going to have a look at this. The flag has popped up for offside. It\u2019s very tight. Was Archer inches off? Out come the rulers. Dibling sashays in from the right and sends Fraser scampering into acres down the left. Fraser crosses. Archer opens his body and slams into the bottom right. Easy as that! What an outrageous turnaround! 66 min: Downes is replaced before he can get himself sent off. Aribo comes on in his stead, while Sugawara makes way for Fraser. 64 min: Southampton assistant manager Matt Gill was the recipient of that aforementioned booking. 63 min: That goal has given Southampton such succour, and now Armstrong barrels down the left into space. Archer is free in the middle, but he can\u2019t find him with his cross. Had the cross been any good, it was surely 2-1 to Saints. How quickly games can change. 62 min: \u2026 and breathe. The Brighton free kick leads to nothing. 61 min: Before the free kick can be taken, there\u2019s a brouhaha involving both managerial teams. Someone gets booked. Not sure who. Russell Martin maybe. 60 min: Some may argue Downes shouldn\u2019t be on the pitch, having come very close to picking up a second yellow in the first half. Even more so now, as Downes skittles Pedro, who was in flight down the left. Did he elbow him? There didn\u2019t look much in it, and the referee awards no more than a free kick, but Downes is surely in the last-chance saloon now. Dibling wins possession in the centre circle. He drives down the inside-left channel. Manning is fed to his left. Manning checks and tries to tee up Armstrong. There\u2019s some pinball, then the ball breaks to Downes on the edge of the box. Downes pearls into the bottom right through a crowded box, and it\u2019s fair to say this has come against the run of play! 58 min: Sugawara sends Archer scampering down the right. A fine pass and a clever run, but the resulting cross sails half a mile over Armstrong\u2019s head. Verbruggen still hasn\u2019t been put to any sort of meaningful work. 56 min: Estupinan\u2019s curling free kick is only half cleared. O\u2019Riley meets it on the edge of the D and sends his shot bouncing towards the bottom left. Lumley claims easily enough. 55 min: Harwood-Bellis is booked for cynically body-checking the in-flight Mitoma. Free kick out on the Brighton left. Everyone lines up on the edge of the Saints box. 53 min: \u2026 but here it\u2019s Brighton over-elaborating out from the back. Ayari plays Lamptey into trouble near the right-back\u2019s corner flag, and Armstrong\u2019s pressure earns Southampton a corner. Nothing comes of this set piece either, but please file this entry also under Dearie Me. 51 min: Yeah, Southampton look ragged at the back all right. Lumley\u2019s clumsy pass out nearly clanks straight into Mitoma; Rutter picks up the ball and has his shot deflected wide right. Nothing comes of the corner, but dearie me, Southampton can\u2019t keep on like this. 50 min: Brighton triangulate prettily down the right. O\u2019Riley sends a low forensic cross through the six-yard box. Mitoma can\u2019t quote get his toe to it. Southampton still looking ragged at the back. 49 min: Ayari nicks the ball off Dibling but just as Mitoma begins tearing off towards a lightly-guarded Southampton box, the referee kindly blows for a generous free kick. 47 min: Lamptey crosses deep from the right. Welbeck competes at the far stick, to little effect. Otherwise a slow start to the half. Goal kick. Brighton get the second half underway. No changes \u2026 other than referee Rob Jones, just before the restart, swapping what looked like his whistle for a new one. Half-time pancontinental postbag. \u201cI think Mitoma\u2019s header was not quite a sitter. Very hard to get the timing right when the ball is bouncing up to you on a header. His first chance when he nicked the ball was a lot easier. Always love watching him play, particularly the fact he did his PhD in dribbling. Who knew he could score with his head too?\u201d \u2013 Calvin from Old Bar, Australia \u201cUnlike most Americans, I am not sleeping off a turkey-induced coma, just watching a bunch of football (of both persuasions). This weekend is so filled with sports, seemingly from dawn to dusk, that it can be a little overwhelming. Which is why God created wine. Sorry for the Saints, but I think this one is the Seagulls to lose\u201d \u2013 Joe Pearson \u201cWe in Brighton were at the edge of the BBC South Today region so got no coverage for about 45 years. It was all Southampton this, Portsmouth that. To be fair we were a rundown resort, and we had only Peter Ward. So we have NOTHING against the town or its people and supporters, other than a forever-deep-seated bile against those club names\u201d \u2013 Simon Wellard Half-time advertisement break. It\u2019s the big game between the Lionesses and the USWNT tomorrow. We\u2019ll have MBM coverage for you from 4pm GMT, but in the meantime allow us to whet your appetite. Brighton have been by far the better team, Saints their usual flaky defensive selves. But the visitors have shown at least some potential of scoring, so this isn\u2019t over yet. A second goal for the hosts would surely kill it, though. 45 min +4: Pedro spins Downes down the inside-left channel. Downes tries to grab a handful of his shirt, then pushes him over. He\u2019s really stress-testing his luck now. One more, surely, and he\u2019ll be off. Just a free kick, from which nothing happens. 45 min +2: Stephens, playing out from the back \u2026 well, you know what happens to his crossfield pass. It\u2019s intercepted by Mitoma, who passes infield to Pedro. A low shot is easily snaffled by Lumley, the keeper getting his team-mate out of jail. 45 min +1: Mitoma scuttles into the Saints box down the left but can\u2019t find anybody with his low cross. 45 min: There will be four additional first-half minutes. 44 min: Sugawara crosses again from the right. It\u2019s a lovely delivery that evades Julio\u2019s slide at the near post. Archer meets the ball six yards out, level with the near post, but can only shin high and wide. That\u2019s a dismal miss. That should have been the equaliser. 43 min: Sugawara bombs down the right, reaches the byline, and crosses long. Now it\u2019s Brighton\u2019s turn to allow the ball to bounce freely in their own box, and Manning, racing in from the left, has a speculative shot. He drags it into a crowded mixer, and the ball deflects out for a corner. The set piece is easily dealt with. 41 min: Lamptey and Rutter combine to win a corner down the right. O\u2019Riley takes it. Saints clear it, but Brighton soon come back at the visitors, Pedro having a whack that gets blocked the second it leaves his boot. Saints aren\u2019t quite at the hanging-on stage, but Brighton are certainly pushing for the second. 39 min: O\u2019Riley faffs around with the ball, 30 yards from his own goal, allowing Armstrong to nick the ball and tee up Fernandes for a shot. The effort is blocked by Van Hecke. Better from Saints, though the bar is not set high. 37 min: Rutter is fine to continue. When play restarts, Archer goes scampering down the right and though his cross towards Armstrong is poor, he at least wins another corner. Nothing comes of this one either, but again, at the risk of belabouring the point: Southampton\u2019s best form of defence is unquestionably attack. 35 min: Dibling tries to make something happen with a determined run down the left. Rutter slides in and nicks the ball away, but hurts his own shoulder in doing so. Play is stopped, and that\u2019s good news for Downes, who seconds later comes barging into the back of O\u2019Riley. Downes, already on a booking, wants to watch himself here. 33 min: So far this season, Southampton have lost all eight games in which they\u2019ve conceded first. The way they\u2019ve played so far tonight, they\u2019ll not be bucking that trend unless something changes quicksmart. 31 min: Walker-Peters grapples with Rutter again, this time going into the book. Also seeing yellow: the Brighton boss Fabian H\u00fcrzeler, for telling it as he sees it. That\u2019s his third booking of the season, and a touchline ban for the upcoming Fulham game. 30 min: Harwood-Bellis and Stephens on walkabout there. A huge gap in the middle of the Southampton box, the ball inexplicably allowed to bounce, teeing up Mitoma for a sitter. Walker-Peters fouls Rutter out on the right.The resulting free kick is worked upfield to Lamptey, who crosses into the Saints box. There\u2019s nobody in the middle of it. The ball bounces on the spot, then rears up for Mitoma, racing in from the left. Mitoma powers a header home, one he could hardly miss. Easy as that. A decent cross, but where was the Southampton defence? 27 min: Free kick for Saints out on the left. Manning swings it in. It\u2019s so easy for Verbruggen. Frustrated groans from the away end. \u201cWhile the Seagulls are eating many bigger clubs\u2019 lunches these heady days, it\u2019s sad to see the Saints as the league\u2019s bottom feeders,\u201d writes Justin Kavanagh. \u201cEven if Russell Martin is a Buddhist, he might get canonized if he somehow manages to keep Southhampton up this season.\u201d 26 min: Saints are winning corners, if achieving little else. Armstrong with the latest, this time down the left. Fernandes sends it in. It\u2019s half cleared. Walker-Peters tries again. That\u2019s cleared too. Verbruggen hasn\u2019t had any work to do yet. 24 min: Mitoma makes off down the left and cuts back to Estupinan, who whips a cross onto the head of Welbeck, ten yards out and level with the near post. Welbeck sends his header high and wide \u2026 but not by much. Brighton close again. 22 min: Now it\u2019s Walker-Peters\u2019 turn to thank his lucky stars for a fuss-free referee. He wrestles Pedro to the ground, and, well, you\u2019ve seen yellow flashed for less. When the game restarts, Estupinan crosses from the left, and O\u2019Riley flashes a header harmlessly over the bar from the edge of the box. 20 min: Dibling is again clipped mid-dribble, this time by Mitoma. A fussier referee might have booked the Brighton man. Fernandes swings the resulting free kick into the box from the right; it\u2019s easy pickings for Verbruggen. 18 min: Archer\u2019s shot-cum-cross from the right is deflected out for a corner. The set piece leads to some head tennis, but Brighton eventually clear their lines. Southampton\u2019s best form of defence may well be attack. 17 min: The exciting young winger Dibling advances elegantly down the inside-right channel and is stopped in cynical style by O\u2019Riley. Into the book he goes. 16 min: Brighton patiently probe \u2026 and then Rutter takes a couple of touches infield from the right and sends a rising curler across Lumley and off the left-hand post. The ball crashes away from danger. So close to the opener. 15 min: It was all Southampton for the first three minutes. Since then, that Manning cross aside, they\u2019ve barely had a touch. Brighton settling into doing what Brighton do. 14 min: Welbeck is thankfully fine to continue. 13 min: Welbeck stays down, his ankle requiring a look. On comes the physio. \u201cI know the talking point is positive about him, but I still think it\u2019s harsh to say Welbeck has \u2018quieted down\u2019 after three matches without a goal,\u201d begins Adam Becker. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t scored more than six league goals in a season since he was at United, which was a decade ago and feels even longer. I\u2019ve quite enjoyed his resurgence, I was sure Arsenal had managed a steal when getting him for so little (relatively), but it has never really come together for him. Hopefully he\u2019ll keep the form up.\u201d 12 min: Welbeck spins Harwood-Bellis with ease and strides into space down the middle. Downes clips him cynically and quite rightly goes into the book. 11 min: Fernandes rolls a pass down the left touchline for Manning, who creams a sensational low cross through the six-yard box. Had Archer not been on his heels, six yards out and level with the near post, he would surely have scored. But the ball sails on through. 9 min: It\u2019s Walker-Peters\u2019 turn to dither, and that allows Rutter to sashay in from the right, reaching the edge of the D before swivelling and firing a low screamer inches wide of the bottom-right corner. Saints are asking for big trouble here. 7 min: Archer wins a corner down the right, but from Southampton\u2019s set piece, Brighton break quickly, Pedro chasing a long ball down the middle. Sugawara looks to have the situation under control, but dithers, allowing Pedro to nick in from behind and steal off with the ball. Pedro lashes wide right with Lumley on walkabout. Saints already look like a defensive disaster waiting to happen. 5 min: Saints overplay out of defence for the first, but one would suggest not last, time tonight. Manning\u2019s misplaced backpass is nearly intercepted by Pedro, but Lumley is off his line quickly to smother. 4 min: Brighton finally get a touch after some pinball on the edge of the Saints box. O\u2019Riley attempts to release Welbeck down the inside-right with a cute backheel, but his captain can\u2019t keep the ball in play. Goal kick. 3 min: Sugawara makes good down the right again, this time slipping a pass down the wing for Archer, whose cutback is cleared by O\u2019Riley. Then a third run by the Saints wing-back, Sugawara fizzing a low ball into the arms of Verbruggen. 1 min: Sugawara steams down the right and feeds Dibling on the overlap, but the latter\u2019s cross is easily blocked and bashed clear. A positive start by Saints, though. Southampton get the ball rolling. Fans of both teams giving it plenty. A rare old roar. The teams take to the pitch. Brighton in their blue and white stripes, Southampton in third-choice pink. And it\u2019s a weekend of vivid colours all right, because it\u2019s time for Stonewall\u2019s 2024/25 Rainbow Laces campaign, showing support for the LGBT+ community through rainbow-coloured pitch flags, ball plinths, handshake boards, substitute boards, captain\u2019s armbands \u2026 and, of course, bootlaces. A fantastic atmosphere, it\u2019s Sussex by the Sea. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. Russell Martin\u2019s turn to talk to Sky. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for Joe Lumley \u2026 Alex McCarthy played through the pain barrier for us on Sunday, he\u2019d had an injection \u2026 I love and admire that about him, because he didn\u2019t have to do that, but he did \u2026 the reaction to the game has not been very good, he\u2019s had a very stiff knee this week \u2026 so we have to make big decisions \u2026 we really trust Joe \u2026 it\u2019s an amazing opportunity for him \u2026 we have certain principles we want to live by \u2026 energy and momentum is really important \u2026 when and where we flex and adapt \u2026 the feeling and temperature of the game.\u201d Fabian H\u00fcrzeler speaks to Sky Sports. \u201cWhen you watch our games you see we play in some phases very good, but in some we struggle \u2026 the next step is to play consistently for 90 minutes in all phases of the game \u2026 today we have another opportunity to prove it \u2026 we are in the right direction \u2026 the place in the table is confirmation \u2026 but the League is so unpredictable \u2026 every day is special.\u201d Pre-match postbag. It\u2019s not exactly teeming over, if we\u2019re being honest, but what we\u2019ve got is a good one. \u201cI live in Brighton and my daughter is training at Hove Park with the Russell Martin Academy as we speak. On the next pitch is a training session run by them for women in their 40s who never got the chance to play football when they were younger. The academy has also set up a school in the city for children who struggle with conventional education. I hope the fans of his home town give him a decent welcome this evening - he sounds like a genuine good egg\u201d \u2013 Tom Atkins Some more pre-match, indeed pre-weekend, Premier League reading for you. Both of these clubs featured in today\u2019s edition of Ten Talking Points. Their entries are below, painstakingly curated to save you the trouble of clicking through to the actual article and finding them for yourself. But you should go there anyway, you\u2019ll only be doing yourself out of eight other Points otherwise. Indolence never pays, kids. After six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks, with Jo\u00e3o Pedro returning from injury to resume his position as Brighton\u2019s main attacking force. Welbeck\u2019s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up two goals against Bournemouth, the captain\u2019s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian H\u00fcrzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. Taha Hashim Southampton had only six shots against Liverpool \u2013 they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. \u201cWhat was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,\u201d Arne Slot said. \u201cToday they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I\u2019m sure they will win some games.\u201d As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. Simon Burnton Breaking news \u2026 and it\u2019s something which will have some sort of effect, one way or another, on Southampton\u2019s efforts to stay in the Premier League. Here\u2019s a reminder of how the Premier League table looks heading into the Friday Night Football. Southampton were set a bottom-versus-top clash last Sunday; now they\u2019ve been handed a 20th-versus-fifth-and-potentially-second test. It\u2019s theoretically easier, but not by very much. Brighton make two changes to their starting XI after the 2-1 win at Bournemouth. Tariq Lamptey returns from injury, with Matt O\u2019Riley stepping up from the bench. Carlos Baleba is suspended after his red card at Dean Court, while Joel Veltman misses out altogether. Lewis Dunk is also back from an injury lay-off, taking a spot on the bench. Southampton make four changes after their 3-2 home defeat to Liverpool. Goalkeeper Alex McCarthy is dropped and replaced by Premier League debutant Joe Lumley. Ryan Fraser also drops to the bench, while Paul Onouachu and Adam Lallana are injured; Cameron Archer, Yukinari Sugawara and Ryan Manning take their places. Brighton &amp; Hove Albion: Verbruggen, Lamptey, van Hecke, Igor, Estupinan, O\u2019Riley, Ayari, Rutter, Joao Pedro, Mitoma, Welbeck. Subs: Steele, Dunk, Enciso, Adingra, Minteh, Wieffer, Ferguson, McConville, Slater. Southampton: Lumley, Sugawara, Walker-Peters, Harwood-Bellis, Stephens, Manning, Dibling, Downes, Fernandes, Armstrong, Archer. Subs: McCarthy, Aribo, Edwards, Bree, Wood-Gordon, Brereton, Sulemana, Fraser, Amo-Ameyaw. Referee: Rob Jones VAR: Jarred Gillett A score draw will send Brighton &amp; Hove Albion into second place in the Premier League tonight, but even a win wouldn\u2019t lift Southampton off the bottom of the table. Given that Brighton, currently fifth in the league, are unbeaten in five against the Saints, and dispatched champions Manchester City in their last fixture at the Amex, you\u2019d have the hosts down as hot favourites tonight. Which they probably are. But Southampton gave a good account of themselves against table-topping Liverpool last weekend, and if they\u2019re able to maintain that level of performance, a second win of the season would be perfectly possible. So while this south-coast derby isn\u2019t exactly poised delicately, it\u2019s not a total home banker either. Kick-off is at 8pm GMT. It\u2019s on!",

Performance has to be perfect, availability of your squad has to be perfect, things have to go your way and the opposition, the level is different, and it\u2019s so hard to win.\u201d Victory for Liverpool over City on Sunday would take them 11 points clear of the champions with just over a third of the season completed. But Arteta, having been top for almost 250 days before being overhauled by Guardiola\u2019s side two seasons ago, warned that it would not be easy for them to maintain that momentum for the whole campaign. \u201cWe\u2019ve been there and to sustain it for 10 months is extremely difficult \u2013 everything has to go your way,\u201d he said. \u201cJust when you think you have it, plop! Everything collapses. Results can change through injuries, decisions and it can happen at any moment. You have to be ready for that but it\u2019s something you can\u2019t always control. All you can control is to do our very best.\u201d Asked whether Arsenal had the best-equipped squad to reel Liverpool in, he said: \u201cI really believe in my team, yes.\u201d",

Given that Tuesday\u2019s second leg is in Helsinki, Finland are probably slight favourites to reach next summer\u2019s finals in Switzerland after Scotland\u2019s worrying lack of creativity let them down. \u201cWe did well with the dirty part of the game,\u201d said the home manager, Pedro Mart\u00ednez Losa, whose side extended their unbeaten run to nine games. \u201cIf we keep defending like that we\u2019ll just need one opportunity to win in Finland.\u201d Chances were certainly at a premium in this rather nervy duel.

Anyway, welcome to Anfield!</p> <p>Even if City\u2019s predicament feels reassuringly short-term \u2013 still second in the table, with the opportunity to move within five points of Arne Slot\u2019s Liverpool team on Sunday afternoon, injured players still to return \u2013 then the circumstances that created it are anything but. In a way the freshest iteration of English football\u2019s newest blue-chip rivalry is a chance to examine why these two clubs seem to have ended up on violently different trajectories.</p> <p>After all, it was Liverpool who were supposed to be in their rebuilding phase, City the model of stability and calm, Liverpool the club prone to lavish fluctuations in form and intensity, City the cold winning machine harvesting points without ever really seeming to get out of fourth gear.

Kalvin Phillips, Matheus Nunes, Mateo Kovacic arrived in the 2022 and 2023 summers for a combined outlay of more than \u00a3100m.

Nunes is not good enough; Kovacic not fit enough; Phillips neither good enough nor fit enough; G\u00fcndogan a shuffling 34-year-old with all of the cleverness but none of the sharpness he possessed in his prime.</p> <p>You can go through some of City\u2019s other recent transfer business picking out similar anomalies. The spectacularly misguided call to let Cole Palmer go to Chelsea after giving him three Premier League starts in three seasons. Allowing Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez to leave in the summer with no obvious replacement, and thus placing pretty much the entire striking burden on Haaland.</p> <p>Of course injuries have been an issue this season.

James McAtee? Bernardo Silva on Oscar Bobb\u2019s shoulders?</p> <p>Liverpool, by contrast, have built resilience in almost every position. Obviously players such as Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk are largely irreplaceable. But their absence would not in itself force a change of style or approach.

      "bodyText": "MPs have taken a historic step toward legalising assisted dying in England and Wales by backing a bill that would give some terminally ill people the right to end their own lives. Campaigners in favour of the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill said it was a significant move towards giving people more choice over the way they die, after the Commons backed the bill by 330 votes for to 275 against. Brought by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, the bill would give terminally ill adults with less than six months to live the right to die once the request has been signed off by two doctors and a high court judge. It still has further steps to go through before becoming law, and supporters believe assisted dying will not be an option for those with a terminal diagnosis for at least three years. The vote, which is the first on the issue for almost a decade, split the political parties and the cabinet. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves voted in favour alongside prominent opposition MPs such as Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt. Those voting against included Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister; Wes Streeting, the health secretary; Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader; and Nigel Farage, the Reform leader. During the five-hour debate, the Commons heard impassioned pleas on both sides. MPs recounted personal experiences of illness and death, and appeals they had heard from their constituents on assisted dying. Esther Rantzen, who galvanised the debate on assisted dying last December after revealing she had lung cancer, said the bill offered everyone \u201cequal choice\u201d. She said: \u201cThose who don\u2019t want an assisted death and don\u2019t want to take part in providing assisted dying can opt out of it, don\u2019t have to do it, don\u2019t choose to end their lives that way. So it offers everyone equal choice, whatever their religion.\u201d Kit Malthouse, who made an impassioned speech in favour of the legislation, said parliament had taken a \u201csignificant first step\u201d and called for the government to now dedicate more parliamentary time to consideration to the bill. According to recent polling, three-quarters of the public back a change in the law. Opponents of the move expressed disappointment and were downbeat about the prospects of it being significantly changed at later stages of its passage through parliament to increase safeguards against the risk of coercion. Labour\u2019s Diane Abbott, the longest-serving female MP, who spoke and voted against the change, said: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that the bill is going forward. But many of the people that spoke in favour of the bill seem to think that it can be drastically changed in committee. It\u2019s not going to be drastically changed in committee, and the question for them is: what do they do at report [stage]?\u201d Figures involved in the hospice and end-of-life care sector who are neutral on the issue called for urgent funding and reform of palliative care to make sure patients have a real choice when dying. The bill must pass several more hurdles in parliament and will not be brought before MPs again until April. The government is now likely to assign a minister to help work on the bill, without formally giving its support. After that it must be voted on again by MPs and go through the House of Lords.

The health secretary is not expected to now take the lead in working on the legislation at its next stage.

How is that more humane than a medically sanctioned death at home? Some terminally ill people are going to want to kill themselves regardless. This bill was for them, said Leadbeater.</p> <p>Oliver Dowden interrupted to suggest that judges would inevitably seek to expand the scope of the bill. He seemed to think that all judges were natural born killers. Not content with dispatching the terminally ill, they would soon start working their way through the perfectly well. Weirdly, when it came to the vote, Olive walked through the aye lobby. There again, maybe he thinks it\u2019s a good thing that judges kill as many people as possible. It\u2019s a view, I suppose.</p> <p>Speaking in opposition to the bill, the Conservative MP Danny Kruger began by saying he was mindful of those whose lives would be prolonged against their wishes. His solution was better palliative and hospice care. Which sounded great. Except no government has ever been prepared to fund that properly. There just aren\u2019t enough to go round. And added to this, there are limits to palliative care. There are some conditions that morphine can\u2019t touch. The pain excruciating. And many people don\u2019t want to die in a state of semi-consciousness.</p> <p>Danny also had it in for doctors. They too were basically killers at heart. Never come across a patient they didn\u2019t think wouldn\u2019t be better off dead. Best not to give doctors any more excuse than they had now. Going to see his GP must be a troubling experience for him. Never know quite whether you\u2019re going to get out alive.</p> <p>The quality of debate was uniformly high. Labour\u2019s Florence Eshalomi and the Conservative Kit Malthouse excelled while arguing for opposite sides. The veteran Tory MP David Davis made the case for keeping the debate going by voting for the bill. Otherwise it would be dropped for at least a decade. Amendments could be made at later stages for those worried about inconsistencies or mission creep.</p> <p>There were exceptions though. James Cleverly \u2013 yet again disproving nominative determinism \u2013 argued that if the bill was so good, why didn\u2019t we extend it to children. Really. Honest Bob Jenrick used his time to have another go at ECHR. Everything that\u2019s wrong in his world starts at Strasbourg. The independent Adnan Hussain thought we had already started assisted dying by removing the winter fuel allowance. For the only time in the debate, cries of \u201cshame\u201d were heard.</p> <p>Shortly before the debate wound up, Keir Starmer finally turned up in the Commons fresh from summarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/29/assisted-dying-vote-louise-haigh-keir-starmer-latest-politics-updates-news-live?page=with:block-67496d2f8f0816561c49e81b\">sacking the transport secretary, Louise Haigh</a>. Once the votes had been announced by the speaker there was a brief moment of immanence. When time seemed to stand still. No one quite able to believe what they had done. A change under way as momentous as equal marriage and the abolition of the death penalty. Esther Rantzen gave a statement on TV. The Commons then reverted to debating ferrets.

And many people don\u2019t want to die in a state of semi-consciousness. Danny also had it in for doctors. They too were basically killers at heart. Never come across a patient they didn\u2019t think wouldn\u2019t be better off dead. Best not to give doctors any more excuse than they had now. Going to see his GP must be a troubling experience for him. Never know quite whether you\u2019re going to get out alive. The quality of debate was uniformly high. Labour\u2019s Florence Eshalomi and the Conservative Kit Malthouse excelled while arguing for opposite sides. The veteran Tory MP David Davis made the case for keeping the debate going by voting for the bill. Otherwise it would be dropped for at least a decade. Amendments could be made at later stages for those worried about inconsistencies or mission creep. There were exceptions though. James Cleverly \u2013 yet again disproving nominative determinism \u2013 argued that if the bill was so good, why didn\u2019t we extend it to children. Really. Honest Bob Jenrick used his time to have another go at ECHR. Everything that\u2019s wrong in his world starts at Strasbourg. The independent Adnan Hussain thought we had already started assisted dying by removing the winter fuel allowance. For the only time in the debate, cries of \u201cshame\u201d were heard. Shortly before the debate wound up, Keir Starmer finally turned up in the Commons fresh from summarily sacking the transport secretary, Louise Haigh. Once the votes had been announced by the speaker there was a brief moment of immanence. When time seemed to stand still. No one quite able to believe what they had done. A change under way as momentous as equal marriage and the abolition of the death penalty. Esther Rantzen gave a statement on TV. The Commons then reverted to debating ferrets. Keeping it real.

The 2009 report Tax by Design\u201d for the IFS recognised the strong case for LVT, advocating it in the foreseeable future as a replacement for business rates. That would be a good start. In a Financial Times article in August, the eminent economist Charles Goodhart looked further ahead and urged Reeves to deal with the UK\u2019s \u00a322bn deficit by raising \u201cthe bulk, if not all, of the required revenue from a tax on land ownership\u201d over a period of years, and noted the \u201coverwhelming case for a land tax\u201d made by the most prominent economists. There is indeed a better solution if the chancellor is prepared to listen. John Digney Buchlyvie, Stirling \u2022 Do you have a photograph you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

      "bodyText": "The government has thrown its weight behind a bill to crack down on puppy smuggling as part of a commitment to strengthening animal welfare. Ministers announced on Friday that they were supporting a private member\u2019s bill sponsored by Danny Chambers, a Liberal Democrat MP and veterinary surgeon, to crack down on the pet-smuggling trade. The move is intended to deliver on a Labour manifesto pledge to tackle puppy smuggling by closing loopholes in the law that are exploited by unscrupulous traders. The bill will give the government powers to ban the import of puppies and kittens less than six months old, and dogs and cats that are mutilated or heavily pregnant. The animal welfare (import of dogs, cats and ferrets) bill will also make it more difficult and less profitable for traders to fraudulently import animals for sale by passing them off as pets travelling with their owners. The number of pets involved in \u201cnon-commercial\u201d moves to the UK rose from 100,000 in 2011 to more than 320,000 in 2023, triggering fears of fraudulent activity. Previous governments have sought to strengthen protections in the past but met obstacles. An animal welfare bill championed by Boris Johnson\u2019s government that would have imposed curbs on puppy imports was shelved in 2023.

      "body": "<p>A two-year-old girl who drowned in a bin containing 9cm of water in a back garden in east London was a victim of \u201cgross failures\u201d largely by social workers, a coroner has concluded at an inquest.</p> <p>At the time of her death, Mazeedat Adeoye was being cared for in Dagenham by an acquaintance of her mother, Balikis Adeoye, who had to stay in hospital with Mazeedat\u2019s baby brother when he required urgent heart surgery.</p> <p>Adeoye had asked social workers at Newham council if they could provide foster care for her daughter for 10 days during the hospital stay.</p> <p>She had come to the UK on a visitor visa with Mazeedat in spring 2021 to join her partner but the relationship ended in May that year and she overstayed her visa, which expired in September 2021, because she had no means to return home. She was not eligible for state support, a status referred to as \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d (NRPF).</p> <p>The NRPF team at the council declined to provide foster care and told Adeoye to look for someone \u201cin her community\u201d who could look after her daughter. A woman from a local mosque agreed to take care of the child until Adeoye and her son left the hospital.</p> <p>The senior coroner for east London, Graeme Irvine, found that while playing alone and inadequately supervised in the woman\u2019s back garden, Mazeedat fell head first into a plastic refuse bin that contained water. Despite the water\u2019s depth being no more than 9cm, Mazeedat drowned.

      "bodyText": "A two-year-old girl who drowned in a bin containing 9cm of water in a back garden in east London was a victim of \u201cgross failures\u201d largely by social workers, a coroner has concluded at an inquest. At the time of her death, Mazeedat Adeoye was being cared for in Dagenham by an acquaintance of her mother, Balikis Adeoye, who had to stay in hospital with Mazeedat\u2019s baby brother when he required urgent heart surgery. Adeoye had asked social workers at Newham council if they could provide foster care for her daughter for 10 days during the hospital stay. She had come to the UK on a visitor visa with Mazeedat in spring 2021 to join her partner but the relationship ended in May that year and she overstayed her visa, which expired in September 2021, because she had no means to return home. She was not eligible for state support, a status referred to as \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d (NRPF). The NRPF team at the council declined to provide foster care and told Adeoye to look for someone \u201cin her community\u201d who could look after her daughter. A woman from a local mosque agreed to take care of the child until Adeoye and her son left the hospital. The senior coroner for east London, Graeme Irvine, found that while playing alone and inadequately supervised in the woman\u2019s back garden, Mazeedat fell head first into a plastic refuse bin that contained water. Despite the water\u2019s depth being no more than 9cm, Mazeedat drowned. Irvine described the case as \u201cparticularly harrowing\u201d. This is the first death of a child thought to be linked to NRPF. In his conclusion, Irvine said: \u201cThere was a missed opportunity to provide effective care in the form of an offer of a temporary fostering placement which would have probably resulted in the avoidance of Mazeedat\u2019s death \u2026 Local authority children\u2019s services failed to support Mazeedat.\u201d He said some of the social workers who failed to support the family were \u201cobdurate and stubborn\u201d. \u201cBalikis Adeoye was treated in a dehumanising way on account of her status in the UK,\u201d the coroner said.

Keir Starmer and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, voted in favour while Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, and Wes Streeting, the health secretary, voted against. The private member\u2019s bill, brought by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, would give terminally ill adults with less than six months to live the right to die once the request has been signed off by two doctors and a high court judge. Campaigners in favour of the change said the vote was a momentous step forward. Esther Rantzen, who galvanised the debate on assisted dying last December when she revealed she had terminal lung cancer, said the bill offered everyone \u201cequal choice\u201d. But some of the MPs who were voting for the bill said that, if they are not happy with what emerges after the bill gets revised in committee and at report stage, they could vote against at third reading. And <strong>Care Not Killing</strong>, the group campaigning against the bill, said it was \u201chugely encouraged that the more MPs hear about assisted suicide and euthanasia the more they turn against changing the law\u201d.

Seven times since 2010, a Tory-dominated parliament voted down bill after bill on the right to die, regardless of public opinion. Almost all progressive social reforms have trailed behind the public in this way: parliament is very rarely the standard bearer. In fact, it is usually the foot-dragger, timid unless absolutely certain what its constituents think. Abortion had long been strongly supported before parliament finally caught up. Divorce law had become an absurd farce for decades \u2013 good business for private detectives who were hired to dash into a hotel bedroom to snap a husband in bed with a hired actor to prove his \u201cfault\u201d before a couple could legally part.</p> \n   <p>Banning capital punishment was the standout exception, when a new Labour government in 1965 dared to defy a public that was <a href=\"https://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/resources/sixty-years-public-opinion-about-crime-and-punishment\">still in favour</a>. Afterwards, the Commons held a vote in every parliament until 1997 calling to restore the death penalty, always defeated.

Some are travelling to Switzerland, if they have the money and mobility to do so. Others are dying in traumatic circumstances by suicide, assisted or otherwise.

In a statement on today\u2019s vote, Thea Stein, its chief executive, says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As this bill progresses through parliament, MPs will need to carefully consider how such a change in the law would interact with the NHS and social care. There are large unanswered questions around funding, staffing and equity if this bill becomes law. <br> In particular, it is still unclear whether or not assisted dying would be fully publicly funded. If it is, it will sit alongside services like social care and hospice care which are not. Both of these services are financially on the brink and MPs will need to understand how current threadbare provision will interact with this new service, what implications this may have for people paying for social care, and how to fund assisted dying from a health budget that is already overstretched. If assisted dying is not publicly funded then it will be difficult for the bill to achieve its aim of improving choice for all patients. These are crucial questions to address in the next stage. </p> \n   <p>MPs will also need to scrutinise and debate the staffing and regulatory questions this throws up. Will NHS trusts be able or expected to provide this service? Will medical professionals carry out this work privately or as part of their NHS contract? Who will regulate this service? And what changes will be needed to training and education to ensure staff have the skills and knowledge to deliver it?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-29T15:50:15.971Z\">at 3.50pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6749dd9d8f088c7046fdfbad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-29T15:32:06.240Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6749d7ea8f088c7046fdfb53\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-29T15:14:15.798Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lammy says he voted against bill recalling his mum, and how she worried about being financial burden when terminally ill</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>David Lammy,</strong> the foreign secretary, has just released a letter to his constituents explaining why he voted against the assisted dying bill.

I know from speaking and listening to many of you, that too many people have to go through painful, traumatic, drawn-out deaths. These moving, deeply personal stories have left a profound impression on me. This bill will make these ordeals, which are so traumatic for patients and their families, less frequent: it will reduce suffering. The worry with legislation such as this is always that it could be abused, used to pressure people into ending their lives; or as a way to remove those who are perceived as a burden to the state or their family. But my judgement is that this bill is sufficiently tightly drawn to prevent that. Pressuring someone into ending their life will be a criminal offence and under this bill, people can only request help to die if they have a terminal disease that they will pass away from within the next 6 months in the independent, professional opinion of two doctors.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6749d38a8f088c7046fdfb15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-29T14:46:52.855Z\">2.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the graphic <a href=\"https://votes.parliament.uk/votes/commons/division/1877#ayes\">from the Commons website</a> illustrating the voting.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6749d0548f086137725676cc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-29T14:41:42.696Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">How MPs voted on assisted dying bill, by party affiliation</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are the number of MPs voting by party.</p> \n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://votes.parliament.uk/votes/commons/division/1877#ayes\">For the bill</a></strong></p> \n  <p>Conservatives: 23</p> \n  <p>Independent: 1</p> \n  <p>Greens: 4</p> \n  <p>Labour: 234</p> \n  <p>Lib Dems: 61</p> \n  <p>Plaid Cymru: 3</p> \n  <p>Reform UK: 3</p> \n  <p>SDLP: 1</p> \n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://votes.parliament.uk/votes/commons/division/1877#noes\">Against the bill</a></strong></p> \n  <p>Alliance: 1</p> \n  <p>Conservatives: 92</p> \n  <p>DUP: 5</p> \n  <p>Independents: 14</p> \n  <p>Labour: 147</p> \n  <p>Lib Dems: 11</p> \n  <p>Plaid Cymru: 1</p> \n  <p>Reform UK: 2</p> \n  <p>TUV: 1</p> \n  <p>UUP: 1</p> \n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://votes.parliament.uk/votes/commons/division/1877#notrecorded\">Did not vote</a></strong></p> \n  <p>Conservatives: 3</p> \n  <p>Deputy Speakers: 3</p> \n  <p>Labour: 18</p> \n  <p>SNP: 9</p> \n  <p>Sinn F\u00eain: 7</p> \n  <p>SDLP: 1</p> \n  <p>Speaker: 1</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6749d0248f0816561c49ecf6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-29T14:31:27.477Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The division list for the vote is now <a href=\"https://votes.parliament.uk/votes/commons/division/1877\">on the Commons\u2019 website.</a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6749cf9f8f0816561c49eceb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-29T14:30:44.148Z\">2.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Keir Starmer was seen having a chat with Nigel Farage in the chamber as the division was taking place.

Keir Starmer voted for assisted dying in 2015, as director of public prosecutions he issued landmark guidance intended to clarify in what circumstances someone helping a relative to die for compassionate reasons might avoid prosecution and he has said recently he supports legislation in principle.

      "bodyText": "MPs have taken a historic step toward legalising assisted dying in England and Wales after backing a bill that would give some terminally ill people the right to end their lives. As Jessica Elgot, Eleni Courea and Rowena Mason report, the Commons backed the bill by 330 votes in favour to 275 against, a majority of 55. Keir Starmer and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, voted in favour while Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, and Wes Streeting, the health secretary, voted against. The private member\u2019s bill, brought by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, would give terminally ill adults with less than six months to live the right to die once the request has been signed off by two doctors and a high court judge. Campaigners in favour of the change said the vote was a momentous step forward. Esther Rantzen, who galvanised the debate on assisted dying last December when she revealed she had terminal lung cancer, said the bill offered everyone \u201cequal choice\u201d. But some of the MPs who were voting for the bill said that, if they are not happy with what emerges after the bill gets revised in committee and at report stage, they could vote against at third reading. And Care Not Killing, the group campaigning against the bill, said it was \u201chugely encouraged that the more MPs hear about assisted suicide and euthanasia the more they turn against changing the law\u201d. Here is a guide from the Institute for Government to what comes next in the parliamentary process. And here is a guide to what comes next from Kiran Stacey that focuses on the wider politics. (See 3.57pm.) Louise Haigh was advised to resign by No 10 for a possible breach of the ministerial code, after she did not declare her spent conviction for fraud to the government when she became a cabinet minister. Luke Tryl, UK director for the More in Common campaign group, points out that it would only take 28 MPs supporting the bill today to change their mind for the bill to fall at third reading. Reasonable majority, at top of what projected. But will only take 28 MPs to be dissatisfied with what emerges from committee/report stage for Bill to fall at 3rd reading. Debate continues &amp; if/whether meeting public\u2019s high expectations on safeguarding can be met will now be key. Danny Kruger, the Tory MP who led opposition to the bill in the Commons today, said that while he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d to lose the vote, he was encouraged by how many people have concerns about the bill. He told PA Media: I was reassured that so many colleagues recognised that the bill is very dangerous, there\u2019s lots of problems with it and they have said they want to improve it in committee. I want to help them do that and I hope we can make substantial improvements before it comes back for third reading, and I hope that if it\u2019s not good enough, if the safeguards are not strengthened, then colleagues will vote against it before it comes into law. One of the striking features of what happened in the Commons today was the quality of the debate. Normally speeches in the chamber range between OK and dull/dire, partly because votes are whipped and MPs know what they say won\u2019t make any difference. Today people were listening intently, and there were many very good speeches, often personal and moving. There was no party politics at all (which was a bonus). And there was a lot of passion, but with little or no rancour, bitterness or scorn, which is highly unusual. The journalist and writer Ian Dunt has a good account in a blog on his Substack account. Here is an extract. One after another, I saw MPs who I had not previously admired give some of the best parliamentary speeches I have ever seen. \u201cThe deathbed for far too many is a source of misery, torture and degradation,\u201d Tory MP Kit Malthouse said. \u201cA reign of blood and vomit and tears. I see no compassion and beauty in that, only profound human suffering.\u201d He spoke of a man who had been reduced to committing suicide by walking in front of a train. He had waited until 2am so he could minimise the interference to commuters. For some reason I found this act so affecting I was temporarily overcome with emotion. Dame Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill and who secured a promise from Keir Starmer before the election that he would allow a vote on assisted dying, has said she is \u201cabsolutely thrilled\u201d with the result of the vote. She told PA Media: I listened to the debate and it was very deeply felt. Members of Parliament, whether they opposed it or proposed it, had obviously given it a great deal of thought, and right up to the end of the debate, I had no idea whether it would be voted through or not. And here is footage of Rantzen discussing the result in a call with her daughter, Rebecca Wilcox, and Paul Brand from ITV News. Charities have renewed their calls for better palliative care in the light of today\u2019s vote on assisted dying. This is from Matthew Reed, chief executive of Marie Curie, an end of life charity. Marie Curie remains neutral on the matter of assisted dying, but what we are absolutely not neutral on is the need to urgently fix end of life care. In recent weeks, many MPs have acknowledged the importance of palliative care. The secretary of state for health and social care himself has even said that existing palliative care isn\u2019t good enough. But warm words won\u2019t fix our broken end of life care system. The bill says nothing about the urgent need to improve existing provision. It says nothing about the postcode lottery for access to end of life care, nothing about the funding crisis, and nothing about people spending their final moments in A&amp;E because our health system can\u2019t offer them the care and support they need, in or out of hours \u2026 As this bill progresses, we will be encouraging parliamentarians to amend the bill to ensure that it sets out the improvements that must be made to our palliative care system. And this is from James Sanderson, chief executive of the palliative care and bereavement charity, Sue Ryder. Ahead of the vote on assisted dying, the health secretary recognised the need to strengthen end-of-life care, and the prime minister said he would invest in it regardless of the result. The government cannot now backtrack. It must fix end of life care. As the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill progresses, MPs have a duty to ensure no one feels an assisted death is their only option simply because the care they need isn\u2019t available. We found that 77% of people felt either a few, some or most terminally ill people would be put in this position. Now is the time for change. Polly Toynbee argues that it has taken the House of Commons too long to vote for assisted dying, saying previous bills have been voted down repeatedly since 2010. (See 4.09am.) In fact, the campaign goes back well beyond that. Here is an article from the Guardian archive about the formation of the Voluntary Euthanasia (Easy Death) Legalisation Society and plans for a bill. It was written in October 1935. At the time the Guardian also published an editorial about the bill, which sounds remarkably similar to the Kim Leadbeater legislation. We were in favour (more or less). \u201cNo one who knows of the terrible suffering which incurable illness may bring in its train can doubt that this proposal deserves the most searching considering from every citizen,\u201d the editorial said. Sadly, as occasionally happens, a Guardian endorsement was not enough to persuade parliament. The bill was defeated in the Lords in 1936 by 35 votes to 14. Here is Polly Toynbee\u2019s column on today\u2019s vote. She says the Commons has finally caught up with public opinion. Here is an extract. How long this has taken. Seven times since 2010, a Tory-dominated parliament voted down bill after bill on the right to die, regardless of public opinion. Almost all progressive social reforms have trailed behind the public in this way: parliament is very rarely the standard bearer. In fact, it is usually the foot-dragger, timid unless absolutely certain what its constituents think. Abortion had long been strongly supported before parliament finally caught up. Divorce law had become an absurd farce for decades \u2013 good business for private detectives who were hired to dash into a hotel bedroom to snap a husband in bed with a hired actor to prove his \u201cfault\u201d before a couple could legally part. Banning capital punishment was the standout exception, when a new Labour government in 1965 dared to defy a public that was still in favour. Afterwards, the Commons held a vote in every parliament until 1997 calling to restore the death penalty, always defeated. Public opinion on this is now against restoration. Gay rights and civil partnerships broke through the barriers only with very strong public support. Here again, citizens were way out ahead. And here is Polly\u2019s full article. Humanists UK have welcomed the result of the vote. This is from its chief executive, Andrew Copson. Parliament has taken a historic first step to meet the aspirations of the public, who overwhelmingly support having choice, dignity, and compassion at the end of their lives. We welcome this and look forward to working further on the legislation. As the bill goes through further stages and detail is debated, detailed questions of eligibility, process, and safeguards obviously remain on the table, but this is a historic bill which would give many suffering people the choice and dignity they desire and deserve. The fact of the matter is that assisted dying is already happening in this country. Some are travelling to Switzerland, if they have the money and mobility to do so. Others are dying in traumatic circumstances by suicide, assisted or otherwise. Many more are suffering greatly, even while receiving the best possible care. This vote shows that MPs see the need to introduce real safeguards to our law where there are currently none. Care Not Killing, which campaigns against assisted dying and in favour of better palliative care, says it is disappointed by the result of the vote, but encouraged by how many MPs are expressing reservations about the legislation. In a statement Gordon Macdonald, its chief executive, said: We are naturally disappointed at the vote, but have been hugely encouraged that the more MPs hear about assisted suicide and euthanasia the more they turn against changing the law and rightly want the government to focus on fixing the UK\u2019s broken palliative care system. The Nuffield Trust, a health thinktank, says there are many questions to be answered as the bill progresses through parliament about how assisted dying might work. In a statement on today\u2019s vote, Thea Stein, its chief executive, says: As this bill progresses through parliament, MPs will need to carefully consider how such a change in the law would interact with the NHS and social care. There are large unanswered questions around funding, staffing and equity if this bill becomes law. In particular, it is still unclear whether or not assisted dying would be fully publicly funded. If it is, it will sit alongside services like social care and hospice care which are not. Both of these services are financially on the brink and MPs will need to understand how current threadbare provision will interact with this new service, what implications this may have for people paying for social care, and how to fund assisted dying from a health budget that is already overstretched. If assisted dying is not publicly funded then it will be difficult for the bill to achieve its aim of improving choice for all patients. These are crucial questions to address in the next stage. MPs will also need to scrutinise and debate the staffing and regulatory questions this throws up. Will NHS trusts be able or expected to provide this service? Will medical professionals carry out this work privately or as part of their NHS contract? Who will regulate this service? And what changes will be needed to training and education to ensure staff have the skills and knowledge to deliver it? David Lammy, the foreign secretary, has just released a letter to his constituents explaining why he voted against the assisted dying bill. He says he worries that, if assisted dying had been allowed when his mother was dying, she might have taken if as an option to avoid being a financial burden on her family in her final months. Cabinet ministers were asked not to try to sway the debate on assisted dying before the vote today, because the government is meant to be neutral, and so presumably Lammy held back his comments until now in keeping with that guidance. Other cabinet ministers were more willing to get stuck in. Here is video of the moment the result was announced. Six cabinet ministers were among the Labour MPs voting against the bill: Angela Rayner, deputy PM; David Lammy, foreign secretary; Wes Streeting, health secretary; Shabana Mahmood, justice secretary; Bridget Phillipson, education secretary; and Jonathan Reynolds, business secretary. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and Anneliese Dodds, the development minister, also voted against. They both attend cabinet, but are not full cabinet ministers. Rishi Sunak was one of the 23 Tory MPs who voted for the bill. But until today he had not commented on the issue. He has now published an article for the Darlington and Stockton Times explaining why he is in favour. Here is an extract. I believe that, where possible, we should prevent suffering. I know from speaking and listening to many of you, that too many people have to go through painful, traumatic, drawn-out deaths. These moving, deeply personal stories have left a profound impression on me. This bill will make these ordeals, which are so traumatic for patients and their families, less frequent: it will reduce suffering. The worry with legislation such as this is always that it could be abused, used to pressure people into ending their lives; or as a way to remove those who are perceived as a burden to the state or their family. But my judgement is that this bill is sufficiently tightly drawn to prevent that. Pressuring someone into ending their life will be a criminal offence and under this bill, people can only request help to die if they have a terminal disease that they will pass away from within the next 6 months in the independent, professional opinion of two doctors. Here is the graphic from the Commons website illustrating the voting. Here are the number of MPs voting by party. For the bill Conservatives: 23 Independent: 1 Greens: 4 Labour: 234 Lib Dems: 61 Plaid Cymru: 3 Reform UK: 3 SDLP: 1 Against the bill Alliance: 1 Conservatives: 92 DUP: 5 Independents: 14 Labour: 147 Lib Dems: 11 Plaid Cymru: 1 Reform UK: 2 TUV: 1 UUP: 1 Did not vote Conservatives: 3 Deputy Speakers: 3 Labour: 18 SNP: 9 Sinn F\u00eain: 7 SDLP: 1 Speaker: 1 The division list for the vote is now on the Commons\u2019 website. Keir Starmer was seen having a chat with Nigel Farage in the chamber as the division was taking place. This is from the i\u2019s Eleanor Langford. Keir Starmer is now in the Chamber having just cast his vote on the assisted dying bill He had a quick chat with Nigel Farage before taking his seat on the front bench Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, says the Commons is now moving on to deal with a bill about ferrets (the animal welfare [import of dogs, cats and ferrets] bill \u2013 another private member\u2019s bill, tabled by Danny Chambers) and he suggests some MPs might want to leave the chamber. Kim Leadbeater, sponsor of the bill, is moving a motion saying the public bill committee for the bill should have the power to take evidence. That goes through on the nod. (Normally government bills committees have this power, but not committees dealing with private members\u2019 bills.) The Speaker is reading out the results: Ayes: 330 Noes: 275 Keir Starmer has voted for the bill. The tellers for the ayes are Sarah Owen and Bambos Charalambous. And the tellers for the noes are Harriett Baldwin and Florence Eshalomi. MPs are now voting. This is the second reading division. Kit Malthouse stood up and moved \u201cthat that question now be put\u201d. That is a closure motion. When MPs are debating private member\u2019s bill, supporters often have to call a closure motion vote to stop the debate being talked out and to ensure that the house can move on to a proper vote. Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, called the closure motion by acclamation. No one opposed it, and so he moved on immediately to the second reading vote. Alex Davies-Jones, a justice minister, is winding up now the government. She says she is speaking not as a constituency MP, but as a minister in the department responsible for the administration of the law. She will not express her personal views now, she says. But she will be voting, she says. If MPs vote for the bill, the government will \u201crespect its duty to the statute book\u201d and ensure any bill is workable. She pays tribute to the way Kim Leadbeater has campaigned on this, and argued her case with respect and dignity. Two frontbenchers are now winding up. Kieran Mullan, a shadow justice minister, is summing up for the opposition. But it is a free vote, so there is no party position to sum up. Mullan says even the best pain relief cannot help some people who are dying. But he also acknowledges that opponents of the bill, who place a premium on the sanctity of life, have a good argument. He says MPs should vote with humility, and with respect for each vote cast, in whichever direction. If you want to read the debate, Hansard will have full transcript online here. At this point the online version covers all speeches up to Kit Malthouse\u2019s. The transcript is normally about three hours behind proceedings in the Commons. The whole thing should be up by 5.30pm. Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, calls Vikki Slade, the Lib Dem MP. He says hers will be the final speech before the wind-ups. Kim Leadbeater makes a point of order. She says she wants to correct the record. She says in her speech earlier she said she had consulted the medical profession and the judiciary at the highest levels. She says she has been in correspondent with the Judicial Office. But she says the serving judiciary have not expressed a view on the bill, and she wants to make that clear. The Labour MP Florence Eshalomi said that she was opposed to the bill in part because minority groups would be particularly vulnerable. She explained: We must recognise the hard truth that health inequalities are wide and persistent. We know that black and minority ethnic disabled people have far worse health outcomes than the national average. I\u2019ve seen this first-hand, caring for my mother who suffered with sickle cell anaemia. As a teenager, I would be by her side when she was in excruciating pain, explaining to a doctor who would not believe her when she told them she needed lifesaving medication, and sadly this is still the reality today. I am reminded of the death of Evan Smith on April 25 [2019] at North Middlesex Hospital. Evan suffered from sickle cell too. He was in so much pain that he had to ring 999 from his hospital bed because he was denied oxygen and basic care by the doctors. Put simply: we should be helping people to live comfortable, pain-free lives on their own terms before we think about making it easier for them to die \u2026 How can we be possibly satisfied that this bill would deliver equality and freedom in death when we do not yet have this in life? The Green party MP Si\u00e2n Berry told MPs in the debate that she was in favour of the bill. While we don\u2019t have to choose between this Bill and better palliative care, we do have to give dying people the right to choose which ending is right for them, so please, please vote for this bill today. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, told MPs that he was opposed to the bill and that, if it passed, \u201cactivist judges in Strasbourg\u201d would change it. He explained: Let\u2019s think about the role of judges. The test which is to be applied is a low one, it\u2019s the civil law threshold, this is a balance of probabilities. This means a judge could see real risk of coercion and still sign-off this individual for assisted death; if the threshold was not reached of 50% or more, the judge would sign-off the individual. I worry, in fact I am as certain as night follows day, this law if passed will change. Not as a result of the individuals in this chamber or in the Lords, but as a result of judges in other places. We\u2019ve seen that time and again. It may be on either side of the debate but it will happen. This act, if passed, will be subject to activist judges in Strasbourg [where the European court of human rights is based]. They will change it fundamentally and we have to be prepared for that. I don\u2019t want to see that happen. Jenrick was speaking from the backbenches, not as a party spokesperson. But when he was standing to be Conservative leader, calling for withdrawal from the ECHR was his most important policy proposal. John Hayes (Con) told MPs that he was against the bill because it would change the relationship between patients and doctors. This bill changes the relationship between clinicians and patients forever. It says to the NHS, your job is not only protect and preserve life, it is sometimes to take life. I am not prepared for our NHS to be changed in that way, and beyond that it changes society\u2019s view of what life and death is all about. There are many cruel and spiteful and ruthless and unkind people in the world and there are many vulnerable and frail people, and when those two collide, it\u2019s not a good outcome for the second of those groups. Alicia Kearns (Con) told MPs that her mother\u2019s experience of cancer made her support assisted dying. Imagine a situation where you have cancer that day by day is breaking every individual vertebrae on your body, one by one. There is nothing that can take away the pain, and that is a situation in which my mother lost her life, her last words were \u2018I cannot go on like this\u2019. And thankfully for her, there were only a few more days of pain. But for others, there are months, and before they get to that six months, they will have suffered from years of excruciating agony that palliative care cannot resolve. To deny choice to others, especially those with only six months to live, where their personal choice does no harm, is wrong. And the Labour MP Rachel Hopkins said her grandfather, Harold Hopkins, \u201csuffered greatly\u201d as he was dying from cancer. It was the haunted look on my father\u2019s face when he arrived home \u2013 having spent the final few days with Harold in terrible pain and suffering before he finally died \u2013 that had a lasting impression on me, and that surely in a modern society, if we are able to live a good life, we must be able to have a good death. The head of the race equality thinktank has warned of \u2018devastating consequences\u2019 if assisted dying bill is allowed to pass. Jabeer Butt, chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, pointed to the Liverpool Care Pathway, which was abolished a decade ago, where a government review heard that hospital staff wrongly interpreted its guidance for care of the dying, leading to stories of patients who were drugged and deprived of fluids in their last weeks of life. Butt said: The assisted dying bill represents a dangerous slippery slope. For decades, the NHS has struggled to protect life adequately. Framing assisted dying as a \u2018better solution\u2019 exposes a health system failing to provide the care and support people need for a reasonable quality of life. My own experience with the Liverpool Care Pathway showed the devastating consequences when appropriate care is denied\u2014loved ones were lost needlessly. Instead of embracing this approach again, which has proven flawed in the past, we must focus on fixing the system. Where are the safeguards? Even clinicians who initially supported these measures often later express doubts. We cannot afford to repeat mistakes that cost lives. Downing Street are refusing to be clear about the circumstances around Louise Haigh\u2019s resignation but at the lobby briefing this morning No 10 appeared to be hinting that she might have broken the seven principles of public life or the ministerial code. The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson repeatedly told reporters this morning: Following further information emerging, the prime minister has accepted Louise Haigh\u2019s resignation. When asked what Starmer knew about Haigh\u2019s spent conviction, what the further information was that emerged, and why he appointed her to cabinet, the spokesman gave the same scripted line over and over again. Asked about what she had declared to the government, the spokesman said: [There are] clear rules around declarations and that on appointment to office ministers must provide their permanent secretary with a full declaration in writing of private interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict actual or perceived ... The permanent secretary will review the minister\u2019s declarations in light of their responsibilities and in discussion with the minister advise on actions needed to manage any interests. The interests must be shared with the independent adviser and this must occur within 14 days ... Ministers must record in writing what action has been taken as a result of advice received from the permanent secretary and the independent adviser and provide the permanent secretary and independent adviser with a copy. Many MPs have been using social media to say how they will vote in the debate today. Here are some of their messages posted this morning. Shaun Davies, Labour MP for Telford, is voting for. Saqib Bhatti, Conservative MP for Meriden and Solihull East, is against. Tonia Antoniazzi, Labour MP for Gower, who spoke in the debate earlier, is for Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, who is now an independent MP, says he cannot support the bill. Charlie Maynard, Lib Dem MP for Witney, is for (at least for now). Lee Anderson, the Reform UK MP for Ashfield, says his constituents are in favour (but he does not say here how he will vote). Kirsteen Sullivan, Labour MP for Bathgate and Linlithgow, says she cannot back the bill. Callum Anderson, the Labour MP for Buckingham and Bletchley, says he is in favour. Ruth Jones, Labour MP for Newport West, is against. Tulip Siddiq, a Treasury minister, is for. Nigel Huddleston, the Conservative co-chair, is against. Rachel Taylor, the Labour MP for North Warwickshire and Bedworth, is for. David Reed, Conservative MP for Exmouth and Exeter East, is against. Polly Billington, Labour MP for East Thanet, is against. Nia Griffith, a Welsh Office minister, is against. Zubir Ahmed, Labour MP for Glasgow South West, is against. Steff Aquarone, Lib Dem MP for North Norfolk, is in favour. Carla Lockhart (DUP) says the safeguards against coercion in the bill are not adequate. The bill will change the way society values life. And it will put vulnerable people at risk. That is why she and her DUP colleagues will be voting against the bill. Anna Dixon (Lab), another MP who signed the reasoned amendment saying the bill should not get a second reading to allow time for a full policy review, said she did not believe the procedure for private member\u2019s bill was adequate for an issue of this complexity. In line with the precautionary principle, the bill should be blocked until there has been a proper public consultation, she says. David Davis, the former Conservative cabinet minister, says he has changed his mind on this bill. He will vote for it today, he says. But this is only second reading, he says. If he is not happy with the bill, he could vote against at third reading, he says. If the bill looks as if it will create a Belgian version of assisted dying, or a Canadian version, he would vote against, he says. But if the bill follows the Australian model, he will vote in favour. But he does urge the government to allow more time for debate. He says the report stage, where all MPs (not just the MPs serving on the public bill committee) get the chance to vote on amendments, should last for four days. (Under the normal procedure, it would just get a few hours on a Friday.) He says this bill is more important to constituents than most of the bills in the Labour manifesto. Marie Tidball (Lab) says today\u2019s decision is the hardest she has had to make during a career in disability law and policy. She says she did not expect to be voting for the bill, but she will be doing so. She says she thinks it is right that people should have the option of assisted dying, but she says she would like to see stronger safeguards introduced as the bill goes through parliament. UPDATE: Tidball said: When I was six years old I had major surgery on my hips. I was in body plaster from my chest to my ankles, in so much pain and requiring so much morphine that my skin began to itch. I remember vividly laying in a hospital bed in Sheffield Children\u2019s Hospital and saying to my parents \u2018I want to die, please let me die\u2019. I needed to escape from that body that I was inhabiting. That moment has come back to me all these years later. That moment made it clear to me that if the bill was about intolerable suffering I would not be voting for it. Tidball said she had since lived a \u201cgood life\u201d, but added: That moment also gave my a glimpse of how I would want to live my death, just as I have lived my life. Empowered by choices available to me. Living that death with dignity and respect and having the comfort of knowing that I might have control over that very difficult time. Back in the Commons, Tim Farron, the former Lib Dem leader, says is he opposed to the bill. It will create a space for coercion, he says. He recalls what happened when his mother was told she was terminally ill. A doctor said terminally ill people often suffer from depression. That is why they would be vulnerable to coercion, he says. He says the government\u2019s own suicide prevention adviser is against this bill. And he says he is opposing this bill as a liberal. He is a liberal, not a libertarian, he says. He says people should not have a freedom if it encroaches on someone else\u2019s freedom, and giving people the right to assisted dying would stop people from being free from coercion to die, he says. According to Jessica Elgot\u2019s assisted dying backgrounder yesterday, Heidi Alexander was being lined up as the government minister appointed to sit on the committee dealing with the next stage of the assisted dying bill, if it passes this afternoon. That is because, until yesterday, she was a justice minister. If the bill passes second reading, another minister will have to take up this responsibility. Nusrat Ghani, the deputy speaker, asks MPs to stick to a five-minute time limit in subsequent speeches. Back in the Commons Peter Prinsley (Lab) is speaking. Prinsley is a doctor, and he says he is in favour of the bill. He says better palliative care and assisted dying can go together. Heidi Alexander has been appointed transport secretary, replacing Louise Haigh, Downing Street has announced. Alexander had been a justice minister. She first became a Labour MP in 2010, but left parliamment in 2018 to work for Sadiq Khan as deputy London mayor for transport. She became an MP again at the 2024 election. Edward Leigh (Con), father of the house, goes next. He co-wrote an article with Diane Abbott opposing the bill He says people support this measure because they are terrified of dying in pain. But there is no need for that, he says. He claims there is no limit to how much morphine a patient can take. But he says some doctors will not give patients morphine beyond a certain amount. There should be a royal commission to clear this up, he says. Meg Hillier (Lab) says she agrees with the arguments made by Diane Abbott. (See 10.53am.) She recalls her daughter being seriously ill with acute pancreatitis as a teenager, and says for some days she did not know if her daughter would live or die. During that time she saw what good pain relief could achieve. She says palliative care needs to be much better, and that she has been campaigning on this for years. She urges MPs to oppose the bill, saying it would put vulnerable people at risk. Ben Spencer (Con), one of the cross-party group of MPs who tabled an amendment opposing the bill to allow time for a full debate, confirmed that he would vote against the legislation. He said he was particularly concerned about the risk of people being coerced into assisted dying. Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, has confirmed that she will vote against the bill. In interviews in recent weeks she has expressed strong reservations about the bill, but in an article for the Times she explains why she is definitely voting against. She cites the experience of teenagers given medical treatment to change gender as one of the reasons why she does not think the NHS should be allowed to supervise assisted dying. I fundamentally believe that giving people a level of control over how they die can be a sacred thing in and of itself, is the right thing to do and something we must get right. Yet, I find myself unable to support this bill as it stands today. That is because of experience of the state\u2019s ability to deal with this sort of complexity. During my time as a government minister, it became clear to me that our healthcare system is not able to cope with complex issues requiring serious safeguarding. I learnt this when clinicians, parents, whistleblowers and children came to me raising serious concerns of safeguarding failures in our gender identity development service. None of the safeguards purportedly in place did anything to prevent young, often gay or autistic, children from receiving irreversible and damaging treatments. I saw a culture in which patients and parents felt unable to challenge medical professionals, and medical professionals were fearful of questioning patients. And she says she took the final decision to vote against the bill when Keir Starmer seemed to rule out allowing extra time for its report stage in the Commons. The moment I knew I could not personally support the bill was at prime minister\u2019s questions, when Sir Alec Shelbrooke asked the prime minister whether he would allow MPs two days of debate to examine the details of the bill and any amendments. The prime minister swiftly dismissed him, saying five hours was \u201csufficient time\u201d. I knew that this same bureaucratic indifference to the sincere concerns raised by MPs would be reflected in the judicial and healthcare systems responsible for carrying out assisted dying for the most vulnerable in our society. Layla Moran (Lib Dem), chair of the Commons health committee, says she will be voting for the bill because \u201cI want this conversation to continue\u201d. To those saying the bill crosses the Rubicon (like Danny Kruger \u2013 see 10.44am), she says she respects their views. And to those MPs with concerns about the bill, she says they should vote for it today so amendments to the bill can be debated later. MPs can vote for the bill today, but vote against it at third reading if they don\u2019t like the final version, she says. Rachael Maskell (Lab) says MPs should be focusing on improving palliative care. That is what the public wants, she says. She says she is worried about people feeling coerced into assisted dying. Disabled people would be particularly vulnerable, she says. The safeguarding measures in the bill are flawed, she says. She says the bill is wrong and rushed. And there won\u2019t be time to fix it, she says. Kit Malthouse (Con) is a co-sponsor of the bill, and he says he has been supporting this campaign for years. When I was a child, my parents shielded me from death, and centuries of art and literature and religion taught me that death was something noble or even slightly romantic. When I became an adult, I learned quickly that that was not the case. For far too many, it is anything, but certainly not noble. The death bed for far too many is a place of misery, torture and degradation, a rain of blood and vomit and tears. Malthouse says he wants to address some objections to the bill. Referring to Canada (see 10.53am), he says I\u2019m married to a Canadian, and I can tell you, they love their children just as much as we do. The idea that they, the Australians, the New Zealanders, the Spanish the Austrians, care little for their relatives, or indeed for the wider society in which they live, is offensive, and we should not pretend that somehow here we are special or different. Malthouse says people also claim this bill would lead to the NHS or the court system being overwhelmed. He goes on: These people are already dying. They are already in the National Health Service. They already are entitled to care. And even if you think there is an impact, are you seriously telling me that my death, my agony, is too much for the NHS to have time for? Even the claim that it would overload the judges \u2013 that I should drown in my own fecal vomit because it\u2019s too much hassle for the judges to deal with. We send things to the NHS and the judges from this house, all the time. Is anyone suggesting that we should be creating new offense of spiking because the judges are overworked? Just come through this week? Of course not. Malthouse says MPs have a duty to help people who want the option of assisted dying. Referring to people in the public gallery who suppor the bill, he says: We are 1,000-year-old democracy. It\u2019s not beyond us to design legislation that gives them what they want and protects those who we feel need to be protected. I want this choice for my constituents, but profoundly, I want it for myself, and I want it for those people in the gallery who have been working so hard over the last decade to get us to change our minds. Please be clear that, whatever happens today, terminal people will still take their own lives. All we are deciding today is how. Andrew Slaughter (Lab) tells MPs that at the moment people who are terminally ill who want to end their life have three options; they can go to Dignitas, which could mean dying alone; they could try to kill themselves, which might be unsuccessful; or they could ask a friend or relative to help, but those people would risk prosecution, and the ill person might have to die too soon. Under this bill, Slaughter says, a terminally ill person would have to consider their decision to die at least eight times. He says the safeguards in the bill are strong, and he urges MPs to back it. Andrew Mitchell, the former Tory cabinet minister, goes next. He says he has completely changed his mind on this subject and is now in favour. I\u2019ve sat in my advice surgery, and I have had tears pouring down my face listening to listening to constituents who have set out so clearly speaking with such emotion about how their mother, brother, father or child has died in great pain and great indignity. And I strongly support this bill \u2026 I believe that we should give our constituents, our fellow citizens, this choice. I want this choice for my constituents. I want it for those whom I love, and indeed, I want it perhaps one day for myself. The status quo is \u201ccruel and dangerous\u201d, he says. And he says there won\u2019t be a slippery slope unless MPs agree to one. Diane Abbott, the Labour MP and mother of the Commons, is speaking now. She is opposed to the bill, for reasons she set out in a recent Guardian article. She says people need to be protected from themselves. There will be those who say to themselves, they don\u2019t want to be a burden. And I can imagine myself saying that in particular circumstances. Others will worry that assets they are going to leave for their own children are being eroded by the cost of care. And there will even be a handful who will think they should not be taking up a hospital [bed]. Abbott says, if passed, this bill can be amended in the future. And she says in Canada an assisted dying bill has been extended. It was introduced originally for people with a terminal illness, then extended to people without a terminal illness, and in March 2027 will be extended to cover people with a serious mental health problem. She says she is not against assisted dying in all circumstances. But she goes on: If this will passes, we will have the NHS as a fully funded 100% suicide service, but palliative care will only be funded at 30% at best \u2026 We can come back. We can have a commission. We can craft a better bill, but I will not be voting for this bill this morning. Kruger says that, although the bill covers coercion, it does not address the danger that people coerce themselves \u2013 because they feel under pressure to take their life. He says he is often accused of imposing his view on others. But with this bill real choice would narrow, he says, because there would be less focus on palliative care. And he says everyone would be affected by a change to the law like this. What about the safeguards for people who are vulnerable? Kruger goes on: I\u2019ll tell you \u2013 we are the safeguard this place, this parliament, you and me. We are the people who protect the most vulnerable in society from harm, and yet we stand on the brink of abandoning that role. The Rubicon was a very small stream, but on the other side lies a very different world, a worse world, with a very different idea of human value, the idea that our individual worth lies in our utility, valuable only for so long \u2026 Let us do better than this bill. Let today not be a vote for despair but the start of a proper debate about dying well in which we have a better idea than a state suicide service. An MP raises a point of order to complain about Kruger using the term suicide. That is not the correct language, she says, and it is offensive. Kruger says the bill amends the Suicide Act, and so he says using the word is appropriate. Richard Tice (Reform UK) says Kruger seems to be making an argument for the bill to get a second reading. He says, by querying the specifics of the bill, Kruger is showing why it should be debated in detail in committee. Kruger says he is sure Kim Leadbeater is pleased to have Tice\u2019s support. John Hayes (Con) says detailed consideration of the process should have taken place earlier. Kruger is now going through the detail of the bill. He says he is particuarly concerned by the provisons saying the bill should only apply to people who are terminally ill. He says this phrase has \u201cgreat elasticity, almost to the point of meaninglessness\u201d. He says it is a \u201cpurely subjective judgment\u201d. The bill says it should apply to people expected to die within six months. But that is uncertain, he says. Wera Hobhouse (Lib Dem) says all medical assessments involve some uncertainty. Kruger says almost anyone with a serious illness could fit this definition. For example, a diabetic could refuse insulin, he says. Or someone with an eating disorder could refuse food. Danny Kruger (Con) is speaking now. He is making the opening speech for opponents of the bill, and so he is not covered by the unofficial eight-minute limit on speeches imposed by the Speaker. He says he expects to speak for about 15 minutes. He pays tribute to Leadbeater for the way she has campaigned on this with respect and sensitivity. Using the phrase coined by Leadbeater\u2019s sister, the late Jo Cox, he says they have more in common than might appear. We all share a deep concern about the experience of people dying or fearing death, fearing pain and suffering. He says he wants to see the \u201cbroken palliative care system\u201d repaired. He says the bill is \u201ctoo big for the time it\u2019s been given\u201d. He says it is unlikely to be amended, beyond \u201cminor tweaks\u201d, as it goes through that committee. And for that reason, if MPs have doubts, they should vote against, he says. Andrew George (Lib Dem) intervenes. He says he disagrees; if MPs are not sure, they should allow the bill to go through today, so it can be amended. He says the final decision should be taken at third reading. Leadbeater says the UK can look at 31 jurisdications around the world where laws of this kind are in place. She says she has followed best practice. And she accepts there are some assisted dying laws that Britain should not follow. She quotes an Australian MP talking about their legislation, and saying \u201cnone of the fears that were put forward as reasons not to change the law have been realised\u201d. She goes on: People talk about a slippery slope, but the health and social care select committee found that not one jurisdiction which passed laws on the basis of terminal illness has expanded its scope. Some MPs seem to be questioning this. But Leadbeater insists she is right. She says the scope of the bill cannot be expanded by the courts. And she says, if the bill gets a second reading today, she will move a motion to ensure that the bill committee can take evidence orally and in writing on its provisions. (This is something that normally happens when government bills are being considered in committee, but not private members\u2019 bills.) Leadbeater winds up urging MPs to back the bill. The text of the bill is here. And here are the explanatory notes. Leadbeater says, having set out why there is a problem, she wants to explain how the bill would work. Daisy Cooper (Lib Dem) intervenes. She says she is worried about the impact of the bill on people who are learning disabled. She says in clause 9(3)(b), the bill says that if the certifying doctor is worried about the capacity of the person who wants assisted dying, they may refer them to for a psychiatric assesssment. Will Leadbeater agree to change that from \u201cmay\u201d to \u201cmust\u201d. Leadbeater says she would be happy to consider that change when the bill goes into committee. Leadbeater is citing more examples of terminally ill people who back the bill. And she says some of them cannot understand why they are not being given the right to choose assisted dying if they want. She says some of them want the option, even though that does not necessarily mean they would exercise that right. She goes on: I know there has been much discussion about the views of people who hold religious beliefs about this subject. I fully respect those beliefs, and I do not intend to say much more about this, other than that I know there are a range of views within faith communities. Indeed, some of the most powerful conversations I\u2019ve had have been with people of faith, including in my own constituency. People of different religions have said, whilst they would not choose an assisted death for themselves or for their family, who are they to stop someone else who may want to make that choice? Blair McDougall (Lab) intervenes to say he used to take the same view as Leadbeater does. But he says he is worried about disabled people being made to feel that they should take their life. Leadbeater says it is a bill covering the terminally ill. It does not apply to people who are disabled but not terminally ill, she says. Back in the Commons Leadbeater is giving another example of someone who suffered a terrible death. Lucy\u2019s husband, Tom, was 47 a music teacher with a young son. He had bile duct cancer, which obstructed his bowel, resulting in an agonizing death. Tom vomited fecal matter for five hours before he ultimately inhaled the feces and died. He was vomiting so violently that he could not be sedated, and was conscious throughout Lucy pleaded with the doctors to help. The doctor treating him said there was nothing he could do. His family say the look of horror on his face as he died will never leave them. Lucy now has PTSD, which is quite common for families who lose loved ones in such harrowing circumstances. Leadbeater asks how parliament can allow cases like this to happen, but not a compassionate death. Oliver Dowden, the former Conservative deputy PM, asks Leadbeater what assurances she can give that \u201cjudicial activism\u201d won\u2019t lead to the courts interpreting the bill in a way not intended by MPs. Leadbeater says the courts have repeatedly said they want parliament to decide this matter. And she says her bill is strictly drafted. Leadbeater says she wants palliative care to be better. And so there is a requirement in the bill for the secretary of state to report to MPs on the state of palliative care. Leadbeater talks about the safeguards in her bill. Simon Hoare (Con) intervenes, and asks how the two doctors who would have to approve an assisted dying request under the bill would be able to know that the patient had not been coerced into ending their life. Leadbeater says at the moment there are no checks at all to prevent coercion. Richard Burgon (Lab) says he is concerned about societal coercion. Elderly people pay thousands of pounds a month for care. What assurances are there that someone won\u2019t feel that they have a duty to end their life early to save the family money. Leadbeater says we are not having these conversations at the moment. And she says coercion can happen the other way (with people feeling obliged they need to stay alive for the sake for their family, when they really want to end their life). UPDATE: Hoare said: [Leadbeater] references coercion and I recognise the point that she makes about the two medics, but the medics won\u2019t be able to see or have heard anything and everything at all times. People will not be put beyond challenge because subsequent to the death, if a relative claims coercion of another relative, investigation will remain. And Leadbeater replied: We\u2019re going to check for coercion in a very robust system. We don\u2019t have any of that now, so at the moment the person will definitely be dead. We have to look at the status quo by putting layers of safeguarding and checking for coercion. That\u2019s got to be better than the system that we\u2019ve got now. Leadbeater said she wanted to tell MPs some of the stories that inspired her to take up this cause. Warwick was married to his wife, Anne for nearly 40 years. She had terminal peritoneal cancer, which meant she couldn\u2019t breathe properly. She spent four days gasping and choking, remaining awake throughout despite being given the maximum dose of sedatives and eventually died of suffocation. She had to get Warwick to end her life, but as he stood over her with a pillow, he could not do what she asked. He did not want that to be her final memory of him. Anne had excellent palliative care, but it simply could not ease her suffering. Tim fell in love at first sight. When he met his wife, Louise, he proposed after just three days, but Louise got cancer twice, and at the end, the morphine simply could not control her pain. In desperation, she managed to smash a small glass bottle and tried to take her own life, not realizing that her toddler daughter had got into bed with her. Tim found her. He says, \u2018You get to a point where you stop praying for a miracle and start praying for mercy.\u2019 Former police officer James waved his mum off as she embarked on her final trip to Dignitas. She had terminal vasculitis. James desperately wanted to accompany his mum and hold her hands during her final moments, but he knew, because of his job as a police officer, it was just not possible. Indeed, she insisted he must not go with her. So she went alone, no one to hold her hand, no proper goodbye or funeral. These are just a few examples of the heartbreaking reality and human suffering which far too many people are experiencing as a result of the status quo. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP who has tabled the private member\u2019s bill, is opening the debate. She says this is a complex issue, but it is MPs\u2019 job to address complex issues. It is our job to address complex issues and make difficult decisions. And I know for many people, this is a very difficult decision, but our job is also to address the issues that matter to people. And after nearly a decade since this subject was debated on the floor of the house, many would say this debate is long overdue. Leadbeater says she has tried to ensure this debate is \u201crobust, of course, but most importantly, respectful and compassionate\u201d. For the most part that has been the case, she says. The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, is speaking now. He says more than 160 MPs want to speak. It is not customary to put a time limit on speeches in these debates, he says. But he says he will start by requesting an eight-minute limit on speeches. He says after that he may ask for shorter speeches, and he retains the right to impose a limit, he says. He says he expects to move to the winding up speeches at about 2pm. And he says he is not calling the reasoned amendment, that would have denied the bill a second reading to allow for a full policy review instead. The debate is about to start. The Speaker should announce at the very start whether he\u2019s going to accept the reasoned amendment (not expected to as no precedent) and give guidance around how the debate will be conducted. He cannot impose time limits but will likely appeal to people not to speak too long: 3-4 min Kim Leadbeater and Danny Kruger will make the opening statements of 20-25 mins with interventions There is expected to be a vote on a closure motion at 2-2.15pm and a vote on the substantive motion at 2.30pm (assuming the reasoned amendment hasn\u2019t been called, if it has there needs to be an earlier vote on that too) If the bill passes, Leadbeater will move a secondary motion to allow the public bill committee to take oral and written evidence. Then the bill will go to the public bill committee, not expected until the new year Leadbeater can pick the committee membership and has committed to it reflecting a balance of views; the committee of selection has to approve the names. The govt will appoint a minister, expected to be from justice as the bill would change criminal law If it passes the government will move a money resolution fairly soon (will check when this means) and also has to publish an impact assessment; when is up to thembut it\u2019s likely to be before the bill goes to committee stage The bill can\u2019t be filibustered as the speaker can intervene and stop someone from speaking if they try (or just go on too long) and a closure motion can be brought at any point Leadbeater will see her parents and the families of people affected by the current law who are in the public gallery for the debate; then she\u2019ll do interviews in central lobby. She\u2019s pleased that there has been a respectful and compassionate debate and has had messages even from people who disagree with her praising the way she\u2019s conducted herself In the run up to today\u2019s vote on the assisted dying bill, it has been hard to work out Downing Street\u2019s take on the debate. Keir Starmer voted for assisted dying in 2015, as director of public prosecutions he issued landmark guidance intended to clarify in what circumstances someone helping a relative to die for compassionate reasons might avoid prosecution and he has said recently he supports legislation in principle. But he has not argued publicly for the bill in recent weeks, and cabinet ministers opposed to the bill have been able to make their case forcefully. In her excellent background ahead of today\u2019s debate, Jessica Elgot explains what has been going on. She says: When [Kim] Leadbeater decided she would take up the cause, there was a private approach to Downing Street to see if there were objections \u2013 and there were none. Starmer has been studiously neutral in the lead-up to the vote, but privately he has been appalled by the public comments of his cabinet ministers \u2013 particularly [Wes] Streeting, whom he has told to stop his interventions. The prime minister\u2019s own view was formed during his time as director of public prosecutions: that the current law is not fit for purpose and puts families at risk of arrest and where patients take their own lives in ways that are dangerous and painful. He will vote on Friday, though he has not confirmed which way, and there is a strong feeling among the bill\u2019s proponents that it will be a decisive moment. \u201cWhen you watch the prime minister walk through the yes lobby, lots will think: \u2018that\u2019s good enough for me,\u2019\u201d said one MP. When Leadbeater first adopted the bill, there were raised eyebrows. She had never spoken on the issue previously, though her sister Jo Cox, the former MP who was murdered by a far-right terrorist, had been a strong advocate. But the prime minister is an outlier in his own operation. \u201cThere was no No 10 machine behind this,\u201d said one ally. \u201cThe machine is not actually sure they want this to happen.\u201d Senior aides are frustrated the cause is dominating the conversation and the divisions it is causing. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d one official said. \u201cIf it passes, it will eat up so much time. And it\u2019s causing divisions among our MPs when we have worked so hard to try to build bonds between them.\u201d \u201cKeir wanted it to happen,\u201d another staffer said. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple. There isn\u2019t anyone else who thought this was a particularly great thing to do in the first months of a Labour government.\u201d You can read Jess\u2019s full article here. James Cleverly, the former Tory home secretary, has posted this on social media about why he thinks Louise Haigh\u2019s resignation raises questions about Keir Starmer\u2019s judgment. Questions about Starmer\u2019s judgement If the conviction was unacceptable to him why did he appoint Haigh to ShadCab after she told him about it? If it was declared to Proprietary &amp; Ethics on her appointment to Cabinet (must have been), why is he throwing her under the bus now? MPs will start debating the assisted dying bill \u2013 or the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill, to give it its proper name \u2013 at 9.30am. We will be focusing on the debate most of the day, while continuing to cover the repercussions of the Louise Haigh resignation. Here is Jessica Elgot\u2019s overnight story about the vote. And here is a 125-page Commons library briefing on the bill, and the issues it tackles. If you want to read about this in detail, it\u2019s invaluable. The vote will take place at 2.30pm. Some Labour figures have been paying tribute to Louise Haigh on social media. This is from the MP Toby Perkins. Very sad to see Lou Haigh stand down, she was doing a great job as Transport Secretary. I very much hope she will be back in the cabinet in the future. She was doing a great job and will be a real loss. And this is from the former MP Ben Bradshaw. George Eaton from the New Statesman says Louise Haigh\u2019s place in cabinet may have been at risk anyway following the incident last month when she condemned DP World, the parent firm of P&amp;O Ferries, shortly before it was due to attend a government investment conference. Some in Labour already expected Louise Haigh to be moved at the next reshuffle following the DP World row. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT rail union, has paid tribute to Louise Haigh. He said: Louise achieved a great deal during her time as transport secretary including laying the foundations for the public ownership of our railways \u2013 a landmark achievement that prioritises the needs of passengers and workers over private profit. Her vision and dedication have set the stage for a fairer, more efficient, and publicly accountable transport system. I want to thank her on behalf of RMT and wish her every success in the future. Grant Shapps, the former Conservative cabinet minister, has complained the BBC is not giving enough prominence to the Louise Haigh resignation. He posted this on social media. \ud83d\udea8NEWS ALERT gone missing? Whenever a Conservative minister resigned there was always a BBC news alert. Yet Starmer loses his first Cabinet Minister and somehow the BBC doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant enough to send out an alert! Andrew Fisher, who was head of policy for Jeremy Corbyn when Corbyn was Labour leader, told the Today programme that Louise Haigh was having to go because Keir Starmer \u201cpanicked\u201d in response to a media attacked. Her departure was \u201c a real loss in terms of the effectiveness of government\u201d, he said. Fisher said that Haigh had been one of the most effective ministers in government, and he said the incident that led to her resignation was a \u201cfairly trivial matter\u201d which had been disclosed to Starmer four years ago. He said it was not clear whether Haigh chose to go voluntarily, or whether Starmer made it clear to her that she had to resign. But it was a mistake, he suggested. He said Starmer had \u201cpanicked in the face of a media attack\u201d. Fisher\u2019s decision to speak out publicly in support of Haigh is indicative of how she was seen as one of the more leftwing members of the cabinet. In her resignation letter Louise Haigh said little about the past conviction, now spent, that led to her resignation. But she gave a fuller statement yesterday when approached by reporters about the story. She said: In 2013 I was mugged while on a night out. I was a young woman and the experience was terrifying. I reported it to the police and gave them a list of what I believed had been taken - including a work mobile phone that had been issued by my employer. Some time later I discovered that the mobile in question had not been taken. In the interim I had been issued with another work phone. The original work device being switched on triggered police attention and I was asked to come in for questioning. My solicitor advised me not to comment during that interview and I regret following that advice. The police referred the matter to the CPS and I appeared before Southwark magistrates. Under the advice of my solicitor I pleaded guilty - despite the fact this was a genuine mistake from which I did not make any gain. The magistrates accepted all of these arguments and gave me the lowest possible outcome [a discharge] available. The Daily Mail and the Times both put this story on their front page. Haigh\u2019s resignation was not announced until this morning, but her resignation letter is dated 28 November, implying the decision to go was taken last night. The Conservative party is suggesting that Keir Starmer should never have appointed Louise Haigh to the cabinet in the first place given he knew about her past fraud conviction. And it is calling this an \u201cobvious failure of judgment\u201d. A Conservative spokesperson said: Louise Haigh has done the right thing in resigning. It is clear she has failed to behave to the standards expected of an MP. In her resignation letter, she states that Keir Starmer was already aware of the fraud conviction, which raises questions as to why the prime minister appointed Ms Haigh to Cabinet with responsibility for a \u00a330bn budget? The onus is now on Keir Starmer to explain this obvious failure of judgment to the British public. The gov.uk website has just published the exchange of letters between Louise Haigh and Keir Starmer in full. There is already a little bit of early response from political commentators and reports on social media this morning to Louise Haigh leaving government. Kevin Maguire says \u201cLou Haigh was doing a great job and was the unofficial leader of the Left in the Cabinet. That\u2019s why opponents wanted to take down \u2018Red Lou\u2019\u201d. Mikey Smith, a deputy political editor at the Mirror, interprets it this way: \u201cStarmer\u2019s reply essentially reads \u2018sorry about all this, it\u2019s exceptionally dumb, you\u2019ll be back.\u2019\u201d Here is how, in the letter announcing her departure, Louise Haigh sets out the events, before she was an MP, that have led to her becoming the first minister to leave Keir Starmer\u2019s government. She wrote: As you know, in 2013 I was mugged in London. As a 24-year-old woman, the experience was terrifying. In the immediate aftermath, I reported the incident to the police. I gave the police a list of my possessions that I believed had been stolen, including my work phone. Some time later, I discovered that the handset in question was still in my house. I should have immediately informed my employer and not doing so straight away was a mistake. In its London Playbook morning email, Politico\u2019s Sam Blewett and Bethany Dawson write: Long-serving frontbencher Haigh \u2013 who was seen by many as one of the few remaining standard-bearers of the \u201csoft left\u201d \u2013 is the first Cabinet casualty of the new government. Playbook hears Haigh was on a train back from an announcement in Leeds with patchy phone signal last night while firefighting the fallout. At that point her allies said she believed she\u2019d be staying in the post, having \u201cfully disclosed\u201d the \u201ctraumatic\u201d incident to Starmer before he appointed her to the shadow cabinet in 2020. Louise Haigh has been Sheffield Heeley MP since 2015 and held a number of shadow ministerial and shadow cabinet roles before becoming Transport secretary when Labour won the election in July. Within days of taking office, Haigh told civil servants she planned to \u201cmove fast and fix things\u201d, a play on the famous Facebook motto. She said \u201cGrowth, net zero, opportunity, women and girls\u2019 safety, health \u2013 none of these can be realised without transport as a key enabler.\u201d In October she became embroiled in a row after describing P&amp;O Ferries as a \u201crogue operator\u201d just as DP World, its Dubai-based owner, was poised to announce a reported \u00a31bn investment in the UK. Starmer distanced himself from the comments at the time. In his reply to Louise Haigh\u2019s resignation letter, Keir Starmer left the door open for her eventual return to government, saying: Thank you for all you have done to deliver this government\u2019s ambitious transport agenda. You have made huge strides to take our rail system back into public ownership through the creation of Great British Railways, investing \u00a31bn in our vital bus services and lowering cost for motorists. I know you still have a huge contribution to make in the future. The transport secretary, Louise Haigh, has resigned after it emerged she pleaded guilty after she incorrectly told police that a work mobile phone was stolen in 2013. In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer she said: I appreciate that whatever the facts of the matter, this issue will inevitably be a distraction from delivering on the work of this government and the policies to which we are both committed. I will always be grateful for the support you have shown me, and I take great pride in what we achieved since the election. She added: I remain totally committed to our political project, but I now believe it will be best served by my supporting you from outside Government. I am sorry to leave under these circumstances, but I take pride in what we have done. I will continue to fight every day for the people of Sheffield Heeley who I was first and foremost elected to represent and to ensure that the rest of our programme is delivered in full.",

      "bodyText": "The UK has increased its contribution to the World Bank, in a move that will boost prospects for climate finance. Next week, at a meeting in Seoul of the International Development Association (IDA) \u2013 the body that funds the World Bank\u2019s support for low-income countries \u2013 the UK will put forward \u00a31.98bn in funding over three years, an increase of about 40% on the previous pledge. Anneliese Dodds, the development minister, said: \u201cBritain is back with a voice on the world stage. When we said we would take a new approach to development, built on genuine partnerships and based on respect, we meant it. Leaders of low-income countries around the world called for stronger IDA contributions and we listened.\u201d The World Bank and its fellow multilateral development banks (MDBs) will play a key role in providing the climate finance, mostly in the form of grants and loans, which will be needed to meet commitments made last week at the Cop29 UN climate summit. Experts and campaigners welcomed the cash injection. Avinash Persaud, climate advisor to the president of the Inter American Development Bank, said: \u201cI recognise the challenging circumstances in which this commitment has been made to some of the most vulnerable countries. I personally wish it was more, but I very much welcome the strong endorsement this makes to the multilateral system.\u201d Mafalda Duarte, the executive director of the Green Climate Fund, said: \u201cThe UK government is fiscally constrained, so this is quite positive.\u201d Adrian Lovett, the UK executive director of the campaign group ONE, said: \u201cEvery pound invested by the UK in IDA helps to catalyse far more from others, ensuring the maximum value to British taxpayers. We look to other countries, including France, Canada and Sweden, to now make their pledges and complete this investment package.\u201d Recriminations continue to fly after the Cop29 summit, which ended on Sunday amid rancour and accusations that the rich world had betrayed the poor, and that the hosts had stage-managed the conference. Under the deal that was finally agreed, the governments of developed countries agreed only to supply $300bn (\u00a3236bn) of the $1.3tn a year that developing countries have been promised by 2035, in part through the MDBs. The rest is likely to come from the private sector and new forms of finance. While rich nations have been criticised the most for failing to put forward enough cash for the developing world to tackle climate breakdown, there has also been criticism of the Cop presidency, held by Mukhtar Babayev, Azerbaijan\u2019s environment minister and a former oil company executive. Writing in the Guardian after the talks finished, Babayev blamed \u201cwestern nations\u201d for being \u201csimply immovable\u201d on the cash on offer, which he said was \u201ctoo low\u201d. Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) who oversaw the 2015 Paris agreement and is the co-founder of the Global Optimism thinktank, was critical of Babayev\u2019s comments. \u201cIt is such a betrayal of the role of a Cop president, [who] needs to hold the information of what is going on very tightly and use it for common benefit, to come out and say: this country did that and that country did whatever, and try to lay blame at the feet of different countries, for something that should have been managed very differently,\u201d she said, in her Outrage and Optimism podcast. \u201cI\u2019m really aghast. I\u2019ve never seen this.\u201d Babayev remains in charge of the UN climate negotiations until next November, when Brazil will take over for the Cop30 talks. Figueres said the presidency had failed to prepare the ground at Cop29 for a successful deal. \u201cA very, very complicated agreement can never be reached at the last moment.

      "body": "<p>The 1980 disaster movie spoof Airplane! was a flyaway success. Made for $3.5m, it grossed over $170m and forged a new style of film comedy.

(1957) and Airport (1970), ZAZ took their cue from MAD magazine, which printed finely detailed comic-strip spoofs of current releases, each panel packed tightly with gags. Though the film referenced everything from Saturday Night Fever to From Here to Eternity, its adherence to the disaster movie template kept it on course. It was a lesson which later spoofs, such as the Scary Movie series (some of which David Zucker directed, with Abrahams co-writing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/apr/07/comedy\">Scary Movie 4</a> in 2006) neglected to follow.</p> <p>ZAZ made for a disciplined directorial unit: Abrahams and David Zucker sat at a monitor watching the filming while Jerry Zucker conversed with the actors. \u201cWe huddle after a take and compare suggestions,\u201d said Abrahams in 1986. \u201cThe nice thing about three people working together is that you can come to quick decisions \u2013 three\u2019s an odd number so we\u2019d vote.\u201d He distinguished his own approach from that of his co-directors: \u201cDavid and Jerry were always the ones who had goals, drive and aspirations, while I was the one having a good time.\u201d</p> <p>The trio were not responsible for the vastly inferior follow-up, Airplane II: The Sequel (1982). \u201c[Paramount] came to us and told us they were going to do a sequel,\u201d said Abrahams. \u201cBut we\u2019d thought of all the airplane jokes we could and said, \u2018Thanks, but no thanks.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After their initial success, they were treated as heroes. \u201cWe kind of misperceived ourselves, and what the real beauty of Airplane! was,\u201d said Abrahams. \u201cWe really thought that making a successful comedy was merely stringing a bunch of funny scenes together \u2026 and that\u2019s not really the way it works at all.\u201d</p> <p>Their next film, Top Secret! (1984), contained numerous gags, many of them both silly and highly sophisticated, while deadpan duties were ably fulfilled by a young Val Kilmer. But the material was too scattershot in its choice of targets, which included war films and Elvis Presley musicals. \u201cThe jokes might be fine, it might look nice and be well-directed, but it\u2019s just not a good idea for a movie,\u201d reflected Abrahams, who admitted that the trio\u2019s confidence took a hit.</p> <p>The madcap Ruthless People (1986), starring Danny DeVito as a businessman whose wife (Bette Midler) is kidnapped on the same day he intends to kill her, was the first time they had directed a script not written by them. Unusually, the friends found themselves at loggerheads. \u201cEach of us had more confidence, and it was harder to lose an argument,\u201d said Abrahams.</p>    <p>In between Airplane! and Top Secret!, ZAZ had ventured into television comedy with Police Squad! (1982), which was cancelled after six episodes due to poor ratings. But in its dim-witted protagonist, Lieutenant Frank Drebin, played by Nielsen in straight-faced mode, it introduced a character who would provide ZAZ\u2019s spoofing career with its second wind.</p> <p>Out of the ashes of Police Squad! emerged The Naked Gun (1988), in which Drebin foils a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. The film boasted a gag rate equal to Airplane!, as well as another batch of formerly dramatic actors (including Priscilla Presley and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/01/george-kennedy-obituary\">George Kennedy</a>) adopting their best poker faces amid the comic mayhem.</p> <p>Abrahams, who co-wrote The Naked Gun but left the directing to David, wasn\u2019t keen on the end result. \u201cI remember seeing the dailies and thinking, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s not how you\u2019re supposed to film that joke,\u2019\u201d he recalled.</p> <p>Two sequels followed \u2013 The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear (1991) and The Naked Gun 33\u2153: the Final Insult (1994) \u2013 though Abrahams was credited only as an executive producer.</p> <p>He was born in Shorewood, a suburb of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Louise (nee Ogens), who worked in education, and Norman, a lawyer. He attended the same synagogue and high school as the Zucker brothers; their fathers had also worked together. Later, the three boys were all at the University of Wisconsin-Madison together.</p> <p>After graduating, Abrahams worked as an investigator for a law firm. The Zucker brothers roped him into making comic short films on video equipment. As this took up more of their time, they rented space at the back of a local bookshop, where they set up the Kentucky Fried Theatre Company, screened their videos and performed skits parodying movies, TV shows and commercials.</p> <p>Three years later in 1972, they relocated to Los Angeles and built a considerable fanbase there. One of their shows was titled My Nose, in the hope that the local newspaper listings would read: \u201cMy Nose runs indefinitely.\u201d</p>    <p>Eager to break into cinema but unsure how to do so, they sought advice from the young film-maker John Landis. ZAZ wrote a preliminary draft of Airplane!, which presented the central story as a film-within-a-film being shown on TV, complete with fake commercials. Having had no luck pitching this, they teamed up instead with Landis, who directed their script of irreverent bite-sized sketches, The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977).</p> <p>Even with the minor success of that picture under their belt, they struggled to sell a more streamlined draft of Airplane! Fortunately, it found its way to the future industry titans Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Eisner, who were then executives at Paramount and happy to prepare the film for take-off.</p> <p>By the time the Naked Gun trilogy was under way in the late 1980s, the quality of spoofs had begun to degrade. Two members of the team had already moved on to solo projects: Jerry Zucker found legit success with the Oscar-winning Ghost (1990) while Abrahams made the lively comedy Big Business (1988), starring Midler and Lily Tomlin as two sets of twins, and directed a young Winona Ryder in the teen drama Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael (1990). He also co-wrote and directed his own Top Gun spoofs, Hot Shots (1991) and Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), starring Charlie Sheen.</p> <p>His TV movie, First Do No Harm (1997), starring Meryl Streep, was partly based on his own search for a dietary cure for epilepsy, with which his son, Charlie, had been diagnosed. After directing Nielsen in the sub-par mob spoof Jane Austen\u2019s Mafia! (1998), Abrahams dropped out of film-making altogether to devote time instead to promoting the <a href=\"https://charliefoundation.org/\">Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies</a>.</p> <p>A part-sequel, part-reboot of The Naked Gun, with Liam Neeson as Frank Drebin\u2019s son, will be released next year.</p> <p>Abrahams is survived by his wife, Nancy (nee Cocuzzo), whom he married in 1978, Charlie, another son, Joseph, and a daughter, Jamie.</p> <p> \u2022 James Steven Abrahams, screenwriter and director, born 10 May 1944; died 26 November 2024</p>",

One of their shows was titled My Nose, in the hope that the local newspaper listings would read: \u201cMy Nose runs indefinitely.\u201d Eager to break into cinema but unsure how to do so, they sought advice from the young film-maker John Landis. ZAZ wrote a preliminary draft of Airplane!, which presented the central story as a film-within-a-film being shown on TV, complete with fake commercials. Having had no luck pitching this, they teamed up instead with Landis, who directed their script of irreverent bite-sized sketches, The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977). Even with the minor success of that picture under their belt, they struggled to sell a more streamlined draft of Airplane! Fortunately, it found its way to the future industry titans Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Eisner, who were then executives at Paramount and happy to prepare the film for take-off. By the time the Naked Gun trilogy was under way in the late 1980s, the quality of spoofs had begun to degrade. Two members of the team had already moved on to solo projects: Jerry Zucker found legit success with the Oscar-winning Ghost (1990) while Abrahams made the lively comedy Big Business (1988), starring Midler and Lily Tomlin as two sets of twins, and directed a young Winona Ryder in the teen drama Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael (1990). He also co-wrote and directed his own Top Gun spoofs, Hot Shots (1991) and Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), starring Charlie Sheen. His TV movie, First Do No Harm (1997), starring Meryl Streep, was partly based on his own search for a dietary cure for epilepsy, with which his son, Charlie, had been diagnosed. After directing Nielsen in the sub-par mob spoof Jane Austen\u2019s Mafia! (1998), Abrahams dropped out of film-making altogether to devote time instead to promoting the Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies. A part-sequel, part-reboot of The Naked Gun, with Liam Neeson as Frank Drebin\u2019s son, will be released next year. Abrahams is survived by his wife, Nancy (nee Cocuzzo), whom he married in 1978, Charlie, another son, Joseph, and a daughter, Jamie. \u2022 James Steven Abrahams, screenwriter and director, born 10 May 1944; died 26 November 2024",

Two psychiatrists and two psychologists told the court that MacDonald suffered from autistic spectrum disorder and depressive disorder. The jury was not swayed, and after three-and-a-half hours of deliberation on Friday, found MacDonald guilty of one count of murder, three counts of attempted murder, and one count of possession of a shotgun \u201cwith intent thereof to endanger life\u201d. Judge Lady Drummond handed MacDonald a life sentence with a minimum of 28 years inside before he could be considered for release. After murdering MacKinnon, Finlay went to a house in Dornie in Wester Ross on the mainland, where his osteopath, John MacKenzie, lived with his wife, Fay. The jury had heard that MacDonald had claimed MacKenzie gave him a treatment session that had \u201cruined his life\u201d. MacDonald shot Fay MacKenzie in the face through the windows of the house and shot her husband twice, in his front and side, before the police arrived on the scene, tasered and arrested him. Rowena MacDonald, Fay MacKenzie and John MacKenzie survived their injuries. Defending, solicitor advocate Shahid Latif said of Finlay: \u201cHe is sorry for what he did that day. He wishes he could undo and go back in time to try and stop himself. \u201cIn particular, he indicates he has failed his children. He wants them to know he is sorry.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a weird thing about superheroes. They tend to be a little bit more intriguing when they actually have superpowers. Yes, there is the odd exception: Batman has managed to navigate a Gotham City filled with supervillains who vacillate between the distinctly non-magical (Penguin, Carmine Falcone) and the utterly bonkers (Poison Ivy, Clayface), without having any powers of his own \u2013 unless you count his uncanny ability to weaponise extreme wealth and a voice like he has been gargling gravel. Iron Man may not be filled with radioactive spider venom or gamma rays, but he does develop technology that would make Elon Musk sweat as if he\u2019s just realised his latest rocket is running on Windows Vista.<br><br>Then there\u2019s just about everyone else in the Marvel universe \u2013 and they all seem to have some kind of deal going on, whether it be Doctor Strange\u2019s mystical, extra-dimensional shenanigans or Captain Marvel\u2019s cosmic power-ups. Which is why it\u2019s downright weird that the studio has decided to take the new Captain America, Anthony Mackie\u2019s Sam Wilson, right back to the superhero stone age with its latest iteration.</p> <p>The forthcoming Captain America: Brave New World will see Wilson attempting to discover the truth behind an international conspiracy after Harrison Ford\u2019s Thaddeus Ross is elected as US president. It\u2019s a return to the espionage-themed era of earlier Captain America films such as 2014\u2019s The Winter Soldier, and to a lesser extent, 2016\u2019s Civil War. Asked to explain how he is going to manage fighting the good fight without access to the super serum that Wilson decided not to take during the events of Disney+ spin-off The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Mackie suggested he would use his intellect to make up for any shortfall in firepower.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pHDWnXmK7Y\"                                                                        > <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1pHDWnXmK7Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very different with the serum \u2013 you can fight anybody,\u201d <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/11/anthony-mackie-captain-america-brave-new-world-disney-showcase-1236182161/\">he told Deadline</a>. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have the serum, you have to be smart and engineer different ways of defeating [enemies]. With Sam, him being a counsellor, he uses more of his brains than brawn. He uses more of his wit than his fist. He\u2019s more of a friend to everyone.\u201d</p> <p>All of which is fine, but sounds a bit like Wilson\u2019s superpower will manifest as just being really, really especially careful. There\u2019s a longstanding debate in comic books about the efficacy of constantly increasing superpowers: Superman is so invulnerable to just about anything and anyone that DC Comics had to introduce kryptonite just to give the story guys something to spin off. Brie Larson\u2019s Captain Marvel is so powerful that she has to be kept off-world most of the time to avoid outshining everyone else on the Avengers team.</p> <p>But does that mean it\u2019s OK to have superheroes with basically no power at all? There\u2019s nothing wrong with the likes of Hawkeye and Black Widow \u2013 both have (or had) something different that made their inability to punch through wallsfine while they were saving the world with grit, guile, and a knack for making impossible odds look like a mildly inconvenient traffic jam.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a weird thing about superheroes. They tend to be a little bit more intriguing when they actually have superpowers. Yes, there is the odd exception: Batman has managed to navigate a Gotham City filled with supervillains who vacillate between the distinctly non-magical (Penguin, Carmine Falcone) and the utterly bonkers (Poison Ivy, Clayface), without having any powers of his own \u2013 unless you count his uncanny ability to weaponise extreme wealth and a voice like he has been gargling gravel. Iron Man may not be filled with radioactive spider venom or gamma rays, but he does develop technology that would make Elon Musk sweat as if he\u2019s just realised his latest rocket is running on Windows Vista. Then there\u2019s just about everyone else in the Marvel universe \u2013 and they all seem to have some kind of deal going on, whether it be Doctor Strange\u2019s mystical, extra-dimensional shenanigans or Captain Marvel\u2019s cosmic power-ups. Which is why it\u2019s downright weird that the studio has decided to take the new Captain America, Anthony Mackie\u2019s Sam Wilson, right back to the superhero stone age with its latest iteration. The forthcoming Captain America: Brave New World will see Wilson attempting to discover the truth behind an international conspiracy after Harrison Ford\u2019s Thaddeus Ross is elected as US president. It\u2019s a return to the espionage-themed era of earlier Captain America films such as 2014\u2019s The Winter Soldier, and to a lesser extent, 2016\u2019s Civil War. Asked to explain how he is going to manage fighting the good fight without access to the super serum that Wilson decided not to take during the events of Disney+ spin-off The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Mackie suggested he would use his intellect to make up for any shortfall in firepower. \u201cIt\u2019s very different with the serum \u2013 you can fight anybody,\u201d he told Deadline. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have the serum, you have to be smart and engineer different ways of defeating [enemies]. With Sam, him being a counsellor, he uses more of his brains than brawn. He uses more of his wit than his fist. He\u2019s more of a friend to everyone.\u201d All of which is fine, but sounds a bit like Wilson\u2019s superpower will manifest as just being really, really especially careful. There\u2019s a longstanding debate in comic books about the efficacy of constantly increasing superpowers: Superman is so invulnerable to just about anything and anyone that DC Comics had to introduce kryptonite just to give the story guys something to spin off. Brie Larson\u2019s Captain Marvel is so powerful that she has to be kept off-world most of the time to avoid outshining everyone else on the Avengers team. But does that mean it\u2019s OK to have superheroes with basically no power at all? There\u2019s nothing wrong with the likes of Hawkeye and Black Widow \u2013 both have (or had) something different that made their inability to punch through wallsfine while they were saving the world with grit, guile, and a knack for making impossible odds look like a mildly inconvenient traffic jam. And yet The Falcon and the Winter Soldier almost fetishised Wilson\u2019s reluctance to power up: Wyatt Russell\u2019s US Agent is seen as cheating by imbibing the special sauce and putting himself on par with the original Captain America, all of which creates a weird vibe around the super serum and perhaps even superpowers themselves. The idea becomes that Chris Evans\u2019 Cap was a true superhero largely for his decency and altruism rather than for his ability to Frisbee a shield so hard it turned Nazis into abstract art. Had anyone else been given the same privileges, they might have used them for selfish purposes rather than the greater good. But this means the serum itself becomes a kind of magical protein shake laced with moral judgment, where the results depend entirely on whether you\u2019re sipping it for justice, or secretly planning to crush your enemies. The problem is that Wilson, even with those swanky metal wings, is at some point going to come up against bad guys even nastier than the Red Hulk (who we know Ross is going to transform into at some point during the events of Brave New World). There is surely going to be some super serum out there, shining in the sun like a luxury yacht anchored just off the coast of moral bankruptcy, but our hero\u2019s not allowed to take any, because he\u2019ll be letting the side down. Our new Captain America may be a fiercely principled beacon of unwavering determination. But he\u2019s also showing himself up as the one Avenger who would rather lose a fight than admit they need a little help from science juice. Is that true heroism, or just a very dramatic way to prove you can bench-press your own moral high ground?",

Paul Anderson retired in June from his post as chief constable of Humberside police. His departure was announced just 10 months after taking the role and he was placed under investigation by the police watchdog. The Independent Office for Police Conduct has now elevated the seriousness of its investigation and decided the allegations could amount to gross misconduct, the gravest level of disciplinary offence. It follows complaints made by other officers and staff. Anderson is under investigation for \u201cunprofessional behaviour, including making discriminatory, insensitive and offensive comments\u201d, the IOPC said. One remark being investigated was alleged to have been made at an event to boost the combatting of violence against women and girls. One source said a woman was present and heard the remark. The allegations also include comments made about a Humberside police investigation into a Hull funeral home, which some police colleagues who were present said they found offensive. The Guardian understands there are also new claims that concerns about Anderson were raised before his retirement was decided and then publicly announced. The police superintendents\u2019 association said concerns about Anderson were raised formally one month before his retirement. Dan Murphy, the PSA assistant national secretary, said: \u201cMembers of the police superintendents\u2019 association first reported concerns to Humberside police chief officers relating to allegations of misconduct regarding the former chief constable on 23 May 2024.\u201d In a statement the IOPC signalled it was trying to get formal statements from the officers understood to have concerns, but was yet to have talked to their investigators. The IOPC said: \u201cWe continue to independently investigate allegations referred to us by the Humberside police and crime commissioner\u2019s office, relating to a former senior officer.\u201d Sources say the number of alleged whistleblowers may run into double figures or beyond. The IOPC\u2019s statement continued: \u201cInvestigators have gathered and reviewed a significant amount of information, including witness statements. Efforts are ongoing to obtain additional statements as part of our inquiries. \u201cFollowing a review of the available evidence, we have now informed the former officer that they are under investigation for potential gross misconduct. This relates to allegations of unprofessional behaviour, including making discriminatory, insensitive and offensive comments, and that they used their senior position to interfere with the outcome of a disciplinary matter. \u201cThe serving of a misconduct notice does not necessarily mean that misconduct proceedings will follow. As with all our investigations, the status of those involved will remain under review throughout.\u201d Anderson took over running the force with Humberside rated as outstanding and the best-performing force ever assessed by the policing inspectorate. Sources said a chasm had emerged between staff and the leadership. A spokesperson for Humberside police said: \u201cThe IOPC investigation into former chief constable Paul Anderson is independent of Humberside police and reports to the office of the police and crime commissioner. As such the force has no oversight of the investigation and therefore is unable to comment.\u201d A spokesperson for Humberside\u2019s police and crime commissioner said: \u201cWe have been made aware of the outcome of the latest IOPC severity assessment of the allegations made against the former chief constable and that the investigation continues. As this remains a live investigation we cannot comment further.\u201d Anderson worked in policing for 34 years and joined Humberside police as an assistant chief constable in 2019, becoming deputy chief constable before rising to chief constable in August 2023.",

      "bodyText": "Child safety experts have warned the UK government against enacting an Australian-style social media ban for children under 16, which they called a \u201cretrograde step\u201d that would \u201cdo more harm than good\u201d. On Thursday, Australia became the first country in the world to ban under-16s from using social media platforms. The move was supported by a large majority of the Australian public \u2013 but academics, politicians and child rights groups said it could backfire, driving teenagers to the dark web, or make them feel more isolated. These concerns were echoed by child safety experts in the UK, who called the ban \u201cretrograde\u201d and said a similar move in Britain would \u201cpenalise children for the failures of tech companies\u201d. Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, has indicated that Britain could follow Australia\u2019s lead. Last week, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that a similar ban was \u201con the table\u201d, before telling the Guardian days later that such a move was \u201cnot on the cards\u201d for now. Peter Wanless, the chief executive of the NSPCC, has objected to a ban in the UK, saying social media was an \u201cintegral part of young people\u2019s lives\u201d.

Gavin adored any music and art that was challenging or tough for those to whom it was unfamiliar, and he saw the TV documentary as an irresistibly fascinating way to invite the public into worlds they might otherwise never have discovered. He had no patience with anyone who lacked the energy and curiosity to find out more about what they did not understand. </p> <p>At the same time, he was sympathetic to artists who had turned away from the more rebarbative aspects of 20th-century modernism, and whom he warmed to as outsiders even in a world of outsiders. He worked with many, including the composers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/oct/08/h-k-gruber-bbcpo\">HK Gruber</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/sep/04/john-adams-contemporary-music-guide\">John Adams</a> when neither were well-known, and his last and uncompleted project was to have been a portrait of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/01/howard-skempton-portrait-review\">Howard Skempton</a>.</p> <p>Folk music was an abiding passion.

There he enjoyed listening to Russian while monitoring Soviet air traffic, as well as pursuing musical interests by taking over from an acquaintance a cross-border vinyl record trafficking route, exchanging western desirables for eastern bloc classical recordings, often of obscure repertoire.

      "bodyText": "Friday\u2019s vote by British MPs in favour of legalising assisted dying is the first step towards landmark legislation that would mean terminally ill adults wishing to end their lives can legally be helped to do so in England and Wales for the first time. The vote passed by 330 votes to 275, a clear but not overwhelming margin, reflecting the often passionately held positions on each side of the debate. Campaigners in favour of the change had argued that the legislation offered a rare opportunity to give choice and dignity to people who wanted to end their own lives, under strictly limited circumstances. But many of those who had opposed it expressed fears that it could allow vulnerable people to be coerced into opting for an early death. Others had argued that efforts should instead be directed to improving palliative and end of life care. The vote is a watershed in what has been an intensely debated subject in the UK for decades. Polls show a majority of the public support legalising the measure. The bill passed by MPs proposes that terminally ill adults who are expected to die within six months and wish to hasten their death can be helped to do so by a doctor. Those supporting the bill insist it includes tough safeguards to prevent sick people being put under pressure to end their own lives. Under the proposals, a person living in England or Wales who wants to be helped to end their life must be over 18, be expected to die within six months and have the mental capacity to decide. They must make two separate declarations, witnessed and signed, about their wish to die, to the satisfaction of two independent doctors and a high court judge. While a doctor would prepare the substance being used to end life, the person would have to take or administer it themselves. It would be illegal to pressurise someone to take this step, with a penalty of up to 14 years in prison. The legislation does not apply in Scotland or Northern Ireland. The vote was introduced not as part of the government\u2019s business but as a private member\u2019s bill. This is a lottery system by which MPs are able to propose measures that fall outside the government\u2019s agenda if their names are drawn at the top of a ballot. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, came first in the ballot in September. While most private members\u2019 bills go nowhere, Leadbeater opted to propose a measure on which MPs last voted in 2015 \u2013 then, a previous assisted dying bill was comprehensively rejected. She has compared the campaign for assisted dying to the push to allow a woman the right to choose an abortion, arguing that terminally ill people should be given similar autonomy over their bodies. The landmark 1967 Abortion Act, which legalised abortion in Britain with limitations, was also introduced as a private member\u2019s bill. It was a \u201cfree\u201d vote, meaning individual MPs were allowed to vote according to their conscience, rather than along party lines communicated by a government whip. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, voted in favour, but the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, and other cabinet ministers opposed it. The opposition Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, who voted against, had said she supported assisted dying in principle but could not back the current proposals. Most MPs from the ruling Labour party \u2013 234 out of 402 \u2013 voted in favour, but only 23 Conservative MPs out of 121 did so; the previous prime minister, Rishi Sunak, was among them. The vote does not mean the matter is now law. Rather the passing of the \u201csecond reading\u201d of the bill \u2013 which, despite its name, is the first time representatives have been able to debate and vote on it in parliament \u2013 means the proposal passes to the committee stage, the next step of the parliamentary process, at which each clause is examined carefully and any amendments can be debated. This will not happen before next spring. The bill will then be put to another MPs\u2019 vote in the House of Commons before, if passing again, going to the House of Lords. As the law stands at present, assisting a suicide is illegal in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. While it is not explicitly a crime in Scotland, helping someone to die could lead to a charge of culpable homicide. The state has declined to prosecute in some cases, however, leading to uncertainty for terminally ill people who want to choose how and when to die. In 2010, Starmer \u2013 at the time the director of public prosecutions or chief public prosecutor for England and Wales \u2013 said it was not in the public interest to prosecute a doctor, Michael Irwin, who travelled with a patient to the Dignitas clinic in Zurich where he ended his life.

Needless to say, he does not.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in the last eight or nine years, or maybe even longer, would have said that City at home or away, the word easy never comes to my mind if I think about City,\u201d he said. \u201cNot at all.

And against Feyenoord, that has not happened many times \u2013 they were 3-0 up, completely dominating the game and all of a sudden, in the end it was 3-3. They are still a very, very, very good team and one of the reasons I think Pep Guardiola is the best manager in the world \u2013 or one of the best, but I think the best \u2013 is that he always comes up with solutions for his problems.</p> \n  <p>\u201cHis problem now might be that Rodri is out but we all know, at least I think, that he will come with a solution and their run of form will go up again \u2013 hopefully after Sunday.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-29T16:19:15.717Z\">at 4.19pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6749cc3e8f088c7046fdfa9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-29T14:23:31.492Z\">2.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Crystal Palace:</strong> Having steadied the listing ship somewhat with a win and two draws in their past four games, Crystal Palace host Newcastle tomorrow.

I\u2019m hoping to win. It\u2019s going to be a different match, with a lot of fighting, a lot of long balls, second balls \u2026 a quality coach that understands the league.\u201d</p> \n  <p>(Second balls, love it.

He is really a team player.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Jamie Jackson asks how Amorim can make up for lost time, having come in halfway through the season. Will he use videos?</strong> \u201cI was a player. For players, videos more than 12 minutes, forget it \u2026 we have to imagine, instead of video, we will do it [tactics] walking and jogging. Yes, showing some videos \u2026</p> \n  <p>They [the assistant coaches] are more important than me. That\u2019s it \u2026 They are very good players. They need to believe. If you can\u2019t run, you can jog [in training]. Of course it\u2019s not the same.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Everton have had all week to prepare while Manchester United played last night.</strong> \u201cIt is what it is. We will rotate players. We will be ready \u2026 we will use four subs to manage not the fitness, to manage the game. No excuse. We have to be ready for Sunday. And we have to win.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWithout training, you have to use the games. I felt we pressed a bit higher [last night]. Rasmus was dead in the end.

Then you have to understand the human, also. He wants this really bad. And that is most important. He proved to all of you he is a talented player. He is a European champion \u2026 he has to stay fit. In certain moments you can see Mason is a proper footballer. I believe a lot in Mason Mount.\u201d</p> \n  <p>And a tactical question to finish: [Last night] \u201cYou saw 4-4-2, more defending \u2026 then we put two wide players. But you have to change the characteristics. To open the field, to play, and to close the field when we lose the ball.

We have lost a lot of games in a row. There are still many, many games to play. Liverpool [are one of the best teams in the world] at the moment. Arne [Slot] is doing a great job.

I don\u2019t know when. That is the truth. We are second in the Premier League table, we are not in a good moment in terms of results, but I have the feeling in general that we played more than decent, but not enough to win games. But in life it is about when you stand up again. You are stable when you are 10, 11, 12 games winning but [if we win one game at Anfield] it does not mean we are stable. If we do not have the players [who are injured] we are probably going to fall down again. You have to accept when you are in a bad moment and you challenge it. I want an opportunity to challenge [the bad form]. I don\u2019t want to run away. I asked for this challenge and opportunity. I feel it. I know what we have to do.

If you\u2019re not already a subscriber, sign up to have each day\u2019s edition slither apologetically into your inbox (or spam folder) from Monday to Friday. And on that note, we\u2019ll leave you for today \u2013 have a great weekend. Liverpool: A rock in the heart of Liverpool\u2019s defence this season, Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 has confirmed he will miss his side\u2019s match against Manchester City on Sunday. \u201cSo frustrating to pick up this injury right at the end of a great game on Wednesday night,\u201d he posted on Instagram, a couple of days after hobbling off at full-time against Real Madrid with a knee injury. \u201cNow we start the recovery process, but one thing I promise is I will come back and be the best I can be once again.\u201d With Conor Bradley\u2019s fitness for Sunday also in doubt after he strained a hamstring, we will continue to feverishly monitor the 21-year-old\u2019s Facebook, Bluesky and TikTok accounts for updates. Bournemouth: Andoni Iraola takes his side to Wolves tomorrow on the back of consecutive defeats at the hands of Brentford and Brighton. Needless to say, the Spaniard is expecting another tough game tomorrow. \u201cThey are surely in their best moment of the season,\u201d he said of tomorrow\u2019s opponents. \u201cThey come to us without any losses in their past four. We have to be ready for a very good team. We have to be at their level. In their first run of fixtures, it was very difficult because they played against all of the top teams. A similar thing happened to us last season. Now they have had more games against teams around their level, they have been very good.\u201d It is to be hoped somebody tells Andoni that the game is at Molineux and not the Vitality Stadium, as he seems to think. Ipswich Town: Kieran McKenna got his media duties ahead of Ipswich\u2019s trip to Nottingham Forest out of the way yesterday and was asked to discuss his side\u2019s progress after they\u2019d taken four points from games against Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United either side of the international break. \u201cI think you look at the performances in both games and there was a lot of positives to take but it\u2019s up to us to continue that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel like we are in pretty good form but it\u2019s about the next game - a tough game against Nottingham Forest. We need to step up again.\u201d Asked about Omari Hutchinson, who scored a fine equaliser against United last week, Mckenna had this to say. \u201cIt\u2019s enjoyable seeing a hungry, talented young player getting to grips with the league and trying to make an impact. He\u2019s been a positive through the season but certainly in the last few games. He was maybe the standout attacker on the pitch against Manchester United. He is making good strides. Lots to go.\u201d Manchester City\u2019s beleaguered manager was in a very talkative mood as he discussed his side\u2019s slump in fortunes and the fact that past successes are protecting him from the sack. Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson with a round-up of the latest Pep-talk. Newcastle: Eddie Howe\u2019s side travel to Crystal Palace tomorrow hoping to bounce back from a dreadful performance in defeat at the hands of West Ham at St James\u2019 Park on Monday. Asked if he\u2019d ripped his players a new one in the aftermath of their poor display, he said he had not. \u201cFirstly, from personal view point, you can never underestimate opposition,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second goal floored us which was a surprising reaction. First thing you look at is the attitude of players, the key clues to how players are mentally going into a game and they were pretty good. So no riot act but lots of analysis since.\u201d The Newcastle head coach went on to describe tomorrow\u2019s match against Palace as \u201canother test of their mentality\u201d. Asked about Callum Wilson\u2019s return from another lengthy spell on the sidelines through injury, he had this to say: \u201cIt is difficult, naturally every sportsman wants to execute what they are paid and love to do. He loves to scores goals. In training he has a brilliant mentality to do that. When you can\u2019t do that because of your body it is frustrating.\u201d Everton: Yet to feature for Everton this season as he continues his recovery from the achilles injury he was carrying when he signed on loan from Chelsea in August, Armando Broja has had a couple of run-outs with the club\u2019s under-21s this week and could be part of the senior squad that travels to Old Trafford on Sunday. Over to you, Sean Dyche \u2026 \u201cWe\u2019re getting there,\u201d said the Everton boss. \u201cAB [Broja] will get some minutes again today, as will Youssef Chermiti on his journey back to full fitness, which is good. AB is in front of Youssef. This is only Youssef\u2019s start point, really, but AB is looking really fit. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how he gets on today. He\u2019s done a lot of background work and I\u2019ve spoken to him about possibly being involved\u201d Broja\u2019s last senior appearance came in Albania\u2019s 1-0 defeat at the hands of Spain in Dusseldorf during the Euro 2024, while the 23-year-old striker has not scored a Premier League goal in 14 months. With a barren spell like that to his name, the 23-year-old should feel right at home among his fellow Everton strikers. Miaow. Women\u2019s football: Both England and the USA have key absences but the out-of-sorts hosts hope to learn from going toe-to-toe with Emma Hayes\u2019s resurgent side, writes Tom Garry. Brentford: Christian N\u00f8rgaard was sent of last weekend for catching Jordan Pickford\u2019s shin with his studs as he tried to force a loose ball home against Everton last weekend. While there was zero intent or malice, the Brentford midfielder was sent off and personally, I thought it was the right decision. Thomas Frank and others disagreed, Brentford appealed and the red card has since been rescinded. \u201cIt\u2019s more happiness that we have him available for the next three games,\u201d said Frank earlier this afternoon. \u201cIt would have been a very harsh decision. I\u2019m very happy that it was correctly overturned. This [VAR mistakes] will be an ongoing thing. We are luckily still dealing with people and not AI. Human beings can make mistakes. I think it is progressing in the right way.\u201d Frank went on to say that Brentford will be without Kristoffer Ajer and Gustavo Nunes for tomorrow\u2019s visit of Leicester. Women\u2019s football: Emma Hayes takes her USA side to Wembley for a prestige friendly against England tomorrow night. You can hear Faye Carruthers, Suzanne Wrack, Megan Swanick and Tom Garry preview the game in the latest episode of the Guardian\u2019s Women\u2019s Football Weekly and if you\u2019re not already a subscriber you can sign up on all the usual pod platforms. Aston Villa: Without a win in seven games across the Carabao Cup, Premier League and Champions League, Aston Villa are having a bad time of it at the moment and face a tough assignment at Chelsea on Sunday. Unai Emery has been chatting ahead of their trip to Stamford Bridge. \u201c\u201cWe are Aston Villa, we are in our process,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe are more or less getting our high demands but to be consistent is the next challenge. We\u2019ve won two times [against Chelsea] and we\u2019ve drawn in the cup but now it is a different match. A different match, different players and different coach of them. They are feeling comfortable, they are performing consistently and getting better and the challenge is this Sunday. We want to fight to be competing [with those teams] that are contending for the top seven.\u201d Villa currently sit eighth in the table, behind Nottingham Forest on goal difference. Liverpool: As mentioned previously, Arne Slot did his media duties ahead of Liverpool\u2019s match against Manchester City yesterday, when he was asked if he thinks the champions will be \u201ceasier\u201d to face because of their current run of bad form. Needless to say, he does not. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in the last eight or nine years, or maybe even longer, would have said that City at home or away, the word easy never comes to my mind if I think about City,\u201d he said. \u201cNot at all. I know everybody is looking at their results and I have seen them as well, but if you face them \u2013 and that\u2019s what we do \u2013 you analyse it and I have seen, for example, against Brighton they were 1-0 up and could have scored for 2-0 or 3-0 but didn\u2019t, and then were beaten 2-1. \u201cAgainst Tottenham after 20 minutes they could have been two or three goals up, [but] weren\u2019t. And against Feyenoord, that has not happened many times \u2013 they were 3-0 up, completely dominating the game and all of a sudden, in the end it was 3-3. They are still a very, very, very good team and one of the reasons I think Pep Guardiola is the best manager in the world \u2013 or one of the best, but I think the best \u2013 is that he always comes up with solutions for his problems. \u201cHis problem now might be that Rodri is out but we all know, at least I think, that he will come with a solution and their run of form will go up again \u2013 hopefully after Sunday.\u201d Crystal Palace: Having steadied the listing ship somewhat with a win and two draws in their past four games, Crystal Palace host Newcastle tomorrow. Not renowned for the quality of their performances in the Big Smoke, Eddie Howe\u2019s side go into this game on the back of their worst performance of the season, an uncharacteristically insipid display in defeat at home against West Ham on Monday night. Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has confirmed that both Eberechi Eze and Eddie Nketiah will be fit to take their places in his squad. \u201cEberechi will be in the squad tomorrow, Eddie Nketiah as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe worked pretty hard on their rehab, and also the medical staff did an amazing job, so that\u2019s why they are available earlier than expected. \u201cOther players are coming back, some have had one more week of training after returning from injuries, so this week was very positive. It\u2019s good when we enter a three-game week that players are back, so now we have a better situation in the squad.\u201d After tomorrow\u2019s game, Palace travel to Ipswich for their midweek Premier League game on Tuesday night, then host Manchester City the following Saturday. Southampton: Hurzeler\u2019s opposite number, Russell Martin, takes his Saints side to his home town tonight and is expecting a \u201cwarm\u201d welcome. \u201cI have a lot of people in the crowd that I know will shout some abuse at me,\u201d he joked yesterday. \u201cMy kids are desperate for me to win because they go to a school of all Brighton fans, and they will be in their Southampton shirts and their tracksuits. \u201cI split my time between there and here, because I love being part of this club and part of this city, but my kids are in Brighton, they go to school there, so of course I have to have a home there as well.\u201d On four points, a win for Southampton would not be enough to lift them off the foot of the table but would take them to within a point of Crystal Palace and decimate the field in the game of Last Man Standing I\u2019m currently playing, as half the remaining field of 20 players have gone for Brighton. I\u2019ve plumped for Liverpool this weekend. Diving in to take out man and ball Conor Bradley-on-Kylian Mbappe style, more like. Good afternoon, readers and welcome to the last leg of today\u2019s rolling football news blog. Brighton host Southampton tonight and with my green Leprechaun hat on, I was interested to hear what Fabian Hurzeler had to say about Evan Ferguson in his pre-match presser yesterday. The Irish striker is fully fit but has struggled to get much game time this season, not least because of the scintillating form of Danny Welbeck and Joao Pedro. \u201cI am happy how he is training, what shape he is in physically, mentally,\u201d said Hurzeler, who said a January loan move away from Brighton has not been discussed \u2026 yet. \u201cOf course, he is a young player and needs game time. It is exactly that which I demand from Evan and also what I said to him.\u201d That\u2019s it from me. Barry Glendenning is stepping in. What is Manchester United\u2019s Ruben Amorim expecting from playing Everton in the Premier League on Sunday? \u201cWin. I\u2019m hoping to win. It\u2019s going to be a different match, with a lot of fighting, a lot of long balls, second balls \u2026 a quality coach that understands the league.\u201d (Second balls, love it. He\u2019s obviously seen a lot of Everton and Dyche, and has beautifully given with one hand and taken with the other there.) \u201cWe need to have the ball,\u201d Amorim says. \u201cWe have a short time to recover. I expect to see different things and better things [from the players]. On Diego Dalot: \u201cHe is not a machine. I think he plays better on the right \u2026 a player who can play both sides is perfect. I expect the same as last year that you saw. He is really a team player.\u201d Jamie Jackson asks how Amorim can make up for lost time, having come in halfway through the season. Will he use videos? \u201cI was a player. For players, videos more than 12 minutes, forget it \u2026 we have to imagine, instead of video, we will do it [tactics] walking and jogging. Yes, showing some videos \u2026 They [the assistant coaches] are more important than me. That\u2019s it \u2026 They are very good players. They need to believe. If you can\u2019t run, you can jog [in training]. Of course it\u2019s not the same.\u201d Everton have had all week to prepare while Manchester United played last night. \u201cIt is what it is. We will rotate players. We will be ready \u2026 we will use four subs to manage not the fitness, to manage the game. No excuse. We have to be ready for Sunday. And we have to win. \u201cWithout training, you have to use the games. I felt we pressed a bit higher [last night]. Rasmus was dead in the end. The guys who are playing, they have to push more, to the limit. The other guys have to train \u2026 We will manage with all the staff trying to figure out ways to deal with that.\u201d A question about Mason Mount next: \u201cMason is working really hard. Then you have to understand the human, also. He wants this really bad. And that is most important. He proved to all of you he is a talented player. He is a European champion \u2026 he has to stay fit. In certain moments you can see Mason is a proper footballer. I believe a lot in Mason Mount.\u201d And a tactical question to finish: [Last night] \u201cYou saw 4-4-2, more defending \u2026 then we put two wide players. But you have to change the characteristics. To open the field, to play, and to close the field when we lose the ball. It\u2019s the same for every team.\u201d The Chelsea gaffer Enzo Maresca is asked about Nicolas Jackson: \u201cHe\u2019s been doing very well. He has been open-minded, as sometimes we require different things from him. \u201cThe way we want to play off the ball, it\u2019s always aggressive, and we are very happy with him.\u201d How good can Jackson be? \u201cHe is already good enough for us \u2026 but like all the players, there are many things he can do better \u201cSometimes he misses one v one chances. He can be a bit more brave.\u201d How does he keep all the Chelsea players happy when he has to rotate? \u201cIt\u2019s never easy. It\u2019s the bad part for all managers. But the good thing is they can see clearly it\u2019s not the same 11 playing every game \u2026 We need all of them. \u201cThe target is for them to compete with each other in the right way.\u201d Are Chelsea in the Premier League title race? \u201cNo. I said many times. I like the pressure. I\u2019d like to say \u2013 \u2018Yes, we are there. But we are not there. Arsenal, City, Liverpool are ahead of us. The important thing is we improve game after game. Then we\u2019ll see.\u201d \u201cWe have a bounce back mentality,\u201d says Marco Silva after Fulham\u2019s thumping by Wolves. \u201cWolves had four shots \u2026 it was a strange game. And the score didn\u2019t reflect the game. \u201cWe are going to be ready for the next one \u2026 we analysed, we worked on it, and we\u2019re ready.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve made a considerable difference to the defensive part,\u201d says Everton\u2019s Sean Dyche before Sunday\u2019s meeting with Manchester United, Ruben Amorim\u2019s first home Premier League game in charge. \u201cThe final third is hardest as a manager \u2026 you can\u2019t kick it in for them,\u201d \u201cStrikers want to score goals \u2026 Dom [Calvert-Lewin} has been working hard \u2026 Beto\u2019s been working hard \u2026 \u201cWe have mixture of good strikers, I feel, but we\u2019ve got to get them operating. That\u2019s my responsibility and the staff\u2019s to get us scoring more goals.\u201d On facing Amorim: \u201cI think everyone talks about new manager bounce. It\u2019s more difficult in that way \u2026 they\u2019ve got good players, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s been working with the players and trying to get his thoughts across. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know much of his work, other than stuff from the TV, stats and facts. Gary O\u2019Neil speaks before Bournemouth\u2019s visit to Molineux tomorrow: \u201cHe can play there, it was a decent discovery for us,\u201d he says of Mario Lemina\u2019s role at centre-back last weekend in the thumping 4-1 win at Fulham. \u201cHe handled a very good Fulham attack exceptionally well.\u201d \u201cZero concern from my part,\u201d he says, on potential interest from other clubs in Matheus Cunha. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to make him perform as best he can. I want the world to want him. I don\u2019t see there being any problems with him in January \u2026 the contract stuff will be handled by the football club \u2026 Matheus won\u2019t leave in January. Definitely not. \u201cI\u2019m proud of Matheus at this moment. He\u2019s worked very, very hard. He\u2019s a very humble guy. He was big enough and open enough to accept the gaps he had in his game, and he\u2019s gone head on in trying to piece the bits together. \u201cHe has quality \u2026 all the other stuff is workable \u2026 you can\u2019t help players with the quality and understanding they have \u2026 he is an exceptional player and very important to the group.\u201d Did O\u2019Neil feel pressure when results weren\u2019t so good? \u201cI didn\u2019t feel under any pressure \u2026 or, I\u2019m always under pressure. I put pressure on myself \u2026 hopefully the fanbase have enjoyed the last few weeks more than the previous ones \u2026 now Bournemouth come and they are going to be a really tough test \u2026 it\u2019ll be a real big test. Four unbeaten, yes, but desperate to make it five.\u201d Barcelona have stiff competition in midfield and Frenkie de Jong must work to nail down a first-team spot, manager Hansi Flick said. De Jong has been sidelined for several months due to a persistent ankle injury, which also meant he missed Euro 2024 with the Netherlands. Since his October return, the 27-year-old has largely featured off the bench, making just two starts, and he was booed during Barcelona\u2019s 3-0 Champions League win over French club Brest. \u201cHe must deal with this situation. He must regain his confidence. We look at every game to win. We want to play with the best team and based on that we make the eleven,\u201d Flick said before a home game against Las Palmas on Saturday. \u201cHe will be back, but it takes time. For me he was injured and now he is progressing well, and personally three or four weeks ago, when he started playing, he had a different mentality. \u201cNow he\u2019s back after the international break and we support him, but we have a lot of midfielders. Those who are at 100% will play. He has to show the level. He is progressing, we follow him and we support him.\u201d \u201cThe managers just keep on coming,\u201d declares the anchor on a well-known sports news TV channel, leading into an advert break. \u201cWe\u2019re about to hear from Wolves\u2019 Gary O\u2019Neil.\u201d Exciting! On Guardiola and crisis-club Manchester City, Krishnamoorthy emails: \u201cWhen Joseph Heller was told that he has not written a book as good as Catch-22 on the 10th year anniversary of the book he replied \u201cWho has?\u201d Pep Guardiola is speaking about his Manchester City side\u2019s visit to Anfield. Here\u2019s some of what he had to say. On the challenge of facing Liverpool: It will be difficult. We have lost a lot of games in a row. There are still many, many games to play. Liverpool [are one of the best teams in the world] at the moment. Arne [Slot] is doing a great job. We are not as stable [as we used to be]. In the past when we went 3-0 up we were in control. The best place to prove if we are stable is Anfield.\u201d Guardiola is asked if his club is in crisis. Spoiler: he doesn\u2019t seem to think so. [We are in crisis] when you [journalists] write about it. We will be back, I know that. I don\u2019t know when. That is the truth. We are second in the Premier League table, we are not in a good moment in terms of results, but I have the feeling in general that we played more than decent, but not enough to win games. But in life it is about when you stand up again. You are stable when you are 10, 11, 12 games winning but [if we win one game at Anfield] it does not mean we are stable. If we do not have the players [who are injured] we are probably going to fall down again. You have to accept when you are in a bad moment and you challenge it. I want an opportunity to challenge [the bad form]. I don\u2019t want to run away. I asked for this challenge and opportunity. I feel it. I know what we have to do. It\u2019s no excuse to say Rodri\u2019s not there. What am I going to do? Cry every day. We not have consistency at the moment but tell me which sport team in the past decade has had the consistency of us? No one.\u201d Bayer Leverkusen want to show they have rediscovered consistency with a win at Union Berlin on Saturday that would make it three consecutive victories in all competitions, says coach Xabi Alonso. Leverkusen, who won the domestic league and Cup double last season without a single defeat, crushed Heidenheim in the league 5-2 last week before firing another five goals past RB Salzburg in the Champions League on Tuesday in a 5-0 win. Yet they have managed three consecutive wins in all competitions just once this season, in September. \u201cWe want to have again a good feeling. After [the win over] Heidenheim it was better and it was certainly better after Salzburg,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cTomorrow is a different game ... but it is a good moment to show that after two good games we can play a third good one in a row. I want another clean sheet tomorrow.\u201d Leverkusen have one win in four league games and are fourth on 20 points, nine off leaders Bayern Munich who face Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. \u201cWe know we expect something different against Union and a big challenge in front of us,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cWe have to be prepared for a physical game.\u201d (Reuters) Mikel Arteta has said he feels sympathy for Pep Guardiola after Manchester City\u2019s poor run of results but said dealing with setbacks is part of being a manager. City will attempt to record a first win in seven matches when they face the leaders, Liverpool, on Sunday, with Arsenal having the opportunity to close the gap to Arne Slot\u2019s side at West Ham 24 hours earlier after impressive wins over Nottingham Forest and Sporting this week. Arteta expressed concern for Guardiola\u2019s wellbeing after City surrendered a three-goal lead against Feyenoord in midweek but said he expected their rivals to rediscover their form after such a sustained period of success. A quote headline from Ranieri in Gazzetta, about last night: \u201cWell done Roma, you never gave up. That\u2019s how people get fired up\u201d Thanks John. Good afternoon all. Just listening to Ange Postecoglou asking journalists at today\u2019s press conference why he should make Tottenham more pragmatic. And I have to say, last night\u2019s 2-2 draw against Roma was one of the most entertaining games I\u2019ve seen in a long time. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing, Ange. That\u2019s my stint on the blog done. Over to Luke McLaughlin. But first, a quiz. A reminder of the table. Just look at Liverpool\u2019s advantage. Shades of 2019-20, hopefully without the outbreak of a novel virus. Nottingham Forest were in the top four but have lost their last two. Nuno\u2019s been speaking to his club\u2019s TV channel. Forest host Ipswich at 3pm on Saturday. \u201cVery positive. When you have a problem you have to address it, you have to take care of that and we did that. Now Saturday comes a test. \u201cBut the mentality, the way we want to do things, we must go back from where we start, how we start, how we want to be as a team. When we speak I say over and over these words to the press, to the players, we must be compact, solid. We must be a team that is hard to beat, we must be a team that opponents don\u2019t get anything. The first step has to be always like that when you go into the games.\u201d Kev McCready gets in touch about Arne\u2019s day off: \u201cI\u2019d like to think Arne is enjoying some of Liverpool\u2019s trendier venues - News From Nowhere (an independent bookshop run by a collective of women), The Open Eye (photography gallery) or maybe 69a (antique shop).\u201c It\u2019s been a busy week at Tottenham, might it be a busy January? Here\u2019s Ange on some transfer business. \u201cI\u2019ve already had a few minutes with [Tottenham technical director] Johan [Lange] about a strategy for January. Last year, we did some business which helped us. We\u2019ve got a lot of injuries but a lot of clubs have. At some point it is going to come home to roost, you will either get a diminished product or clubs will have to carry bigger squads.\u201d That West Ham v Arsenal game previewed here by Jacob Steinberg. In that context Lopetegui needs to keep his guard up. Although suggestions that the former Borussia Dortmund manager Edin Terzic was being lined up to take over are wide of the mark, the situation remains precarious. Another bad run would inevitably bring more noise. Some at the club were unsure about Lopetegui\u2019s appointment and suggested alternatives. However Sullivan, still the main power, has championed the 57-year-old and is determined to give him time to silence the doubters. Dortmund v Bayern is at 5.30 on Saturday. Per Reuters Bayern Munich have won seven straight matches with as many consecutive clean sheets but coach Vincent Kompany said that is all in the past and will count for nothing in Saturday\u2019s Bundesliga \u2018Klassiker\u2019 at Borussia Dortmund. Undefeated in the Bundesliga, Bayern are already six points clear at the top of the table ahead of second-placed Eintracht Frankfurt. They have not conceded a goal in their last five league matches and seven across all competitions and have netted 36 times in their 11 Bundesliga matches so far with the league\u2019s leading scorer Harry Kane having already bagged 14 league goals this season. \u201cThe last results are gone now. I just want us to win the game tomorrow. It\u2019s the Klassiker,\u201d Kompany told a press conference on Friday. \u201cI like that these games have this special build-up. We all look forward to these games.\u201d \u201cIf you look at the big picture, it\u2019s important for us not to look too much at how others see our players. It\u2019s how we see them that\u2019s important.\u201d Bayern travel to Dortmund with the hosts far from convincing in the league despite their good run in the Champions League. Hampered by injuries, Dortmund have dropped to fifth in the Bundesliga on 19 points, 10 behind Bayern, after failing to win any of their away matches in the league this season. But Kompany is preparing to face what he said would be \u201cthe best version\u201d of Dortmund no matter their recent Bundesliga results. Dortmund have won all six Bundesliga home matches. \u201cOur preparation is for the best version of the team. If they are top then they go high into their pressing game, they are extremely dangerous on the break with their speed on the wings,\u201d Kompany said of Dortmund. \u201cWhen they are at their best, they are also very, very good at building up the play. It\u2019s not going to be an easy game, it\u2019ll be tough.\u201d Ben Dawson is the caretaker \u2013 interim \u2013 manager at Leicester. On Ruud van Nistelrooy\u2019s reportedly imminent arrival, he\u2019s keeping cards close to his chest. \u201cNothing at the moment. I was hoping you could shed some light on the situation. We probably know as much as you do and we\u2019re just continuing and focusing on the game tomorrow.\u201d Leicester play at Brentford on Saturday at 3pm. Ruben Amorim held his TV duties with fans singing his name. Per PA Media When asked if Arsenal\u2019s form needs to be perfect to finish ahead of Liverpool, Arteta said: \u201cIf they continue then that\u2019s for sure, with the numbers they\u2019re producing and the amount of games they\u2019re winning. \u201cThe focus is on us to maintain the consistency especially and performances that will give us the right to win games, keep the availability in the squad. This is a long run. \u201cWinning lifts the energy and our confidence up. We\u2019ve had two big wins for us and now it\u2019s about consistency and getting that momentum, take it further against a good opponent tomorrow and try to replicate the performance to win the game.\u201d Arteta on the Pep crisis at City. \u201cA bump, everybody has a bump. For them it is very strange because for nine years they have never had it. It tells you the level and the environment that we are in, everything has to be almost perfect - performance and ability has to be perfect and things have to go your way. It is so hard to win.\u201d Arteta on Raheem Sterling, who hasn\u2019t played too much for Arsenal. \u201cI would like to see him more and this is down to me. He is trying his best. His application and his commitment around the team has been exceptional and now it is time for me to get him more minutes. \u201cThat\u2019s the intention [to get him more minutes] and that\u2019s why I put him in against Forest and I wanted to put him in against Sporting and now getting him in that rhythm because he can really impact the team.\u201d It\u2019s West Ham v Arsenal at 5.30pm on Saturday. Mikel Arteta has been speaking about Martin Odegaard: \u201cWith the way he prepares himself and how much work he put in with the physios and medical department to get in the best possible condition to face the period and importance of the season that we are in and to hit the ground running - he has been exceptional since the Chelsea game and he has been very consistent the last three games. \u201cGood players that are so consistent and so reliable that can take the game to a different level and make the players better around them, that\u2019s a huge quality of Martin\u2019s and he has been missed.\u201d Last night\u2019s Europa League action: Colin gets in touch: You won\u2019t hear from Arne Slot today. As Andy Hunter reported he held his press conference yesterday. I think on TNT on Wednesday he said his family was visiting for a few days. Maybe he\u2019s off to visit the Three Graces, Albert Dock, The Cavern &amp; The Cathedrals - \u201cwe\u2019ve got one to spare\u201d. After Ramsus H\u00f8jlund scored twice against Bod\u00f8/Glimt in Manchester United\u2019s 3-2 Europa League win, the No 9 stated Ruben Amorim\u2019s 3-4-3 suited his game. The victory over the Norwegian champions at Old Trafford was United\u2019s second in the competition and lifted them to 12th with nine points after five games. H\u00f8jlund said: \u201cI think the new system, new ideas, are suiting my style of play. I\u2019ve played this sort of football - I don\u2019t say it is the same, but a 3-4-3. I used to play in Atalanta a little bit the same.\u201d H\u00f8jlund played for the Italian club in the 2022-23 season, scoring 10 goals in 34 appearances. The Dane was asked what is different between Amorim\u2019s system and that of his predecessor, Erik ten Hag, for him as the centre-forward. \u201cThe press is very different,\u201d the 21-year-old said. \u201cI have to focus a little bit more on what\u2019s in front of me instead of behind. I showed last season with being the top scorer for the team that I can score goals. I\u2019m still very young but obviously I would like to take the responsibility and that\u2019s why I took the No 9 this year because I want to take the next level and the next step. But I still have a lot to grow \u2013 I\u2019m still not the finished article.\u201d H\u00f8jlund\u2019s goal celebration featured a thumbs-up and thumb-down. \u201cIt\u2019s the Gladiator one. We watched it when we were with the national team and I thought it was a nice celebration.\u201d Let\u2019s get it going with the usual 10 things. Ahead of that Wembley friendly, here\u2019s a piece from the ever excellent Emma John, comparing the England manager to her English opposite number. Warnings from the US for Liverpool as the Salah contract saga goes on. Good piece from Ryan Baldi. The Manchester City saga, the on-field stuff that is, continues on Sunday. Whatever next? They take on all conquering Liverpool on Sunday, and could end up 11 points back in the Premier League. That would be amazing but is it time the champions kick back? We\u2019ll hear from Arne Slot and Pep Guardiola today, and the rest of the Premier League managers. We also await white smoke from Leicester, where Ruud van Nistelrooy is expected to be announced as manager. Join us throughout the day.",

      "body": "<p>London fashion week has become the first of the four main fashion weeks to ban exotic animal skins from shows from 2025 \u2013 the biggest industry event to do so.</p> <p>All designers staging fashion shows at the event will have to commit to ditching skins of animals such as crocodiles, alligators and snakes from their collections.</p> <p>The ban was announced by the British Fashion Council\u2019s deputy director for policy and engagement, David Leigh-Pemberton, in a speech to parliament this week.</p> <p>The move follows the ban on fur, which was first promised by the BFC\u2019s chief executive, Caroline Rush, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/sep/07/london-fashion-week-vows-to-be-fur-free\">in 2018</a>, and formally put in place in December 2023.</p> <p>Within the \u201cbig four\u201d fashion weeks \u2013 New York, London, Milan and Paris \u2013 the British capital has been more progressive when it comes to animal materials.

      "bodyText": "London fashion week has become the first of the four main fashion weeks to ban exotic animal skins from shows from 2025 \u2013 the biggest industry event to do so. All designers staging fashion shows at the event will have to commit to ditching skins of animals such as crocodiles, alligators and snakes from their collections. The ban was announced by the British Fashion Council\u2019s deputy director for policy and engagement, David Leigh-Pemberton, in a speech to parliament this week. The move follows the ban on fur, which was first promised by the BFC\u2019s chief executive, Caroline Rush, in 2018, and formally put in place in December 2023. Within the \u201cbig four\u201d fashion weeks \u2013 New York, London, Milan and Paris \u2013 the British capital has been more progressive when it comes to animal materials. London was the first to ban fur and is now the first to ban exotic skins, and follows smaller but increasingly influential events such as Melbourne fashion week and Copenhagen fashion week. By contrast, fur is still seen at shows in Milan and Paris. Animal rights campaigners welcomed the development. \u201cWe celebrate this important progress,\u201d said Emma H\u00e5kansson, the founding director of Collective Fashion Justice. Dr Charlotte Regan, a wildlife campaign manager at World Animal Protection UK, said the announcement sent an \u201cimportant message throughout the global fashion industry that exploiting animals for their skins is both unethical and unnecessary. \u201cMillions of animals continue to suffer and die for fashion when there are so many innovative and exciting animal-friendly materials designers and clothing companies can choose to create with instead.\u201d Animal rights campaigners would also like to see a ban of feathers, which are sometimes \u201clive-plucked\u201d from birds, causing pain and distress. Regan said: \u201cWith both fur and now wild animal skins banned from London fashion week, our attention turns to the use of wild bird feathers in fashion. We look forward to working with the British Fashion Council on the last step of their journey to being a completely wildlife-free event.\u201d Copenhagen fashion week announced in April that it would ban feathers from its shows from 2025. London fashion week is heavily dominated by emerging designers so the ban may be easier for it to implement, according to the Business of Fashion website, as it is \u201cthe leather goods powerhouses that more often use exotic [skins] in their collections\u201d. Feathers are perhaps a trickier proposition because they are used so frequently by designers as trimming on clothing. It is also harder to ascertain real from faux. In 2023, it was discovered that retailers including Boohoo and Selfridges had mislabelled real feathers as faux. A press statement from the British Fashion Council described the ban as part of a wider package of standards under the organisation\u2019s Institute of Positive Fashion which works across social, environmental and sustainability programmes, partly to reflect the changing feelings of the fashion industry in London. \u201cWe know that many of our designers have strong ethics and are working towards more sustainable practices and accurate measurement,\u201d it read. \u201cWe are committed to providing our network with tools and resources to help them on this journey.

A woman who worked on MasterChef in 2019 said Wallace talked about his sex life and had asked if her boyfriend had a nice bottom. A woman on the BBC Good Food Show in 2010 said Wallace stared at her chest. A woman on Eat Well for Less? in 2019 said Wallace told her he wasn\u2019t wearing any boxer shorts under his jeans. A man who worked on MasterChef in 2005-06 said Wallace regularly made sexually explicit comments on set. He said Wallace once said a dish tasted like his aunt\u2019s vagina, and on another occasion had asked a female runner if she put her finger up her boyfriend\u2019s bottom. A spokesperson for Channel 5, which airs Big Weekends, said the broadcaster had asked Rumpus, the production company which makes the show, to look into the claims. \u201cWe take any allegations of this nature extremely seriously,\u201d they said. \u201cThe health and wellbeing of everyone involved in our productions is very important to us and we want all of our productions to be safe and secure places for people to work.\u201d Rumpus said: \u201cWe do not tolerate inappropriate behaviour on our productions. Our comprehensive duty of care processes were in place during production of these series and any matters raised would have been investigated in accordance with these.\u201d A No 10 spokesperson described the allegations against Wallace as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s right that a thorough investigation is conducted, but this of course is one for the BBC and you will have seen their statement saying that they \u2018take any issues that are raised with us seriously and we have robust processes in place\u2019,\u201d they said. \u201cI believe the BBC is currently undertaking a workplace culture review to deliver clear and timely recommendations, and it\u2019s essential that staff and the wider public have confidence that the BBC takes these issues seriously.\u201d On Thursday MasterChef\u2019s production company, Banijay UK, said it had launched an investigation after the BBC received complaints about Wallace\u2019s behaviour and said the 60-year-old was \u201ccommitted to fully cooperating throughout the process\u201d. The presenter Kirsty Wark, who was a Celebrity MasterChef contestant in 2011, told BBC News that on two occasions during early morning filming Wallace told stories and jokes of a \u201csexualised nature\u201d in front of contestants and crew. She said she felt strongly that the comments were \u201creally, really in the wrong place\u201d. Rod Stewart, whose wife, Penny Lancaster, appeared on Celebrity MasterChef in 2021, used his Instagram account on Thursday to comment on Wallace\u2019s break from the show. Stewart called Wallace a \u201ctubby, bald-headed, ill-mannered bully\u201d and said the presenter had humiliated his wife. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Friday, the former BBC One controller Lorraine Heggessey, who was behind the high-profile sackings of Richard Bacon and Angus Deayton, said broadcasters and programme makers had to \u201cstop treating the presenter as if they\u2019re a special case\u201d. She said: \u201cThey are just one person in a huge team that gets a show on air, and they are neither more special nor less special than anybody else. Somehow we\u2019ve got a culture \u2026 of pandering to those who are in front of camera and letting them get away with the kind of behaviour that other people in teams wouldn\u2019t be allowed to get away with.\u201d A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cWe are always clear that any behaviour which falls below the standards expected by the BBC will not be tolerated. Where an individual is contracted directly by an external production company we share any complaints or concerns with that company and we will always support them when addressing them.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>My brother Neil Goldman, who has died aged 74, was chief executive of the business <a href=\"https://colpacpackaging.com/\">Colpac</a>, where he was at the forefront of innovations in the British paperboard food packaging industry for more than 50 years.</p> <p>Neil joined Colpac, which was originally a hat box-making firm owned by his father, in the early 1970s, just as the consumption of takeaway food was beginning to boom in the UK, and quickly saw an opportunity for the business to branch out into supplying fast food packaging made out of paperboard, rather than the plastic almost exclusively used at the time.</p> <p>He also recognised that the development of paper recycling in the US in the 70s and 80s was an opportunity to provide the market with recyclable paperboard, and therefore a more sustainable way for people to consume food.</p> <p>In addition Neil made sure that Colpac was first to the market with compostable packaging in the 90s, and he developed microwaveable paperboard bowls and heat-seal designs. In fact, just about every environmentally sustainable takeaway food carton, pot, tray and box can trace its roots back to Neil\u2019s innovations.</p> <p>He was born in London as the eldest of the three children of Martin Goldman and Brenda (nee Flugelman), a secretary at the BBC. Both his parents were Jewish, and his father had fled to the UK from Nazi Germany, after which he bought Frank Coleman (Luton) Ltd, a hat box business.</p> <p>Educated at Merchant Taylors\u2019 school in Hertfordshire, Neil won a scholarship to St John\u2019s College, Oxford, to read modern languages. After graduating in 1972 he joined his father\u2019s firm, and by the early 80s he was at the helm, changing the name to Colpac.</p> <p>Outside his business interests, Neil had a philanthropic impact by making substantial donations to charities, including Parkinson\u2019s UK, Cancer Research UK, the Weiner Holocaust Library and Brighter Futures.</p> <p>His exceptional gift for languages \u2013 he spoke nine \u2013 was matched by an incredible ear for melody. In his spare time he wrote dozens of songs while sitting at the piano at his home in Radlett, Hertfordshire, to combat the stresses of business life. Some of those compositions have found their way into two musical theatre projects that he and I collaborated on \u2013 Up Is There and A Tale of Little Italy \u2013 to be developed.</p> <p>Neil is survived by his wife, Olivia (nee Davis), an artist, whom he married in 1986, their daughters, Aura and Talia, and his sisters, Fiona and me.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My brother Neil Goldman, who has died aged 74, was chief executive of the business Colpac, where he was at the forefront of innovations in the British paperboard food packaging industry for more than 50 years. Neil joined Colpac, which was originally a hat box-making firm owned by his father, in the early 1970s, just as the consumption of takeaway food was beginning to boom in the UK, and quickly saw an opportunity for the business to branch out into supplying fast food packaging made out of paperboard, rather than the plastic almost exclusively used at the time. He also recognised that the development of paper recycling in the US in the 70s and 80s was an opportunity to provide the market with recyclable paperboard, and therefore a more sustainable way for people to consume food. In addition Neil made sure that Colpac was first to the market with compostable packaging in the 90s, and he developed microwaveable paperboard bowls and heat-seal designs. In fact, just about every environmentally sustainable takeaway food carton, pot, tray and box can trace its roots back to Neil\u2019s innovations. He was born in London as the eldest of the three children of Martin Goldman and Brenda (nee Flugelman), a secretary at the BBC. Both his parents were Jewish, and his father had fled to the UK from Nazi Germany, after which he bought Frank Coleman (Luton) Ltd, a hat box business. Educated at Merchant Taylors\u2019 school in Hertfordshire, Neil won a scholarship to St John\u2019s College, Oxford, to read modern languages. After graduating in 1972 he joined his father\u2019s firm, and by the early 80s he was at the helm, changing the name to Colpac. Outside his business interests, Neil had a philanthropic impact by making substantial donations to charities, including Parkinson\u2019s UK, Cancer Research UK, the Weiner Holocaust Library and Brighter Futures. His exceptional gift for languages \u2013 he spoke nine \u2013 was matched by an incredible ear for melody. In his spare time he wrote dozens of songs while sitting at the piano at his home in Radlett, Hertfordshire, to combat the stresses of business life. Some of those compositions have found their way into two musical theatre projects that he and I collaborated on \u2013 Up Is There and A Tale of Little Italy \u2013 to be developed. Neil is survived by his wife, Olivia (nee Davis), an artist, whom he married in 1986, their daughters, Aura and Talia, and his sisters, Fiona and me.",

Making hasty decisions could prove costly, so you should always stop and take a moment to assess the offer critically before proceeding.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Fear and anxiety</strong> \u2013 Scammers often incite fear by suggesting that failing to act immediately could result in negative consequences, such as missing out on a deal or facing account issues. <br><br>Emails from retailers are rife at this time of year, but messages claiming that your account has been compromised and urging you to click a link to verify your information are common scams. You should always verify such claims by directly contacting the retailer or service provider through official channels.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Greed and excitement</strong> \u2013 Scammers know that the allure of significant discounts can cloud judgement, so you should always question the authenticity of deals that offer products at prices well below market value. It is wise to compare prices across multiple trusted sources to validate the offer, and shop only from secure, official websites. <br><br>You should always look for a padlock symbol in the address bar and verify that the URL starts with \u201chttps://\u201d.

In its latest financial stability report, the BoE cited the \u201cmaterial\u201d global risks associated with geopolitical tensions, global fragmentation, and pressures on government debt levels. It warned: Uncertainty around, and risks to, the global economic outlook have increased. As the UK is an economy with a large financial sector and in which trade is significant, these risks are particularly relevant to UK financial stability. The Bank added that cybercrime is a significant threat, and also insisted that Donald Trump\u2019s election isn\u2019t the only factor driving up fragmentation risks. The latest check on financial stability also highlighted that half of households will be paying higher mortgages by 2027\u2026 \u2026.and that firms in shadow banking sector risk triggering \u00a317bn asset sell-off, says Bank of England. In the retail world, shops have been offering Black Friday bargains as they try to drum up trade after a tough November. Nationwide reports that the number of purchases by 2pm was 12% higher than on Black Friday 2023. Amazon staff have been striking, with protests in New Delhi and in Germany. UK mortgage approvals rose in October to the highest since August 2022. Eurozone inflation nudged up to 2.3%. And growth in Canada has slowed. Black Friday is firmly up and running in the US, but these photos from New Jersey suggest there\u2019s not a stampede to stores: Meanwhile in Moscow, Russia\u2019s central bank has said no emergency steps were required to prop up the rouble, which has had a sticky week. Philipp Gabunia, a deputy chairman of the Bank of Russia, told reporters Friday at a Moscow briefing: \u201cThe measures that have been taken are sufficient, and we are seeing signs that the situation is stabilizing.\u201d Today, the rouble is slightly stronger against the US dollar, at 106/$. On Wednesday it plunged from 105/$ to 113/$. Back in London, rumours of another piece of takeover action have been crushed. India\u2019s private hospital operator Narayana Health has pledged that it does not intend to make an offer for the UK\u2019s Spire Healthcare. This means it cannot now bid for six months. This followed media reports this morning that Narayana was considering taking a stake in Spire, whose shares jumped 8% in response. Stocks have opened a little higher on Wall Street, as (some) traders return from their Thanksgiving break. Art the start of a shortened session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 38.0 points, or 0.08%, at the open to 44,760.05. The S&amp;P 500 nudged up by 0.09%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite is 0.14% higher. New data from Nationwide seems to confirm that this Black Friday is busier than last year. They report: By 2pm today, Nationwide customers have made 5.24 million transactions - 18 per cent higher than a typical Friday. The number of purchases is 12 per cent higher than on Black Friday 2023 and 16 per cent higher than on the same day in 2022. Back in the retail world, Amazon employees in Bad Hersfeld, Germany, have been holding strike action today. According to the German union Verdi, around 1,200 Amazon employees from all over Germany, supported by colleagues from the USA, Sweden, the UK, and Italy, are on strike to draw attention to their working conditions and the lack of collective bargaining at Amazon. Over in Canada, growth has slowed in the last quarter. Canada, the last member of the G7 to release Q3 GDP data, expanded its gross domestic product by 0.3% in July-September. That\u2019s a slowdown on the 0.5% growth recorded in the first two quarters of this year. Higher household and government spending lifted growth, while slower non-farm inventory accumulation, lower business capital investment and lower exports all dragged. On a per capita basis, GDP fell 0.4% in the third quarter, which was the sixth consecutive quarterly decline. Data from Swedish fintech Klarna suggests there was a surge of interest in Black Friday deals in the UK early this morning, which has slightly tailed off. Klarna, the buy-now-pay-later operator, reports that total sales were 30% higher in the first 6 hours of Black Friday, but this slowed +26% by noon. Klarna also reports high interest in the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max 256GB, and also for Adidas\u2019s Samba OG shoe \u2013 which were dubbed \u201cthis year\u2019s It-footwear\u201d, at least until Rishi Sunak donned a pair\u2026 Hedge funds, pension funds and other companies in the shadow banking sector are at risk of amplifying market shocks and triggering a \u00a317bn asset sell-off, according to the Bank of England\u2019s first ever stress test into the largely unregulated industry. The landmark exercise, the first in the world by a central bank, tracked how non-bank financial institutions \u2013 often referred to as the shadow banking sector \u2013 would react in a short and sharp shock affecting financial markets. The stress test showed that in this scenario, companies would rapidly sell off as much as \u00a317bn worth of assets, as they scrambled to recapitalise or limit their activities, in a way that would \u201camplify the shock\u201d. Speaking of trade tensions\u2026. the head of the World Trade Organization has said today she is eager to work with the incoming Trump administration and that she would take a \u201cconstructive and creative\u201d approach. Speaking at a press briefing, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said: \u201cWe are looking forward to working with the new administration. I think we should come into things with a very constructive and creative approach to trying to deal with the issues that will face the world trading system. She declined to comment specifically on tariff warnings by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, adding: \u201cUntil we get specifics on what is planned it is a bit premature to pronounce on these issues.\u201d [a point the BoE\u2019s Andrew Bailey also made today] Q: What kind of cyber attacks are the Bank worried about? Governor Andrew Bailey says cyber is the risk that has risen most since the financil crisis of 2008. It is constantly evolving and \u201cit never goes away\u201d, he points out. Deputy governor Sam Woods warns that the boundary between state and non-state threat actors in the cyber space is not entirely clear, which adds to the threat. But, he points out, the biggest disruption this year came from the Crowdstrike incident, not a cyber attack, which shows the need for wider operational resilience. Q: Is the Bank of England concerned that France\u2019s borrowing costs rose above Greece\u2019s this week (as Paris\u2019s government was rocked by a budget row)? Governor Andrew Bailey doesn\u2019t really comment on the situation in France, but points out that the UK showed recently how quickly bond markets can move (after the 2022 mini-budget). That why it\u2019s important to have assessment tools, and tools to intervene in the markets if necessary, he adds. Incidentally, despite some breathless commentary about the French bond market in recent days, France\u2019s 10-year borrowing costs have actually fallen this week \u2013 to 2.93%, from 3.049% last week. That\u2019s slightly lower than Greece, whose 10-year bonds are yielding 2.94%. Q: What impact has the budget had on financial stability? We are not, at the moment, seeing any sign of an increase in corporate distress, Governor Andrew Bailey replies firmly. But he adds that the Bank will watch closely to see how the impact of the budget passes through the corporate and household sectors. Q: Have the risks of global fragmentation been increased by the election of a US president who advocates sharp increases in tariffs? Governor Andrew Bailey says it\u2019s very important to see what the Trump administration\u2019s policies are, once it\u2019s in office, rather than simply what the president-elect says. But risks move based on what is expected to happen, and \u201cwe are seeing an increased risk of global fragmentation,\u201d Bailey explains It\u2019s not right to pin that all on one event, though, he adds, saying: We are living in a world that is, I\u2019m afriad, more uncertain on a number of fronts with a number of very difficult events going on around the world. Sam Woods, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for prudential regulation, says the UK\u2019s motor finance scandal isn\u2019t seen as a risk to financial stability. But, misconduct has often been a \u201cquite a significant headwind\u201d to the financial sector in the past, so the Bank needs to monitor it. Woods adds that the Bank didn\u2019t attempt to make a \u2018point estimate\u2019 of the cost of compensation for customers caught up in the car loans issue, in its latest stress tests. Instead, it used the average of the annual cost for conduct failings in the recent past, which is \u00a35bn/year, giving a \u00a325bn cost over the next five years. Is that a hint as to what the Bank thinks it could cost? Moody\u2019s has estimated \u00a330bn, so it\u2019s in a similar ballpark\u2026. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff asks the Bank of England about Labour\u2019s criticism of the reforms brought in after the 2008 financial crisis. Q: Is the Bank concerned about the messaging from the government, encouraging risk-taking in the financial markets, and have you considered that when calculating the risk that banks and shadow banking could pose to financial stability? Governor Andrew Bailey replies that this is a very important question. The Bank is \u201cobviously\u201d very supportive of growth, he insists. But, there isn\u2019t a trade-off between growth and financial stability, he insists. That stability is the \u2018bedrock\u2019 for the economy. He says the Bank could only switch its bank stress tests from every year, to every two years, because the UK now has financial stability. That decision cuts costs and work for banks, but is only possible because there\u2019s more resilience within the sector. The Bank of England\u2019s new financial stability report also shows that around half of mortgages are expected to see payment increases by the third quarter of 2027. That follows the sharp increases in interest rates \u2013 from record lows - in 2022 and 2023, before the Bank began cutting this year. Despite this, though, the Bank says the share of households spending a high proportion of their income on mortgage payments is expected to remain low, adding: While many UK households, including renters, are still facing pressures from the increased cost of living and higher interest rates, the share of households who are behind in paying their mortgages is low by historical standards. It also warns that some companies will struggle with higher borrowing costs, saying: Firms will come under more pressure if they have a large amount of existing market-based debt which is due to be replaced with new debt, or if a high proportion of income is being spent on repayments. The Bank of England are presenting their financial stability report at a press confence in London now. You can watch it here: Governor Andrew Bailey starts by reading a slightly abridged version of the statement we quoted at 10.42am, saying: Global risks associated with geopolitical tensions, global fragmentation and pressures on soverign debt levels remain material. Uncertainty around, and risks to, the outlook have increased. Geopolitical risk remains elevated, and as we are an open economy with a large financial sector, these risks are particularly relevant to UK financial stability. The Bank of England also warns this morning that geopolitical tensions also increase the risk of cyber-attacks. In today\u2019s financial stability report, the Bank says it \u201cencourages efforts to build national and international resilience to these threats\u201d. It is concerned that higher geopolitical tensions also create an environment of heightened risk of cyber-attacks, which could coincide with, and amplify, other stresses. The Bank points out that geopolitical risks and cyber-attacks remained the most frequently cited risks to the UK financial system by UK banks. Earlier this week, UK minister Pat McFadden warned a Nato cybersecurity conference that Russia was \u201cexceptionally aggressive and reckless in the cyber realm\u201d and that Moscow \u201cwon\u2019t think twice about targeting British businesses\u201d. Newsflash: Risks to the global economic outlook have increased since last summer, the Bank of England has warned. In its latest Financial Stability Report, just released, the Bank warns that there are \u201cmaterial\u201d global risks associated with geopolitical tensions, global fragmentation \u2013 including reduced co-operation on trade and international policy \u2013 and pressures on government debt levels. The Bank says: Uncertainty around, and risks to, the global economic outlook have increased. As the UK is an economy with a large financial sector and in which trade is significant, these risks are particularly relevant to UK financial stability. The Bank singles out events in the Middle East, Russia\u2019s continued war in Ukraine, and US-China relations as sources of material geopolitical risk. And they cite the risks from disruption to global trade and supply chains. This could hit asset prices, including commodities, and fuel inflationary pressures, \u201cputting upward pressure on interest rates and increasing challenges for households and businesses\u201d. Building society Nationwide has reported that spending is higher this morning than on last year\u2019s Black Friday. By 9am this morning, Nationwide customers had made 1.66 million transactions, it reports. That\u2019s 11% higher than on Black Friday 2023, and 21% higher than a typical Friday [today is, though, pay day for many Brits, which could also be a factor]. Mark Nalder, director of payment strategy at Nationwide Building Society, said: \u201cBlack Friday 2023 was the busiest shopping day on record for Nationwide customers and this year\u2019s Black Friday is shaping up to be even busier. \u201cThe number of purchases made by 9am is already 11 per cent higher than the same period last year. Transactions are 21 per cent higher than a typical Friday as many people use the day to kick start their Christmas shopping. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s important everyone shops safely and uses legitimate websites to ensure their bargain doesn\u2019t result in them losing money to a scam.\u201d House sales are expected to accelerate over the next four months as buyers seek to benefit from tax breaks that are due to run out in April 2025, according to the online property website Zoopla. The number of home sales increased across the UK this year, pushing up prices by 1.5% in the year to October. Next year prices are expected to rise by 2.5% and transactions will jump by 5%, the website said. Inflation across the eurozone has risen back over the European Central Bank\u2019s 2% target. Consumer prices rose by 2.3% in the year to November, according to a flash estimate from statistics body Eurostat, up from 2% in October. Services sector prices drove inflation up; they rose by 3.9% per year in November, while food, alcohol &amp; tobacco prices rose by 2.8% and industrial goods prices were up 0.7%. The deflation in energy eased \u2013 energy prices were down by 1.9% in the year, compared with a 4.6% fall in October. This may not stop the European Central Bank cutting interest rates again next month, to support the struggling eurozone economy. FX market analyst Kyle Chapman of Ballinger Group, says: The uptick on the headline [rate] is purely the result of energy price volatility last year, so that is irrelevant for policy. Underneath, there is a lot for the ECB to like here. Monthly services inflation is highly negative at -0.9%, and that has fed through to a lower yearly print of 3.9% and a downside surprise on core inflation. And with the growth picture looking soft, there is still no doubt that inflation will fall to 2% on a sustainable basis next year. In other property news, there was a jump in the number of housing transactions completed last month. According to HMRC, there were 100,410 UK residential transactions in October 2024, 21% higher than October 2023 and 10% higher than the previous month. Nicky Stevenson, managing director at national estate agent group Fine &amp; Country, says: \u201cOctober saw a significant rise in buyers signing on the dotted line and committing to house moves, signalling strong momentum in the housing market despite some caution following the Autumn Budget. \u201cThis impressive 21% annual increase and 10% month-on-month growth highlights robust consumer confidence, with many eager to push forward with their plans ahead of the typical Christmas slowdown. \u201cWhile the market has seen some price adjustments following the Budget, these changes reflect sellers\u2019 willingness to remain competitive and attract buyers. According to Rightmove, the average asking price for a UK home dipped by 1.4% in November to \u00a3366,592 \u2014 a sharper than usual seasonal decline but a potential opportunity for buyers to secure favourable deals. The \u201cfading drag from higher interest rates\u201d appears to be continuing to support the housing market, lifting mortgage approvals last month, reports Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics: Webb explains: The rise in mortgage approvals for house purchase from 66,115 in September to a two-year high of 68,303 in October (consensus 64,500) likely reflects the fall in mortgage rates in recent months, from 4.9% in July to 4.4% in October. Admittedly, the rebound in swap rates in November may prevent further declines in mortgage rates in the coming months. But our view that Bank Rate will eventually fall from 4.75% now to 3.50% suggests mortgage rates will drop to 3.9% by the end of 2026. That would support a gradual rise in mortgage approvals. We also suspect some housing activity will be brought forward to before nil band thresholds for stamp duty expire at the end of March 2025, as announced in the Budget. Property agent Emma Fildes of Brickweaver reports that UK mortgage approvals in October were boosted by people trying to complete a new home move before Christmas, and avoid paying more stamp duty in 2025: Back in the UK, more people have been applying for mortgages following the cuts to borrowing costs this year. Around 68,300 mortgages for house purchases were approved in October, which is the highest since August 2022 \u2013 the month before the chaotic mini-budget drove up mortgage costs \u2013 when 72,200 were agreed. Demand picked up after UK interest rates were cut in August, and ahead of the second reduction in early November. The Bank of England has also reported that net consumer credit borrowing by individuals slowed slightly, to \u00a31.1bn in October, slightly down from \u00a31.2bn in September. Over in New Delhi, people have been holding a protest calling on Amazon to pay higher wages, and provide better working conditions: Today isn\u2019t all about shopping, as retail analyst Nick Bubb reminds us: Spare a thought for all the hard-working delivery drivers today, coping with all the \u2018Black Friday\u2019 orders, although today is also Buy Nothing Day (a day of protest against consumerism that began in Canada in the 1990\u2019s)... The philosophy behind Buy Nothing Day is that it\u2019s a 24-hour detox from consumerism, and a chance to reflect on the impact that shopping has on the environment \u2013 as it\u2019s more sustainable to reuse and recycle than buy new. The timing of Black Friday this year, near or on payday for many workers, may work out well for retailers. Susannah Streeter head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: \u2018\u2019We\u2019re deep in the golden quarter for retail with Christmas sales crucial for so many stores and Black Friday spending is expected to surpass last year\u2019s levels on both sides of the pond. However, this mega promotional event is a mixed blessing for retailers. It provokes such shopping mania in the quest for a good deal that around three quarters of people will actually put off spending in the run up to the event. During the promotional period it also means selling at a discount, with means a smaller profit margin at a time when they are being squeezed by rising staff costs. It also puts pressure on their distribution chains, which can cause problems for their reputation in they run into difficulties. However, given that this year it\u2019s so close to pay day, it looks likely that consumer spend in the UK will surpass last year\u2019s totals. Consumer confidence may still be in negative territory with worries reverberating about the economy, but optimism about personal finances has increased this month, which may also translate into higher sales There\u2019s another flurry of takeover excitement in the City today. UK engineer TI Fluid Systems has agreed to be taken over in a deal worth more than \u00a31bn. They\u2019ve being bought by ABC Technologies Acquisitions, owned by asset manager Apollo, in a deal worth 200p per share. Shares in TI Fluid are up 2.3%, at 193p. The company makes fluid storage, carrying and delivery systems, and thermal management products and systems, for electric cars, hybrids and also internal combustion engine vehicles. Another loss to the London stock exchange, which has already seen takeover offers for Direct Line (rejected) and for waste management firm Renewi, and the departure of Just Eat (though that\u2019s less of a blow\u2026.) German retailers also need a Black Friday lift, after new data this morning showed a fall in sales last month. German retail sales fell by 1.5% compared with the previous month, much worse than the 0.3% decrease predicted by analysts. Food sales rose by 0.1% on the month, while non-food sales fell by 2.2% in October. Compared to the same month in the previous year, sales were 1% higher. The Booksellers Assocation is urging consumers to support their local bookshops \u2013 and their high streets \u2013 today and through the year. Meryl Halls, managing director of the Booksellers Assocation, explains: \u201cDuring this festive gifting period of immense financial pressure for many, the appeal of money-saving Black Friday deals is understandable, but the Booksellers Assocation is reminding consumers of the value of local bookshops and vibrant high streets. Bookshops are the cultural hearts of our highstreets and essential cornerstones for our communities \u2013 and by shopping in them during the festive period, we support their presence throughout the year, and also take part in a cultural and social movement where communities who invest in their town centres and high streets thrive and flourish. A book bought in your local bookshop enables them to support local festivals, workshops, school visits, parenting groups, libraries, charities and food banks. So we urge everyone this Friday looking to buy a book to do so from a bookshop on their local high street.\u201d It\u2019s still Thursday (just) in California, but some eager shoppers have already been gathering ready for Black Friday to kick off: australia The Black Friday sales have already been in full swing in Australia. The Australian Retailers Association (ARA) expects a record $6.7bn to be spent from Friday to Monday \u2013 5.5% more than in the same period last year \u2013 based on analysis by market researcher Roy Morgan. While major retailers \u2013 and plenty of smaller labels \u2013 have heavily promoted their products for Black Friday, some brands marketed as ethically minded have chosen to entirely avoid taking part in the sales. Financial advisor Quilter is urging shoppers to have a heightened awareness of the scams targeting their money. They warn that Black Friday and Cyber Monday is prime time for fraudsters looking to take advantage of people during this period of high-volume spending and frenzied online activity. Such scams are often not only disguised as the sale of goods, but also appear as opportunities to invest your money, Quilter\u2019s information security culture manager Louise Cockburn warns. She\u2019s drawn up some advice for avoiding scams: A sense of urgency \u2013 This is one of the most common tactics used at this time of year. Fraudsters design offers that appear to be fleeting, pressuring shoppers to act quickly without thoroughly evaluating the legitimacy of the deal. Phrases such as \u2018limited time offer\u2019 or \u2018only a few items left\u2019 can be red flags. Making hasty decisions could prove costly, so you should always stop and take a moment to assess the offer critically before proceeding. Fear and anxiety \u2013 Scammers often incite fear by suggesting that failing to act immediately could result in negative consequences, such as missing out on a deal or facing account issues. Emails from retailers are rife at this time of year, but messages claiming that your account has been compromised and urging you to click a link to verify your information are common scams. You should always verify such claims by directly contacting the retailer or service provider through official channels. Greed and excitement \u2013 Scammers know that the allure of significant discounts can cloud judgement, so you should always question the authenticity of deals that offer products at prices well below market value. It is wise to compare prices across multiple trusted sources to validate the offer, and shop only from secure, official websites. You should always look for a padlock symbol in the address bar and verify that the URL starts with \u201chttps://\u201d. Secure connections protect your personal and financial information from being intercepted by malicious actors. The Filter, the Guardian\u2019s home for product reviews and recommendations, has rounded up some of the best Black Friday deals on offer in the UK. They\u2019ve picked out genuine Black Friday deals \u2013 namely, discounts that undercuts the item\u2019s long-term average price by a notable amount, rather than reversing an October price hike (a tactic popular with less scruplous retailers). The list includes air fryers, food mixers, a handheld steamer, a coffee machine, hand-held weighs, tech kit, and clothes\u2026. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK retailers will be hoping for a surge of Black Friday sales today, after bad weather hit takings in November. This month has been tough for Britain\u2019s retailers, as Storm Bert brought high winds, heavy rain, flooding and transport disruption to parts of the country. According to the Office for National Statistics, footfall on UK high streets fell 5% last week, and was 10% lower than a year ago. That will have hurt shops, who have already been hit by weak consumer confidence in the run-up to the budget in October, and afterwards. Black Friday, the traditional US post-Thanksgiving sales bonanza that has now gone global, should give shoppers an opportunity to bag a bargain. BUT, they should also watch out for scams from fraudsters, and be aware that some offers may not be as generous as they appear\u2026. New data this morning from the British Retail Consortium shows that total footfall at UK stores fell by 4.5% in November, year-on-year. However, that\u2019s partly because Black Friday came earlier last year. Shopping centres were hit hardest, but the number of visitors to high streets and retail parks also fell with the north-east of England, Yorkshire, Wales and Scotland most affected, according to the latest data from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and Sensormatic. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, says: \u201cFootfall took a disappointing tumble in November, as a later-than-usual Black Friday and low consumer confidence meant customers were hesitant to hit the shops. Some northern cities also suffered particularly badly due to Storm Bert, which caused travel disruption towards the end of the month. Retailers remain hopeful that the Black Friday and Christmas sales will help to turn around the declining footfall seen through most of 2024, crucial as we enter the \u201cgolden quarter\u201d. Andy Sumpter, retail consultant EMEA for Sensormatic, says hopes of an early pick-up to spending before Christmas has been dashed: \u201cRetail store visits dipped in November as consumer confidence remains volatile, perhaps not helped by post-Budget spending jitters and shoppers withholding festive purchases, opting instead to shop around for the best prices or hold out for further discounting. This lacklustre footfall performance will have come as a blow for many retailers, who would have been counting on getting early Christmas trading results under their belts before the start of advent. Black Friday has been one of the biggest shopping days in the US for years, leading UK retailers to adopt it. A decade ago, there were big crowds and scuffles as stores opened at midnight to lure shoppers in with cut-price deals. These days, it\u2019s more of a online affair. But Amazon faces the prospect of thousands of its workers protesting or striking from today until Monday, in a push for better workers\u2019 rights and climate action from the US retailer. The Make Amazon Pay campaign, is coordinating action in the US, Germany, the UK, Turkey, Canada, India, Japan, Brazil and other countries.

The tough, heavy and incredibly durable Crater Rim boots wowed our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/oct/10/best-walking-boots-hiking-men-tried-tested\">walking boot</a> tester Paddy Madison, but they\u2019re normally wildly expensive at \u00a3430. This drop to \u00a3258 makes them relatively affordable. Given how many years these boots will last you, this is a genuinely good buy for keen walkers.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Men\u2019s summer hiking shoes</h2>    <p><strong>Keen Arroyo II, from \u00a368.81 (was \u00a3110)<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Keen-NEWPORT-Outdoor-Sandals-Bombay/dp/B008J5FILY/\"><sub>amazon.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>The Keen Arroyo shoes snuck into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/oct/10/best-walking-boots-hiking-men-tried-tested\">best men\u2019s walking boots</a>, despite looking more like sandals, because they offer good sole protection, support and traction on rough terrain. Their description of \u201cwaterproof\u201d made our writer chuckle, though. The shoes still cost \u00a3110 at Keen at the time of writing, but Amazon has treated the black and brown model to a welcome discount of more than \u00a340.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Soft cabin bag</h2>    <p><strong>Eastpak Tranverz cabin-size suitcase, from \u00a3</strong><strong>63.80 (was \u00a3145)<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07DP783VD/\"><sub>amazon.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>\u00a3101.50</strong><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.luggagesuperstore.co.uk/eastpak-tranverz-s-wheeled-duffle-cabin-size-51cm/\"><sub>luggagesuperstore.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>A soft but strong and durable cabin bag is the perfect travel companion, squishing into the carry-on allowance without damaging your stuff or bursting the bag\u2019s stitches.

Well worth buying at its offer price, which is significantly lower than its average price of \u00a3110.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Underwear subscription</h2>    <p><strong>OddBalls monthly subscription, from \u00a38/month (was \u00a314)<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.myoddballs.com/collections/oddballs-subscriptions\"><sub>myoddballs.com</sub></a></p> <p>Subscriptions and undies are two reliably good gift choices.

Joan Didion liked to pack two skirts for any trip, no doubt in black, but you\u2019ll need to settle for lilac if you want the biggest discount.

It\u2019s comfortable, durable and versatile enough to style up or down, so we think this is a good buy \u2013 it\u2019s just a shame that only the navy, and not the red, is available at the time of writing.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Kids\u2019 goalie gloves</h2>    <p><strong>Adidas Predator goalkeeper gloves, </strong><strong>from \u00a39 (was \u00a318)<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.sportsdirect.com/adidas-predator-training-goalkeeper-gloves-juniors-837228\"><sub>sportsdirect.com</sub></a><strong><br></strong></p> <p>These fetching goalie gloves will protect young hands and help keep the opposition out.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re finally approaching the business end of Black Friday, and stores have stumped up some delectable discounts on products we\u2019ve recommended in the Filter. If you followed our advice in our guide to not getting ripped off in the sales, you may have waited until now to splurge on Black Friday deals, and might even be clutching a strict shopping list. Now\u2019s your time to dive in. The big day itself may be on 29 November, but the discounting continues through to Cyber Monday (2 December). Keep an eye on this page throughout the sale, because we\u2019ll update it with any genuine Black Friday bargains on our favourite products of the year, from Ninja air fryers and GHD hair tools to Google Pixels and video doorbells. *** How we selected these Black Friday deals (and excluded others) We\u2019ve looked at more than 300 different products, ranging from \u00a32 fabric plasters to the \u00a31,700 Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, at the Filter. Many are discounted already, but only a select few deals are genuine enough for us to endorse here. A \u201cgenuine\u201d Black Friday deal is a discount that undercuts the item\u2019s long-term average price by a notable amount, rather than undoing a cheeky October price hike. Ideally, it will be the lowest price of the year. We use various tools to find this out, including the brilliant browser extension the Camelizer, a free and non-affiliated tool that reveals the price history of any Amazon item. Our recommendations here have the best discounts of all the products we checked (and we checked enough to make Santa sweat). Some categories, such as heated clothes airers and women\u2019s coats, haven\u2019t seen much Black Friday action yet, possibly because they\u2019re good winter sellers anyway, whereas some of the deals below got off the starting blocks days ago. *** The best home deals *** *** The best robot vacuum cleaner Eufy X10 Pro Omni, \u00a3579 (was \u00a3799.99) very.co.uk amazon.co.uk Eufy\u2019s self-emptying, self-cleaning robot cleaner uses camera and laser technology to sense its way around your floors and suck, scrub and dry with outstanding results. Our writer Stuart Andrews named it \u201cbest overall\u201d in best robot vacuum cleaners, even at \u00a3799. Neither Amazon nor Very dropped the price until the end of Black Friday week, so this is a genuinely good and limited deal. *** Half price Roomba iRobot Roomba Combo J9+, \u00a3599 (was \u00a31,249) irobot.co.uk Roomba is the original robot vacuum and remains one of the best \u2013 but its full price is hair-raising. The Combo J9+\u2019s quiet and efficient operation made it our tester\u2019s favourite \u201cfuss-free\u201d cleaner, but he noted \u201cit\u2019s expensive if you miss it while it\u2019s on sale\u201d. So here\u2019s your chance. Since its launch in June, the J9+ has cost between \u00a31,249 and \u00a31,311 on Amazon, and we don\u2019t expect this less-than-half-price deal to last long. *** Retro air fryer Wonder Oven, \u00a3150 (was \u00a3195) fromourplace.co.uk You think you know what an air fryer looks like, right? Well check out this dreamboat, fresh from our essential gifts for food lovers. It doubles as a countertop steam oven and will look so glorious in your kitchen that you probably won\u2019t want to give it away. It\u2019s full price at Amazon, but discounted by almost a quarter at Our Place. ****** Titanium Always Pan Our Place Titanium Always Pan Pro, \u00a3135 (was \u00a3175) fromourplace.co.uk amazon.co.uk Harrods\u2019 head pastry chef Phil Khoury has only one large pan, he told us for best pans chosen by chefs, and it\u2019s this \u201cvirtually indestructible\u201d Always Pan from premium cookware brand Our Place. Titanium is three times harder than stainless steel and fabulously shiny, and we love the classic silhouette of this pan. With \u00a340 off in a rare discount, this is a fine buy for serious cooks. *** Espresso machine Sage Bambino Plus, \u00a3300 (was \u00a3370) argos.co.uk \u00a3347.99 amazon.co.uk This petite version of a professional espresso machine will be the best-looking thing in your kitchen, hands down. Our best coffee machines writer named it \u201cbest manual machine for beginners\u201d and called it \u201ca dream\u201d to use, although its full price is pretty high. Amazon\u2019s average price for the Sage is \u00a3368 and hasn\u2019t dropped below \u00a3300 since 2020, so Argos\u2019s Black Friday deal is a clear winner. *** Electric toothbrush Oral-B Pro 3 toothbrush, \u00a335 (was \u00a340) argos.co.uk amazon.co.uk In our guide to everyday items that can change your life, our money and consumer editor Hilary Osborne credits her electric toothbrush with revolutionising her dental routine and making her dentist nicer to her. The Oral-B Pro 3 cost as much as \u00a390 on Amazon in 2022 but you can normally buy it for around \u00a340. Today\u2019s drop to \u00a335 matches its lowest ever price. *** Handheld steamer Philips 3000 Series handheld steamer, \u00a327 (was \u00a337.99) johnlewis.com \u00a328 argos.co.uk Another one from our university essential guide, this steamer is useful for pretty much anyone who wears clothes. It smoothes out fabric without the need for ironing and freshens up your clothes if you haven\u2019t the time or the inclination to give them a full wash. *** Food processor Magimix 3200XL food processor, \u00a3241.66 (was \u00a3289.99) nisbets.co.uk \u00a3249 amazon.co.uk When we asked chefs to choose their favourite food processors, mixers and blenders, Feast columnist and Dinner author Meera Sodha told us she\u2019d only ever bought this one. \u201cIt gets the job done (the job being slicing and chopping), and it has never let me down.\u201d Not a huge price drop, but well below its average Amazon price. *** Stand mixer Lakeland digital stand mixer, \u00a3199.99 (was \u00a3249.99) lakeland.co.uk amazon.co.uk The best stand mixers are rarely cheap, so we\u2019re happy to see this sturdy but good-looking and lightweight machine dipping to below \u00a3200 for Black Friday. Our writer Dale Berning Sawa already deemed it \u201cbest value stand mixer\u201d at full price, and with \u00a350 off it\u2019s a buy well worth recommending \u2013 just in time to start making that Christmas pud. *** *** Designer wallpaper Connor wallpaper by Harlequin, \u00a355.30 per roll (was \u00a379) janeclayton.co.uk Fashion designer-turned-ceramicist Henry Holland plundered the archive of British textile house Harlequin to create this offbeat but achingly chic wallpaper, one of our favourite homeware collabs for autumn. A little more affordable now, especially with the price seeming to drop incrementally as Black Friday week continues. *** Luxury linen bedding Secret Linen double duvet cover, fitted sheet and two pillowcases, \u00a3265.60 (was \u00a3330) secretlinenstore.com Our guide to the fair price for 14 everyday items recommends spending \u00a3100-\u00a3200 for a double duvet set, and this one exceeds that even with a 20% discount for Black Friday.

Our fashion team\u2019s guide to the best women\u2019s footwear for autumn praised their toasty warmth, great traction and waterproof membrane, and said they\u2019re light enough to wear all day. Prices are as low as \u00a3138.78 for the lovely moon colour edition. *** Men\u2019s hiking boots Danner Crater Rim, \u00a3258 (was \u00a3430) danner.com It\u2019s not often we see the very best deal offered by a brand\u2019s own store, but Danner is an exception. The tough, heavy and incredibly durable Crater Rim boots wowed our walking boot tester Paddy Madison, but they\u2019re normally wildly expensive at \u00a3430. This drop to \u00a3258 makes them relatively affordable. Given how many years these boots will last you, this is a genuinely good buy for keen walkers. *** Men\u2019s summer hiking shoes Keen Arroyo II, from \u00a368.81 (was \u00a3110) amazon.co.uk The Keen Arroyo shoes snuck into best men\u2019s walking boots, despite looking more like sandals, because they offer good sole protection, support and traction on rough terrain. Their description of \u201cwaterproof\u201d made our writer chuckle, though. The shoes still cost \u00a3110 at Keen at the time of writing, but Amazon has treated the black and brown model to a welcome discount of more than \u00a340. *** Soft cabin bag Eastpak Tranverz cabin-size suitcase, from \u00a363.80 (was \u00a3145) amazon.co.uk \u00a3101.50 luggagesuperstore.co.uk A soft but strong and durable cabin bag is the perfect travel companion, squishing into the carry-on allowance without damaging your stuff or bursting the bag\u2019s stitches. Writer Liz Boulter chose this great-looking Eastpak bag for our roundup of 18 everyday essentials, and she said it\u2019s still going strong after a decade of use. Well worth buying at its offer price, which is significantly lower than its average price of \u00a3110. *** Underwear subscription OddBalls monthly subscription, from \u00a38/month (was \u00a314) myoddballs.com Subscriptions and undies are two reliably good gift choices. Put them together and you get OddBalls, a quirky, high-quality brand that was set up to raise awareness of testicular cancer and is one of our 16 favourite subscriptions. For Black Friday, all subscriptions are 20% off, ranging from \u00a38/month (was \u00a314) for boxer shorts and socks to \u00a3144 a year (was \u00a3180) for bralettes and socks. *** Sports bra Sweaty Betty running bra, \u00a332.50 (was \u00a365) sweatybetty.com Sweaty Betty\u2019s bra was one of our favourite sports bras in our best bras roundup. It has a high neckline and sturdy construction that make it ideal for high-impact sports such as running and boxing. Now half price, this is a great buy that should last you years. *** Satin skirt Ghost Luna satin slip skirt, from \u00a327.60 (was \u00a369) ghost.co.uk Our fashion writers voted this the only skirt you need in our guide to the ultimate capsule wardrobe. Joan Didion liked to pack two skirts for any trip, no doubt in black, but you\u2019ll need to settle for lilac if you want the biggest discount. Most other colours, including black and navy, are \u00a351.75 for Black Friday, but charcoal remains full price. *** Breton T-shirt Sunspel Classic T-shirt, \u00a359 (was \u00a385) sunspel.com Breton-striped T-shirts never go out of style, so this Sunspel classic was a cert for the ultimate capsule wardrobe. Made from ethically sourced Californian cotton, it should last years and is an excellent buy with 30% off. *** Crew neck jumper Rosh Crewneck, \u00a3221.25 (was \u00a3295) and-daughter.com Four out of five colours of this classic lamb\u2019s wool winter warmer from the ultimate capsule wardrobe are reduced to \u00a3221.25 for Black Friday, although if you\u2019re dead set on the navy, it\u2019ll still cost you \u00a3295. Like many fashion stores, &amp;Daughter gives you an additional 10% off your first buy if you sign up for its newsletter. *** Dress Me+Em Travel Tailoring boat neck midi dress, \u00a3175 (was \u00a3250) meandem.com Another timeless classic from the ultimate capsule wardrobe, this tailored flared dress gets a sizeable 25% price cut from Me+Em. It\u2019s comfortable, durable and versatile enough to style up or down, so we think this is a good buy \u2013 it\u2019s just a shame that only the navy, and not the red, is available at the time of writing. *** Kids\u2019 goalie gloves Adidas Predator goalkeeper gloves, from \u00a39 (was \u00a318) sportsdirect.com These fetching goalie gloves will protect young hands and help keep the opposition out. Fresh from our 242 top Christmas gifts, they\u2019re now under \u00a310 on Sports Direct but Amazon is still charging up to \u00a325 for them. Sports Direct one, Amazon nil. \u2022 The article was originally published on 22 November 2024.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s one damned thing after another. As Keir Starmer is discovering, government, like life, can feel like a fusillade of events, each coming faster than the one before. If it\u2019s not a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/29/louise-haigh-resigns-as-transport-secretary\">cabinet minister resigning</a> over a past fraud conviction, it\u2019s MPs voting for assisted dying \u2013 and that\u2019s just in one day. Through that blizzard of news, it can be hard to make out the lasting changes in the landscape \u2013 even those that have profound implications for our place in the world.</p> <p>The November 2024 event that will have the most enduring global impact is the election of Donald Trump. There are some in the higher reaches of the UK government who are surprisingly relaxed about that fact, reassuring themselves that, in effect, we got through it once, we\u2019ll get through it again. Yes, they admit, Trump has nominated some crazy people to lead in areas crucial to the UK-US relationship, such as defence and intelligence, but don\u2019t worry, officials in London will do what they did last time: work with like-minded counterparts in the Washington bureaucracy to bypass the Trump loyalists at the top.</p> <p>Whether that\u2019s complacency or naivety, it\u2019s a mistake. This is not like last time. As Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, put it to me: \u201cTrump is different and the world is different.\u201d During his first term, Trump was hemmed in by the establishment types he had appointed to key jobs. Now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/08/donald-trump-evidence-public-health-crisis-nato\">he will be unbound</a>. Back then, there was no war in Europe, China was relatively cooperative and Britain was still in the EU. That\u2019s all changed now.</p> <p>Consider what Trumpism, if implemented, means for the world. It would dismantle the post-1945 order, underpinned for eight decades by the US. In that period, the US acted as both guarantor for a system of global trade and defensive umbrella for the western alliance, with Britain and Europe the obvious beneficiaries. Playing that role came at a cost for the US, but successive presidents believed it was worth it, because a stable world was one in which the US could prosper.</p> <p>Trump marks a radical break from that thinking. He believes those previous US presidents were suckers, ripped off by allies taking a free ride at US expense. He denies the US has any greater responsibilities than any other country: it should sacrifice nothing, looking out instead solely for itself. He\u2019s happy for the US to be No 1 in the world, but not the world\u2019s leader. The two are different. Like the slogan says: it\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d.</p> <p>For China, Russia, the Gulf states, Brazil and others there is some relief at that: they relish a future without a scolding Washington sticking its nose into their business. But for Europe, including Britain, it\u2019s a disaster. In terms of both defence and the economy, our societies are predicated on a US-led world that will soon no longer exist.</p> <p>The impact will be felt most sharply in Ukraine, which is weeks away from seeing US support fall away. Leonard fears a \u201cYalta-type settlement sealed by Trump and Vladimir Putin over the heads of European countries\u201d, one that will reward Putin\u2019s aggression and leave him emboldened. That leaves more than the likes of Moldova and the Baltic states feeling vulnerable. As the Guardian <a href=\"ttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/29/would-you-survive-72-hours-germany-and-the-nordic-countries-prepare-citizens-for-possible-war\">reported today</a>, \u201cGermany is developing an app to help people locate the nearest bunker in the event of attack. Sweden is distributing a 32-page pamphlet titled If Crisis or War Comes. Half a million Finns have already downloaded an emergency preparedness guide.\u201d Berlin is taking steps to get the German public <em><a href=\"https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/deutschland/pistorius-zeitenwende-ukraine-israel-100.html\">kriegst\u00fcchtig</a></em><a href=\"https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/deutschland/pistorius-zeitenwende-ukraine-israel-100.html\">:</a><em><a href=\"https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/deutschland/pistorius-zeitenwende-ukraine-israel-100.html\"> </a></em><a href=\"https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/deutschland/pistorius-zeitenwende-ukraine-israel-100.html\">war-capable</a>.</p> <p>On the continent, it\u2019s become an urgent question: can Europe defend itself either <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6beab2fe-224a-4c6c-afc6-51a10cdfadf4\">without America</a> or, at best, with <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/publication/defending-europe-with-less-america/\">less America?</a> European defence spending is up and there is talk of shifting the industrial base, repurposing factories, to allow for a fast and massive, Europe-wide programme of rearmament. Our nearest neighbours understand that if the US president no longer believes in the core Nato principle of mutual defence \u2013 one for all and all for one \u2013 then, at the very least, Nato\u2019s US pillar is gone. If Nato is to survive, the EU pillar will have to bear much of the weight alone.</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear that this penny has quite dropped in London. And remember there is a double threat here. Trump also plans to protect US domestic industry by slapping tariffs on imports from the rest of the world. China is likely to be hardest hit, with a 60% charge, but Trump wants a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/12/lighthizer-trump-new-tariff-plan-00189114\">\u201cuniversal\u201d tariff of up to 20%</a> on all goods coming into the US \u2013 including from Britain. For a trading nation such as the UK, that spells calamity.</p> <p>What, then, can be done? On defence, Britain can vow to spend more and increase military cooperation with European allies. Fine, as far as it goes. But in the face of a trade war, Britain alone would be all but impotent against the might of the US. There is only one nearby market that is of comparable heft to the US, whose threats to retaliate against US tariffs would have a deterrent effect, a body, incidentally, that happens to be a virtuoso in the realm of trade and trade disputes. I am speaking of course of the European Union.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, these two spheres, military and economic, are no longer as distinct as they once were. When states confront each other, they no longer do it solely through bombs and bullets. Everything else gets weaponised too, whether it\u2019s the financial system through sanctions, the supply of energy or food or technology. Witness Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. As it happens, these are all areas where the EU\u2019s particular brand of cooperation can help. So when Russia moved to choke off the gas supply to individual European countries, the EU was able to step in and connect what were previously separate energy grids, thereby thwarting that threat. </p> <p>The point is, the landscape of 2016 \u2013 that fateful year \u2013 no longer exists. Plenty of Brexiters believed, in good faith, that a buccaneering, free-trading Britain could thrive in a world of open borders. But that world has gone now, replaced by one of war, barriers and Darwinian competition. Whatever case you could make for Britain being out of the EU in the Obama era of 2016 makes no sense now.</p> <p>I don\u2019t expect Starmer to announce a plan to rejoin the EU tomorrow. But it\u2019s time for outriders to start riding out. Labour MPs, perhaps the odd minister, can begin to make the case that is becoming increasingly obvious to many millions of Britons. The <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-poll-vote-rejoin-eu-brexit-new-referendum-pm-keir-starmer/\">polls are saying it</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/14/bank-of-england-governor-urges-ministers-to-rebuild-relations-with-eu\">governor of the Bank of England</a> is saying it. And when immigration levels are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/28/figures-net-migration-expected-falling-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-latest-updates?page=with:block-674895ba8f08613772566a22#block-674895ba8f08613772566a22\">four times higher</a> now than when we were in the EU, the issue that served as the Brexiters\u2019 trump card lies in shreds. One by one, the premises of Britain\u2019s 2016 decision are crumbling.</p> <p>I understand the political calculus that made Labour believe Brexit was an issue best avoided. But the reality around us is changing and politicians, governments especially, have to adapt to it. In the age of Trump, when the US is no longer the predictable guarantor it once was, Britain cannot thrive alone and in the cold. It\u2019s not ideology or idealism, but hard-headed, practical common sense to say our place is in Europe \u2013 and to say so now.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The BBC licence fee will return to rising in line with the annual rate of inflation again for the first time in three years next year, as the government also said it will review alternate funding models as part of an \u201chonest\u201d conversation about the long-term future of the corporation. The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said that from April next year the cost of an annual BBC licence fee will rise by \u00a35 to \u00a3174.50, in line with the average consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation of 2.96% between October 2023 and September 2024. The increase in the licence fee follows a two-year freeze and a below-inflation increase set by the government for this year that limited the increase to \u00a310.50 as the rate of annual inflation soared. The then culture secretary, Lucy Frazer, reneged on an agreement with the BBC to raise the licence fee by the usual annual average rate of inflation between October 2022 and September 2023, which was running at 9%, for this year\u2019s increase. Instead the government opted to use the lower rate in September 2023 \u2013 6.7% \u2013 citing the cost of living crisis for not raising it by the \u00a315 expected by the corporation. The BBC, which has embarked on significant rounds of cuts in recent years as its finances have beccome stretched, said at the time that the lower rise meant it would have to find a further \u00a3100m in cost savings. \u201cWe welcome confirmation that the licence fee will increase in line with inflation next year,\u201d said a spokesperson for the BBC. \u201cWe want everyone to get value from the licence fee and we are committed to delivering trusted news, the best homegrown storytelling and those special moments that bring us together.\u201d Nandy said that the government will also look at the BBC\u2019s funding model as part of the review of its charter, which is due to be renewed in 2027, and has scrapped the Conservative\u2019s separate funding review and the expert panel set up to inform it. \u201cThrough the charter review we will have an honest national conversation about the broadcaster\u2019s long-term future,\u201d said Nandy, in a written statement to parliament on Friday. \u201cEnsuring the BBC has a sustainable public funding model that supports its vital work but is also fair and responsible to those who pay for it.\u201d The BBC has said that in real terms the corporation\u2019s licence fee funding has fallen by 30% over the past decade. The government also said it is expanding the simple payment plan (SPP), which was set up to help struggling households pay their licence fee in instalments across a year, which it says will make 9,000 unlicensed homes eligible. At present, unlicensed households are only eligible for the plan if they met certain criteria set out in legislation, such as having been visited by TV Licensing or sought advice from a debt advice charity. The government said that the BBC\u2019s own analysis of an expansion in the SPP criteria suggests that it could double the number of households using the scheme to 500,000 by the end of 2027. \u201cIn the short term we are providing the BBC with funding certainty,\u201d Nandy said. \u201c[And] supporting thousands more households facing financial hardship to spread the cost of a TV licence.\u201d The BBC spokesperson added: \u201cWe also look forward to the debate about the future and working with the government to ensure sustainable, long-term public funding\u201d.",

Fragments from downed Russian drones struck buildings in two Kyiv districts and injured one person late on Thursday, officials said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukrainian emergency services, in a post on the Telegram messaging app, showed pictures of rubble strewn about inside and outside a pediatric clinic in Kyiv\u2019s Dniprovskyi district on the east bank of the Dnipro River</strong>. A security guard at the facility was taken to hospital and adjacent buildings suffered damage. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said drone fragments had struck an infrastructure site in the Sviatoshynskyi district on the West Bank of the river. Kyiv regional governor, Ruslan Kravchenko, reported minor damage to a private residence and another building without any casualties.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>At least two regions suffered power cuts on Friday, Ukrainian electricity operator Ukrenergo said.</strong> Local media reported that 70% of customers in Mykolaiv and the surrounding region had been without electricity for a second day as a result of Russian attacks on the energy infrastructure.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Moscow said on Friday it had seized the village of Rozdolne in the southern part of Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region</strong>, where it has made a string of territorial gains in recent months.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia downed 47 attack drones fired overnight by Ukraine, mainly targeting the Rostov border region</strong> where a major fire broke out at an industrial site, authorities said. Ukraine\u2019s military said on Friday it had struck the Atlas oil depot in Russia\u2019s Rostov region overnight, causing a fire. Ukraine also struck a radar station for a Russian Buk air defence system in Ukraine\u2019s southern Zaporizhzhia region, a military statement said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The number of people injured by a Russian strike on Daryiv in the Kherson region has risen to two</strong>, according to local authorities.

Some protesters threw fireworks at police while shouting \u201cRussians\u201d and \u201cslaves\u201d.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraine on Friday accused Georgia of trying to \u201cplease Moscow\u201d. </strong>Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry said: \u201cUkraine is disappointed by the decision of the Georgian government to suspend EU accession negotiations until 2028. This decision, as well as the use of force against a peaceful protest, is evidence of the curtailment of democratic processes in the country to please Moscow.\u201d</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Russian rouble will strengthen when temporary speculative factors and market nervousness are gone, but the economy will need adapt to new US sanctions targeting the banking sector, economy minister, Maxim Reshetnikov, said on Friday. </strong>\u201cIt is evident that adaptation to the new anti-Russian sanctions will be necessary, including changes to banking mechanisms and channels for currency inflows into the Russian market,\u201d Reshetnikov said in a statement</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraine on Friday said Russian authorities returned more than 500 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers killed in combat</strong>, with most having died in the eastern Donetsk region. \u201cAs a result of repatriation activities, the bodies of 502 fallen defenders were returned to territory controlled by the government of Ukraine,\u201d Kyiv\u2019s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said on social media. Russia, for its part, does not announce the return of its bodies.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia on Friday sentenced Alexei Gorinov, the first person to be convicted for speaking out against Moscow\u2019s military offensive in Ukraine, to another three years in prison in a second trial. </strong>The 63-year-old is already serving a seven-year sentence after a conviction in 2022. He wore a paper badge with a peace sign drawn on it as a court in Vladimir handed him the new sentence on charges of \u201cjustifying terrorism\u201d, the Medizazona website reported.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s plan to tap the retired US lieutenant general Keith Kellogg as US envoy to Ukraine and Russia has triggered renewed interest in a policy document he co-authored that proposes ending the war by withdrawing weapons from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> if it doesn\u2019t enter peace talks</strong> <strong>\u2013 and giving even more weapons to Ukraine if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> doesn\u2019t do the same. </strong>Trump is said to have responded favorably to the plan \u2013 <a href=\"https://americafirstpolicy.com/issues/america-first-russia-ukraine\">America First, Russia &amp; Ukraine</a> \u2013 which was presented to him in April and was written by Kellogg and the former CIA analyst Fred Fleitz, who both served as chiefs of staff in Trump\u2019s national security council from 2017 to 2021.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency (BfV) has set up a taskforce to head off any foreign state attempts to influence the upcoming federal election after last month warning of increased Russian-sponsored espionage and sabotage</strong>. It said possible attempts at disinformation, cyber-attack, spying or sabotage could be made ahead of the snap vote set for 23 February after the collapse earlier this month of chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s fractious three-way coalition.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Scholz, assured Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, of Germany\u2019s continued support in a call on Friday in which they agreed to stay in contact</strong>, also with a view on possible paths to a just peace, he said on social platform X.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Swedish police said that an unidentified drone flew over the Russian embassy in Stockholm early on Friday, dropping paint on the grounds of the diplomatic compound. </strong>No arrests have been made and no suspects identified, a police spokesperson added.

Our security \u2013 British, French, European and transatlantic \u2013 will be jeopardised,\u201d Moore said during an address given in <strong>Paris</strong> alongside his <strong>French</strong> counterpart.</p> \n  <p>The spy chief was touted earlier this week as a possible surprise appointment as the <strong>UK</strong>\u2019s ambassador to the US, though he is not thought to be pressing for the job. The former Labour minister <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/08/downing-street-to-appoint-new-us-ambassador-within-days\">Peter Mandelson</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/08/downing-street-to-appoint-new-us-ambassador-within-days\"> is considered the frontrunner</a> for a critical role at a delicate time in transatlantic relations.</p> \n  <p>Moore has served as the head of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mi6\">MI6</a> for four years in what is normally considered a five-year job. At the start of his tenure he overlapped with the Trump adviser <strong>Richard Grenell</strong>, who was the acting director of national intelligence and has now been identified as a possible US envoy tasked with trying to find an end to the war in Ukraine.</p> \n  <p>Trump has complained about the expense of supporting Kyiv and said repeatedly that he wants to end the war, claiming he could do so \u201cwithin 24 hours\u201d. <strong>JD Vance</strong>, the vice-president-elect, has suggested freezing the conflict on the current frontlines, and denying Ukraine <strong>Nato</strong> membership for an extended period.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe cost of supporting Ukraine is well known,\u201d said Moore. \u201cBut the cost of not doing so would be infinitely higher.

Here are the latest developments: Abandoning Ukraine would jeopardise British, European and American security and lead to \u201cinfinitely higher\u201d costs in the long term, the head of MI6 has warned in a speech that amounted to a plea to Donald Trump to continue supporting Kyiv. Richard Moore, giving a rare speech, said he believed Vladimir Putin \u201cwould not stop\u201d at Ukraine if he was allowed to subjugate it in any peace talks involving the incoming US Republican administration. Moore accused Russia of waging a \u201cstaggeringly reckless campaign\u201d of sabotage in Europe while also stepping up its nuclear sabre-rattling to scare other countries off from backing Ukraine. \u201cOur security \u2013 British, French, European and transatlantic- will be jeopardised,\u201d he said during an address given in Paris alongside his French counterpart. Russian defence minister, Andrei Belousov, on Friday hailed \u201cexpanding\u201d ties with North Korea during a visit to the country for talks with its military and political leaders. \u201cFriendly ties between Russia and North Korea are actively expanding in all areas, including military cooperation,\u201d he was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying during the visit. Russia launched more than 100 drones at Ukraine overnight and early on Friday, killing one person and injuring eight others, officials said. A drone attack killed a woman in the southern city of Kherson, the head of the local military administration, Roman Mrochko, said. A drone attack on the southern region of Odesa damaged 13 residential buildings and injured seven people, the national police said in a statement. Fragments from downed Russian drones struck buildings in two Kyiv districts and injured one person late on Thursday, officials said. Ukrainian emergency services, in a post on the Telegram messaging app, showed pictures of rubble strewn about inside and outside a pediatric clinic in Kyiv\u2019s Dniprovskyi district on the east bank of the Dnipro River. A security guard at the facility was taken to hospital and adjacent buildings suffered damage. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said drone fragments had struck an infrastructure site in the Sviatoshynskyi district on the West Bank of the river. Kyiv regional governor, Ruslan Kravchenko, reported minor damage to a private residence and another building without any casualties. At least two regions suffered power cuts on Friday, Ukrainian electricity operator Ukrenergo said. Local media reported that 70% of customers in Mykolaiv and the surrounding region had been without electricity for a second day as a result of Russian attacks on the energy infrastructure. Moscow said on Friday it had seized the village of Rozdolne in the southern part of Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, where it has made a string of territorial gains in recent months. Russia downed 47 attack drones fired overnight by Ukraine, mainly targeting the Rostov border region where a major fire broke out at an industrial site, authorities said. Ukraine\u2019s military said on Friday it had struck the Atlas oil depot in Russia\u2019s Rostov region overnight, causing a fire. Ukraine also struck a radar station for a Russian Buk air defence system in Ukraine\u2019s southern Zaporizhzhia region, a military statement said. The number of people injured by a Russian strike on Daryiv in the Kherson region has risen to two, according to local authorities. Suspilne, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster, reported that one of those injured, a 57-year-old woman, had been hospitalised Ukraine\u2019s army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi visited two key Ukrainian-held sites in the Donetsk region, the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhhove, where he said Ukrainian forces were continuing to repel Russian advances. Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike Kyiv with Oreshnik missiles, an intermediate-range weapon that Moscow used against the city of Dnipro last week and that Putin has claimed cannot be shot down by any air defence system. \u201cWe do not rule out the use of Oreshnik against the military, military-industrial facilities or decision-making centres, including in Kyiv,\u201d Putin said at a press conference in Kazakhstan on Thursday. Police have clashed with protesters in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, after the country\u2019s ruling party said the government would suspend talks on EU accession until 2028. Police fired water cannon and deployed pepper spray and teargas to disperse protesters as masked people tried to smash their way into the parliament. Some protesters threw fireworks at police while shouting \u201cRussians\u201d and \u201cslaves\u201d. Ukraine on Friday accused Georgia of trying to \u201cplease Moscow\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry said: \u201cUkraine is disappointed by the decision of the Georgian government to suspend EU accession negotiations until 2028. This decision, as well as the use of force against a peaceful protest, is evidence of the curtailment of democratic processes in the country to please Moscow.\u201d The Russian rouble will strengthen when temporary speculative factors and market nervousness are gone, but the economy will need adapt to new US sanctions targeting the banking sector, economy minister, Maxim Reshetnikov, said on Friday. \u201cIt is evident that adaptation to the new anti-Russian sanctions will be necessary, including changes to banking mechanisms and channels for currency inflows into the Russian market,\u201d Reshetnikov said in a statement Ukraine on Friday said Russian authorities returned more than 500 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers killed in combat, with most having died in the eastern Donetsk region. \u201cAs a result of repatriation activities, the bodies of 502 fallen defenders were returned to territory controlled by the government of Ukraine,\u201d Kyiv\u2019s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said on social media. Russia, for its part, does not announce the return of its bodies. Russia on Friday sentenced Alexei Gorinov, the first person to be convicted for speaking out against Moscow\u2019s military offensive in Ukraine, to another three years in prison in a second trial. The 63-year-old is already serving a seven-year sentence after a conviction in 2022. He wore a paper badge with a peace sign drawn on it as a court in Vladimir handed him the new sentence on charges of \u201cjustifying terrorism\u201d, the Medizazona website reported. Donald Trump\u2019s plan to tap the retired US lieutenant general Keith Kellogg as US envoy to Ukraine and Russia has triggered renewed interest in a policy document he co-authored that proposes ending the war by withdrawing weapons from Ukraine if it doesn\u2019t enter peace talks \u2013 and giving even more weapons to Ukraine if Russia doesn\u2019t do the same. Trump is said to have responded favorably to the plan \u2013 America First, Russia &amp; Ukraine \u2013 which was presented to him in April and was written by Kellogg and the former CIA analyst Fred Fleitz, who both served as chiefs of staff in Trump\u2019s national security council from 2017 to 2021. Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency (BfV) has set up a taskforce to head off any foreign state attempts to influence the upcoming federal election after last month warning of increased Russian-sponsored espionage and sabotage. It said possible attempts at disinformation, cyber-attack, spying or sabotage could be made ahead of the snap vote set for 23 February after the collapse earlier this month of chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s fractious three-way coalition. Scholz, assured Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, of Germany\u2019s continued support in a call on Friday in which they agreed to stay in contact, also with a view on possible paths to a just peace, he said on social platform X. Swedish police said that an unidentified drone flew over the Russian embassy in Stockholm early on Friday, dropping paint on the grounds of the diplomatic compound. No arrests have been made and no suspects identified, a police spokesperson added. There was a reported case of vandalism at Sweden\u2019s embassy in Moscow on Thursday, and Sweden\u2019s foreign minister Maria Malmer Stenergard has urged Russia to ensure the protection of Sweden\u2019s diplomatic mission and its staff. German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, will travel to China next week, where she will meet her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, to discuss issues including the war in Ukraine, said a ministry spokesperson on Friday. Abandoning Ukraine would jeopardise British, European and American security and lead to \u201cinfinitely higher\u201d costs in the long term, the head of MI6 has warned in a speech that amounted to a plea to Donald Trump to continue supporting Kyiv. Richard Moore, giving a rare speech, said he believed Vladimir Putin \u201cwould not stop\u201d at Ukraine if he was allowed to subjugate it in any peace talks involving the incoming US Republican administration. \u201cIf Putin is allowed to succeed in reducing Ukraine to a vassal state, he will not stop there. Our security \u2013 British, French, European and transatlantic \u2013 will be jeopardised,\u201d Moore said during an address given in Paris alongside his French counterpart. The spy chief was touted earlier this week as a possible surprise appointment as the UK\u2019s ambassador to the US, though he is not thought to be pressing for the job. The former Labour minister Peter Mandelson is considered the frontrunner for a critical role at a delicate time in transatlantic relations. Moore has served as the head of MI6 for four years in what is normally considered a five-year job. At the start of his tenure he overlapped with the Trump adviser Richard Grenell, who was the acting director of national intelligence and has now been identified as a possible US envoy tasked with trying to find an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump has complained about the expense of supporting Kyiv and said repeatedly that he wants to end the war, claiming he could do so \u201cwithin 24 hours\u201d. JD Vance, the vice-president-elect, has suggested freezing the conflict on the current frontlines, and denying Ukraine Nato membership for an extended period. \u201cThe cost of supporting Ukraine is well known,\u201d said Moore. \u201cBut the cost of not doing so would be infinitely higher. If Putin succeeds, China would weigh the implications, North Korea would be emboldened and Iran would become still more dangerous.\u201d A key British argument to the incoming Trump administration is to try to link the war in Ukraine with US concerns about the rising military might of China, emphasising that the arrival of North Korean troops is bringing authoritarianism from Asia into what was previously a European conflict. Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency (BfV) has set up a taskforce to head off any foreign state attempts to influence the upcoming federal election after last month warning of increased Russian-sponsored espionage and sabotage, reports Reuters. It said possible attempts at disinformation, cyber-attack, spying or sabotage could be made ahead of the snap vote set for 23 February after the collapse earlier this month of chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s fractious three-way coalition. \u201cAgainst the backdrop of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, Russia probably has the greatest and most obvious interest in influencing the election in its own favour,\u201d the BfV said in a statement, noting it was also keeping an eye on other actors. Such actors could seek to actively support individual candidates or parties or discredit other candidates and parties or the democratic process itself, seizing on opportunities, the BfV said. Germany is Ukraine\u2019s second biggest financial and military backer. That has resulted in a sharp rise in \u201caggressive behaviour\u201d by the Kremlin towards Germany, as to other Ukraine allies, the head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency said last month. Parcels that exploded at logistics depots in Europe including in Germany, for example, were part of a test run for a Russian plot to trigger explosions on cargo flights to the US, according to western security officials, reports Reuters. Acts of sabotage could, in addition to causing physical damage, also have a psychological impact on voters as well as on political decision makers, the BfV said. According to Reuters, the BfV also warned against disinformation, given that Russia had been \u201coffensively increasing\u201d the distribution of pro-Russian and anti-western narratives, hoping to divide German society and reduce support for Ukraine. Cyber-attacks, in particular hack-and-leak operations, were a further danger, as well as the use of artificial intelligence to produce deepfake videos to dupe voters, it said. Support for Russia-friendly parties \u2013 notably the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Aliance \u2013 has been on the rise in recent months, with both parties faring well in elections in eastern Germany in September. In April, a senior member of the AfD was accused of receiving money from a pro-Russian media site, allegations he denied. Here is a video of the head of the UK\u2019s foreign intelligence service saying, on Friday, that Russia was conducting a \u201cstaggeringly reckless\u201d sabotage campaign against Ukraine\u2019s western allies, and intelligence services were working to stop the consequences from spiralling out of control: Richard Moore spoke alongside Nicolas Lerner, the head of France\u2019s external intelligence agency, the DGSE, at an event marking 120 years of the Entente Cordiale, a pact between the UK and France that binds the countries together as military and diplomatic allies. Police have clashed with protesters in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, after the country\u2019s ruling party said the government would suspend talks on EU accession until 2028. The interior ministry on Friday reported the arrest of 43 protesters, with three police officers injured, two of whom were taken to hospital. Police fired water cannon and deployed pepper spray and teargas to disperse protesters as masked people tried to smash their way into the parliament. Some protesters threw fireworks at police while shouting \u201cRussians\u201d and \u201cslaves\u201d. Thousands of pro-EU protesters had blocked streets in the capital before the altercations began. The country\u2019s outgoing pro-EU figurehead president, Salome Zourabichvili, accused the government of declaring \u201cwar\u201d on its own people and confronted riot police, asking whether they served Georgia or Russia. \u201cToday marks a significant point, or rather, the conclusion of the constitutional coup that has been unfolding for several weeks,\u201d she told a news conference alongside opposition leaders. \u201cToday, this nonexistent and illegitimate government declared war on its own people,\u201d she added, calling herself the Georgia\u2019s \u201csole legitimate representative\u201d. The government announcement came hours after the European parliament adopted a non-binding resolution rejecting the results of Georgia\u2019s 26 October parliamentary elections, alleging \u201csignificant irregularities\u201d. The resolution called for new elections within a year under international supervision and for sanctions to be imposed on top Georgian officials from the ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party, including the prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze. Ukraine on Friday accused Georgia of trying to \u201cplease Moscow\u201d after prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, said his country would suspend EU accession talks, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry said: Ukraine is disappointed by the decision of the Georgian government to suspend EU accession negotiations until 2028. This decision, as well as the use of force against a peaceful protest, is evidence of the curtailment of democratic processes in the country to please Moscow.\u201d Ukraine on Friday said Russian authorities returned more than 500 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers killed in combat, with most having died in the eastern Donetsk region. Russia and Ukraine have been exchanging bodies and prisoners of war since the first months of the conflict \u2013 with casualties estimated to be high on both sides. \u201cAs a result of repatriation activities, the bodies of 502 fallen defenders were returned to territory controlled by the government of Ukraine,\u201d Kyiv\u2019s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said on social media, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The centre said that 397 of the bodies were returned from the Donetsk region, where fighting is most intense. It said 24 were returned from the eastern Luhansk region and 64 from the southern Zaporizhzhia area, while 17 were handed back from morgues on Russian territory. \u201cWe are grateful for the assistance of the International Committee of the Red Cross,\u201d Kyiv\u2019s centre said. It said the bodies will be taken for forensic medical examination and that \u201ctogether with the expert institutions, the deceased will be identified as soon as possible.\u201d Russia, for its part, does not announce the return of its bodies. Ukraine\u2019s army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has visited two key Ukrainian-held sites in the Donetsk region, the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhhove, where he said Ukrainian forces were continuing to repel Russian advances. Reuters quotes him saying, via the Telegram messaging app, that: Based on the results of the work, all necessary decisions have been made to strengthen the units with reserves, additional ammunition, weapons, and military equipment. We continue to restrain the enemy and inflict heavy losses in terms of their manpower and equipment. Reuters, citing Swedish police, reports that an unidentified drone flew over the Russian embassy in Stockholm early on Friday, dropping paint on the grounds of the diplomatic compound. No arrests have been made and no suspects identified, a police spokesperson added. There was a reported case of vandalism at Sweden\u2019s embassy in Moscow on Thursday, and Sweden\u2019s foreign minister Maria Malmer Stenergard has urged Russia to ensure the protection of Sweden\u2019s diplomatic mission and its staff. The number of people wounded by a Russian strike on Daryiv in the Kherson region has risen to two, according to local authorities. Local media reports that 70% of customers in Mykolaiv and the surrounding region have been without electricity for a second day as a result of Russian attacks on the energy infrastructure. Here are some of the latest images sent over the news wires from Ukraine, Russian-occupied Ukraine, and Russia. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that a 57-year-old woman has been hospitalised after a Russian strike on Daryiv in the Kherson region, which is close to the Dnipro River. Russia holds control of the southern portion of Kherson region, on the river\u2019s left bank. German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, assured Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, of Germany\u2019s continued support in a call on Friday in which they agreed to stay in contact, also with a view on possible paths to a just peace, he said on social platform X. \u201cWe will continue our military support for Ukraine in close coordination with our European and international partners. I agreed with Zelenskiy that we will remain in contact \u2013 also with a perspective to possible paths to a just peace,\u201d he wrote. Russia is waging a \u201cstaggeringly reckless campaign\u201d of sabotage in Europe while also stepping up its nuclear sabre-rattling to scare other countries off from backing Ukraine, the head of the UK\u2019s Secret Intelligence Service known as MI6, said on Friday. Richard Moore said in a speech in Paris on Friday that were Vladimir Putin to succeed in reducing Ukraine to a vassal state, he would not stop there, reports Reuters. \u201cOur security \u2013 British, French, European and transatlantic- will be jeopardised,\u201d he said, adding: We have recently uncovered a staggeringly reckless campaign of Russian sabotage in Europe, even as Putin and his acolytes resort to nuclear sabre-rattling to sow fear about the consequences of aiding Ukraine.\u201d He said the cost of supporting Ukraine was well known, but added: The cost of not doing so would be infinitely higher. If Putin succeeds China would weigh the implications, North Korea would be emboldened and Iran would become still more dangerous.\u201d Reuters repots that Moore\u2019s speech seemed aimed at rallying wavering European allies and any sceptics in the incoming US administration of Donald Trump about the importance of Ukraine. He joins other western intelligence officials in warning about increasing Russian sabotage actions. Nato and western intelligence services have said that Russia is behind a growing number of hostile activities across the Euro-Atlantic area, ranging from repeated cyber-attacks to Moscow-linked arson \u2013 all of which Russia denies. The UK\u2019s domestic spy chief said last month that Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence service was seeking to cause \u201cmayhem\u201d across the UK and Europe. And sources familiar with US intelligence told Reuters this week that Russia was likely to expand its campaign of sabotage against European targets to increase pressure on the west over its support for Kyiv. Moore added that cooperation between the UK and the US had made its societies safer, and that that would continue. \u201cI worked successfully with the first Trump administration to advance our shared security and look forward to doing so again,\u201d he said. Russia launched more than 100 drones at Ukraine overnight and early on Friday, killing one person and injuring eight others, officials said. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that Friday\u2019s drone barrage came a day after Russia launched about 90 missiles on Ukraine, cutting power to over a million people. A drone attack killed a woman in the southern city of Kherson, the head of the local military administration, Roman Mrochko, said. Meanwhile, at least two regions suffered power cuts on Friday, Ukrainian electricity operator Ukrenergo said. \u201cEmergency repair works are ongoing around the clock. By the end of the day, the power company plans to restore power to the de-energised customers in Kherson and Mykolaiv regions,\u201d it said, according to AFP. Moscow said on Friday it had seized the village of Rozdolne in the southern part of Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, where it has made a string of territorial gains in recent months. Russia downed 47 attack drones fired overnight by Ukraine, mainly targeting the Rostov border region where a major fire broke out at an industrial site, authorities said. German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, will travel to China next week, where she will meet her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, to discuss issues including the war in Ukraine, said a ministry spokesperson on Friday, according to Reuters. Further political talks are also planned, said the spokesperson, adding that Baerbock will also meet German business representatives in the country. Russia on Friday sentenced Alexei Gorinov, the first person to be convicted for speaking out against Moscow\u2019s military offensive in Ukraine, to another three years in prison in a second trial, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The 63-year-old is already serving a seven-year sentence after a conviction in 2022. He wore a paper badge with a peace sign drawn on it as a court in Vladimir handed him the new sentence on charges of \u201cjustifying terrorism\u201d, the Medizazona website reported. Donald Trump\u2019s plan to tap the retired US lieutenant general Keith Kellogg as US envoy to Ukraine and Russia has triggered renewed interest in a policy document he co-authored that proposes ending the war by withdrawing weapons from Ukraine if it doesn\u2019t enter peace talks \u2013 and giving even more weapons to Ukraine if Russia doesn\u2019t do the same. Trump is said to have responded favorably to the plan \u2013 America First, Russia &amp; Ukraine \u2013 which was presented to him in April and was written by Kellogg and the former CIA analyst Fred Fleitz, who both served as chiefs of staff in Trump\u2019s national security council from 2017 to 2021. The document proposes halting further US weapons deliveries to Kyiv if it does not enter peace talks with Moscow, while simultaneously warning Moscow that, should it refuse to negotiate, US support for Ukraine would increase. It blames \u201cunserious and incoherent\u201d US foreign policy under Joe Biden for the three-year conflict, including what it describes as a \u201cprecipitous\u201d US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the supposed antagonization of US allies including Israel and Saudi Arabia, and a policy to China described as \u201cweak and confusing\u201d. The paper further accuses the Biden administration of putting \u201cthe idealistic agendas of the global elite ahead of a working relationship with Russia\u201d \u2013 a \u201chostile policy\u201d that it claims \u201cmade it an enemy of the US, drove Russia into the arms of China and led to the development of a new Russia-China-Iran-North Korea axis\u201d. Kellogg and Fleitz criticize what they said was a decision to scold Vladimir Putin and threaten \u201cunprecedented\u201d sanctions as it prepared to invade Ukraine, \u201cinstead of using negotiations to de-escalate tensions\u201d. \u201cAn America First approach could have prevented the invasion,\u201d they write. Russia said on Friday it had seized the village of Rozdolne in the southern part of Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, where it has made a string of advances in recent months, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Russian army units \u201cliberated the village\u201d, the defence ministry said in a daily briefing. Here is a video of Vladimir Putin threatening to strike Kyiv with Oreshnik missiles, which we reported on earlier (see 9.02am GMT). The Russian rouble will strengthen when temporary speculative factors and market nervousness are gone, but the economy will need adapt to new US sanctions targeting the banking sector, economy minister, Maxim Reshetnikov, said on Friday. \u201cIt is evident that adaptation to the new anti-Russian sanctions will be necessary, including changes to banking mechanisms and channels for currency inflows into the Russian market,\u201d Reshetnikov said in a statement, reports Reuters. Russia\u2019s rouble plunged recently to its lowest rate against the dollar since the early weeks of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the wake of new western sanctions and growing geopolitical tensions. The rouble on Wednesday hit 110 against the dollar for the first time since 16 March 2022. Before launching its war on Ukraine in February 2022, the Russian currency traded at around 75-80 against the US dollar. The latest drop came just days after the US introduced sanctions against Gazprombank, Russia\u2019s third-largest bank, which played a key role in processing payments for the remaining Russian natural gas exports to Europe. Ukraine\u2019s military said on Friday it had struck the Atlas oil depot in Russia\u2019s Rostov region overnight, causing a fire. \u201cAtlas is part of the Russian military-industrial complex that supplies petroleum products to the Russian army,\u201d said a military statement on the Telegram messaging app, according to Reuters. Ukraine also struck a radar station for a Russian Buk air defence system in Ukraine\u2019s southern Zaporizhzhia region, the statement said. Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike Kyiv with Oreshnik missiles, an intermediate-range weapon that Moscow used against the city of Dnipro last week and that Putin has claimed cannot be shot down by any air defence system. \u201cWe do not rule out the use of Oreshnik against the military, military-industrial facilities or decision-making centres, including in Kyiv,\u201d Putin said at a press conference in Kazakhstan on Thursday. He said the weapon was \u201ccomparable in strength to a nuclear strike\u201d if used several times on one location, though he added that it was not currently fitted with nuclear warheads. \u201cThe kinetic impact is powerful, like a meteorite falling,\u201d Putin said. \u201cWe know in history what meteorites have fallen where, and what the consequences were. Sometimes it was enough for whole lakes to form.\u201d The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accused Russia of a \u201cdespicable escalation\u201d. Moscow has said the new threats are a response to a decision earlier this month by the US, Britain and France to allow Ukraine to fire long-range missiles provided by them against military targets inside Russia, something Kyiv had long requested. Kyiv is better protected than most other Ukrainian cities by air defence batteries, and there have been few successful strikes on the centre of the capital during almost three years of war. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president described Putin\u2019s claim that air defence systems could not take out Oreshnik missiles as \u201cfiction, of course\u201d. \u201cPutin doesn\u2019t understand military stuff. He\u2019s a guy that people come and show him some cartoon about how the missile will fly, how nobody will be able to shoot it down. He said the same thing many times about their Kinzhal missile. And then when it turned out that Patriot [air defence systems], even the not-the-latest-generation systems, can comfortably shoot it down, he stopped talking about it,\u201d Podolyak said. Podolyak also said there was \u201cno such thing\u201d as Oreshnik and that the missile was simply a lightly modified version of existing Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles. \u201cThe man has just come up with a name, just an abstract name,\u201d he said. Nonetheless, the threats have caused alarm in Kyiv, causing a sitting of parliament scheduled for last Friday to be cancelled. Russian drone attacks on Ukraine injured at least eight people and damaged residential buildings in the capital Kyiv and in the southern Odesa region overnight, officials said on Friday, reports Reuters. Ukraine\u2019s air force said in a statement that, of 132 drones launched against the country overnight, it had downed 88 drones, while 41 were \u201clost\u201d, likely due to electronic warfare, and one returned to the Russian territory. Russia has stepped up its nightly drone attacks on Ukrainian cities as it continues to push along the eastern frontline, making some of its largest monthly territorial gains since 2022. It launched a record-high number of 188 drones against the country on Tuesday before staging a large-scale attack on Ukraine\u2019s power grid on Thursday. The drone attack on the southern region of Odesa damaged 13 residential buildings and injured seven people, the national police said in a statement. Fragments from downed Russian drones struck buildings in two Kyiv districts and injured one person late on Thursday, officials said. Emergency services, in a post on the Telegram messaging app, showed pictures of rubble strewn about inside and outside a pediatric clinic in Kyiv\u2019s Dniprovskyi district on the east bank of the Dnipro River. A security guard at the facility was taken to hospital and adjacent buildings suffered damage, reports Reuters. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said drone fragments had struck an infrastructure site in the Sviatoshynskyi district on the West Bank of the river. Kyiv regional governor, Ruslan Kravchenko, reported minor damage to a private residence and another building without any casualties. Russian defence minister, Andrei Belousov, arrived in North Korea on Friday for talks with North Korean military and political leaders as the countries deepen their alignment over Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. According to the Associated Press, the defence ministry in announcing the visit did not specify who Belousov would be meeting or the purpose of the talks. North Korean state media did not immediately confirm the visit either. Photos released by Russia\u2019s defence ministry showed Belousov walking alongside North Korean defense minister, No Kwang Chol, on a red carpet laid out at a Pyongyang airport. According to the AP, North Korean military officials were seen clapping under a banner that read: Complete support and solidarity with the fighting Russian army and people.\u201d Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that Belousov on Friday hailed \u201cexpanding\u201d ties with North Korea. \u201cFriendly ties between Russia and North Korea are actively expanding in all areas, including military cooperation,\u201d he was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying during a visit to the country. The visit came days after South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, met with a Ukrainian delegation led by defense minister, Rustem Umerov, in the South Korean capital of Seoul and called for the two countries to formulate countermeasures in response to North Korea\u2019s dispatch of troops to Russia in support of its fight against Ukraine. North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in recent months has prioritised relations with Russia as he tries to break out of isolation and strengthen his international footing, embracing the idea of a \u201cnew cold war\u201d, reports the AP. The US and its allies have said North Korea has sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia in recent weeks and that some of those troops were engaging in combat. On Thursday, Joe Biden said Russia\u2019s latest attack on Ukraine shows the \u201curgency\u201d of backing Kyiv, touting strong support ahead of Donald Trump taking office in January. \u201cThis attack is outrageous and serves as yet another reminder of the urgency and importance of supporting the Ukrainian people in their defence against Russian aggression,\u201d Biden said in a statement. Earlier on Thursday, Russia pummelled Ukraine\u2019s energy grid with almost 200 missiles and drones, leaving a million people without power. \u201cOn this day, my message to the Ukrainian people is clear: the United States stands with you,\u201d added Biden. In other developments: Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike Kyiv with Oreshnik missiles, an intermediate-range weapon that Moscow used against the city of Dnipro last week and that Putin has claimed cannot be shot down by any air defence system. It came after Moscow pummelled Ukraine\u2019s energy grid in an attack that left a million people without power. Russia fired more than 90 missiles and about 100 drones during the barrage, according to Kyiv, with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy urging his allies to respond firmly to what he dubbed Russian \u201cblackmail\u201d. Putin said the fresh bombardment was a \u201cresponse\u201d to Ukrainian strikes on his territory with western missiles. Russian drone attacks on Ukraine injured at least eight people and damaged residential buildings in the capital Kyiv and in the southern Odesa region overnight, officials said on Friday. Ukraine\u2019s air force said in a statement that, of 132 drones launched against the country overnight, it had downed 88 drones, while 41 were \u201clost\u201d, likely due to electronic warfare, and one returned to the Russian territory. Georgian riot police deployed teargas and water cannon against demonstrators protesting a government decision to delay asking for EU accession, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reporters witnessed. Thousands rallied in the capital Tbilisi and cities across Georgia after prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, announced the decision amid a post-election crisis that saw the country\u2019s president challenge the legitimacy of the newly elected parliament and government. Donald Trump\u2019s plan to tap the retired US Lt Gen Keith Kellogg as US envoy to Ukraine and Russia has triggered renewed interest in a policy document he co-authored. It proposes ending the war by withdrawing weapons from Ukraine if it does not enter peace talks \u2013 and giving even more weapons to Ukraine if Russia does not do the same.",

We are rummaging through US history to find precedents for why Trump won and how to confront the damage he may cause.</p> <p><em><strong>What can America\u2019s queer history tell us about confronting the challenges?</strong></em></p> <p>The LGBTQ+ community has been here before.</p> <p>The late 1970s was a somber, frightening time in queer history. The rise of a Christian right \u2013 branding themselves the \u201cmoral majority\u201d \u2013 in conjunction with an energized Republican party began a culture war against women, people of color and queer people. The combination of religious rhetoric, nationalism and economic conservatism \u2013 Reaganomics, in other words \u2013 created a groundswell of contemporary far-right politicking that became the template for our contemporary political world.</p> <p>The immediate effects on queer people was tremendous. The modest gains the gay rights movement \u2013 emerging in 1969 \u2013 had attained were subject to a vicious backlash. Sound familiar? In 1977, Anita Bryant, a devout Christian, popular vocalist and spokesperson for the Florida Citrus Commission, in reaction to a Miami-Dade county gay anti-discrimination ordinance, organized Save Our Children, a national campaign claiming that gay and lesbian teachers were \u201crecruiting\u201d children to homosexuality. The next year conservative California state legislator John Briggs introduced Proposition 6, which would ban all gay and lesbian teachers from the state schools. Children are again the centerpiece of anti-gay and anti-trans hysteria. During this time, recently passed anti-discrimination laws that protected LGBTQ+ people\u2019s jobs, housing and insurance came under attack, and many were repealed. In November of that same year openly gay San Francisco board of supervisors member Harvey Milk, along with the liberal mayor, was assassinated by a fellow supervisor and former San Francisco cop.</p> <p>In 1981, the peak of this backlash, the first cases of HIV/Aids were reported. Not only were gay men becoming ill and dying, but they were stigmatized, ostracized, and discriminated against in employment, housing, insurance and medial care. As the death toll mounted, the Reagan administration refused to even acknowledge the crisis and Congress cut funding for medical research and safe-sex education. Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan announced that homosexuals \u201chave declared war upon nature, and now nature is exacting an awful retribution\u201d.</p> <p>Preeminent conservative leader William F Buckley penned a New York Times<em> </em>op-ed demanding that homosexual men with HIV be tattooed on the buttocks as a warning to others. A 1985 Los Angeles Times national poll showed that 50% of Americans were in favor of quarantining people infected with HIV. Gay men were banned for life as blood donors. Congress passed legislation forbidding any one who was HIV positive from entering the country. By 1990 over 100,000 people in the US had died of Aids, a large percentage being gay men.</p> <p>As dark as the coming Trump years may feel to queer people today, it is important to remember the resistance, organizing and political cunning that sustained the community and made substantial progress on numerous issues. National LGBTQ+ groups such as the Gay and Lesbian Task Force and Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund were lobbying and taking very necessary legal action on legislative and judicial fronts. The deeper and more effective organizing, however, was taking place at community meetings and on the streets. Their tactics were diverse, but all depended on their being publicly queer and outspoken.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em><strong>Working behind the scenes is necessary, but real change happens when activists are front and center</strong></em></p> </blockquote> <p>National and local campaigns were organized \u2013 along with many progressive groups \u2013 against Bryant\u2019s Save Our Children efforts.

Peter Young, 47, who now lives in Boulder, Colorado, went on the run after being indicted in 1998 over a string of fur farm raids across three states the previous year. He was jailed in the US for two years in 2005 after spending years hiding from the FBI in the UK. He said the agency had since twice sought information from him about Daniel Andreas San Diego, 46, who has been on the FBI\u2019s \u201cmost wanted terrorists\u201d list for almost two decades for his alleged involvement in two office building bombings in San Francisco in 2003. San Diego was arrested in Maenan, between Conwy and Betws-y-Coed, on Monday, with officers from the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency and North Wales police acting on a request from the FBI. The agency said he was an \u201canimal rights extremist\u201d, who is alleged to have been involved in two explosions on the campus of a San Francisco biotechnology firm in August 2003, and a bombing at a nutritional products company in the same city a month later. The FBI said it considered him \u201carmed and dangerous\u201d and had offered a reward of up to $250,000 (\u00a3200,000) for information leading directly to his arrest.

Young said: \u201cThey wheeled out this pallet of stuff, and they did an inventory, and this whole thing was very businesslike and at the end, they said: \u2018We want talk to you about Daniel Andreas San Diego, we want to know if you know where he is, and we basically want to make a deal with you.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd at that point, I just ended the conversation,\u201d he said. Young said he \u201cdidn\u2019t stick around to find out\u201d what the FBI would offer him in return, adding: \u201cI could only speculate they wanted to pay me money. \u201cI think the theory of the FBI is that there\u2019s this underground railroad for activists, fugitives, and that is really not the case. It really just comes down to who you know, in terms of your supporters, [but] there is no underground network.\u201d Young said he thought it was unlikely that San Diego was assisted by any global network of likeminded activists. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate,\u201d he said. \u201cI can only say that if that network existed, I would have found it. And so I can confidently say that network does not exist.\u201d While he did call on help from activist friends while on the run, he said it\u2019s \u201cno different than if you fall on financial hard times. Who do you call? You call the people you know. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a laughable idea to think of an underground network, because there\u2019s only been, it\u2019s really just me and him in terms of actual fugitives, so if there was an established network, who is it for?\u201d Young said he knew nothing \u2013 other than what he had read in the press \u2013 of San Diego\u2019s life on the run. He did not know whether San Diego also had relationships, why he moved to Wales, who may have helped him evade capture, when he took on a new identity under the name of Danny Webb, or how he managed to make enough money to purchase the \u00a3425,000 house where he had been detained. \u201cI did not live like it appeared Daniel Andreas San Diego was living at the time of his arrest,\u201d he said. \u201cI never had a stable home for those entire seven years, I never had stable income. I subsisted largely off shoplifting if I was going to be honest, and it was always precarious. I never was financially stable, I was always on the move. \u201cI\u2019m going to be following the case closely, I have been following his case since the beginning. I don\u2019t want to speculate, but I feel very badly for his situation, and I\u2019m hoping for a good outcome.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A landfill site in Staffordshire which has plagued residents with noxious fumes for years has been told to permanently shut down, with local campaigners hailing the news as \u201cabsolutely amazing\u201d. The Environment Agency said it had brought the closure of Walleys Quarry forward after \u201cexhausting other enforcement options\u201d, and said it had to stop accepting new waste from Friday. It said Walleys Quarry Ltd, which runs the site, had been \u201cgiven time to put effective measures in place to manage emissions and yet failed to do so\u201d. The landfill site is in the village of Silverdale, just west of Newcastle-under-Lyme, with the emissions affecting residents in many of the surrounding towns and villages. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fantastic. It\u2019s so long overdue. It\u2019s a huge relief, just elation,\u201d said the local resident and campaigner Helen Vincent. \u201cWe honestly didn\u2019t see this coming. Everyone thought it would play out until the end of its permit. But it\u2019s absolutely amazing, it\u2019s the only topic of conversation right now. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to solve the problem with the gases straight away, we know that. But it\u2019s a huge win and hopefully they will do as they\u2019re supposed to, and cap everything off.\u201d People living in the area around the quarry have complained of itchy eyes, sore throats and headaches from the fumes, while some said it had worsened their health conditions such as asthma. In 2021, a local family brought a landmark legal case against the Environment Agency (EA), arguing it was failing to protect the life of five-year-old Mathew Richards. They said his respiratory health problems were being worsened by hydrogen sulphide fumes from the landfill, and his life expectancy was being reduced. The high court ruled in the family\u2019s favour and ordered the EA to take action, but the court of appeal quashed the ruling. Mathew\u2019s mother, Rebecca Currie, told the BBC after the closure notice that she \u201cnever thought this day was going to come\u201d. \u201cThis is amazing for our community, but obviously there are still a lot of sick people in this community and this should never have gone on this long,\u201d she said. Adam Jogee, the MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, said: \u201cSo many people have campaigned for so long in the rain, in the sleet, in the snow. \u201cI think there\u2019s a massive sense of relief, there\u2019s a massive sense of happiness and celebration. Once we\u2019ve had the opportunity to celebrate, we can get to work to finally get the answers we need to how on earth we ended up in this mess for so long.\u201d The EA notice will start the process of permanently closing the landfill, and Walleys Quarry will be required to permanently cap the remainder of the site and install further landfill gas management infrastructure. Lorries will only be allowed to enter the site to bring in materials for those purposes. Vincent said: \u201cWe know they\u2019re probably going to appeal but I can\u2019t see they\u2019ve got a leg to stand on.\u201d She added that in recent months the fumes had been \u201cworse than ever\u201d. \u201cJust the other day my house was full of fumes all day, it was absolutely horrendous. And I work from home so I can\u2019t get away from it. It has been really bad, especially with the cold weather,\u201d she said. Simon Tagg, the leader of Newcastle-under-Lyme borough council, said complaints to the council about the foul gas odours \u201chave soared this year\u201d and were already more than double the total for the whole of 2023. \u201cI hope this action by the EA is the first step to a permanent solution for our residents,\u201d he said. \u201cI would encourage residents to carry on reporting the foul smells every time they happen to both the council and the EA.\u201d",

He knows that we are going to find a solution and \u2026 if that doesn\u2019t happen, the club will have to take the solution and the decision they have to take.\u201d Guardiola said he took responsibility \u201cabsolutely all on my shoulders\u201d and that he and his players needed to ensure there was \u201cno complaining, no blaming, no pointing\u201d. Guardiola is without Rodri because of a serious knee injury expected to sideline the midfielder until next season, while the frontline centre-backs Nathan Ak\u00e9, John Stones, R\u00faben Dias and Manuel Akanji have also at times been unavailable. Guardiola refused to use these absences as mitigation. \u201cIn a decade we don\u2019t find it [anywhere],\u201d he said of City\u2019s run of success, before reflecting on the slump. \u201cIt\u2019s not nice to live, but what do you expect? That everything is easy? It\u2019s easy when everyone is fit and in their prime and everyone is 26, 27, 28. Now, no. I have to put myself [forward] now. It\u2019s not an excuse that Rodri is not there. Cry all the time? That the four central defenders have not been there. I have to find a solution and I\u2019m trying every day.\u201d",

But the chances of even an outline agreement before Trump returns to power seems remote.</p> <p>Iran is under pressure regionally after setbacks for the forces it has supported in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza.</p> <p>Kazem Gharibabadi, an Iranian deputy foreign minister, said there would be more talks in the near future without going into further details. His tone was markedly more restrained than before the talks, when he said the EU \u201cshould abandon its self-centred and irresponsible behaviour\u201d on a range of issues including the war in Ukraine and the Iranian nuclear issue.</p> <p>Europeans have become increasingly frustrated with Iran\u2019s approach, including its provision of arms for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and its lack of cooperation with the UN nuclear inspectorate, the International Atomic Energy Agency. Some Europeans fear that Iran\u2019s growing stockpile of highly enriched uranium reveals it is on a covert path to building a nuclear bomb.</p> <p>Iran believes Europe rebuffed a clear signal of willingness to negotiate when Tehran offered to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/20/iran-has-offered-to-keep-uranium-below-purity-levels-for-a-bomb-iaea-confirms\">cap its uranium enrichment programme</a> at 60% and to allow experienced IAEA nuclear inspectors back into the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/28/iran-says-it-could-end-ban-on-possessing-nuclear-weapons-if-sanctions-reimposed\">Iran says it could end ban on possessing nuclear weapons if sanctions reimposed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The aim of the Geneva meeting was to see if there was a basis for the Iranian offer to be developed, as well as to seek limits to Iranian-Russian military cooperation.

      "bodyText": "Iran and the so-called E3 grouping of the UK, France and Germany have agreed to continue holding talks in the near future in an attempt to find a way out of an impasse over Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme, in what may be the last chance of a breakthrough before Donald Trump takes up the US presidency again. Trump, who pursued a policy of \u201cmaximum economic pressure\u201d against Iran during his first term, returns to the White House on 20 January. The decision to hold a further round of talks following a meeting in Geneva on Friday suggests the two sides believe there is still diplomatic space for an agreement whereby Iran would be more transparent about its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. But the chances of even an outline agreement before Trump returns to power seems remote. Iran is under pressure regionally after setbacks for the forces it has supported in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza. Kazem Gharibabadi, an Iranian deputy foreign minister, said there would be more talks in the near future without going into further details. His tone was markedly more restrained than before the talks, when he said the EU \u201cshould abandon its self-centred and irresponsible behaviour\u201d on a range of issues including the war in Ukraine and the Iranian nuclear issue. Europeans have become increasingly frustrated with Iran\u2019s approach, including its provision of arms for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and its lack of cooperation with the UN nuclear inspectorate, the International Atomic Energy Agency. Some Europeans fear that Iran\u2019s growing stockpile of highly enriched uranium reveals it is on a covert path to building a nuclear bomb. Iran believes Europe rebuffed a clear signal of willingness to negotiate when Tehran offered to cap its uranium enrichment programme at 60% and to allow experienced IAEA nuclear inspectors back into the country. The aim of the Geneva meeting was to see if there was a basis for the Iranian offer to be developed, as well as to seek limits to Iranian-Russian military cooperation. In return, the EU could try to lift some economic sanctions, but the timetable is short before Trump takes power. Iran insists it has not provided any ballistic missiles to Russia, an assurance that the US does not accept. Speaking in Paris on Friday alongside his British counterpart, Richard Moore, the French foreign intelligence chief, Nicolas Lerner, said the risk of an Iranian nuclear proliferation was expected to be the most \u201ccritical threat\u201d in the coming months. Moore said the Iranian regime\u2019s nuclear ambitions \u201ccontinue to threaten all of us\u201d despite the series of blows dealt in recent months to Tehran\u2019s allied militias across the Middle East. In a pre-meeting between Gharibabadi and the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Enrique Mora, little common ground was found, judging by the accounts of the exchanges issued by both sides. Gharibabadi, Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs, wrote on X: \u201cEurope should not project its own problems and mistakes onto others, including with regard to the conflict in Ukraine \u2026 With regard to the nuclear issue of Iran, Europe has failed to be a serious player due to lack of self-confidence and responsibility.\u201d Mora issued a shorter statement on social media, saying the two sides had frank exchanges. He added: \u201cIran\u2019s military support to Russia that has to stop, the nuclear issue that needs a diplomatic solution, regional tensions (important to avoid further escalation from all sides) and human rights.\u201d The distrust between the two sides was made evident when the E3 countries on 21 November pushed ahead with a motion ordering the nuclear inspectorate to prepare a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d report on Iran\u2019s nuclear activities \u2013 the stepping stone necessary for European countries next autumn to snap back the UN sanctions that were imposed on Iran before it signed the 2015 nuclear deal. The UN nuclear agency has confirmed that Iran plans to install about 6,000 new centrifuges to enrich uranium, according to a report seen by AFP on Friday. \u201cIran informed the agency that it intended to feed\u201d about 6,000 centrifuges at its sites in Fordo and Natanz to enrich uranium to up to 5%, higher than the 3.67% limit Tehran had agreed to in 2015. Seyed Abbas Araghchi, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, said this week that the aim of the meeting was to find out whether the EU wanted cooperation or confrontation. He said that any snapback of UN sanctions was likely to lead to a change in the debate inside Iran about its possession of nuclear weapons. Iran has a fatwa in place opposing its possession of nuclear weapons, and the country insists its nuclear programme is only for civil purposes. Araghchi felt frustrated that Europe did not take a clearer independent approach after Trump pulled the US out of the nuclear deal in 2018, undercutting reformists inside Iran who said cooperation with the west over its nuclear programme would lead to a lifting of economic sanctions. Araghchi said Europe had done little to seek compromise since the election in the summer of the reformist president, Masoud Pezeshkian, who is committed to lifting sanctions by offering a more balanced policy between east and west.",

      "body": "<p>According to culinary lore, a traditional chef\u2019s hat has 100 pleats to represent the number of ways there are to cook an egg. But are there really as many as 100 ways to cook an egg? No, there are probably a <em>thousand</em> ways to transform, adorn and cajole this most obliging ingredient. But here is a modest selection of 100 \u2013 just to get you started.</p> <h2><strong>Breakfast</strong></h2> <p><strong>1</strong> Get up, don\u2019t reach for your phone, reach for an egg instead and start your day sunny side up. For a perfect breakfast sandwich, serve a fried egg between two slices of bread with a dollop of chilli jam and a sprinkle of chopped chives.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> As the mornings cool, there\u2019s no cosier way to start the day than with the uncosy-sounding \u201ceggs in purgatory\u201d. Drop the eggs into bubbling, chilli-spiked tomato sauce and partially cover the pan until the whites are completely cooked.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> But for eggs at their simplest, it\u2019s hard to beat the humble boiled egg. Lower an egg into a saucepan of boiling water for five minutes for a runny yolk, or seven for a soft and creamy one.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Or try the Delia method: lower eggs into boiling water and cook for exactly one minute. Turn the heat off, put a lid on the pan, and leave for six or seven minutes. Consider your soldiers: Marmite on rye, gruy\u00e8re on sourdough, anchovy butter on brioche \u2026.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> How about parmesan-crusted soldiers? This recipe calls for dunking them into a pesto-swirled yolk \u2026</p>    <ul> <li><p>Lightly boiled egg with parmesan-crusted soldiers and basil pesto</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2024/freshlay/boiled.html\" data-alt=\"Lightly boiled egg with parmesan-crusted soldiers and basil pesto recipe\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2024/freshlay/boiled.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p><strong>6</strong> For golden, lacy, crispy edges, fry an egg in oil so hot it hisses and splutters \u2013 and dodge the spits while you baste.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> In New York, the cheesy bodega-style egg sandwich is much loved. It\u2019s a squishy bun or English muffin stuffed with a cheesy almost-omelette, wrapped in foil. To make the almost-omelette, whisk the egg and tip it into a heated, oiled frying pan. Leave it alone, and as it starts to cook, place the cheese in the middle and fold the edges around it.</p> <p><strong>8</strong> Or, instead of an almost-omelette, how about an <em>actual </em>omelette? Food producer and recipe writer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jodienixon_/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jodie Nixon</a> suggests taking it up a notch with your pan: \u201cI like doing this in a cast iron pan so I can get a golden bottom and crispy edges, you just need to make sure the pan is screaming hot so when you add the eggs it puffs and bubbles (and won\u2019t stick!) - just push the edges in, swirling the rest of the eggs to fill the gaps and top with parmesan and chives.\u201d</p> <p><strong>9</strong> But the beauty in the omelette is in its easy customisation, there\u2019s a filling for every moment. As recipe developer<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cookingwithzainab/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Zainab Pirzada</a> puts it: \u201cOmelettes are a morning ritual that reflect my mood. Some days call for nothing more than a sprinkling of salt and pepper, while other days demand bold fillings like smoked sausage and green chilli.\u201d</p> <p><strong>10</strong> To make a breakfast taco, fill a flour tortilla with crispy potatoes, a fried egg and optional bacon, and garnish liberally with coriander, avocado, diced onion and your favourite salsa.</p> <p><strong>11</strong> Go for the Korean breakfast lifesaver, gyeran bap (which translates to egg rice): fried eggs, steamed white rice, soy sauce and sesame oil.</p> <p><strong>12</strong> Unbox last night\u2019s cold pizza, top it with a fried egg. (Or you can try the same thing with bolognese on toast \u2013 an absolutely delicious way to use up leftover ragu.)</p> <p><strong>13</strong> Love french toast? Explore its possibilities by using hot cross buns, crumpets and thick slices of challah. The basic eggy bath consists of eggs, milk, vanilla, a sprinkle of sugar, a pinch of salt, and possible cinnamon and nutmeg. Soak well and fry in foamy butter.</p> <p><strong>14</strong> Add fresh sage leaves to the frying pan while your eggs fry. Once the leaves are crispy, break them up and sprinkle on top of your eggs.</p> <p><strong>15</strong> Egg in a hole: use a cookie cutter to make a hole in a slice of bread. Fry the bread gently on one side in a well-oiled (or buttered) pan, then flip the slice and crack an egg into the hole. Cook until the egg is almost firm, then flip again to seal the deal. (Rumour has it you can do this in an air fryer, cutting out the flipping.)</p> <p><strong>16</strong> Scramble your eggs as you like. Top with ripples of smoked salmon, lemon and chopped dill.</p> <p><strong>17</strong> For scrambled eggs with chutzpah, gently saute some chopped spring onions in butter or wilt some spinach before you add the eggs to the pan. Finish with a flurry of parmesan.</p> <p><strong>18</strong> That muffin tin in the back of the kitchen cupboard we don\u2019t speak of? It does have a purpose. Spray each cup with oil, line with bacon and crack in an egg. Bake in the oven and voila \u2013 breakfast muffins you\u2019ll actually make.</p> <p><strong>19</strong> I do not like green eggs and ham \u2026 but you might? (Scramble them with pesto.)</p> <p><strong>20</strong> In North America, \u201cover-easy\u201d means the egg is fried on both sides, so there\u2019s no chance of underdone white. It works a whole lot better in a sandwich.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Smashed lemony mint peas with feta and poached eggs</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>21</strong> \u2026 or on top of smashed lemony peas <em>a la</em> this <a href=\"https://freshlayeggs.co.uk/recipes/smashed-lemony-mint-peas-with-feta-and-poached-eggs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">recipe</a>.</p> <p><strong>22</strong> Poached, over the top of avocado toast, obvs \u2026</p> <p><strong>23</strong> What\u2019s the difference between poached and coddled? Poached goes straight in the water, whereas coddled eggs are placed in a ramekin or \u201cegg coddler\u201d and then cooked in a water bath.</p> <h2><strong>Brunch</strong></h2>    <ul> <li><p>Soft-boiled egg halves on bacon</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>24</strong> Eggs benedict starts with a muffin that\u2019s English, but the origin story leads us to Delmonico\u2019s in Manhattan, where a long-time customer \u2013 one Mrs LeGrand Benedict \u2013 requested a dish of poached eggs, ham, hollandaise sauce and truffles.</p> <p><strong>25</strong> There are no fritters without eggs. Celebrate the egg as a binding agent by combining it with vegetables, herbs and cheese, and then frying in patties. Turkish <em>m\u00fccver</em> are incredible: courgette, spring onions, dill, feta and a little flour.</p> <p><strong>26</strong> Or, try your hand at the recipe below, inspired by a Korean dish called <em>yachaejeon</em>, and normally cooked as one large crispy pancake with a soy dipping sauce. Instead, this take calls for smaller fritters and is paired with a smoky tomato chutney made with soy sauce and deliciously spicy gochujang.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2024/freshlay/fritters.html\" data-alt=\"Crispy, vegetable fritters, gochujang and tomato chutney with soft boiled eggs recipe\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2024/freshlay/fritters.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Interactive</a> </figure>      <ul> <li><p>Crispy, vegetable fritters, gochujang and tomato chutney with soft boiled eggs</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>27</strong> Spanish tortilla ingredients: olive oil, eggs, potato, onion, a little patience and a leap of faith (turning it over in the pan, eek).</p> <p><strong>28</strong> Shakshuka is said to have been created by Tunisian Jews. The word means \u201cmixed\u201d and the mixture includes harissa, peppers, garlic and tomatoes, with eggs added straight to the simmered sauce.</p> <p><strong>29</strong> Shakshuka has been around the internet brunch-block, which means there are variations galore. Search green shakshuka for versions with peas, kale, courgettes and spinach.</p> <p><strong>30</strong> <em>Huevos rancheros,</em> or ranch-style eggs, can be traced to the farms and ranches of 16th-century Mexico. In its simplest form it\u2019s fried eggs topped with a luscious red salsa, eaten with warm tortillas.</p> <p><strong>31</strong> Dip asparagus spears in the runny yolk of a boiled egg. Wrap the spears in ham if you\u2019re that way inclined (and a meat eater).</p> <p><strong>32</strong> Turkish <em>menemen</em> is the most glorious scramble of eggs, olive oil, tomatoes and chillies. Welcome additions include feta, herbs and <em>sucuk</em> (Turkish sausage).</p> <p><strong>33</strong> When is an omelette actually a frittata? Frittatas tend to be thicker, finished in the oven, loaded with (mostly) vegetables and eaten at room temperature \u2013 perfect for a leisurely brunch. Try yours with leeks, lots of fresh herbs and a cheese of your choice.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Roasted cauliflower cheese and jalape\u00f1o frittata</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>34</strong> Or, if you\u2019re hosting and you want that collective \u201coooooh\u201d when you lay down a dish, try this <a href=\"https://freshlayeggs.co.uk/recipes/roasted-cauliflower-cheese-jalapeno-frittata/\" rel=\"nofollow\">frittata recipe</a>.</p> <p><strong>35</strong> A Parsi favourite, <em>akuri</em> makes for a jubilant Sunday morning. It\u2019s a super-soft and luxurious egg scramble (never too well done) with onion, tomatoes, fresh coriander, chillies, turmeric and further spices at the chef\u2019s discretion.</p> <p><strong>36</strong> A strata is a savoury bread pudding \u2013 a dish piled with broken bread and flavourings (kale and gruy\u00e8re, or sweetcorn, spring onion and cheddar, for instance), topped with a rich, creamy, and potentially mustardy, egg custard, baked until golden.</p> <p><strong>37</strong> To make marvellous Mexican <em>migas</em>, tear corn tortillas straight into hot oil in a frying pan, and when they\u2019re crisp, take them out. Fry some chopped peppers, jalapenos and onions, and then add the tortilla bits back into the pan with some eggs, and scramble it all together.</p> <p><strong>38</strong> In France, eggs<em> en cocotte </em>tend to be baked in adorable ramekins in a water bath, with a little cream or creme fraiche, pepper and chopped chives.</p> <p><strong>39</strong> The once-viral Japanese souffle pancakes, the fluffiest pancakes in the world, are powered by well-whipped egg whites, folded gently into the batter.</p> <p><strong>40</strong> Nothing screams brunch quite like a crab-and-egg combo. In an eggs benedict, replace the English muffin and ham with a crab cake to epic brunch-time effect.</p> <p><strong>41</strong> Planning a brunch to take your time over? Add a hit of chimichurri to your steak and eggs and load that cafetiere \u2013 you\u2019ll be set up for the day.</p> <p><strong>42</strong> The tomato-based Mauritian Creole sauce <em>rougaille</em> is flavoured with chilli and fresh thyme. It tastes good alongside almost anything, but for added sunshine, drop in whole eggs and cook in the same style as eggs in purgatory or shakshuka.</p> <p><strong>43</strong><em> \u00c7ilbir</em> is the Turkish poached egg dish of dreams: poached eggs on a heavenly bed of garlic yoghurt, topped with chilli butter and scooped up with bread.</p> <p><strong>44</strong> One of Singapore\u2019s staple breakfasts, <em>kaya</em> toast (toast smothered with coconut jam) is incomplete without soft-boiled eggs and sweet, strong coffee.</p> <h2><strong>Lunch</strong></h2>    <ul> <li><p>Green chilli cheese croque madame with poached egg</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>45</strong> Indeed you <em>can</em> fry your eggs in your favourite chilli oil. Take no prisoners; baste the yolk with it, too.</p> <p><strong>46</strong> Boiled egg mixed with mayonnaise and chopped spring onion is the correct way to enjoy a good bagel, pickle on the side.</p> <p><strong>47</strong> Or opt for a Japanese <em>tamago sando</em>. Egg mayo (made with kewpie mayo) stuffed between two slices of Japanese milk bread. The secret that makes this a superior sarnie? After the boiled eggs are peeled, the yolks are separated and mashed to create a creamy golden sauce for the chopped whites. Sounds like a right pain, yes, but worth it.</p> <p><strong>48</strong> Upgrade your life and almost any lunch with soy-marinated eggs \u2013 jammy boiled eggs (try 6\u00bd minutes to get the yolk just right), then cooled, peeled and submerged in a soy-based marinade, and left to do their thing overnight.</p> <p><strong>49</strong> Picnic pie!

This spinach version, above, from chef and recipe writer Hannah Mai Miller (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hannahmaieats/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Hannahmaieats</a>) uses the classic combination of sweet, earthy beetroot and tangy goat\u2019s cheese.</p> <p><strong>51</strong> It\u2019s hard to say what meal you\u2019d eat cloud eggs for, or why they exist. Nonetheless, the internet seems to love them. They are egg whites whipped to form a cloud or nest, with the egg yolk plopped back in the middle, then baked in the oven.</p> <p><strong>52</strong> Want to double the egginess? For <em>oeufs durs mayonnaise</em> in the Parisian pavement style, make your own mayonnaise with beautiful yolks and plenty of Dijon mustard and spoon it on to halved boiled eggs in very generous splodges.

The wine was Marc de Champagne (grape-skin brandy).</p> <p><strong>69</strong> There are many egg curries in the world, all worthy of your attention.

The flavour is variously described as umami, salty and very savoury.</p> <p><strong>72</strong> An egg on top of a steaming bowl of dal is a very wonderful thing. Fry the egg and slide it on top, or break it straight into the pan to poach with the dal.</p> <p><strong>73</strong> To make devilled eggs as the devil intended, scoop the yolks out of hard boiled eggs, mix them with mayonnaise, paprika and mustard, and then pipe the mixture back into the whites in pretty rosettes.

That\u2019s <em>oeufs en meurette.</em></p> <p><strong>76</strong><em> Huevos rotos</em> (broken eggs) can be found throughout Spain, but the dish probably originated in the Canary Islands. It\u2019s fried eggs placed over crispy fried potatoes (usually cut into rounds but occasionally actually French fries) alongside ribbons of jam\u00f3n or chunks of chorizo.</p> <p><strong>77</strong> Aioli is egg at its most mind blowing \u2013 yolks emulsified with garlic, olive oil and lemon juice to luxuriant effect, ideal for your chips, roast chicken or fish stew, but how to quickly turn it into a meal? Why, <em>le grand aioli</em>, of course! Fill a platter with colourful chopped things to dip: radishes, peppers, carrots, cooked potatoes, cherry tomatoes, blanched green beans, sugar snap peas, some cooked prawns if you\u2019re feeling fancy. The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance? Halved boiled eggs, of course.</p> <p><strong>78</strong> The Greek dish <em>strapatsada</em> is ripe tomatoes cooked simply and then finished by adding eggs, and scrambling \u2013 it has no time constraints, and is often eaten as part of a meze for lunch or dinner.</p> <p><strong>79</strong> Ham, egg and chips, like your nan used to make.</p> <p><strong>80</strong> To make the magical Thai dish son-in-law eggs, you fry hard boiled eggs (really!) so they develop a golden crust and then you serve them with a syrupy tamarind sauce and crispy onions.

Do as your elders did and dip your crusts in the yolk.</p> <h2><strong>Dessert</strong></h2> <p><strong>84</strong> Floating islands \u2013 the egg at its harmonious puddingy peak? The whites are transformed into floating featherlight meringues, the yolks enrich a lake of sweet creme anglaise.</p> <p><strong>85</strong> An early version of the egg custard tart as we know it in Britain (heavy on the nutmeg, ever so wobbly) was served at the coronation banquet prepared for Henry IV in 1399 \u2013 listed as \u201c<em>doucettys</em>\u201d.</p> <p><strong>86</strong> If you want to see what an egg white is capable of, whether you\u2019re an angel or not, make an angel food cake. It\u2019s made of egg whites, flour and sugar (no butter or oil), with a little cream of tartar to stabilise. It\u2019s as close as you\u2019ll come to baking a cloud.</p> <p><strong>87</strong> The classic Italian pudding <em>zabaglione</em> is made with just egg yolks, sugar and sweet wine. In Piedmont, where it began, the wine is moscato d\u2019Asti.</p> <p><strong>88</strong> <em>Crema catalana</em> is also known as <em>crema cremada</em>, and what\u2019s not to like about burnt cream? Unlike the French creme brulee, Spanish crema catalana tends to be flavoured with cinnamon and citrus.</p> <p><strong>89</strong> Creme caramel is a more gelatinous custard with a layer of dark caramel. It\u2019s possible that its rise in popularity in the late 20th century was because it could be made in bulk, unlike other cremes (brulee, for instance).</p>    <ul> <li><p>Chocolate mousse</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>90</strong> The <em>pastel de nata</em> (arguably the best of the custard tarts) dates back more than 300 years, to Jer\u00f3nimos monastery, in the Bel\u00e9m district of Lisbon. At the time, egg whites were used to starch monks\u2019 and nuns\u2019 habits, leaving the yolks up for grabs.</p> <p><strong>91</strong> The French dessert you make if you\u2019re trying to impress someone, a souffl\u00e9 is, at its heart, a baked egg dish. Souffl\u00e9 is the past participle of the verb <em>souffler</em>, meaning blow, breathe, puff, and it is, of course, the egg white that does the puffing.</p> <p><strong>92</strong> Another unique eggy alchemy, we must never take for granted: lemon curd. Lemons, butter, sugar and eggs, heated and whisked until thickened, then jarred and stored in the fridge, ready to become sunshine on toast, alongside your first cup of tea of the day.</p> <p><strong>93</strong><em> Pasticcini di mandorla</em> are soft, chewy almond biscuits from Sicily, made with just egg whites, ground almonds, icing sugar and lemon. Like all sweet things in Sicily, they\u2019re eaten at any time of day, including for breakfast, dipped in coffee.</p> <p><strong>94</strong> A really good chocolate mousse will make you wonder why you ever bother with any other dessert. It\u2019s just eggs, chocolate and sugar. Whatever you do, do not overmix.</p> <p><strong>95</strong> While eggnog is officially a drink, not a dessert, you\u2019ll scarcely find a more puddingy eggy (pasteurised) punch, laced as it is with cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg, plus bourbon, brandy or rum.</p> <p><strong>96</strong> Only eggs could transform an unappealing ingredient such as stale bread into a comforting dessert \u2013 bread and butter pudding.</p> <p><strong>97</strong><em> Budino</em> is the Italian word for custard or pudding. It tends to be a super-smooth custard in a glass, with a whipped cream topping. Chef and baker Nancy Silverton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.jamesbeard.org/recipes/butterscotch-budino-with-caramel-sauce-and-rosemary-pine-nut-cookies\" rel=\"nofollow\">butterscotch budino</a> is a brown-sugar beauty.</p> <p><strong>98</strong> Lemon meringue pie is good, but have you tried chocolate meringue pie? Raspberry meringue pie? Orange and rhubarb meringue pie? Key-lime meringue pie? You get the idea. Meringue is king.</p> <p><strong>99</strong> Meringue is queen, actually. Queen of puddings has it all \u2013 breadcrumbs soaked in custard (the original version uses any old bread, but <a href=\"https://www.nigella.com/recipes/queen-of-puddings\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nigella uses brioche</a>), berry jam, and a soft, chewy meringue crown.</p> <p><strong>100</strong> Finally, 100. where we present to you the almighty pavlova. Imagine the concept of a dinner party without a wreath of snow-white meringue laden with figs, raspberries and shavings of white chocolate. Or a tower of pavlovas!

      "bodyText": "According to culinary lore, a traditional chef\u2019s hat has 100 pleats to represent the number of ways there are to cook an egg. But are there really as many as 100 ways to cook an egg? No, there are probably a thousand ways to transform, adorn and cajole this most obliging ingredient. But here is a modest selection of 100 \u2013 just to get you started. Breakfast 1 Get up, don\u2019t reach for your phone, reach for an egg instead and start your day sunny side up. For a perfect breakfast sandwich, serve a fried egg between two slices of bread with a dollop of chilli jam and a sprinkle of chopped chives. 2 As the mornings cool, there\u2019s no cosier way to start the day than with the uncosy-sounding \u201ceggs in purgatory\u201d. Drop the eggs into bubbling, chilli-spiked tomato sauce and partially cover the pan until the whites are completely cooked. 3 But for eggs at their simplest, it\u2019s hard to beat the humble boiled egg. Lower an egg into a saucepan of boiling water for five minutes for a runny yolk, or seven for a soft and creamy one. 4 Or try the Delia method: lower eggs into boiling water and cook for exactly one minute. Turn the heat off, put a lid on the pan, and leave for six or seven minutes. Consider your soldiers: Marmite on rye, gruy\u00e8re on sourdough, anchovy butter on brioche \u2026. 5 How about parmesan-crusted soldiers? This recipe calls for dunking them into a pesto-swirled yolk \u2026 Lightly boiled egg with parmesan-crusted soldiers and basil pesto 6 For golden, lacy, crispy edges, fry an egg in oil so hot it hisses and splutters \u2013 and dodge the spits while you baste. 7 In New York, the cheesy bodega-style egg sandwich is much loved. It\u2019s a squishy bun or English muffin stuffed with a cheesy almost-omelette, wrapped in foil. To make the almost-omelette, whisk the egg and tip it into a heated, oiled frying pan. Leave it alone, and as it starts to cook, place the cheese in the middle and fold the edges around it. 8 Or, instead of an almost-omelette, how about an actual omelette? Food producer and recipe writer Jodie Nixon suggests taking it up a notch with your pan: \u201cI like doing this in a cast iron pan so I can get a golden bottom and crispy edges, you just need to make sure the pan is screaming hot so when you add the eggs it puffs and bubbles (and won\u2019t stick!) - just push the edges in, swirling the rest of the eggs to fill the gaps and top with parmesan and chives.\u201d 9 But the beauty in the omelette is in its easy customisation, there\u2019s a filling for every moment. As recipe developer Zainab Pirzada puts it: \u201cOmelettes are a morning ritual that reflect my mood. Some days call for nothing more than a sprinkling of salt and pepper, while other days demand bold fillings like smoked sausage and green chilli.\u201d 10 To make a breakfast taco, fill a flour tortilla with crispy potatoes, a fried egg and optional bacon, and garnish liberally with coriander, avocado, diced onion and your favourite salsa. 11 Go for the Korean breakfast lifesaver, gyeran bap (which translates to egg rice): fried eggs, steamed white rice, soy sauce and sesame oil. 12 Unbox last night\u2019s cold pizza, top it with a fried egg. (Or you can try the same thing with bolognese on toast \u2013 an absolutely delicious way to use up leftover ragu.) 13 Love french toast? Explore its possibilities by using hot cross buns, crumpets and thick slices of challah. The basic eggy bath consists of eggs, milk, vanilla, a sprinkle of sugar, a pinch of salt, and possible cinnamon and nutmeg. Soak well and fry in foamy butter. 14 Add fresh sage leaves to the frying pan while your eggs fry. Once the leaves are crispy, break them up and sprinkle on top of your eggs. 15 Egg in a hole: use a cookie cutter to make a hole in a slice of bread. Fry the bread gently on one side in a well-oiled (or buttered) pan, then flip the slice and crack an egg into the hole. Cook until the egg is almost firm, then flip again to seal the deal. (Rumour has it you can do this in an air fryer, cutting out the flipping.) 16 Scramble your eggs as you like. Top with ripples of smoked salmon, lemon and chopped dill. 17 For scrambled eggs with chutzpah, gently saute some chopped spring onions in butter or wilt some spinach before you add the eggs to the pan. Finish with a flurry of parmesan. 18 That muffin tin in the back of the kitchen cupboard we don\u2019t speak of? It does have a purpose. Spray each cup with oil, line with bacon and crack in an egg. Bake in the oven and voila \u2013 breakfast muffins you\u2019ll actually make. 19 I do not like green eggs and ham \u2026 but you might? (Scramble them with pesto.) 20 In North America, \u201cover-easy\u201d means the egg is fried on both sides, so there\u2019s no chance of underdone white. It works a whole lot better in a sandwich. Smashed lemony mint peas with feta and poached eggs 21 \u2026 or on top of smashed lemony peas a la this recipe. 22 Poached, over the top of avocado toast, obvs \u2026 23 What\u2019s the difference between poached and coddled? Poached goes straight in the water, whereas coddled eggs are placed in a ramekin or \u201cegg coddler\u201d and then cooked in a water bath. Brunch Soft-boiled egg halves on bacon 24 Eggs benedict starts with a muffin that\u2019s English, but the origin story leads us to Delmonico\u2019s in Manhattan, where a long-time customer \u2013 one Mrs LeGrand Benedict \u2013 requested a dish of poached eggs, ham, hollandaise sauce and truffles. 25 There are no fritters without eggs. Celebrate the egg as a binding agent by combining it with vegetables, herbs and cheese, and then frying in patties. Turkish m\u00fccver are incredible: courgette, spring onions, dill, feta and a little flour. 26 Or, try your hand at the recipe below, inspired by a Korean dish called yachaejeon, and normally cooked as one large crispy pancake with a soy dipping sauce. Instead, this take calls for smaller fritters and is paired with a smoky tomato chutney made with soy sauce and deliciously spicy gochujang. Crispy, vegetable fritters, gochujang and tomato chutney with soft boiled eggs 27 Spanish tortilla ingredients: olive oil, eggs, potato, onion, a little patience and a leap of faith (turning it over in the pan, eek). 28 Shakshuka is said to have been created by Tunisian Jews. The word means \u201cmixed\u201d and the mixture includes harissa, peppers, garlic and tomatoes, with eggs added straight to the simmered sauce. 29 Shakshuka has been around the internet brunch-block, which means there are variations galore. Search green shakshuka for versions with peas, kale, courgettes and spinach. 30 Huevos rancheros, or ranch-style eggs, can be traced to the farms and ranches of 16th-century Mexico. In its simplest form it\u2019s fried eggs topped with a luscious red salsa, eaten with warm tortillas. 31 Dip asparagus spears in the runny yolk of a boiled egg. Wrap the spears in ham if you\u2019re that way inclined (and a meat eater). 32 Turkish menemen is the most glorious scramble of eggs, olive oil, tomatoes and chillies. Welcome additions include feta, herbs and sucuk (Turkish sausage). 33 When is an omelette actually a frittata? Frittatas tend to be thicker, finished in the oven, loaded with (mostly) vegetables and eaten at room temperature \u2013 perfect for a leisurely brunch. Try yours with leeks, lots of fresh herbs and a cheese of your choice. Roasted cauliflower cheese and jalape\u00f1o frittata 34 Or, if you\u2019re hosting and you want that collective \u201coooooh\u201d when you lay down a dish, try this frittata recipe. 35 A Parsi favourite, akuri makes for a jubilant Sunday morning. It\u2019s a super-soft and luxurious egg scramble (never too well done) with onion, tomatoes, fresh coriander, chillies, turmeric and further spices at the chef\u2019s discretion. 36 A strata is a savoury bread pudding \u2013 a dish piled with broken bread and flavourings (kale and gruy\u00e8re, or sweetcorn, spring onion and cheddar, for instance), topped with a rich, creamy, and potentially mustardy, egg custard, baked until golden. 37 To make marvellous Mexican migas, tear corn tortillas straight into hot oil in a frying pan, and when they\u2019re crisp, take them out. Fry some chopped peppers, jalapenos and onions, and then add the tortilla bits back into the pan with some eggs, and scramble it all together. 38 In France, eggs en cocotte tend to be baked in adorable ramekins in a water bath, with a little cream or creme fraiche, pepper and chopped chives. 39 The once-viral Japanese souffle pancakes, the fluffiest pancakes in the world, are powered by well-whipped egg whites, folded gently into the batter. 40 Nothing screams brunch quite like a crab-and-egg combo. In an eggs benedict, replace the English muffin and ham with a crab cake to epic brunch-time effect. 41 Planning a brunch to take your time over? Add a hit of chimichurri to your steak and eggs and load that cafetiere \u2013 you\u2019ll be set up for the day. 42 The tomato-based Mauritian Creole sauce rougaille is flavoured with chilli and fresh thyme. It tastes good alongside almost anything, but for added sunshine, drop in whole eggs and cook in the same style as eggs in purgatory or shakshuka. 43 \u00c7ilbir is the Turkish poached egg dish of dreams: poached eggs on a heavenly bed of garlic yoghurt, topped with chilli butter and scooped up with bread. 44 One of Singapore\u2019s staple breakfasts, kaya toast (toast smothered with coconut jam) is incomplete without soft-boiled eggs and sweet, strong coffee. Lunch Green chilli cheese croque madame with poached egg 45 Indeed you can fry your eggs in your favourite chilli oil. Take no prisoners; baste the yolk with it, too. 46 Boiled egg mixed with mayonnaise and chopped spring onion is the correct way to enjoy a good bagel, pickle on the side. 47 Or opt for a Japanese tamago sando. Egg mayo (made with kewpie mayo) stuffed between two slices of Japanese milk bread. The secret that makes this a superior sarnie? After the boiled eggs are peeled, the yolks are separated and mashed to create a creamy golden sauce for the chopped whites. Sounds like a right pain, yes, but worth it. 48 Upgrade your life and almost any lunch with soy-marinated eggs \u2013 jammy boiled eggs (try 6\u00bd minutes to get the yolk just right), then cooled, peeled and submerged in a soy-based marinade, and left to do their thing overnight. 49 Picnic pie! Usually like a pork pie (with a hot-water crust pastry), but stuffed with spiced sausagemeat and whole boiled eggs. 50 Is it a tart? Is it a pancake? Does it matter? The galette is the perfect vessel for an oozy egg. This spinach version, above, from chef and recipe writer Hannah Mai Miller (@Hannahmaieats) uses the classic combination of sweet, earthy beetroot and tangy goat\u2019s cheese. 51 It\u2019s hard to say what meal you\u2019d eat cloud eggs for, or why they exist. Nonetheless, the internet seems to love them. They are egg whites whipped to form a cloud or nest, with the egg yolk plopped back in the middle, then baked in the oven. 52 Want to double the egginess? For oeufs durs mayonnaise in the Parisian pavement style, make your own mayonnaise with beautiful yolks and plenty of Dijon mustard and spoon it on to halved boiled eggs in very generous splodges. Create extra drama with crusty bread, fries, a green salad and a glass of Beaujolais. Don\u2019t go back to work. 53 Omurice! Fried rice seasoned with ketchup, tucked beneath a silky omelette blanket. Thank you for everything, Japan. 54 If the croque is a boy, it doesn\u2019t have an egg on, so make damn sure your croque is a madame. 55 Or level up your toastie game \u2013 cumin, green chillies and soft-boiled eggs deliver a tasty spin on the comforting croque. Green chilli cheese toastie with poached eggs 56 The days of the national scotch egg challenge may be behind us (but national scotch egg day is still a thing), so don\u2019t for one minute think we\u2019ve forgotten about smoked mackerel scotch eggs, black pudding scotch eggs, onion bhaji scotch eggs, or prawn toast scotch eggs \u2013 they adorn farmers\u2019 markets up and down the country. 57 But we\u2019d be remiss not to mention another omelette \u2026 a very fancy one at that, one that deserves a sea view and a very cold, crisp glass of wine. This crab, coconut and courgette omelette from cook and food writer Ixta Belfrage might not seem like your usual combination of ingredients, but it\u2019s a breakfast-for-dinner fit for a king! Crab, coconut and courgette omelette 58 A salade lyonnaise is \u2013 to all intents and purposes \u2013 a bacon and egg salad (fris\u00e9e, crispy lardons, poached eggs). 59 We managed to get to number 56 before wheeling out a quiche. Here it is \u2013 champion of the lunch trolley \u2013 a splendid quiche lorraine, laced with leeks, bacon and cheddar. 60 Yam khai dow is a genius Thai salad that includes chopped up crispy fried eggs, onion, spring onion, fresh coriander and a sour-spicy dressing. 61 Stracciatella (not the cheese or the ice-cream) is an Italian soup made from chicken broth with eggs and parmesan whisked in. Extras include freshly grated nutmeg and parsley. 62 Tamagoyaki is made by rolling together several thin layers of cooked egg. Once you\u2019ve mastered it, you can use it to make tamago sushi \u2013 plump parcels of sushi rice topped with egg and wrapped in elegant strips of nori. 63 One pickled egg, scooped from the cloudy pub jar and slipped directly into a just-opened packet of salt and vinegar crisps, shaken, then eaten. Dinner Fried egg on steak and chips 64 Carbonara, baby. All you need is spaghetti, egg yolks, pecorino romano, lots of pepper and scrumptiously fatty pork cheek (guanciale). Certainly not cream. 65 If guanciale isn\u2019t your bag, you can make a vegetarian carbonara by ditching the meat in favour of caramelised shallots, and adding a little grated courgette or some peas. 66 Eggs make batter. And batter makes everything better. 67 Fancy frying your leftover rice with eggs? Watch the YouTube works of Uncle Roger (Nigel Ng) for all the ways not to do it \u2026 and go from here. 68 In Elizabeth David\u2019s essay An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, the omelette in question was omelette moli\u00e8re, consisting of three eggs beaten with a tablespoon of finely grated parmesan and a little pepper. Fry in butter, adding one tablespoon of diced gruy\u00e8re and one of thick cream during cooking. The wine was Marc de Champagne (grape-skin brandy). 69 There are many egg curries in the world, all worthy of your attention. Consider egg makhani \u2013 boiled eggs simmered in a buttery, nutty, rich curry sauce that is golden in hue. 70 Lomo a lo pobre is a Chilean dish that translates to \u201cpoor man\u2019s steak\u201d but is in fact a sumptuous mix of steak and eggs. This inspired version includes pan-fried plantain, which brings sweetness, and is balanced by a punchy, but quick to make, green sauce loosely inspired by aji verde. Top the seared sirloins with a couple of crispy, fried eggs for a golden finish and you\u2019ve got a winner dinner. Lomo a lo pobre with fried eggs and plantain 71 The legendary Chinese century eggs tend to be preserved in their shells for weeks or months (rather than 100 years) in a mixture of wood ash, salt, clay, quicklime and tea. The method is said to date back to the Ming dynasty. The flavour is variously described as umami, salty and very savoury. 72 An egg on top of a steaming bowl of dal is a very wonderful thing. Fry the egg and slide it on top, or break it straight into the pan to poach with the dal. 73 To make devilled eggs as the devil intended, scoop the yolks out of hard boiled eggs, mix them with mayonnaise, paprika and mustard, and then pipe the mixture back into the whites in pretty rosettes. For a cheat\u2019s version, try oeufs durs mayonnaise as above, but spice up the mayonnaise with paprika and English mustard. 74 Jammy eggs \u2026 but this time immersed in a creamy, spicy coconut soup. This recipe, left, by kitchen wizard John Gregory-Smith uses ready-made dumplings and is a doozy to make. 75 When in Burgundy (or when you\u2019re feelin\u2019 like a French duke), cook your eggs in red wine sauce and serve with garlic toast. That\u2019s oeufs en meurette. 76 Huevos rotos (broken eggs) can be found throughout Spain, but the dish probably originated in the Canary Islands. It\u2019s fried eggs placed over crispy fried potatoes (usually cut into rounds but occasionally actually French fries) alongside ribbons of jam\u00f3n or chunks of chorizo. 77 Aioli is egg at its most mind blowing \u2013 yolks emulsified with garlic, olive oil and lemon juice to luxuriant effect, ideal for your chips, roast chicken or fish stew, but how to quickly turn it into a meal? Why, le grand aioli, of course! Fill a platter with colourful chopped things to dip: radishes, peppers, carrots, cooked potatoes, cherry tomatoes, blanched green beans, sugar snap peas, some cooked prawns if you\u2019re feeling fancy. The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance? Halved boiled eggs, of course. 78 The Greek dish strapatsada is ripe tomatoes cooked simply and then finished by adding eggs, and scrambling \u2013 it has no time constraints, and is often eaten as part of a meze for lunch or dinner. 79 Ham, egg and chips, like your nan used to make. 80 To make the magical Thai dish son-in-law eggs, you fry hard boiled eggs (really!) so they develop a golden crust and then you serve them with a syrupy tamarind sauce and crispy onions. Crunchy, sweet, sour, yum. 81 A crispy fried egg atop noodles is one of life\u2019s greatest pleasures. Making your own chilli oil is another. We present to you both. 82 Fresh pasta! Pappadelle! Linguine! Ravioli! Tortellini! 83 Those of us who dined in Pizza Express\u2019s heyday (we, the true pioneers of the dough ball) will forever have a soft spot for the fiorentina \u2013 a spinach, olive and egg pizza. Do as your elders did and dip your crusts in the yolk. Dessert 84 Floating islands \u2013 the egg at its harmonious puddingy peak? The whites are transformed into floating featherlight meringues, the yolks enrich a lake of sweet creme anglaise. 85 An early version of the egg custard tart as we know it in Britain (heavy on the nutmeg, ever so wobbly) was served at the coronation banquet prepared for Henry IV in 1399 \u2013 listed as \u201cdoucettys\u201d. 86 If you want to see what an egg white is capable of, whether you\u2019re an angel or not, make an angel food cake. It\u2019s made of egg whites, flour and sugar (no butter or oil), with a little cream of tartar to stabilise. It\u2019s as close as you\u2019ll come to baking a cloud. 87 The classic Italian pudding zabaglione is made with just egg yolks, sugar and sweet wine. In Piedmont, where it began, the wine is moscato d\u2019Asti. 88 Crema catalana is also known as crema cremada, and what\u2019s not to like about burnt cream? Unlike the French creme brulee, Spanish crema catalana tends to be flavoured with cinnamon and citrus. 89 Creme caramel is a more gelatinous custard with a layer of dark caramel. It\u2019s possible that its rise in popularity in the late 20th century was because it could be made in bulk, unlike other cremes (brulee, for instance). Chocolate mousse 90 The pastel de nata (arguably the best of the custard tarts) dates back more than 300 years, to Jer\u00f3nimos monastery, in the Bel\u00e9m district of Lisbon. At the time, egg whites were used to starch monks\u2019 and nuns\u2019 habits, leaving the yolks up for grabs. 91 The French dessert you make if you\u2019re trying to impress someone, a souffl\u00e9 is, at its heart, a baked egg dish. Souffl\u00e9 is the past participle of the verb souffler, meaning blow, breathe, puff, and it is, of course, the egg white that does the puffing. 92 Another unique eggy alchemy, we must never take for granted: lemon curd. Lemons, butter, sugar and eggs, heated and whisked until thickened, then jarred and stored in the fridge, ready to become sunshine on toast, alongside your first cup of tea of the day. 93 Pasticcini di mandorla are soft, chewy almond biscuits from Sicily, made with just egg whites, ground almonds, icing sugar and lemon. Like all sweet things in Sicily, they\u2019re eaten at any time of day, including for breakfast, dipped in coffee. 94 A really good chocolate mousse will make you wonder why you ever bother with any other dessert. It\u2019s just eggs, chocolate and sugar. Whatever you do, do not overmix. 95 While eggnog is officially a drink, not a dessert, you\u2019ll scarcely find a more puddingy eggy (pasteurised) punch, laced as it is with cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg, plus bourbon, brandy or rum. 96 Only eggs could transform an unappealing ingredient such as stale bread into a comforting dessert \u2013 bread and butter pudding. 97 Budino is the Italian word for custard or pudding. It tends to be a super-smooth custard in a glass, with a whipped cream topping. Chef and baker Nancy Silverton\u2019s butterscotch budino is a brown-sugar beauty. 98 Lemon meringue pie is good, but have you tried chocolate meringue pie? Raspberry meringue pie? Orange and rhubarb meringue pie? Key-lime meringue pie? You get the idea. Meringue is king. 99 Meringue is queen, actually. Queen of puddings has it all \u2013 breadcrumbs soaked in custard (the original version uses any old bread, but Nigella uses brioche), berry jam, and a soft, chewy meringue crown. 100 Finally, 100. where we present to you the almighty pavlova. Imagine the concept of a dinner party without a wreath of snow-white meringue laden with figs, raspberries and shavings of white chocolate. Or a tower of pavlovas! Stacked high with lemon curd, cream, and sparklers, for the shiniest of show-stoppers.

      "body": "<p>As a flavour pairing, chocolate and orange is much more divisive than it needs to be. Admittedly, it\u2019s something I crave only during the festive season, not least because the very thought of chocolate orange in June feels criminal.

      "bodyText": "As a flavour pairing, chocolate and orange is much more divisive than it needs to be. Admittedly, it\u2019s something I crave only during the festive season, not least because the very thought of chocolate orange in June feels criminal. This is a great get-ahead dessert made up of a light chocolate-orange sponge and a layer of amaretti biscuit that softens and gets all chewy, all topped off with a rich chocolate and mascarpone cream spiked with orange liqueur. Chocolate, orange and amaretti pudding Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr Chill 3 hr+ Serves 10 For the chocolate sponge Butter, to grease 3 large eggs 70g caster sugar Zest of 1 orange 60g plain flour 20g cocoa powder \u00bc tsp baking powder A pinch of salt For the orange syrup Juice of 1 orange 40g caster sugar For the topping 90g dark chocolate, finely chopped, plus extra, shaved, to decorate 220ml double cream 4 egg yolks 60g caster sugar 370g mascarpone 40ml Cointreau or Grand Marnier 60g amaretti biscuits, roughly crushed Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, and grease and line a 30cm x 20cm rectangular cake tin or a 24cm round cake tin. Put the eggs, sugar and orange zest in a large bowl and whisk on medium-high for three to five minutes, until the eggs are very thick and have doubled in size. When you lift the whisk from the bowl, it should leave a trail on the surface before disappearing. Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt into a second bowl, then sift half the flour mix into the whipped egg bowl and carefully fold it in, taking care not to knock out too much air. Repeat with the remaining flour mix, then gently pour the batter into the lined tin, tilting it to fill all the corners. Bake for 15-17 minutes, until springy to the touch, then remove and leave to cool completely. To make the syrup, put the orange juice and sugar in a small saucepan, bring to a boil, then simmer for a minute and take off the heat. For the topping, put the chocolate in a bowl. Heat 120ml of the cream in a small saucepan until steaming, pour it over the chocolate and let it sit for 30 seconds, then stir until smooth. Put the egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl, and whisk on high for two to three minutes, until thick and pale. Beat in the mascarpone in two batches, until smooth, stir in the chocolate mix until fully combined, then add the orange liqueur. In another bowl, lightly whip the remaining 100ml double cream to soft peaks, then fold into the mascarpone. To assemble, slice the cake into large pieces that fit snugly into the cake tin, overlapping if needed. Brush generously with the orange syrup, then top with a layer of crushed amaretti. Spoon the chocolate mixture on top and chill for at least three hours. Cover the chilled pudding with shaved or curled dark chocolate, then serve.",

Extreme procrastination and restlessness are some of my most noticeable traits. If you meet me, I\u2019m most probably discreetly tapping my big toe to expel the nervous energy that rips through me on a daily basis. And while I\u2019m hardly ever late these days, that\u2019s only because I\u2019ve jerry-rigged an elaborate system of calendar alarms to alert me to any upcoming event.</p> <p>Almost everyone treated my diagnosis like a behavioural problem that only affected young, hyperactive boys. These days, things couldn\u2019t be more different. On TikTok alone, videos tagged #ADHD have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98340a65-5438-44eb-8462-7ce15212ded2\">received 2bn views</a> in the UK over the last year. But misinformation is also rife:one study determined that 52% of the clips on the platform <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9659797/\">contained misleading information</a>. Here, a team of&nbsp;medical professionals and ADHD experts unpack what you need to know.</p> <h2><strong>What is ADHD and what causes it?</strong></h2> <p>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the brain and nervous system, with symptoms of inattentiveness and/or impulsivity and hyperactivity that arise in childhood and may persist well into adulthood. It\u2019s believed to be the result of a complex combination of genetics and environmental factors. The condition is highly heritable.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s thought to affect around 5% of children and around 3% of the adult population in the UK,\u201d says Prof Philip Asherson, the emeritus professor of neurodevelopmental psychiatry at King\u2019s College London. It\u2019s one of the most common disorders, alongside autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and can be classed as a disability under the Equality Act if it is severe enough to impair day-to-day life and work.</p> <p>The term \u201cdeficit\u201d can be slightly misleading. \u201cPeople think that people can\u2019t concentrate at all, which is not true,\u201d says Prof Amanda Kirby, the chair of <a href=\"https://www.adhdfoundation.org.uk/\">ADHD Foundation</a>. \u201cOften children and adults can hyperfocus on the things of high interest.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Is ADHD being overdiagnosed?</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely not overdiagnosed,\u201d says Henry Shelford, the co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://adhduk.co.uk/\">ADHD UK</a>. Though experts estimate that there are 2.6 million people with ADHD in the UK, <a href=\"https://adhduk.co.uk/about-adhd/#:~:text=Incidence,694%2C000%20children%2C%201.9%20million).\">based on Lancet and National Insitute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) incidence rates</a>, only about 350,000 to 500,000 have received a formal diagnosis \u2013 which leaves two million out in the cold.</p> <h2><strong>What are some common symptoms of ADHD?</strong></h2> <p>Hyperactivity and impulsivity are the most obvious symptoms of ADHD to those on the outside. \u201cI have to hold myself still, and as I do so it feels like a&nbsp;volcano building in me,\u201d Shelford explains. Children might fidget constantly, talk excessively, get up&nbsp;to&nbsp;move around or bother their classmates. Adults&nbsp;may find more socially acceptable ways of channelling that restlessness, such as repeatedly touching their hair.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I have to hold myself still and as I do so it feels like a volcano building in me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>People with ADHD can often make careless mistakes, regularly losing things and failing to pay close attention to details or following instructions. They often find it impossible to focus on certain tasks. They may lose hours to intense focus or have problems with managing their time. This <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/time-blindness\">time blindness</a> could make them late for important occasions or fail to make deadlines. Conversely, it could also make them turn up incredibly early for occasions, as they can\u2019t accurately estimate how long it takes to do something.</p> <h2><strong>Doesn\u2019t everyone get a little distracted sometimes?</strong></h2> <p>\u201cTwo things mark out what might be potentially diagnosable from what is everyday,\u201d says Dr Max Davie, the co-founder of ADHD UK and co-host of the <a href=\"https://adhduk.co.uk/adhd-science/\">ADHD Science podcast</a>. \u201cOne is that symptoms are present in all settings, and the other is that they\u2019re severe enough to cause functional impairment.\u201d</p> <p>If you are highly distractible all the time \u2013 not just&nbsp;when you\u2019re bored at work \u2013 and your symptoms are persistent and severe enough to impair your life, you may very well meet the clinical threshold for a&nbsp;diagnosis. If a child struggles to consistently listen or pay attention at school <em>and</em> home despite their best efforts and intentions, it may be a sign that they&nbsp;have ADHD.</p> <h2>I saw on TikTok that sleeping like a \u2018flamingo\u2019 or a \u2018T rex\u2019 could be a good indicator you have ADHD</h2> <p>TikTok has been hugely influential in spreading awareness of the condition but it certainly shouldn\u2019t be relied on as a formal diagnosis, especially given the widespread misinformation about symptoms. For instance, sleeping on your side with one leg curled up like a flamingo, or sleeping with your hands curled under your chin (\u201cT rex arms\u201d, as content creators call it) are widely claimed to be telltale signs \u2013 even though there is <a href=\"https://medisearch.io/blog/adhd-and-t-rex-arms\">little to no scientific evidence</a> that this is true. \u201cSocial media has some absolutely brilliant insight and some absolute nonsense,\u201d Shelford says. \u201cBut it can start a learning journey where people look up more information about ADHD and go, \u2018That explains so much.\u2019 That enlightenment is to be celebrated.\u201d Resources such as <a href=\"https://www.adhdfoundation.org.uk/\">ADHD Foundation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.addiss.co.uk/\">ADDISS</a>, <a href=\"https://aadduk.org/\">AADD-UK</a> and <a href=\"https://adhduk.co.uk/\">ADHD UK</a> can help those looking for accurate and up-to-date information about the condition.</p>    <h2><strong>Does ADHD present differently depending on&nbsp;your sex?</strong></h2> <p>Girls under the age of 18 with ADHD are <a href=\"https://www.adhdfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Women-With-ADHD-Call-To-Action.pdf\">three times less likely</a> to be diagnosed, as they tend to present more inattentive and less hyperactive traits, and are therefore perceived as less disruptive. (The girl fidgeting subtly in the back of class doesn\u2019t get half as much attention as a boy who feels the urge to run out of school.) Experts emphasise there is still plenty of overlap between the two, though. \u201cPeople may not realise that you don\u2019t have to be badly behaved to have ADHD,\u201d says Asherson. \u201cI like to remind people that there are lots of boys who fit that female criterion as well.\u201d</p> <p>Women\u2019s symptoms may vary depending on their menstrual cycle. In the week before their period, \u201caligned with PMS, or possibly premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) if it\u2019s really severe, women\u2019s ADHD will worsen\u201d, says Dr James Kustow, a consultant psychiatrist and the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-thrive-with-adult-adhd-9781785044526/\">How to Thrive With Adult ADHD</a>. Symptoms may also worsen during perimenopause and menopause, prompting some to seek help for the first time. Scientists believe this may have to do with <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X23001642\">declining&nbsp;oestrogen levels</a>, though this remains an&nbsp;understudied topic.</p> <p>Women also tend to be better at hiding or \u201cmasking\u201d their symptoms, which may lead to a&nbsp;misdiagnosis of anxiety or depression. Asherson says: \u201cThen they\u2019re presenting later and often not necessarily saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got ADHD,\u2019 but rather, \u2018I\u2019m&nbsp;worrying all the time.\u2019 Part of that could just be&nbsp;their thoughts jumping and flitting, thinking about all the difficulties in their life \u2013 that looks a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;like anxiety.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Some may start having debilitating issues with focus where they might not have before, as well as sleep problems and racing thoughts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>I don\u2019t think I had ADHD as a kid, but I\u2019m really struggling now. What\u2019s happened?</strong></h2> <p>Depending on the severity of your symptoms, you may have slipped under the radar of your parents or teachers and were able to cobble together habits to help you cope and get by. But any major life event or upheaval \u2013 such as the pandemic or a high-pressure job \u2013 can undermine that internal scaffolding. For instance, Kustow sees many people asking for help at the end of first year of university. Becoming a&nbsp;parent might also be \u201creally destabilising for someone who struggles with executive function issues\u201d as they are unable to cope with the baby\u2019s unpredictable schedule.</p> <p>Others may start having debilitating issues with focus where they might not have before, as well as sleep problems and racing thoughts \u2013 which can often be misattributed to mental health issues like anxiety, depression or even bipolar disorder.</p> <h2><strong>How do I get a diagnosis if I think </strong><strong>my child or I&nbsp;has ADHD?</strong></h2> <p>You can check your suspicions with a reputable online screening test, like <a href=\"https://adhduk.co.uk/adult-adhd-screening-survey/#gf_73\">this one on the ADHD UK website</a>. \u201cBut ultimately, the only way to really know is to have a formal assessment,\u201d Shelford says. Talk to your GP about getting a&nbsp;referral for an adult assessment. If you suspect your child has ADHD, you should speak to their GP, as well as to their school about getting a&nbsp;referral to a &nbsp;specialist service.</p> <p>Shelford adds: \u201cIf you\u2019re in England, you\u2019ve got the option of <a href=\"https://adhduk.co.uk/right-to-choose/\">Right to Choose</a>, which is designed to help people escape the postcode lottery if they have a poor service in their local area.\u201d This means that you are legally entitled to an alternative provider. \u201cIt\u2019s an NHS assessment, it goes on the NHS record, you get NHS prescriptions. Anyone in England can access that right,\u201d Shelford adds.</p> <h2><strong>The waiting list in my area is too long. What do&nbsp;I need to know about going private?</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit cowboy country at the moment, with private services popping up,\u201d says Kirby. So the best thing you can do is your homework: talk to other people about their experiences, contact organisations like the ADHD Foundation and ADHD&nbsp;UK, speak to your local NHS trust for recommendations, and make sure your medical professional is registered with the <a href=\"https://www.gmc-uk.org/registration-and-licensing/our-registers\">General Medical Council</a> (GMC).</p> <p>If you are getting your child privately assessed, make sure the psychologist is registered with the <a href=\"https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;amp;ai=DChcSEwiS1uv2mLKJAxXmq4MHHYCnDyQYABACGgJlZg&amp;amp;ae=2&amp;amp;aspm=1&amp;amp;co=1&amp;amp;ase=2&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw7Py4BhCbARIsAMMx-_IEb5ZzlSghj_nlJF9P62kK9enzOLOVWXJ8R11-79XE8kXYAu706Z4aAlilEALw_wcB&amp;amp;ohost=www.google.com&amp;amp;cid=CAESVuD2TVeUVU4YXBE-JP2r6a5hkihbeEftrSrX2l0F3EVIbafeUW15d-B6O_BaxaIzjy3kIWPxfwJ7u5thrAJgQL8H4upX9dCxunPP5O8IJFPY8zwBjtOm&amp;amp;sig=AOD64_1NQTuBsyNz3u0AXw1MUuPxj700nA&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;nis=4&amp;amp;adurl&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiS8-T2mLKJAxXxgP0HHUG9D6sQqyQoAHoECAgQDA\">British Psychological Society</a> (BPS). \u201cWithout that, the diagnosis or report will not be outstanding,\u201d emphasises Prof Barry Carpenter, the UK\u2019s first professor of mental health in education. This is important because you may want to submit evidence that your child\u2019s school needs to provide an Education, Health and Care plan (EHC), which legally entitles them to further support. </p> <h2><strong>What kind of treatment is available for ADHD?</strong></h2> <p>Stimulant medications such as <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/treatment/\">methylphenidate and lisdexamfetamine</a> are the most commonly prescribed for children and adults, but treating ADHD need not begin and end with medication.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s late again,\u201d my friend said, texting to complain about a colleague. \u201cYou\u2019ve got ADHD, too, and you seem fine!\u201d I thought smugly: \u201cAh yes,\u201d as I prepared to pull another all-nighter to hit a deadline, \u201cthat could never be me.\u201d I was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at 14, which, at its worst, feels like having a million YouTube tabs simultaneously playing in my brain. Extreme procrastination and restlessness are some of my most noticeable traits. If you meet me, I\u2019m most probably discreetly tapping my big toe to expel the nervous energy that rips through me on a daily basis. And while I\u2019m hardly ever late these days, that\u2019s only because I\u2019ve jerry-rigged an elaborate system of calendar alarms to alert me to any upcoming event. Almost everyone treated my diagnosis like a behavioural problem that only affected young, hyperactive boys. These days, things couldn\u2019t be more different. On TikTok alone, videos tagged #ADHD have received 2bn views in the UK over the last year. But misinformation is also rife:one study determined that 52% of the clips on the platform contained misleading information. Here, a team of medical professionals and ADHD experts unpack what you need to know. What is ADHD and what causes it? ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the brain and nervous system, with symptoms of inattentiveness and/or impulsivity and hyperactivity that arise in childhood and may persist well into adulthood. It\u2019s believed to be the result of a complex combination of genetics and environmental factors. The condition is highly heritable. \u201cIt\u2019s thought to affect around 5% of children and around 3% of the adult population in the UK,\u201d says Prof Philip Asherson, the emeritus professor of neurodevelopmental psychiatry at King\u2019s College London. It\u2019s one of the most common disorders, alongside autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and can be classed as a disability under the Equality Act if it is severe enough to impair day-to-day life and work. The term \u201cdeficit\u201d can be slightly misleading. \u201cPeople think that people can\u2019t concentrate at all, which is not true,\u201d says Prof Amanda Kirby, the chair of ADHD Foundation. \u201cOften children and adults can hyperfocus on the things of high interest.\u201d Is ADHD being overdiagnosed? \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely not overdiagnosed,\u201d says Henry Shelford, the co-founder and CEO of ADHD UK. Though experts estimate that there are 2.6 million people with ADHD in the UK, based on Lancet and National Insitute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) incidence rates, only about 350,000 to 500,000 have received a formal diagnosis \u2013 which leaves two million out in the cold. What are some common symptoms of ADHD? Hyperactivity and impulsivity are the most obvious symptoms of ADHD to those on the outside. \u201cI have to hold myself still, and as I do so it feels like a volcano building in me,\u201d Shelford explains. Children might fidget constantly, talk excessively, get up to move around or bother their classmates. Adults may find more socially acceptable ways of channelling that restlessness, such as repeatedly touching their hair. People with ADHD can often make careless mistakes, regularly losing things and failing to pay close attention to details or following instructions. They often find it impossible to focus on certain tasks. They may lose hours to intense focus or have problems with managing their time. This time blindness could make them late for important occasions or fail to make deadlines. Conversely, it could also make them turn up incredibly early for occasions, as they can\u2019t accurately estimate how long it takes to do something. Doesn\u2019t everyone get a little distracted sometimes? \u201cTwo things mark out what might be potentially diagnosable from what is everyday,\u201d says Dr Max Davie, the co-founder of ADHD UK and co-host of the ADHD Science podcast. \u201cOne is that symptoms are present in all settings, and the other is that they\u2019re severe enough to cause functional impairment.\u201d If you are highly distractible all the time \u2013 not just when you\u2019re bored at work \u2013 and your symptoms are persistent and severe enough to impair your life, you may very well meet the clinical threshold for a diagnosis. If a child struggles to consistently listen or pay attention at school and home despite their best efforts and intentions, it may be a sign that they have ADHD. I saw on TikTok that sleeping like a \u2018flamingo\u2019 or a \u2018T rex\u2019 could be a good indicator you have ADHD TikTok has been hugely influential in spreading awareness of the condition but it certainly shouldn\u2019t be relied on as a formal diagnosis, especially given the widespread misinformation about symptoms. For instance, sleeping on your side with one leg curled up like a flamingo, or sleeping with your hands curled under your chin (\u201cT rex arms\u201d, as content creators call it) are widely claimed to be telltale signs \u2013 even though there is little to no scientific evidence that this is true. \u201cSocial media has some absolutely brilliant insight and some absolute nonsense,\u201d Shelford says. \u201cBut it can start a learning journey where people look up more information about ADHD and go, \u2018That explains so much.\u2019 That enlightenment is to be celebrated.\u201d Resources such as ADHD Foundation, ADDISS, AADD-UK and ADHD UK can help those looking for accurate and up-to-date information about the condition. Does ADHD present differently depending on your sex? Girls under the age of 18 with ADHD are three times less likely to be diagnosed, as they tend to present more inattentive and less hyperactive traits, and are therefore perceived as less disruptive. (The girl fidgeting subtly in the back of class doesn\u2019t get half as much attention as a boy who feels the urge to run out of school.) Experts emphasise there is still plenty of overlap between the two, though. \u201cPeople may not realise that you don\u2019t have to be badly behaved to have ADHD,\u201d says Asherson. \u201cI like to remind people that there are lots of boys who fit that female criterion as well.\u201d Women\u2019s symptoms may vary depending on their menstrual cycle. In the week before their period, \u201caligned with PMS, or possibly premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) if it\u2019s really severe, women\u2019s ADHD will worsen\u201d, says Dr James Kustow, a consultant psychiatrist and the author of How to Thrive With Adult ADHD. Symptoms may also worsen during perimenopause and menopause, prompting some to seek help for the first time. Scientists believe this may have to do with declining oestrogen levels, though this remains an understudied topic. Women also tend to be better at hiding or \u201cmasking\u201d their symptoms, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of anxiety or depression. Asherson says: \u201cThen they\u2019re presenting later and often not necessarily saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got ADHD,\u2019 but rather, \u2018I\u2019m worrying all the time.\u2019 Part of that could just be their thoughts jumping and flitting, thinking about all the difficulties in their life \u2013 that looks a lot like anxiety.\u201d I don\u2019t think I had ADHD as a kid, but I\u2019m really struggling now. What\u2019s happened? Depending on the severity of your symptoms, you may have slipped under the radar of your parents or teachers and were able to cobble together habits to help you cope and get by. But any major life event or upheaval \u2013 such as the pandemic or a high-pressure job \u2013 can undermine that internal scaffolding. For instance, Kustow sees many people asking for help at the end of first year of university. Becoming a parent might also be \u201creally destabilising for someone who struggles with executive function issues\u201d as they are unable to cope with the baby\u2019s unpredictable schedule. Others may start having debilitating issues with focus where they might not have before, as well as sleep problems and racing thoughts \u2013 which can often be misattributed to mental health issues like anxiety, depression or even bipolar disorder. How do I get a diagnosis if I think my child or I has ADHD? You can check your suspicions with a reputable online screening test, like this one on the ADHD UK website. \u201cBut ultimately, the only way to really know is to have a formal assessment,\u201d Shelford says. Talk to your GP about getting a referral for an adult assessment. If you suspect your child has ADHD, you should speak to their GP, as well as to their school about getting a referral to a specialist service. Shelford adds: \u201cIf you\u2019re in England, you\u2019ve got the option of Right to Choose, which is designed to help people escape the postcode lottery if they have a poor service in their local area.\u201d This means that you are legally entitled to an alternative provider. \u201cIt\u2019s an NHS assessment, it goes on the NHS record, you get NHS prescriptions.

It is at once personal and universal and not in any way hectoring. Meanwhile, Philippa Gregory\u2019s Normal Women is brilliantly researched and riveting; a vast story of how women of all kinds have participated in every sphere of our history. It is full of facts that I am ashamed not to have known. And Precipice by Robert Harris is top-notch writing. The author builds the tension of the looming first world war alongside the passionate extramarital love affair between the prime minister, Herbert Henry Asquith, and the much younger Venetia Stanley. Although much has changed for the better since those days, I couldn\u2019t help feeling nostalgic for a relatively unsurveilled daily life, and for politicians who could quote Browning and Shakespeare and speak and write in beautifully wrought sentences. \u2022 She Speaks! by Harriet Walter is published by Little, Brown (\u00a320).

They\u2019re such a great team both on and off the pitch, that\u2019s something we really admire of them and something they\u2019ve inspired us to do as an England team, after winning the Euros. \u201cWatching what they did, trying to change women\u2019s soccer in America, we had that opportunity in England as well, and we kind of both now bounce off each other in that respect off the pitch. We\u2019re friends, we\u2019re rivals, we\u2019re a community, but at the same time we still want to beat each other. With England and America it\u2019s always that high level of \u2018rivals\u2019 but \u2018respect\u2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "France is at risk of being plunged into fresh political turmoil as its minority government teeters on the brink of collapse amid opposition anger over a planned austerity budget. Reflecting growing unease in financial markets, French sovereign borrowing costs have risen sharply, reaching the highest premium over German bonds since the height of the eurozone debt crisis in 2012. At the heart of the dispute is the prime minister Michel Barnier\u2019s plans for a budget involving \u20ac60bn (\u00a350bn) of spending cuts and tax rises despite lacking a majority in parliament, leading to threats from the French far-right leader, Marine Le Pen, to topple the government. On Thursday, Barnier made a key concession by dropping plans to raise a tax on electricity. But while the far-right National Rally president, Jordan Bardella, claimed a \u201cvictory\u201d over the step, he warned \u201cother red lines remain\u201d. What is happening in markets? On Wednesday the gap between French sovereign borrowing costs and those of Germany widened to as much as 90 basis points, the biggest split since 2012. Shares on the Paris stock exchange also tumbled. The yield \u2013 in effect the interest rate \u2013 on 10-year French government bonds briefly rose above those of Greece for the first time on Thursday amid investor concerns that the government falling could trigger a fresh period of political chaos. Later on Thursday the yield on French bonds fell back slightly after the finance minister, Antoine Armand, said the government was ready to make some concessions over the budget. What is France\u2019s budget plan? After snap elections held by Emmanuel Macron this summer, the new minority government is under pressure to steady the public finances from the EU and financial markets after warning that its budget deficit \u2013 the gap between spending and tax income \u2013 would exceed 6% of gross domestic product (GDP) this year. Last month Barnier announced cuts for welfare, health, pensions and local governments, as well as tax rises, including the restoration of a levy on electricity consumption that was suspended in the energy crisis. Under the plan, borrowing could be cut to 5% of GDP next year, but without that action it could reach almost 7%. That would be more than double a 3% limit in the EU\u2019s stability and growth pact, which is designed to ensure member states pursue \u201csound public finances\u201d and coordinate their tax and spending plans. Brussels has placed France under an \u201cexcessive deficit\u201d monitoring process. While several others are in this position \u2013 including Belgium, Italy and Poland \u2013 investors fear France could maintain unsustainable plans. Why have borrowing levels risen? Borrowing rose sharply after the Covid pandemic and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine triggered a global inflation shock, as the government stepped in to protect households and businesses, while weaker economic activity sapped tax receipts. However, analysts also said tax cuts launched by Macron under his reformist agenda to inject more free-market dynamism into the French economy had undermined the stability of public finances. L\u00e9o Barincou, a senior economist at the advisory firm Oxford Economics, said: \u201cThe key reason for the current precarious fiscal situation really has to do with unfunded tax cuts under Macron.\u201d Viewed as a business-friendly centrist, the former Rothschild banker\u2019s economic agenda included discretionary tax cuts adding up to \u20ac65bn since 2017, which have not been matched by equivalent cuts in public spending. The headline rate of corporate tax was cut from 33% to 25%, while a \u201csolidarity tax\u201d on wealth, levied on assets above \u20ac1.31m, was replaced with a far lower 30% tax on capital gains from interest and dividends. However, tax as a share of national income \u2013 despite having come down in recent years \u2013 remains at the highest level in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Spending is also at the highest level in the group of 38 rich countries. Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at the research firm Capital Economics, said France faced long-term problems, including pension spending at 15% of GDP, and a \u201cpolitical culture which makes expenditure cuts difficult\u201d. In addition to structural challenges, France has faced continued weak household consumption \u2013 suppressing VAT receipts \u2013 while local government spending had been higher than expected. What happens if the government is brought down? Barnier has said toppling the government could cause a \u201cbig storm and very serious turbulence\u201d in financial markets. Some commentators warn France is heading for a Greek-style debt crisis, referencing the near implosion of the eurozone in 2012, when Athens was forced to seek a bailout from the EU and International Monetary Fund. \u201cComparisons with Greece are completely overblown,\u201d Kenningham said. \u201cFrance has major fiscal problems but is not going to default or cause a huge eurozone crisis anytime soon.\u201d Some observers say a compromise is likely, suggesting that although Barnier\u2019s proposals are unpopular, his critics would struggle to come up with alternative plans if they brought down the government.

      "body": "<p>As you look down on a patch of ground in a pleasant neighbourhood in Calais, a large number of creamy grey boulders are visible. Squeezed in between these enormous rocks are dozens of frayed tents. Smoke from wood fires floats in the air as groups of men and boys walk around laughing and talking in the morning sunshine, sharing clementines and cigarettes.</p> <p>The tent dwellers are asylum seekers hoping to travel by dinghy across the Channel to the UK. Most on this site only arrived in Calais in the past week or two and none expect to be staying long. But now they must contend with not just the civic authorities in this seaside town but the might of both the British and French states.</p> <p>Beyond the boulders, which were placed there deliberately by the French authorities to prevent the asylum seekers from having anywhere to rest their heads, their movements are restricted by concrete blocks, high fences and barbed wire. Much of Calais\u2019s hostile street architecture is the result of an agreement under which the UK has paid the French government hundreds of millions of pounds to deter those who come here from the world\u2019s conflict zones. Most recently, in March 2023 the UK agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/10/uk-fund-immigration-detention-centre-france-rishi-sunak\">hand over \u00a3500m</a> to France to help fund a detention centre to \u201cstop the boats\u201d. </p> <p>Everyone on this stretch of coast knows that crossing the Channel by small boat is a life-threatening undertaking. When the Guardian visited last weekend, gale-force winds, driving rain and an arctic chill prevented crossings. Sunday 24 November was the third anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/24/several-people-dead-migrant-boat-capsizes-channel\">worst mass drowning</a> in the Channel since small-boat crossings began at scale in 2018; 27 people lost their lives and four remain missing. The deaths happened in the middle of the Channel despite repeated SOS calls to French and UK coastguards by those on board. </p>    <p>Even without any disasters on the level of November 2021, 2024 has been the deadliest year since these crossings began. Sometimes deaths are <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/region/europe?region_incident=All&amp;route=3896&amp;incident_date%5Bmin%5D=&amp;incident_date%5Bmax%5D=\">reported</a> every few days. According to the UN\u2019s migration agency, the International Organisation for Migration, <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/region/europe?region_incident=All&amp;route=3896&amp;incident_date%5Bmin%5D=2024-01-01&amp;incident_date%5Bmax%5D=2024-11-28\">75 people</a> so far this year have died or gone missing in the Channel, more than triple the 24 in 2023 and almost five times as many as the 16 in 2022.</p> <p>But the number of crossings remains high. So far this year more than 33,000 people have crossed, more than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/26/small-boats-channel-crossings-figures-labour-home-office\">29,437 last year</a> but less than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/07/what-does-the-uk-governments-migration-bill-propose\">45,755 in 2022</a>.</p> <p>Associations supporting the asylum seekers say that they are becoming more stretched as funding dwindles and the French government tries to prevent them distributing food, drinking water and warm clothing. But enough supplies are getting through to keep people alive, and somehow the asylum seekers stitch together a threadbare existence.</p> <p>On Sunday the mood among the rocks is buoyant and relaxed. The temperature is about 10C higher it was than the previous day, although the wind is fierce. The dozens living here are mostly Syrians, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/25/inside-story-of-manston-detention-centre\">Kuwaiti Bidoons \u2013 stateless people</a> \u2013 and Iraqis, although the nationalities of those moving in and out change frequently. The men, mostly young, are friendly. One of them hugs a 17-year-old Kuwaiti Bidoon boy with a black eye and bruising to his face. The boy laughs and smiles and shrugs off his injuries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no country that will let me sit, just sit. I want freedom and I believe the UK is the country where I can find it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe police in Serbia did this to me when I was crossing the border,\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t consider himself to be a victim, preferring instead to focus his energy on getting to the UK. \u201cIn Kuwait no passports for Bidoon, no school, no hospital, police beat us. I had to leave,\u201d he says.</p> <p>A man from Iraq mentions matter-of-factly: \u201cTomorrow the police will come to evict our site. We get evicted about once every 48 hours.\u201d</p> <p>A Bidoon man from Kuwait adds: \u201cOne year ago I left Kuwait. I survived crossing the desert and I can cope with the living conditions here. But the French police are our biggest problem. They are very hard to deal with. They beat us.\u201d</p> <p>The mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, accuses the UK of having lax labour laws, which she says attract asylum seekers in northern France. In fact, safety and reuniting with family are the reasons cited by many for choosing the UK as their destination. If anyone does try to work illegally, their wages are usually a fraction of the minimum wage; exploitation is rife and the chances of being caught are high.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no country that will let me sit, just sit,\u201d says one man. \u201cI want freedom and I believe the UK is the country where I can find it.\u201d</p>    <p>Ali, from Lebanon, worked for international fashion chains in his home country before the conflict there forced him to flee. \u201cGovernments don\u2019t like refugees,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it is these same governments that cause wars that make refugees run away. If these countries want to stop the refugees, they need to stop the wars. The land in my country is amazing, it is beautiful; without war I would never leave it. All we want is to live like normal people \u2013 to eat, sleep and work the way they do. We do not want to be rich and we do not want to commit crimes. Nobody makes a choice to be a refugee.\u201d</p> <p>Lawyers, human rights campaigners and the asylum seekers themselves lay the blame for the increased death toll this year squarely at the door of the French and UK governments. The UK\u2019s Home Office sends out a steady stream of press releases trumpeting its successes in its pledge to stop refugees travelling to the Kent coast \u2013 a smuggler or two arrested here, a consignment of dinghies or life jackets seized there \u2013 but the numbers that cross when the weather permits suggest the UK government is a long way from putting the smugglers out of business. Meanwhile, the enforcement activity the UK pays the French to carry out has made the crossings even more dangerous. French police intercept dinghies trying to leave beaches along the coast more proactively, firing tear gas and slashing boats.</p> <p>The horrifying increase in deaths this year does not seem to have altered the fatalism of many asylum seekers. They have already risked and lost almost everything since leaving home. They are not going to crumple at what they see as the final staging post on their arduous journey. And the ability of the smugglers to evolve appears boundless. Because more boats have been seized, smugglers pack the remaining dinghies ever fuller; as police patrols on beaches increase, smugglers use beaches further along the coast in places such as Le Havre, making the crossings longer and more dangerous.</p> <p>If a new conflict springs up somewhere in the world, it is likely that refugees fleeing that conflict will arrive in Calais six to 12 months later.

      "bodyText": "As you look down on a patch of ground in a pleasant neighbourhood in Calais, a large number of creamy grey boulders are visible. Squeezed in between these enormous rocks are dozens of frayed tents. Smoke from wood fires floats in the air as groups of men and boys walk around laughing and talking in the morning sunshine, sharing clementines and cigarettes. The tent dwellers are asylum seekers hoping to travel by dinghy across the Channel to the UK. Most on this site only arrived in Calais in the past week or two and none expect to be staying long. But now they must contend with not just the civic authorities in this seaside town but the might of both the British and French states. Beyond the boulders, which were placed there deliberately by the French authorities to prevent the asylum seekers from having anywhere to rest their heads, their movements are restricted by concrete blocks, high fences and barbed wire. Much of Calais\u2019s hostile street architecture is the result of an agreement under which the UK has paid the French government hundreds of millions of pounds to deter those who come here from the world\u2019s conflict zones. Most recently, in March 2023 the UK agreed to hand over \u00a3500m to France to help fund a detention centre to \u201cstop the boats\u201d. Everyone on this stretch of coast knows that crossing the Channel by small boat is a life-threatening undertaking. When the Guardian visited last weekend, gale-force winds, driving rain and an arctic chill prevented crossings. Sunday 24 November was the third anniversary of the worst mass drowning in the Channel since small-boat crossings began at scale in 2018; 27 people lost their lives and four remain missing. The deaths happened in the middle of the Channel despite repeated SOS calls to French and UK coastguards by those on board. Even without any disasters on the level of November 2021, 2024 has been the deadliest year since these crossings began. Sometimes deaths are reported every few days. According to the UN\u2019s migration agency, the International Organisation for Migration, 75 people so far this year have died or gone missing in the Channel, more than triple the 24 in 2023 and almost five times as many as the 16 in 2022. But the number of crossings remains high. So far this year more than 33,000 people have crossed, more than the 29,437 last year but less than the 45,755 in 2022. Associations supporting the asylum seekers say that they are becoming more stretched as funding dwindles and the French government tries to prevent them distributing food, drinking water and warm clothing. But enough supplies are getting through to keep people alive, and somehow the asylum seekers stitch together a threadbare existence. On Sunday the mood among the rocks is buoyant and relaxed. The temperature is about 10C higher it was than the previous day, although the wind is fierce. The dozens living here are mostly Syrians, Kuwaiti Bidoons \u2013 stateless people \u2013 and Iraqis, although the nationalities of those moving in and out change frequently. The men, mostly young, are friendly. One of them hugs a 17-year-old Kuwaiti Bidoon boy with a black eye and bruising to his face. The boy laughs and smiles and shrugs off his injuries. \u201cThe police in Serbia did this to me when I was crossing the border,\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t consider himself to be a victim, preferring instead to focus his energy on getting to the UK. \u201cIn Kuwait no passports for Bidoon, no school, no hospital, police beat us. I had to leave,\u201d he says. A man from Iraq mentions matter-of-factly: \u201cTomorrow the police will come to evict our site. We get evicted about once every 48 hours.\u201d A Bidoon man from Kuwait adds: \u201cOne year ago I left Kuwait. I survived crossing the desert and I can cope with the living conditions here. But the French police are our biggest problem. They are very hard to deal with. They beat us.\u201d The mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, accuses the UK of having lax labour laws, which she says attract asylum seekers in northern France. In fact, safety and reuniting with family are the reasons cited by many for choosing the UK as their destination. If anyone does try to work illegally, their wages are usually a fraction of the minimum wage; exploitation is rife and the chances of being caught are high. \u201cThere is no country that will let me sit, just sit,\u201d says one man. \u201cI want freedom and I believe the UK is the country where I can find it.\u201d Ali, from Lebanon, worked for international fashion chains in his home country before the conflict there forced him to flee. \u201cGovernments don\u2019t like refugees,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it is these same governments that cause wars that make refugees run away. If these countries want to stop the refugees, they need to stop the wars. The land in my country is amazing, it is beautiful; without war I would never leave it. All we want is to live like normal people \u2013 to eat, sleep and work the way they do. We do not want to be rich and we do not want to commit crimes. Nobody makes a choice to be a refugee.\u201d Lawyers, human rights campaigners and the asylum seekers themselves lay the blame for the increased death toll this year squarely at the door of the French and UK governments. The UK\u2019s Home Office sends out a steady stream of press releases trumpeting its successes in its pledge to stop refugees travelling to the Kent coast \u2013 a smuggler or two arrested here, a consignment of dinghies or life jackets seized there \u2013 but the numbers that cross when the weather permits suggest the UK government is a long way from putting the smugglers out of business. Meanwhile, the enforcement activity the UK pays the French to carry out has made the crossings even more dangerous. French police intercept dinghies trying to leave beaches along the coast more proactively, firing tear gas and slashing boats. The horrifying increase in deaths this year does not seem to have altered the fatalism of many asylum seekers. They have already risked and lost almost everything since leaving home. They are not going to crumple at what they see as the final staging post on their arduous journey. And the ability of the smugglers to evolve appears boundless. Because more boats have been seized, smugglers pack the remaining dinghies ever fuller; as police patrols on beaches increase, smugglers use beaches further along the coast in places such as Le Havre, making the crossings longer and more dangerous. If a new conflict springs up somewhere in the world, it is likely that refugees fleeing that conflict will arrive in Calais six to 12 months later. Few asylum seekers waiting to cross engage with the day-to-day ebb and flow of political pronouncements in the UK about stopping the boats or smashing the smugglers. In fact the dreams of finding sanctuary in the UK date back decades, to before the advent of the hostile environment. Many know that claiming asylum here is no picnic, but somehow they cling on to a belief that the UK is the apex of civilisation, common decency and human rights. On Saturday afternoon, the UK charity Care4Calais is doing an outdoor drop-in, distributing clothes, hot drinks and snacks, and providing haircuts, music and board games.

      "bodyText": "Louise Haigh was advised to resign by No 10 for a possible breach of the ministerial code, after she did not declare her spent conviction for fraud to the government when she became a cabinet minister. Multiple sources said Morgan McSweeney, Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff, delivered the message to the UK transport secretary on Thursday night that it would be best for her to resign. They said Haigh had not declared the 2014 conviction for wrongly reporting a mobile phone stolen to the police, because she was asked only about unspent offences. She had pleaded guilty to fraud by misrepresentation and received a conditional discharge. Three sources said Haigh had told Starmer about the conviction when she became shadow Northern Ireland secretary in 2020. However, Starmer\u2019s official spokesperson refused to confirm on Friday whether the prime minister knew about the conviction at any point. In a briefing with reporters, the spokesperson repeated the same line that \u201cfollowing further information emerging, the prime minister has accepted Louise Haigh\u2019s resignation\u201d. In a series of bizarre exchanges, the spokesperson gave the same scripted line when asked what the prime minister knew about Haigh\u2019s spent conviction, what further information had emerged, and why he had appointed her to cabinet if he knew about the offence. Pressed on what she declared, the spokesperson said there were \u201cclear rules around declarations\u201d that meant ministers must give a full account in writing of private interests that might give rise to a conflict, actual or perceived. He also stressed that ministers must adhere to the seven Nolan principles of ethical standards in public life. A No 10 source said they did not feel that Haigh disclosed the full details to Starmer in opposition, and that it was not declared to the government when she became a minister. Her departure was more to do with a failure to be fully open than the original offence, they said. Sky News had reported on Thursday two sources saying Haigh had made the report to police in order to gain an upgraded mobile phone from her employer, while the Times reported that Haigh was put under investigation by her then employer, Aviva, over another phone reported missing. However, a source close to Haigh said it was \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d that she had reported it missing to get an upgrade, and that it had been an honest mistake. They said she had come fully clean to Starmer about the episode when he appointed her as shadow Northern Ireland secretary and he was very supportive of her at that point. However, she did not declare it to the government when she became transport secretary, because she was asked only about unspent convictions. She is understood to have spoken to Starmer on Thursday night before McSweeney made clear to her it was best for her to resign. Haigh quit the cabinet on Friday morning with a letter to Starmer saying that \u201cwhatever the facts of the matter, this issue will inevitably be a distraction from delivering the work of this government\u201d. In a statement, Haigh said that while she was working for Aviva in her mid-20s, she was mugged while on a night out. She gave police a list of items missing from her handbag, including her work phone, which she thought had been stolen. Haigh was issued with a new phone but when she subsequently found her old work phone and turned it on, the police called her in for questioning. In her letter to the prime minister published on Friday morning, Haigh said not informing Aviva straight away that she had found her missing work phone \u201cwas a mistake\u201d. Accepting her resignation, Starmer thanked Haigh for her work and \u201chuge strides to take our rail system back into public ownership\u201d. \u201cI know you still have a huge contribution to make in the future,\u201d he wrote. Downing Street later named the Swindon South MP Heidi Alexander as the new transport secretary, replacing Haigh. Haigh, 37, who was the youngest person appointed to Starmer\u2019s cabinet, has become the first person to leave it five months after Labour\u2019s election landslide. She thanked Starmer for his support in her resignation letter and said she took \u201cgreat pride\u201d in what Labour had achieved since the election. She said she was \u201ctotally committed to our political project\u201d but believed \u201cit will be best served by my supporting you from outside government\u201d. \u201cI am sorry to leave under these circumstances, but I take pride in what we have done. I will continue to fight every day for the people of Sheffield Heeley who I was first and foremost elected to represent and to ensure that the rest of our programme is delivered in full,\u201d she wrote.",

One item bucking the trend was a necklace with a \u201cD\u201d initial that the costume designer had specially made \u2013 costing \u00a370, more than all the rest put together.

      "body": "<p>Amid renewed concern over the millions of people in England who cannot get NHS dental care, and a warning that the current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/27/plans-to-end-nhs-dental-care-crisis-not-working-warns-spending-watchdog\">\u201cdental recovery plan\u201d will not work</a>, ministers are drawing up their own proposals to tackle what is widely agreed to be a crisis.</p> <p>Here experts set out four ideas for how to revive NHS dentistry and help patients get the care they need without paying for it privately, as many are having to do now, or undertaking \u201cDIY dentistry\u201d, such as pulling their rotten teeth themselves.</p> <h2>1 A GP-style right to register with an NHS dentist</h2> <p>Patients used to have a right to register with, and be treated by, an NHS dentist, in the same way that they could, and still can, with a GP surgery. That right was removed in 2006.</p> <p>The guaranteed access system was replaced with one where, under a new dental contract, dentists were paid by \u201cunit of dental activity\u201d (UDA) \u2013 care and treatment \u2013 rather than being paid an agreed sum in lieu of the care they provided when needed to every person registered with them.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are also confused about the relationship between an NHS dentist and patients, with many mistakenly believing they can register with a dentist permanently \u2013 a right they lost in 2006 when the current contract was introduced,\u201d explains Louise Ansari, the chief executive of Healthwatch England, the NHS patient watchdog.</p> <p>\u201cWe urge the government to base their plans to improve NHS dentistry on the principle of giving people the right to register permanently with a dental practice, as they do with an NHS GP. This will help them access ongoing appointments and checkups and ensure continuity of care from a trusted professional,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>The change in 2006 is a key reason for the loss of general access to NHS dental care, and so it is time to go back to the old system, Ansari believes.</p> <h2>2 Fewer checkups</h2> <p>Traditionally, dentists have usually suggested that patients come back every six months for a checkup of their teeth and gums. However, Mark Dayan, a policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust health thinktank, says such regular checkups are unnecessary. If the gap between appointments was widened \u2013 to one or even two years \u2013 dentists would have more time to provide more NHS-funded care and patients would not suffer, as emerging problems with their teeth would not be missed, he says.</p> <p>\u201cTraditionally, NHS dentists have by default asked people to come back for a checkup every six months. But a review of the evidence by the expert body Nice found that a gap as long as two years was perfectly safe for many adults.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/08/number-of-children-having-rotten-teeth-extracted-in-english-hospitals-rises-17\">Number of children having rotten teeth extracted in English hospitals rises 17%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is an appalling shortage of dental care, with many people going without NHS checkups at all.

      "bodyText": "Amid renewed concern over the millions of people in England who cannot get NHS dental care, and a warning that the current \u201cdental recovery plan\u201d will not work, ministers are drawing up their own proposals to tackle what is widely agreed to be a crisis. Here experts set out four ideas for how to revive NHS dentistry and help patients get the care they need without paying for it privately, as many are having to do now, or undertaking \u201cDIY dentistry\u201d, such as pulling their rotten teeth themselves. 1 A GP-style right to register with an NHS dentist Patients used to have a right to register with, and be treated by, an NHS dentist, in the same way that they could, and still can, with a GP surgery. That right was removed in 2006. The guaranteed access system was replaced with one where, under a new dental contract, dentists were paid by \u201cunit of dental activity\u201d (UDA) \u2013 care and treatment \u2013 rather than being paid an agreed sum in lieu of the care they provided when needed to every person registered with them. \u201cPeople are also confused about the relationship between an NHS dentist and patients, with many mistakenly believing they can register with a dentist permanently \u2013 a right they lost in 2006 when the current contract was introduced,\u201d explains Louise Ansari, the chief executive of Healthwatch England, the NHS patient watchdog. \u201cWe urge the government to base their plans to improve NHS dentistry on the principle of giving people the right to register permanently with a dental practice, as they do with an NHS GP. This will help them access ongoing appointments and checkups and ensure continuity of care from a trusted professional,\u201d she adds. The change in 2006 is a key reason for the loss of general access to NHS dental care, and so it is time to go back to the old system, Ansari believes. 2 Fewer checkups Traditionally, dentists have usually suggested that patients come back every six months for a checkup of their teeth and gums. However, Mark Dayan, a policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust health thinktank, says such regular checkups are unnecessary. If the gap between appointments was widened \u2013 to one or even two years \u2013 dentists would have more time to provide more NHS-funded care and patients would not suffer, as emerging problems with their teeth would not be missed, he says. \u201cTraditionally, NHS dentists have by default asked people to come back for a checkup every six months. But a review of the evidence by the expert body Nice found that a gap as long as two years was perfectly safe for many adults. \u201cThere is an appalling shortage of dental care, with many people going without NHS checkups at all. NHS England has already started to raise these flexibilities. But in order to free up dentists\u2019 time, there is a good case for them to say more clearly that people should be told to wait at least a year unless they have a particular problem, and two years in many cases,\u201d says Dayan. Such a radical change would need to be accompanied by a public information campaign that seeks to reassure the public that one or two years is a safe interval between recall appointments for those who have healthy teeth, he adds. 3 Ditch the dental contract There is widespread consensus that the current dental contact, between the government and dentists in England, is unfit for purpose and needs to be replaced. Both Labour and the Conservatives agree, as did the Commons health select committee in the last parliament, the Nuffield Trust and the British Dental Association (BDA), which represents dentists and has called for radical change for some time. The BDA thinks it is absurd and unhelpful that under the current contract \u201can NHS dentist is paid the same whether they deliver three fillings or 20. This means they are punished for taking on high-needs patients \u2013 the people who need NHS dentistry the most \u2013 and can end up delivering NHS treatment at a financial loss for doing so. \u201cThe system offers no reward for prevention. The amount of dentistry an NHS dentist [can do] is capped under this system. If you fail to hit your targets \u2013 often as a result of unfilled vacancies \u2013 you face financial penalties, [but] try to do more and you won\u2019t get paid.\u201d The BDA wants to see a system that would focus on preventing people\u2019s teeth decaying in the first place, and give extra support to those with the poorest oral health. This is broadly the same as what Lord Darzi recommended in his review of the NHS in September. 4 Overhaul the funding of NHS dental care NHS dental care is so dysfunctional that some of the budget to pay for the care patients receive goes unspent, because of the reduction in NHS treatment being provided, as the National Audit Office recognised in its report on Wednesday. Units of dental activity are the main problem, says Dayan. \u201cNHS dentists are currently paid for each unit of activity they do \u2013 with one unit for a checkup, three for a filling, and so on. \u201cThis is very simplistic, given how different patients are, and means dentists are penalised for tackling the most difficult problems because they get no more money for them. It means dental practices actually lose out on funding if they keep people well so that they don\u2019t need treatment.\u201d Instead, he suggests, dentists should be paid on the basis of a \u201ccapitation model\u201d, whereby they would receive a set sum to cover the costs of treating their local population.

Policymakers also released the results of their first stress test into the shadow banking sector. It found that hedge funds, pension funds and other companies in the largely unregulated sector were at risk of amplifying market shocks and triggering a \u00a317bn asset sell-off. The exercise, the first in the world by a central bank, tracked how non-bank financial institutions \u2013 often referred to as the shadow banking sector \u2013 would react in a short and sharp shock affecting financial markets. The stress test showed that in this scenario, companies would rapidly sell off as much as \u00a317bn worth of assets, as they scrambled to recapitalise or limit their activities, in a way that would \u201camplify the shock\u201d. There are concerns that risks are emerging in the shadow banking sector that could echo the problems experienced in the financial sector in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The Bank\u2019s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), said that while industry standards had increased the resilience of companies in some corners of the shadow banking industry \u2013 including insurers, money market funds and liability-driven investing funds \u2013 a lack of regulation meant that resilience was shaky and could deteriorate over time. Shadow banking refers to financial firms that face little to no regulation compared with traditional lenders, and includes businesses such as hedge funds, private credit and private equity funds. More than 50 City institutions took part in the exercise, including insurers, clearing houses, asset managers, pension fundsand hedge funds. The PRA said it would start paring back its annual banking stress tests, which were introduced in 2015 to check if banks would be able to withstand a major shock akin to the 2008 crash. It will now run those tests once every two years, in order to alleviate the burden on banks that it believes are now strong enough to require slightly less oversight. The Bank will supplement those bi-annual exercises with \u201cexploratory\u201d exercises testing resilience to a wider range of risks that could include another climate review. The Bank also warned on Friday that higher trade barriers could hit global growth and feed uncertainty about inflation, potentially causing volatility in financial markets. The Bank said the financial system could also be hit by disruption to cross-border capital flows and a reduced ability to diversify risk, although it stopped short of directly referring to Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House, which is expected to affect global trade. \u201cA reduction in the degree of international policy cooperation could hinder progress by authorities in improving the resilience of the financial system and its ability to absorb future shocks,\u201d the Bank said.",

But having experienced a resurgence in the fashion sphere, down jackets are not just a practical purchase \u2013 they\u2019re a fashion statement too. When it comes to design, style and feel, the puffer world is your oyster. Indeed, they come in more shapes and sizes \u2013 and guises \u2013 than ever before, and with a range of smart technology to match. Take Uniqlo, for instance \u2013 there\u2019s a vast assortment of styles and colours across its three down ranges: Seamless, Puffertech and Hybrid. But with so many options available, how do you know which one to choose? Here\u2019s a breakdown of Uniqlo\u2019s down coat collection to help you find the perfect puffer jacket this winter \u2026 Seamless The tech High performance, the Seamless down is windproof, water-repellent and lightweight, covering you for all eventualities. Uniqlo uses thermal bonding instead of stitching to keep out the cold air which, as the name suggests, means there are no seams, and zips are also waterproof. The focus here is on performance and keeping the elements out. The look Classic. Available in long and short styles, the Seamless down range brings an ease and gentle fashion edge to a longstanding design that has been built for all that the weather has to throw at you \u2013 plus it\u2019s lightweight. Padding comes quilted in a thick rib, which makes the design feel modern and smart. Wear it for The great outdoors \u2013 this is your down classic. Opt for the longer lengths, available for both men and women, for ultimate protection. Puffertech The tech Puffertech is an alternative to down and uses Japanese fibre technology to mimic the air-trapping mechanism of feathers for warmth. Depending on the style, it features either high-performance padding with hollow yarn to trap the air for extra warmth or comes with padding inside. A water-repellent finish and double-weave also prevent the elements from getting in. Compact versions can be rolled up and stored for extra ease and flexibility \u2013 ideal for travel. The look If you want a down coat that doesn\u2019t look like your typical puffer jacket but leans into the prevailing gorpcore trend \u2013 wearing functional outdoor wear in a fashionable way \u2013 these come in a host of styles that riff on streetwear-meets-countryside dressing. For women, there is the parka, the relaxed jacket, and compact jacket, all of which feature quilting in either diamond or strip formation. They feel easy and lowkey, but pragmatic. Non-quilted coats, meanwhile, have a more utilitarian feel. For men, hoods and collars provide alternative options \u2013 as does a more voluminous style of parka. Wear it when Day to day when you need flexibility and want to nod to trends. For men, the quilted and compact designs lean into fashion\u2019s current fascination with field jackets, as does the non-quilted coat for women. Hybrid The tech The Uniqlo Hybrid down range is a collaboration with the Japanese competitive snowboarder Ayumu Hirano. Key features include lightweight, high-performance cotton padding with heat absorption technology, and flexible styling features that enable the coat to be worn in various ways. The Hybrid down range is designed to offer a balance between warmth and ease of movement, making it a versatile choice. The look More of a smart coat than a typical outdoorsy down jacket \u2013 without sacrificing the qualities needed for the latter. For men, longer lengths with a fuzzy or removable hood, a duffle coat design or a bomber style are all on trend this season; while women can opt for an elegant non-quilt design with big fleece-lined pockets and an adjustable waist for the option of a more fitted shape that works well to give an overall strong sense of style.

      "body": "<p>As a wise man once said: winter is coming. The wisest among us make preparations for this fact. And one of the most crucial of all is the coat you opt for. How you shield yourself from the elements is going to determine your comfort and health through the season, so getting it right is make or break. I mean, how many of us have suffered a harsh and unforgiving winter\u2019s night having to clutch ourselves because our coat doesn\u2019t come with a zip, or having to hunchback under it, our backs exposed and drenched, because we\u2019re walking around without a hood?</p> \n<p>The smartest options for a winter coat come well padded and protective, and Uniqlo\u2019s down jackets are among the most practical and stylish, and give you the best bang for your buck \u2013 plus, handily, they come with zips and the option of hoods as, to be honest, should be government mandated. But while Uniqlo\u2019s range of options make it straightforward to find the perfect fit for you, choosing between them might be overwhelming. Luckily for you, here\u2019s a guide to help you get it right.</p> \n<p><strong>1 Are you down? <br></strong>If so, how down? Check the padding of your jacket: Uniqlo uses a mix of either down and feathers or a synthetic blend. Out of the three, down tends to be better at trapping heat, while feathers add weight, so check the ratio. The premium down collection, 90% down and 10% feather, might keep you that teeny bit warmer. Or maybe you want that weighted blanket feeling on the go \u2013 so select based on your needs. The Puffertech coats have zero down, tend to be sturdier and more resistant to water, so are good for a rainy trip. And if you\u2019re concerned by the ethics of the down, Uniqlo uses only responsibly sourced down and feathers from RDS (<a href=\"https://textileexchange.org/responsible-down-standard/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Responsible Down Standard</a>) garment factories to protect and enhance the welfare of geese and ducks.</p> \n<p><strong>2 The power of fill compels you<br></strong>It\u2019s true that it\u2019s not the size that counts, so instead of looking for the biggest, puffiest jacket, a good pro tip to gauge its warmth is to check out a down jacket\u2019s fill power. The higher the number, the better it is at trapping air, and therefore greater at insulating you. Fill power is typically rated between 300 and 900 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/women/outerwear/down?path=%2C%2C83799%2C&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=BMK_UK_fw24_prospecting_Down_5_things_to_consider\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uniqlo\u2019s down jackets</a> tend to sit at about 750, which is considered premium fill power, so you know you\u2019ll be snug.</p> \n<p><strong>3 What\u2019s on the outside matters too<br></strong>And contrary to popular belief, it\u2019s not just what\u2019s on the inside that counts. Check what each jacket is made of on its outer layer to make sure it\u2019s sturdy enough for your needs. Consider your lifestyle \u2013 all of the elements you\u2019ll need that jacket to protect you from. Most of Uniqlo\u2019s jackets use a blend of different materials for durability, but if you\u2019re expecting to spend a considerable time outside, it might be wise to go a step further by selecting a jacket with a water-repellent finish, a coating that all of Uniqlo\u2019s down jackets come with.</p> \n<p><strong>4 Is it snug enough?<br></strong>Make sure you think about the weight of the jacket too. If you\u2019re expecting to be freezing, it\u2019ll make most sense to bundle up in the thickest and heaviest jacket \u2013 for example, Uniqlo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E469898-000/00?colorDisplayCode=09&amp;sizeDisplayCode=003&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=BMK_UK_fw24_prospecting_Down_5_things_to_consider\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seamless down long coat</a>. But if you need something light and easy for the transitional seasons or for backpacking, Uniqlo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E469869-000/00?colorDisplayCode=69&amp;sizeDisplayCode=003&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=BMK_UK_fw24_prospecting_Down_5_things_to_consider\" rel=\"nofollow\">ultra light down</a> is perfect, as it can even be rolled up into a nifty little pouch. Or you might want to experiment with layering coats, which might, again, sway you towards something lightweight, or, alternatively, make you opt for a Puffertech coat, which usefully doubles as both a cool jacket and a snug inner layer you can wear under another coat, too.</p> \n<p><strong>5 How does it look?<br></strong>Within each jacket type is a collection with a range of lengths \u2013 cropped, vest, short, boxy, long \u2013 and often the option of a hood, so there\u2019s a super-handy, readymade customisability for your needs and body type.

Albeit such items are often a fleeting trend, but there are some that have proved their worth so well that they can withstand changing tastes with impressive resilience. One such indispensable item is the down coat, which \u2013 along with its siblings the down vest and the down jacket \u2013 is a certified winter wardrobe staple. That status is thanks in no small part to the technical wizardry of Uniqlo. It\u2019s hard to name a clothing category in which the Japanese brand doesn\u2019t excel, but surely it is best loved in Britain for its revolutionary ultra light down, a super slimline padding that keeps you well and truly toasty without adding excess bulk or making movement difficult. It\u2019s amazing as outerwear in its own right, but it\u2019s also the style set\u2019s secret to making a transitional piece such as a trench, a leather jacket or even a blazer work in the winter months too. Whether traditional feathers or technically made, the comfort and warmth of down has been embraced by nearly every demographic, from tiny tots to older generations, so when it comes to achieving the look that you want, intention is everything. First things first, you need to find the coat that\u2019s right for you. Details such as diamond, linear or even seamless down quilting all create different looks \u2013 the Seamless down, for instance, allows for greater water resistance than traditional stitched pockets. But what\u2019s really important is that the shape, fit and length of the coat are right for your own size and proportions, as well as how you like to dress. Next comes the art of layering. A key rule to remember if you want to achieve a put together look rather than something more throw-on-and-go, is to let the coat take the lead, meaning using its length, style and shape to inform the other items in your ensemble. Puffertech, for instance, looks great layered over a more relaxed outfit such as a vibrant cashmere turtleneck and jeans. Take the look to the next level with an oversized fleece cardigan, layered on top of a simple white T-shirt, and wear the jacket open, should the weather allow. A wide pair of trousers will balance the bulkiness of the top half, but if a fully relaxed fit isn\u2019t for you, consider a barrel leg cut for a more defined shape. A sportier style coat will, of course, work brilliantly with sleek and comfortable athleisure, but, somewhat surprisingly, sophisticated pieces create a counterbalance that feels very modern. In womenswear terms, think a tailored skirt and blouse, while men can turn to traditional tailoring to achieve the look, opting for a lightweight but warm knit instead of a classic cotton shirt for a sophisticated look. The down vest has graduated from a useful layer to outerwear in its own right, and has benefited from a bit of a glow-up to boot. On women, a cropped, boxy shape looks great worn with a swishy skirt and chunky knit. While men can experiment with layering a vest under a jacket in order to achieve a more directional look. Accessories are always a fun way of keeping things fresh when it comes to styling, which will really help come the seemingly interminable last stretch of winter when it feels like you\u2019ve worn the same items forever. Bright colours or pastels will pop against a dark coat, while khaki green looks great with greys and berry tones. Keep chunkier knits for more relaxed ensembles and neat accessories for more polished looks. If you\u2019re a statement scarf kind of person, then choose a collarless and hoodless coat so you can create an impressive drape without getting tangled. The same principle applies to a crossbody bag, not just a convenient hands-free accessory but a piece that can pull your look together in an instant. No matter what look you\u2019re going for, the right coat will accentuate your outfit and make those long winter months just a little more bearable \u2026 Shop Uniqlo\u2019s down coat collection at uniqlo.com",

The Oxford office is understood to employ about 50 staff, while TI\u2019s total UK employee numbers are unknown. ABC said it intended to \u201cmaintain the balance of skills and functions of employees\u201d of TI, and the job cuts are expected to primarily target employees in corporate, administration, research and development, and functions supporting \u201cplc-related functions\u201d. The board of TI said on Friday it had agreed the deal, which will fuel concerns of an exodus of businesses from the London stock market, after a spree of dealmaking which has accelerated in recent days. Aviva revealed on Wednesday it had tried to buy smaller rival Direct Line for \u00a33.3bn, the cafe bar business Loungers succumbed to a \u00a3338m bid from the US private equity company Fortress Investment Group, and the Australian asset manager Macquarie struck a \u00a3700m deal to buy the waste management business Renewi. Shares in Spire Healthcare surged on Friday over speculation that the FTSE 250 company may be the next to sell up, after reports that India\u2019s Narayana Health is in talks to take a controlling stake. A decision to maintain TI\u2019s main headquarters in the US, at Auburn Hills in Michigan, means the headcount and \u201cassociated footprint\u201d of administration functions in Oxford will be reduced. The cuts, which are subject to consultation after the deal closes, also include cutting 5% to 10% of TI\u2019s manufacturing facilities and offices globally. TI, founded in 1922 as Harry Bundy &amp; Co in Detroit, Michigan, started making parts for the Ford Model T. It has 98 manufacturing locations in 28 countries. TI, which had rejected several offers from the Toronto-based ABC over the past few months, said it decided to accept the latest offer of 200p a share because of disruption and uncertainty in the global automotive sector. TI makes car parts including fuel tanks and pipes. It also said it took the \u00a31.04bn cash deal, which is worth \u00a31.8bn when debt is included, because of the \u201clong-term potential\u201d of the business not being reflected in its stock market valuation of \u00a3860m. TI said it was a 37.2% premium to its share price before the planned takeover was announced in September. The diminishing number of UK-listed firms has prompted growing concern about the health of the London market.",

They were killed in private and in public: in homes, in a hospital car park, on a beach. They suffered for hours before dying or days later in hospital.</p> <p>The list of the dead is 16 pages long.</p> <p>\u201cAll of them were loved and deserved to live their lives free from the violence of men,\u201d Armitage said.</p> <p>The inquest was one of two reports this week which put the \u201cepidemic\u201d of violence against Aboriginal women back into the national spotlight.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/21/sign-up-for-five-great-reads-guardian-australias-wrap-of-our-best-summer-stories\">Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The second was the federal government\u2019s response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women-and-children\">inquiry into missing and murdered Aboriginal women and children</a>. The government \u201cnoted\u201d its 10 recommendations aimed at preventing further violence, but said they were up to all levels of government to implement.</p> <p>In response, the language from almost every corner has been blunt, and despairing: this is a crisis. A terrible carnage. Aboriginal women are being killed at obscene rates, in obscene ways. The system has utterly failed them all. It is our shame, and our horror. We cannot ignore their suffering any longer.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a real risk that as a community we may become desensitised to the violence, which can fuel racist attitudes and stereotypes; and lead to inaction,\u201d Armitage said on Monday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/24/this-is-our-horror-the-grim-stories-driving-the-northern-territorys-reckoning-with-domestic-violence-ntwnfb\">\u2018This is our horror\u2019: the grim stories driving the Northern Territory\u2019s reckoning with domestic violence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But by the end of the week, even as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/26/northern-territory-domestic-violence-crisis-action-report-ntwnfb\">advocates urged action </a>and the NT police admitted to being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the scale of the violence, an immediate response did not arrive.</p> <p>The federal government said it has already given the NT $180m to address the problem. The NT government said it needs more time to decide how to spend it.</p> <h2>\u2018A cascade of sadness and grief\u2019</h2> <p>The coroner has described a system in crisis \u2013 underfunded and overwhelmed \u2013 as well as a system that failed to help women, where instances of \u201csystemic racism\u201d contributed to preventable deaths.</p> <p>She described the effect on the communities left behind.</p> <p>\u201cEach woman\u2019s death sets off a cascade of sadness and grief, most keenly felt by her children, her parents, her brothers and sisters, cousins, nieces and nephews, and her friends. Each of her loved ones experiences this grief and must carry it with them.\u201d</p> <p>She found that the NT rate of domestic and family violence-related homicide was seven times the national average. More than 63% of assaults in the NT are domestic and family violence-related.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThey were killed where we live,\u201d said the Northern Territory coroner this week, as she handed down findings in an inquest into the horrific domestic violence deaths of four Aboriginal women. On Monday \u2013 the world day for the elimination of violence against women \u2013 Elisabeth Armitage delivered her long-awaited findings on the \u201csenseless, shocking and preventable\u201d deaths of Ngeyo Ragurrk, Kumanjayi Heywood, Kumarn Rubuntja and Miss Yunupingu. They were among at least 87 women \u2013 82 of them Aboriginal \u2013 killed by their domestic partners in the NT since 2000. While these four women\u2019s lives and deaths were the focus of her investigations, Armitage said she wanted to remember as many of those other women as she could. In unflinching terms, she described the killing of 68 Aboriginal women whose deaths were reviewed in the course of the inquest. They were beaten to death with fists, a concrete block, stomped on, stabbed, set on fire, shot, run over repeatedly with a car. They were killed in private and in public: in homes, in a hospital car park, on a beach. They suffered for hours before dying or days later in hospital. The list of the dead is 16 pages long. \u201cAll of them were loved and deserved to live their lives free from the violence of men,\u201d Armitage said. The inquest was one of two reports this week which put the \u201cepidemic\u201d of violence against Aboriginal women back into the national spotlight. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads The second was the federal government\u2019s response to the inquiry into missing and murdered Aboriginal women and children. The government \u201cnoted\u201d its 10 recommendations aimed at preventing further violence, but said they were up to all levels of government to implement. In response, the language from almost every corner has been blunt, and despairing: this is a crisis. A terrible carnage. Aboriginal women are being killed at obscene rates, in obscene ways. The system has utterly failed them all. It is our shame, and our horror. We cannot ignore their suffering any longer. \u201cThere is a real risk that as a community we may become desensitised to the violence, which can fuel racist attitudes and stereotypes; and lead to inaction,\u201d Armitage said on Monday. But by the end of the week, even as advocates urged action and the NT police admitted to being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the scale of the violence, an immediate response did not arrive. The federal government said it has already given the NT $180m to address the problem. The NT government said it needs more time to decide how to spend it. \u2018A cascade of sadness and grief\u2019 The coroner has described a system in crisis \u2013 underfunded and overwhelmed \u2013 as well as a system that failed to help women, where instances of \u201csystemic racism\u201d contributed to preventable deaths. She described the effect on the communities left behind. \u201cEach woman\u2019s death sets off a cascade of sadness and grief, most keenly felt by her children, her parents, her brothers and sisters, cousins, nieces and nephews, and her friends. Each of her loved ones experiences this grief and must carry it with them.\u201d She found that the NT rate of domestic and family violence-related homicide was seven times the national average. More than 63% of assaults in the NT are domestic and family violence-related. About 40% of domestic and family-related assaults in the NT involve weapons, a higher proportion than any other Australian jurisdiction. And she said this \u201cscourge\u201d is getting worse. NT police reported a 117% increase in domestic and family violence over the past 10 years. They expect it to rise by a further 73% over the next decade. About 50% to 80% of NT police\u2019s entire workload was spent on domestic and family violence matters. Based on those figures, the cost of domestic, family and sexual violence (DFSV) to NT Police is projected to reach $156m by 2027 and $209m by 2030 \u2013 almost half of the entire police operating budget. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Outside court on Monday, the NT police commissioner Michael Murphy said \u201cDV still overwhelms police and we need to do things differently.\u201d Murphy outlined initiatives, including a co-responder model being tested in Alice Springs, where officers attend calls with trained experts. Government representatives told the inquest each co-responder location would need $1m, but less than $300,000 had been allocated by the NT government to fund the Alice Springs pilot. The coroner said that was inadequate. \u201cI am told that once fully implemented, demand for the service will immediately surpass the pilot\u2019s capacity in Alice Springs,\u201d she said. She recommended programs be appropriately funded \u2013 along with a specialised DFSV court, better services for offenders and an overhaul of police procedures, including embedding Aboriginal language translators in the emergency call centre. Missing and murdered After the findings were handed down, the federal government tabled its response to the missing and murdered Aboriginal women and children inquiry. The inquiry, first announced in 2021, came after sustained campaigning by First Nations women and advocates across many sectors, including politics, media, health and the law. Among its 10 recommendations are: to find a way to honour the murdered and forcibly disappeared, to properly track and keep data across jurisdictions, greater access to culturally appropriate family and sexual violence legal services and greater advocacy for prevention. The report also said the media could do better in raising the profile of murdered and missing women and children and in covering the issue of DFSV. The Indigenous Australians minister, Malarndirri McCarthy, said she wrote to the Australian Press Council to seek its help in improving reporting on the issue. A press council spokesperson said it had received the Minister\u2019s letter, and was revising its advisory guideline on family and domestic violence reporting. McCarthy said it was a national priority for the government to end the \u201csenseless violence\u201d within a generation, and the report would help inform a standalone National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Family Safety Plan, expected to be released early next year. \u201cMy own family members, my aunties, my cousins, have experienced horrific forms of abuse,\u201d she said. \u201cAs federal minister for Indigenous Australians and as a Yanyuwa Garrwa woman, I want a better future for all First Nations women and children.\u201d McCarthy said the commonwealth had already provided the NT with $180m in funding, and she wanted the new CLP government to \u201cimmediately release\u201d the funds. The Coalition\u2019s spokesperson for Indigenous Australians, fellow Territorian Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, also said there was a \u201cneed for our authorities and police force to tackle [DFSV] more seriously\u201d. Nampijinpa Price said she had \u201cfaith in the Country Liberal party government to be able to deliver on those recommendations, and with that funding that\u2019s available.\u201d But the NT government says it needs more time. The new chief minister, Lia Finocchiaro, told parliament her government is still deciding how to allocate the $180m. The prevention of domestic violence minister, Robyn Cahill, said she wanted more time consulting service providers in the regions. But the Top End Women\u2019s Legal Service\u2019s chief executive officer, Caitlin Weatherby-Fell, said there was no more time to spare. \u201cIt\u2019s getting worse. It\u2019s beyond critical. There are almost no words to describe how serious this crisis is. We need action now,\u201d she said. The coroner was occasionally on the verge of tears as she delivered her landmark findings this week. \u201cHow much longer does the Northern Territory community have to live within this epidemic of domestic and family violence?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy do the citizens of this jurisdiction deserve to live with this unrelenting horror in our midst, which stalks our women and haunts the childhoods of our children?\u201d In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

What went wrong in Laos?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Calls for better regulation</h2> <p>Before the deaths earlier this month, most backpackers didn\u2019t think much about what might be in the free shots that are often offered at hostels and bars in Vang Vieng and many other parts of the backpacker trail.</p> <p>\u201cWe literally arrived in Laos the day that the news came,\u201d says Sam Ayling, 23, from Surrey. \u201cIf our trip was pushed forwards for three days or something or two days \u2026 it\u2019s quite scary to think that that could have been us.\u201d</p> <p>News spread quickly among backpackers, says Eliza Rolf, 21, Hertfordshire. \u201cIn the hostel we were last in, all the friends that we made were very paranoid about what to drink.\u201d</p> <p>No one is drinking spirits any more, they say.</p> <p>At the Mad Monkey hostel, a sign at the bar urges guests to be aware of a serious incident of alcohol poisoning \u201cat another hostel\u201d, adding \u201cplease avoid this for your safety and drink reputable branded spirits\u201d.</p> <p>But most backpackers say their hostels and bars haven\u2019t mentioned the deaths, or said anything about how to stay safe. One business owner said he believes the recent contaminated alcohol was an isolated incident. Another says the tragedy should bring wider change to make the town safer.</p>    <p>\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that something like this will push the go button on the endeavour to regulate the supplies to the tourist market \u2013 things like backyard distilleries and so forth,\u201d says one hotel owner, who asked not to be named.</p> <p>Officials had been visiting businesses to check that they have the correct paperwork, they add.<br><br>Homemade alcohol is fairly common in Laos and other countries in the region but it can be highly dangerous if it is produced incorrectly, or if unscrupulous makers try to cut costs by adding methanol as a cheap alternative to ethanol.</p> <p>According to state media, eight people who worked at the Nana hostel where some of the tourists were staying, including its manager, have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/26/laos-hostel-staff-detained-after-backpackers-deaths-from-suspected-methanol-poisoning\">detained for questioning.</a> The manager of the hostel has previously denied to media that alcohol served to guests was tainted.</p> <p>Reporting of the deaths in local media has been minimal, due to the lack of press freedom.</p> <p>The police have released very little information about their inquiries. The lack of communication has not helped boost confidence in the process.</p> <p>\u201cThey say that they\u2019re investigating but I think that they don\u2019t,\u201d says a grieving backpacker, adding that he does not trust the authorities in the country. His friends, two Danish women in their early 20s, fell ill and died after drinking on a night out.</p> <p>The tourism police declined to answer questions about its inquiry.</p> <h2>\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever have a free shot again\u2019</h2> <p>Vang Vieng, once famous for its raucous parties, has weathered various scandals over the years. The town was in the past known for \u201ctubing\u201d, where backpackers float along the Nam Song river on the inner tube of a tractor tyre, stopping off at bars along the way to enjoy buckets filled with cheap spirits, and throw themselves down giant slides and rope swings. A spate of tourist deaths eventually forced a government crackdown and it imposed a temporary ban on tubing in 2012.</p> <p>Today, the town attracts a much wider variety of tourists, and guests are drawn to more than just its party scene. In the crisp, morning sunshine, tourists in kayaks splash along the waters of the river, the jagged mountains looming behind them. Stalls in the town offer excursions to the nearby blue lagoons and water caves, and hot air balloon trips above the surrounding rivers and rice paddies.</p>    <p>At night-time, hotel signs glow in multiple languages \u2013 Lao, English, Korean and Chinese \u2013 a sign of how the town is powered by tourists from around the world.</p> <p>November is the start of the peak tourism season, after the rainy season has drawn to a close. Businesses say there are no signs yet that the deaths have affected bookings.</p> <p>Some travellers say they did feel nervous about visiting after hearing the news. Others say that, while they are saddened and shocked by recent events, the risks shouldn\u2019t be overblown.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely shaken the community for sure, but you don\u2019t want it to tarnish the reputation of the whole country or change the perspectives of the rest of the world,\u201d says Isabel Wallbank, 23, from Derby. \u201cLondon doesn\u2019t have a great reputation for crime at the moment, but it never stops tourists visiting the city.\u201d</p> <p>Press attention was helping to raise awareness about dangers associated with methanol poisonings, she adds, but online comments suggesting Laos is a death trap were unfair.</p> <p>\u201cLaos is a really poor country that relies on tourism to uphold its economy,\u201d Wallbank says.</p> <p>\u201cIt could happen anywhere - in Magaluf, Zanthi, anywhere,\u201d says fellow traveller Eddie Smith, 26, from Wales. But he adds: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever have a free bar again, or a free shot.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the bars, most tourists are sticking to branded beer or soju bottles.</p> <p>Those who do buy cocktails are at times hesitant. A young tourist and his friend hand a jug of luminous blue liquid back to the bar staff, complaining it\u2019s too strong. <br><br>\u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d they ask, suspiciously. The bar staff pour in an extra can of soda, and take a sip to prove it is safe.</p> <p>Later into the evening, a voice starts to warble over a microphone. On the streets outside, vendors sell sandwiches and smoothies to passersby, their stalls illuminated by lamps beneath umbrellas. Dogs slumber on the roadside, watching out for snacks. Across town, music thumps from a bar busy with dancing revellers. For now, the party goes on in Vang Vieng \u2013 but with an added dose of caution.</p>",

Calls for better regulation Before the deaths earlier this month, most backpackers didn\u2019t think much about what might be in the free shots that are often offered at hostels and bars in Vang Vieng and many other parts of the backpacker trail. \u201cWe literally arrived in Laos the day that the news came,\u201d says Sam Ayling, 23, from Surrey. \u201cIf our trip was pushed forwards for three days or something or two days \u2026 it\u2019s quite scary to think that that could have been us.\u201d News spread quickly among backpackers, says Eliza Rolf, 21, Hertfordshire. \u201cIn the hostel we were last in, all the friends that we made were very paranoid about what to drink.\u201d No one is drinking spirits any more, they say. At the Mad Monkey hostel, a sign at the bar urges guests to be aware of a serious incident of alcohol poisoning \u201cat another hostel\u201d, adding \u201cplease avoid this for your safety and drink reputable branded spirits\u201d. But most backpackers say their hostels and bars haven\u2019t mentioned the deaths, or said anything about how to stay safe. One business owner said he believes the recent contaminated alcohol was an isolated incident. Another says the tragedy should bring wider change to make the town safer. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that something like this will push the go button on the endeavour to regulate the supplies to the tourist market \u2013 things like backyard distilleries and so forth,\u201d says one hotel owner, who asked not to be named. Officials had been visiting businesses to check that they have the correct paperwork, they add. Homemade alcohol is fairly common in Laos and other countries in the region but it can be highly dangerous if it is produced incorrectly, or if unscrupulous makers try to cut costs by adding methanol as a cheap alternative to ethanol. According to state media, eight people who worked at the Nana hostel where some of the tourists were staying, including its manager, have been detained for questioning. The manager of the hostel has previously denied to media that alcohol served to guests was tainted. Reporting of the deaths in local media has been minimal, due to the lack of press freedom. The police have released very little information about their inquiries. The lack of communication has not helped boost confidence in the process. \u201cThey say that they\u2019re investigating but I think that they don\u2019t,\u201d says a grieving backpacker, adding that he does not trust the authorities in the country. His friends, two Danish women in their early 20s, fell ill and died after drinking on a night out. The tourism police declined to answer questions about its inquiry. \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever have a free shot again\u2019 Vang Vieng, once famous for its raucous parties, has weathered various scandals over the years. The town was in the past known for \u201ctubing\u201d, where backpackers float along the Nam Song river on the inner tube of a tractor tyre, stopping off at bars along the way to enjoy buckets filled with cheap spirits, and throw themselves down giant slides and rope swings. A spate of tourist deaths eventually forced a government crackdown and it imposed a temporary ban on tubing in 2012. Today, the town attracts a much wider variety of tourists, and guests are drawn to more than just its party scene. In the crisp, morning sunshine, tourists in kayaks splash along the waters of the river, the jagged mountains looming behind them. Stalls in the town offer excursions to the nearby blue lagoons and water caves, and hot air balloon trips above the surrounding rivers and rice paddies. At night-time, hotel signs glow in multiple languages \u2013 Lao, English, Korean and Chinese \u2013 a sign of how the town is powered by tourists from around the world. November is the start of the peak tourism season, after the rainy season has drawn to a close. Businesses say there are no signs yet that the deaths have affected bookings. Some travellers say they did feel nervous about visiting after hearing the news. Others say that, while they are saddened and shocked by recent events, the risks shouldn\u2019t be overblown. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely shaken the community for sure, but you don\u2019t want it to tarnish the reputation of the whole country or change the perspectives of the rest of the world,\u201d says Isabel Wallbank, 23, from Derby. \u201cLondon doesn\u2019t have a great reputation for crime at the moment, but it never stops tourists visiting the city.\u201d Press attention was helping to raise awareness about dangers associated with methanol poisonings, she adds, but online comments suggesting Laos is a death trap were unfair. \u201cLaos is a really poor country that relies on tourism to uphold its economy,\u201d Wallbank says. \u201cIt could happen anywhere - in Magaluf, Zanthi, anywhere,\u201d says fellow traveller Eddie Smith, 26, from Wales. But he adds: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever have a free bar again, or a free shot.\u201d Back in the bars, most tourists are sticking to branded beer or soju bottles. Those who do buy cocktails are at times hesitant. A young tourist and his friend hand a jug of luminous blue liquid back to the bar staff, complaining it\u2019s too strong. \u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d they ask, suspiciously. The bar staff pour in an extra can of soda, and take a sip to prove it is safe. Later into the evening, a voice starts to warble over a microphone. On the streets outside, vendors sell sandwiches and smoothies to passersby, their stalls illuminated by lamps beneath umbrellas. Dogs slumber on the roadside, watching out for snacks. Across town, music thumps from a bar busy with dancing revellers. For now, the party goes on in Vang Vieng \u2013 but with an added dose of caution.",

      "body": "<p>On a sunny spring morning, the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore, leaves her apartment in inner-city Redfern to walk to her town hall office. Under a canopy of mature London plane trees along Bourke Street, the 79-year-old, who recently won a record sixth term, sets a brisk pace.</p> <p>All politics is local, and Moore\u2019s career began on these streets. In the late 1970s, Moore created a lobby group, Redfern Community Concern, to fix up a little park in Kepos Street and improve local traffic. This was her springboard to becoming an alderman in South Sydney council in 1980 before a two-and-a-half-decade run as an independent in state parliament. In 2004, she began her unbroken 20-year stint as lord mayor which continued this year with another win in September.</p> <p>The recent election victory is not our first subject of conversation, but when we get to it Moore describes the last election as \u201cpretty awful\u201d. The major parties and independent hopefuls were on her heels, but despite predictions she had run her race, she still won, cutting a deal to make the Labor candidate her deputy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear any new, fresh ideas, most of them were just things we were already doing. But they just wanted to get rid of me. So it was personal.\u201d</p>    <p>Ageism, she believes, was at play. \u201cOh yes,\u201d she says, crinkling her nose. But she says it\u2019s the latest in a line of challenges from working in male-dominated councils and parliaments to acting on climate change. One gets the impression Moore sees ageism as just another hurdle to be hopped.</p> <p>\u201cAll those battles I fought, I\u2019m fighting that one too. I believe you should judge people on what their ability is and their energy and their health. Plenty of young people aren\u2019t doing much.\u201d Later, she laughs and calls herself a \u201clifetime learner\u201d in the job. Even now, she won\u2019t be drawn on whether this is her last hurrah as mayor. \u201cI\u2019m focusing on the next four years. If people keep going on about it, I will run again,\u201d she jokes. \u201cJust to spite them!\u201d</p> <p>Moore likes to walk to work as often as she can. She says hello to a young man pushing an elderly resident in a wheelchair outside a Catholic aged care home as we turn into Albion Street, Surry Hills. Moore grew up Catholic on the north shore \u2013 her father was a water board paymaster and her mother a teacher \u2013 and still attends mass. Is faith important to her? \u201cYes,\u201d she says, quickly and with conviction.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>She has held that faith while retaining the support of the large LGBTQ+ community in Sydney. Moore was a Mardi Gras parade judge as early as 1986 and has marched or been on a float in the parade annually since 1992. Cardinal Edward Clancy once took her own parish priest aside at St Francis church in Paddington, she says, claiming that parishioners were upset she was in the Mardi Gras one Saturday night then taking communion the next morning.</p> <p>She also invoked opposition from this city\u2019s most prominent Catholic, George Pell, who opposed Moore\u2019s staunch support for opening a medically supervised injecting centre in Kings Cross.</p>    <p>\u201cCardinal Pell was old school and harking back to the 50s and yet other members of the church are really practical, doing Christ\u2019s work in a really practical way, the way he would do it,\u201d Moore insists. \u201cHe [Jesus] wouldn\u2019t do it in a George Pell way.\u201d</p> <p>We reach the corner of Crown Street and, having been so engaged in laughing at these old religious schisms, Moore only now realises we have overshot her planned route by a couple of blocks, so we double back south to Shuk cafe, where she likes to sit outside and greet constituents passing by.</p> <p>We order coffee when a tall, middle-aged man in a velour tracksuit happens by and asks Moore about the election, then pulls up a chair to share his ambitions with the mayor, among them opening a food truck. She is a good listener.</p> <p>He veers on to a critique of million-dollar milk crates \u2013 a reference to a long vetoed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jul/30/city-sculptures-its-the-milk-crate-thats-stirred-up-a-controversy\">public art sculpture</a> \u2013 before Moore adroitly changes the topic by noting his outfit. \u201cVery colourful,\u201d she says.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Moore was a schoolteacher in 1977 when she and her architect husband, Peter Moore, moved into a modest terrace on Bourke Street, Redfern. \u201cThis area was very bleak,\u201d she recalls. Yet the couple never left the eastern edge of Redfern.</p> <p>They raised children Sophie and Tom on the same strip as the Dandy bacon factory, the ACI glassworks and the Resch\u2019s brewery \u2013 pungent with its hops \u2013 which have all since been demolished for residential developments, such as the one where the couple now live. The apartment overlooks a large, lush park where the Moores regularly walk their black Staffordshire terriers Bessie and Buster.</p> <p>Over coffee we talk about the Moores\u2019 four grandchildren. Sophie\u2019s 12-year-old twins, Harry and Sienna, live in London. Moore is hoping their mother will bring them back to Australia to live, a point she made earlier in our walk. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to see more of them,\u201d she says eagerly. Son Tom, a gardener, is raising his family on the Central Coast so she sees a lot more of his two children, Connor, 12, and Alex, 10, who will be joining their grandmother at the city\u2019s annual festivities soon.</p> <p>Moore\u2019s own children had inner-Sydney childhoods, but some research suggests that such childhoods are harder to come by. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/13/sydney-risks-becoming-the-city-with-no-grandchildren-as-housing-costs-push-out-families-expert-warns\">NSW Productivity Commission report</a> released in February noted an exodus of people aged 30 to 40 from Sydney and that it was on track to be a \u201ccity with no grandchildren\u201d. Does she worry about that? \u201cYou\u2019d know living in our area that\u2019s simply not true,\u201d Moore argues.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s full of families with children. Bourke Street public school is bulging.\u201d She says some developers are now building three- and four-bedroom apartments to accommodate families.</p>    <p>Nevertheless, Sydney is the least affordable city by far in Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s a big problem,\u201d she nods, but argues Sydney has done more than other councils to provide affordable housing. She laments the lack of action on negative gearing and capital gains tax breaks and puts the blame for housing affordability on the levels of government above her own. \u201cEither federal government or the state, there\u2019s been a decade of governments not doing what they should have been doing.\u201d</p> <p>We head towards Oxford Street, past jackhammers at work.

      "bodyText": "On a sunny spring morning, the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore, leaves her apartment in inner-city Redfern to walk to her town hall office. Under a canopy of mature London plane trees along Bourke Street, the 79-year-old, who recently won a record sixth term, sets a brisk pace. All politics is local, and Moore\u2019s career began on these streets. In the late 1970s, Moore created a lobby group, Redfern Community Concern, to fix up a little park in Kepos Street and improve local traffic. This was her springboard to becoming an alderman in South Sydney council in 1980 before a two-and-a-half-decade run as an independent in state parliament. In 2004, she began her unbroken 20-year stint as lord mayor which continued this year with another win in September. The recent election victory is not our first subject of conversation, but when we get to it Moore describes the last election as \u201cpretty awful\u201d. The major parties and independent hopefuls were on her heels, but despite predictions she had run her race, she still won, cutting a deal to make the Labor candidate her deputy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear any new, fresh ideas, most of them were just things we were already doing. But they just wanted to get rid of me. So it was personal.\u201d Ageism, she believes, was at play. \u201cOh yes,\u201d she says, crinkling her nose. But she says it\u2019s the latest in a line of challenges from working in male-dominated councils and parliaments to acting on climate change. One gets the impression Moore sees ageism as just another hurdle to be hopped. \u201cAll those battles I fought, I\u2019m fighting that one too. I believe you should judge people on what their ability is and their energy and their health. Plenty of young people aren\u2019t doing much.\u201d Later, she laughs and calls herself a \u201clifetime learner\u201d in the job. Even now, she won\u2019t be drawn on whether this is her last hurrah as mayor. \u201cI\u2019m focusing on the next four years. If people keep going on about it, I will run again,\u201d she jokes. \u201cJust to spite them!\u201d Moore likes to walk to work as often as she can. She says hello to a young man pushing an elderly resident in a wheelchair outside a Catholic aged care home as we turn into Albion Street, Surry Hills. Moore grew up Catholic on the north shore \u2013 her father was a water board paymaster and her mother a teacher \u2013 and still attends mass. Is faith important to her? \u201cYes,\u201d she says, quickly and with conviction. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning She has held that faith while retaining the support of the large LGBTQ+ community in Sydney. Moore was a Mardi Gras parade judge as early as 1986 and has marched or been on a float in the parade annually since 1992. Cardinal Edward Clancy once took her own parish priest aside at St Francis church in Paddington, she says, claiming that parishioners were upset she was in the Mardi Gras one Saturday night then taking communion the next morning. She also invoked opposition from this city\u2019s most prominent Catholic, George Pell, who opposed Moore\u2019s staunch support for opening a medically supervised injecting centre in Kings Cross. \u201cCardinal Pell was old school and harking back to the 50s and yet other members of the church are really practical, doing Christ\u2019s work in a really practical way, the way he would do it,\u201d Moore insists. \u201cHe [Jesus] wouldn\u2019t do it in a George Pell way.\u201d We reach the corner of Crown Street and, having been so engaged in laughing at these old religious schisms, Moore only now realises we have overshot her planned route by a couple of blocks, so we double back south to Shuk cafe, where she likes to sit outside and greet constituents passing by. We order coffee when a tall, middle-aged man in a velour tracksuit happens by and asks Moore about the election, then pulls up a chair to share his ambitions with the mayor, among them opening a food truck. She is a good listener. He veers on to a critique of million-dollar milk crates \u2013 a reference to a long vetoed public art sculpture \u2013 before Moore adroitly changes the topic by noting his outfit. \u201cVery colourful,\u201d she says. *** Moore was a schoolteacher in 1977 when she and her architect husband, Peter Moore, moved into a modest terrace on Bourke Street, Redfern. \u201cThis area was very bleak,\u201d she recalls. Yet the couple never left the eastern edge of Redfern. They raised children Sophie and Tom on the same strip as the Dandy bacon factory, the ACI glassworks and the Resch\u2019s brewery \u2013 pungent with its hops \u2013 which have all since been demolished for residential developments, such as the one where the couple now live. The apartment overlooks a large, lush park where the Moores regularly walk their black Staffordshire terriers Bessie and Buster. Over coffee we talk about the Moores\u2019 four grandchildren. Sophie\u2019s 12-year-old twins, Harry and Sienna, live in London. Moore is hoping their mother will bring them back to Australia to live, a point she made earlier in our walk. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to see more of them,\u201d she says eagerly. Son Tom, a gardener, is raising his family on the Central Coast so she sees a lot more of his two children, Connor, 12, and Alex, 10, who will be joining their grandmother at the city\u2019s annual festivities soon. Moore\u2019s own children had inner-Sydney childhoods, but some research suggests that such childhoods are harder to come by. A NSW Productivity Commission report released in February noted an exodus of people aged 30 to 40 from Sydney and that it was on track to be a \u201ccity with no grandchildren\u201d. Does she worry about that? \u201cYou\u2019d know living in our area that\u2019s simply not true,\u201d Moore argues. \u201cIt\u2019s full of families with children. Bourke Street public school is bulging.\u201d She says some developers are now building three- and four-bedroom apartments to accommodate families. Nevertheless, Sydney is the least affordable city by far in Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s a big problem,\u201d she nods, but argues Sydney has done more than other councils to provide affordable housing. She laments the lack of action on negative gearing and capital gains tax breaks and puts the blame for housing affordability on the levels of government above her own. \u201cEither federal government or the state, there\u2019s been a decade of governments not doing what they should have been doing.\u201d We head towards Oxford Street, past jackhammers at work. She has, she says, unfinished business as mayor. \u201cReaching net zero by 2025 is one,\u201d she says. \u201cCompleting our work in Oxford Street is another. Completing our work in Chinatown. There\u2019s lots to do.\u201d Moore, a one-time \u201cstrong Labor\u201d supporter (in the Whitlam era), has never soured on the ideal that Sydney can be a haven across the financial and social divides. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s really important that the city is not just for one tier of people,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has got to be a city for everyone.\u201d Moore\u2019s energy seems driven by a curiosity for challenges, quoting the late US president Theodore Roosevelt, that \u201cthe best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing\u201d and adds her own enthusiastic coda: \u201cCity-making, it\u2019s all-embracing.\u201d So how will she know when the time is right to leave public life? \u201cOh, it might be a family decision. Peter and Bessie and Buster might want me at home more often, although post-Covid you can do a lot of work at home, too, so it makes a big difference. I\u2019ll see. I\u2019m a worker.

      "bodyText": "Every year at Christmas, my dad makes a trifle. And, because nobody else in our household eats it, he spends the period between Christmas and New Year devouring the entire thing by himself. Like a legend. This annual tradition of three decades\u2019 standing has affirmed to me one thing as an adult: that Christmas is about enjoying whatever weird thing you like. Who cares if it\u2019s costly, difficult to find or you\u2019re the only person in a house of five who likes it? Below, a mix of unapologetic classics and weird (yet wonderful) new favourites. After all, there\u2019s no such thing as a guilty pleasure \u2013 least of all at Christmas. Fizz Contevedo Cava Brut \u00a35.49 Aldi, 11.5%. A no-fuss supermarket cava: refreshing and appley, with a hint of nuttiness. Tesco Finest Prosecco Valdobbiadene DOCG \u00a39.50 Tesco, 11%. Prosecco is often a bit too sweet for me, but this is a delicious drier version. A serious step up from Tesco\u2019s own-label fizz. Camillo Donati Lambrusco Rosso Seco 2023 \u00a319.95 Buon Vino, 12.5%. A vivacious and reliably delicious lambrusco. Serve chilled while unwrapping the presents, or to quell the Boxing Day hangover. Domaine Karanika Bru Cuv\u00e9e Speciale Xinomavro 2022 \u00a326 Maltby &amp; Greek, 12%. Ever tried Greek sparkling? This is classically styled and made from an indigenous red grape, so it\u2019s a bit like a blanc de noirs. Palate-filling and moreish. Langham Wine Estate Culver Classic Cuv\u00e9e NV \u00a330.95 Grape Britannia, 12%. Young winemaker Tommy Grimshaw takes cues from grower champagne for his English sparkling wines. This one\u2019s red fruit-dominant, and has some serious acidity to balance the playful notes of Petits Filous yoghurt. Leclerc Briant R\u00e9serve Brut NV \u00a350 Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, 12%. Many supermarket non-vintages are pushing \u00a350, so why not spend the money on a blend sourced from premier and grand cru villages instead? This one has notes of salted almonds and ripe stone fruit. White The Society\u2019s White Rioja 2022 \u00a39.25 The Wine Society, 12%. I have a lot of strong feelings towards TWS\u2019s own-label range, and all of them are good. Serve this with your turkey. Marlborough Heartland Sauvignon Blanc 2023 \u00a312.50 Sainsbury\u2019s, 12.5%. Fab value. A partnership between winemaker David Hohnen and the farming families of Marlborough Grape Grower\u2019s Co-operative. Dom\u00e4ne Wachau Gr\u00fcner Veltliner \u00a313 Tesco, 12%. An eyebrow-raising supermarket find. Would be good with smoked salmon. Chic label, too. Aslina Chenin Blanc 2022 \u00a316.99 Waitrose, 13%. South African chenin with seven days of skin contact to dial up the texture and ripe pear notes. Altitudes Ixsir 2022 \u00a324 The Great Wine Co, 13%. Opulent and aromatic Lebanese white. It\u2019s 30% viognier (which explains the Rh\u00f4ne-like plump peach), with the rest equal parts muscat and local obeidy. Domaine Buisson-Battault Bourgogne Chardonnay 2018 \u00a328 Emile Wines, 12.5%. Elegant, floral, oak-aged \u2013 like a baby meursault, just not, you know, as expensive. And as giftable as it is drinkable. Red Aldi Specially Selected Toscana Rosso 2022 \u00a37.69, 14%. A lesser, but rather tasty dupe of Tignanello. Sangiovese-dominated with dark fruit and good grip. Ch\u00e2teau Lanessan, Haut-M\u00e9doc 2012 \u00a317 The Wine Society, 13%. This 12-year-old polished claret spearheads Matthew Horsley\u2019s first Christmas as the Society\u2019s new bordeaux buyer. Vignerons d\u2019Est\u00e9zargues Les Oliviers C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne 2022 \u00a313.95 Parched, 14%. This organic Rh\u00f4ne blend is always, always in my fridge door. From a wine cooperative that uses only organic and biodynamic fruit. Waitrose No 1 Reserva Quinta da Rosa Portugal \u00a310.79 (on offer) Waitrose, 14%. Portuguese blends endure as a great place to find value. This ripe, full-bodied example is just as good with food as it is without. Winzer Krems Blauer Zweigelt 2019 \u00a311.50 Ocado, 13%. Something light, simple and Austrian for Boxing Day cold cuts. Domaine du Bel Air Jour de Soif Bourgueil 2021 \u00a322 Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, 13%. Deceptively fresh and fruity. An undercurrent of earthiness makes this a nice match for goose or duck. Low/No-alcohol Romain des Grottes L\u2019Antidote 2023 \u00a315 Wright\u2019s Wines, 0%. Made from gamay juice blended with 15 herbs from the vineyard, plus apple, ginger and lemon. A tonic for the sore-headed. Real Dry Dragon Sparkling Tea \u00a39.50 Waitrose, 0%. Pan-fired dragon well green tea yields steely citrus. It\u2019s as if they made a sparkling tea in the C\u00f4tes des Blancs. Wednesday\u2019s Domaine Piquant NV \u00a312.59 Laithwaites, 0.04%. A juicy, 100% air\u00e9n that\u2019s been dealcoholised. Tastes off-dry rather than over sweet, which can be a symptom of non-alcs made in that way. Three Spirit Blurred Vines Sharp \u00a315.95 The Whisky Exchange, 0%. A blend designed by plant scientists and winemakers. Crisp, refined, with jalepe\u00f1o oil to mimic alcohol burn. Genius. Botivo Botanical Aperitivo 50cl \u00a326.50 Botivo, 0%. You\u2019ll see this in pretty much every cool bar these days. Bittersweet botanical brew that you can top up with soda. One for kombucha lovers.",

      "body": "<p>As a refugee, when you seek asylum, you experience a complicated bureaucratic process that seems never-ending. This system is a labyrinth of violence where many refugees feel as though they have been sucked in or swallowed whole. Sometimes refugees may feel they have found an open door but soon they realise they have been brought back to the same room they were in years ago. The violence of this system has many faces and has swallowed years, decades, of their lives.</p> <p>The Australian immigration system has established a vicious cycle of violence that looks to be further entrenched with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/27/coalition-boasts-its-running-the-immigration-system-after-deal-to-pass-all-three-of-labors-migration-bills\">three rushed migration bills</a>.</p> <p>Thousands of refugees who had believed themselves to have finally found safety will be targeted by the new migration amendment (removal and other measures) bill. It expands the minister\u2019s power and allows the government to put refugees back again in prison camps, deport them or banish them to a third country. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2024/nov/28/labor-new-migration-bill-laws-comment-ntwnfb\">To not know if you will ever be safe is torture. Labor\u2019s deportation laws are cruel |  Mostafa Azimitabar</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/25/labor-three-migration-bills-what-new-powers-are-sought-and-will-the-coalition-vote-them-through\">According to Guardian Australia</a>, the most likely potential targets are about 4,452 people on bridging visas, 1,179 people in immigration or community detention, and 246 people released due to the high court\u2019s ruling that indefinite immigration detention is unlawful. For those already in detention centres, this means no clear future and their indefinite imprisonment continues. For those who have been free for years, it means being trapped in detention and the threat of deportation or banishment to a third country. In other words, it means returning to the same place they were brutally held years ago \u2013 or worse.</p> <p>Based on my experience as a refugee, we lost almost everything when we left our countries. We lost family, friends, jobs and the communities to which we belonged. A refugee is like a bird that has lost its nest, and it takes years to build a new one on a new tree.</p> <p>Most refugees who will be targeted by this bill have already achieved this, even under difficult circumstances and while struggling with PTSD. But now they will again be forced to lose everything.</p> <p>Yet this time the situation is worse: these refugees have already experienced the violence of the Australian immigration system and now the government seeks the power to put them back into that tragic situation indefinitely.</p> <p>This bill is highly problematic in terms of its legal and political aspects. The high court ruled in November 2023 that indefinite immigration detention is unlawful and in November 2024 that forcing people released from immigration detention to wear ankle bracelets and live under curfews is unconstitutional. In response, the Albanese government has rushed to introduce this bill, which not only targets a few hundred people with criminal records but expands to target many thousands who have been living peacefully in Australia for years.

      "bodyText": "As a refugee, when you seek asylum, you experience a complicated bureaucratic process that seems never-ending. This system is a labyrinth of violence where many refugees feel as though they have been sucked in or swallowed whole. Sometimes refugees may feel they have found an open door but soon they realise they have been brought back to the same room they were in years ago. The violence of this system has many faces and has swallowed years, decades, of their lives. The Australian immigration system has established a vicious cycle of violence that looks to be further entrenched with the three rushed migration bills. Thousands of refugees who had believed themselves to have finally found safety will be targeted by the new migration amendment (removal and other measures) bill. It expands the minister\u2019s power and allows the government to put refugees back again in prison camps, deport them or banish them to a third country. According to Guardian Australia, the most likely potential targets are about 4,452 people on bridging visas, 1,179 people in immigration or community detention, and 246 people released due to the high court\u2019s ruling that indefinite immigration detention is unlawful. For those already in detention centres, this means no clear future and their indefinite imprisonment continues. For those who have been free for years, it means being trapped in detention and the threat of deportation or banishment to a third country. In other words, it means returning to the same place they were brutally held years ago \u2013 or worse. Based on my experience as a refugee, we lost almost everything when we left our countries. We lost family, friends, jobs and the communities to which we belonged. A refugee is like a bird that has lost its nest, and it takes years to build a new one on a new tree. Most refugees who will be targeted by this bill have already achieved this, even under difficult circumstances and while struggling with PTSD. But now they will again be forced to lose everything. Yet this time the situation is worse: these refugees have already experienced the violence of the Australian immigration system and now the government seeks the power to put them back into that tragic situation indefinitely. This bill is highly problematic in terms of its legal and political aspects. The high court ruled in November 2023 that indefinite immigration detention is unlawful and in November 2024 that forcing people released from immigration detention to wear ankle bracelets and live under curfews is unconstitutional. In response, the Albanese government has rushed to introduce this bill, which not only targets a few hundred people with criminal records but expands to target many thousands who have been living peacefully in Australia for years. The government has used a few specific cases to justify creating a brutal law. We\u2019ve seen how the media has adopted language used by politicians including the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, with headlines full of words like \u201ccriminals\u201d, \u201csafety\u201d, \u201cfear\u201d and \u201ccommunity protection\u201d. This language criminalises refugees, provides language for the government to hide behind and shapes public perceptions. This bill expands the regime of banishment (offshore detention) and allows the government to make agreements with third countries including Nauru and others. It gives the Australian government broad powers to collect and share personal information about refugee\u2019s previous interactions with the legal system, foreign governments or others, exposing refugees to deportation to countries where they may face harm or persecution. We have significant experience with third countries, including Papua New Guinea and Nauru, and the history of human rights violations in those countries toward refugees has been recorded and criticised by countless humanitarian organisations. Sending people to a third country does not guarantee they won\u2019t be deported to where they came from. Indeed, this bill is silent about whether they might be detained within such third countries. Another huge concern is that the bill targets refugees who have Australian families. This means many families \u2013 including children \u2013 might be separated, with some family members detained, deported or sent to a third country. Many families have already endured years of separation while in prison camps. Marriages have been destroyed due to the detention of one or both spouses, and we know children are the main victims of this brutal regime. We can analyse this bill from multiple perspectives as it targets refugees in different situations but what is clear is that the Australian government is following the same pattern of using refugees as political tools close to elections. As always, refugees \u2013 one of the most marginalised communities \u2013 are easy targets. Regardless of the many disagreements between Labor and the Coalition, when it comes to refugees, they always unite. I call it a \u201ccompetition of cruelty\u201d, where both parties vie to show the public that they are stricter. In this cruel race the winner is the Coalition, which has seized the opportunity to divide Australians further and once again dominate Labor. I would like to repeat what I said to the Senate committee last week: You are making a policy that damages people who are already part of the community. What are you going to achieve with this brutal policy? Nothing. You are just making a tragedy worse. \u2022 Behrouz Boochani is a writer and refugee who was held on Manus Island.

An OnlyFans model had her visa cancelled this year amid plans to film adult videos on the Gold Coast with \u201cbarely legal\u201d 18-year-olds, and while sexual assaults have dropped significantly, drink spiking and harassment remain a risk.</p> <p>But education has improved, even if expectations haven\u2019t.

Every afternoon, a group of footy player mates have jogged 6.5km to summit Byron\u2019s rocky headland in the punishing heat. It\u2019s worth it for the views, which take in the whole eastern coastline \u2013 an expanse of sea and jagged rock and sand.</p> <p>The boys stop to chat halfway down the trek, dripping in sweat. \u201cThis bloke goes double, morning and night,\u201d James says, gesturing at his friend, Michael.</p> <p>\u201cMost blokes have a sleep-in and then we\u2019ll go in the afternoon. It\u2019s rewarding. We get a photo every time for the Instagram. I don\u2019t know how to explain it \u2013 it\u2019s weird that we\u2019re here.

They jump over waves, clutching each other, striking poses in the dwindling light.</p> <p>\u201cThis is what schoolies is about,\u201d I think to myself, kicking off my shoes and wading into the water.

It\u2019s a milestone, if you can afford it. Speaking over doof music blaring from his friend\u2019s speaker, Josh, 18, says Byron has been the \u201ctalk of town\u201d at his Melbourne school for years. His mates were unorganised \u2013 hence ending up in dorms in a hostel dominated by backpackers (\u201cnothing special, but it does the trick\u201d). Josh says schoolies is made out to be \u201cvery unsafe\u201d, but young people are better informed on how to look after each other than they once were. It\u2019s not paradise. An OnlyFans model had her visa cancelled this year amid plans to film adult videos on the Gold Coast with \u201cbarely legal\u201d 18-year-olds, and while sexual assaults have dropped significantly, drink spiking and harassment remain a risk. But education has improved, even if expectations haven\u2019t. The previous night, Josh\u2019s friend got \u201cvery, very sick\u201d \u2013 so he walked him home with the Red Frogs who kept them both hydrated and chatting. \u201cWe got up at 3.30 in the morning for the flight and finished up at 3.30 the next day,\u201d he says. \u201cStuff like that you just want to tick off \u2013 you\u2019re only 18 once. \u201cThis is, for a lot of us, the last time [our friends] see each other. We\u2019re all going elsewhere next year \u2026 I\u2019ll miss them.\u201d Polite \u2013 and frighteningly athletic From mid-afternoon, the sunburnt schoolies flock back to their accommodation armed with slabs of booze, frozen pizza and two-minute noodles. At the Wollongbar motel, the smell of sausages and vapes wafts through the common area, where gangs of boys armed with tongs work the barbecue while others stretch out in the sun like lizards. \u201cThe best part [of schoolies] is hanging out with your mates and just having a good time,\u201d Seb, 18, says reflectively from the motel pool as he sips on a lukewarm beer. \u201cI expected to just be partying the whole time, but it\u2019s more relaxing.\u201d Harry, who is rapidly losing his voice as the afternoon wears on, has been getting up at 5am every day to run 10km after dancing into the early hours of the morning. \u201cYou can\u2019t be 18 again,\u201d he says, gazing admiringly at his group of friends as Daft Punk plays softly in the background. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of moments where we\u2019ve sat down, taken a break for a second and said \u2013 \u2018hang on, this is actually a lot of fun\u2019 \u2026 it\u2019s bloody unreal, actually, everything we\u2019ve ever dreamed of. \u201cIf every day was like this, it\u2019d be the best life \u2026 my throat is killing me.\u201d Upstairs, a group of giggling girls are getting ready to a soundtrack of pop music, their room a bomb site of half-drunk sports drinks, makeup and wet bathers. \u201cEveryone looks out for each other, we were a bit nervous but it\u2019s really safe,\u201d Nina, 18, says. Their diciest moment so far was their friend, Brigitte, \u201cmunting all over the pub at like 9pm\u201d. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even nine, it was 8.55!\u201d a friend interjects. \u201cIt got all over my feet,\u201d cries another. Brigitte, sitting serenely on the bed, humming to the music, says the experience was a learning curve. \u201cI felt so much better once it was out.\u201d The manager of the motel, Andy Turnbull, opens to schoolies every year and says the kids are \u201chaving a good time, but the majority aren\u2019t trashing themselves\u201d. \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s been a generational shift,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one was going to the gym and doing lighthouse walks in the morning 30 years ago.\u201d A tattoo artist who has been offering a two-for-$200 deal to school leavers (mostly dominated by fine-line palm trees, waves and moons), also reflects on the \u201cold days\u201d when riot police used to man the streets. \u201cI tattooed one girl who did yoga in the morning and was in bed by nine,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re much more polite now.\u201d Polite \u2013 and frighteningly athletic. Every afternoon, a group of footy player mates have jogged 6.5km to summit Byron\u2019s rocky headland in the punishing heat. It\u2019s worth it for the views, which take in the whole eastern coastline \u2013 an expanse of sea and jagged rock and sand. The boys stop to chat halfway down the trek, dripping in sweat. \u201cThis bloke goes double, morning and night,\u201d James says, gesturing at his friend, Michael. \u201cMost blokes have a sleep-in and then we\u2019ll go in the afternoon. It\u2019s rewarding. We get a photo every time for the Instagram. I don\u2019t know how to explain it \u2013 it\u2019s weird that we\u2019re here. You\u2019re always looking at older kids and now it\u2019s us. \u201cThis is the time you\u2019ve got nothing else to worry about, after worrying for so long.\u201d A week of independence Approaching sunset, girls dressed up in sparkly dresses, heels and eyeliner emerge from their squalid motel rooms, their formal outfits a stark contrast to the beige surroundings. Boys ditch their boardies for shorts and shirts. Later, they will spill out of pubs on to the street, downing cans of mixed drinks, Snapchatting and yelling at buskers. Police will loom over a crowd of hundreds sweating at the Great Northern hotel \u2013 a mess of limbs shrieking under neon lights to a piano rendition of Abba\u2019s Gimme Gimme Gimme. But for now, the regular crowd of backpackers and loved-up couples gather on the grass at Main beach alongside the schoolies \u2013 a haphazard mesh of XXXX Gold and ukuleles. In the distance there is a paraglider and dogs catching frisbees on the sand and two young girls splashing in the shallow ocean. They jump over waves, clutching each other, striking poses in the dwindling light. \u201cThis is what schoolies is about,\u201d I think to myself, kicking off my shoes and wading into the water. This is freedom, friendship \u2013 a world away from sticky dancefloors and neon lights and hangovers. How thrilling to experience something for the first time \u2013 your first kiss, your first heartbreak, your first time dancing at the club with friends, giddy on alcohol and the promise of the future. It is only later, often much later, that you realise the significance of such moments. That you will never be 18 again, with this group of people and your whole life ahead of you like a sheet of white paper. A week of independence, every decision yours to make, teetering into adulthood. \u201cHey guys!\u201d I cry out to the girls, water lapping at my knees, \u201csorry to bother you, are you with schoolies?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d they reply politely. \u201cWe just live here.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "About 3 million Australians charged debts totalling $4.3bn by the Australian government may have been affected by an unlawful debt calculation practice. The commonwealth ombudsman has said an \u201cextremely large number of Australians [are] potentially significantly impacted\u201d in response to the latest estimate released by the Department of Social Services. The release under freedom of information laws raises questions about whether the government can properly remediate what it has previously described as an \u201cunquantifiable\u201d potential liability. The true impact could be even higher, with debts owed by deceased persons excluded from the estimate; this has led welfare expert Dr Christopher Rudge to argue that convictions based on dodgy debts are a \u201cmiscarriage of justice that will probably never see the light of day\u201d. Income apportionment is where a recipient\u2019s job income is divided over fortnightly periods in order to calculate support payments. In August 2023 the ombudsman released a report revealing that since at least 2003 Services Australia had been \u201cunlawfully apportioning customers\u2019 income\u201d. In some cases, the payslips relied on by Services Australia to calculate welfare debts don\u2019t align with the fortnightly income reporting periods. In these situations, the agency created a \u201cdaily\u201d average. The ombudsman found that under the process of \u201capportionment\u201d, welfare recipients\u2019 employment income was spread across two or more fortnightly periods, which are used to calculate entitlement to Centrelink payments such as jobseeker. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email At that time it was estimated that just 100,000 debts or potential debts were incorrectly calculated. The report caused a pause in repayments for 86,000 people and dozens of criminal prosecutions. According to the DSS estimate, \u201cat least 5.3 million debts held by 2.9 million Australians, totalling $4.3 billion, may be impacted by income apportionment\u201d. It said the estimate, produced on 22 October, reflects \u201call debts\u201d related to employment income and a payment and time period \u201cin which it is likely income apportionment was used\u201d. However, the department noted the figure is \u201cnot an estimate of the number of debts affected\u201d, merely those that \u201cmay be impacted\u201d, because \u201cit is not possible to know whether a debt is affected \u2026 without a manual investigation\u201d.

You have to ask: was it worth it?\u201d The 5.3m debts potentially affected represent 10% of the total of 53m social security and family payment debts recorded over a similar period. Sample tests conducted by Services Australia have found about 64% of employment income-related debts may be affected by income apportionment. When the debts were recalculated without using income apportionment, debts still existed in over 90% of cases \u2013 although they were smaller in 64% of cases, and actually grew in size in 29% of cases. Welfare expert Dr Darren O\u2019Donovan posted to LinkedIn that the estimate was \u201ca jaw dropping disclosure on the scale of income apportionment\u201d. O\u2019Donovan said the upcoming FTXB full federal court decision \u2013 which will establish the correct method of calculation \u2013 \u201chas to be the largest scale test case one has ever seen\u201d. The ombudsman said that the income apportionment issue was the result of a \u201cgenuinely\u201d held belief by Services Australia that its method was accurate, unlike the robodebt scandal which was \u201cinitiated and continued without legislative changes the agencies knew were required\u201d. But Rudge said the income apportionment issue suggested the government should \u201cpull back on the paranoia about the integrity of the welfare system, minimise enforcement and only go after those in the serious fraud category\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail failed to deliver about a quarter of first-class post on time in recent months, marking a worsening in its recent delivery performance, when it is already under investigation for missing delivery targets. The company that owns Royal Mail, International Distribution Services (IDS), said about 76% of first-class mail arrived within one working day in the three months to 29 September, lower than the 79% achieved in the previous quarter. It added that 92% of first-class post arrived within two days. Nearly 93% of second-class post was delivered on time, within three working days, which was also worse than the 94% of on-time deliveries made in the three months to the end of June. The deterioration in delivery times will put further pressure on the company\u2019s bosses just as a takeover deal is near to being finalised. It also means that the company is moving further away from the annual targets set by the communications watchdog, Ofcom, which has previously called Royal Mail\u2019s performance \u201cnot good enough\u201d. Its rules require Royal Mail to deliver 93% of first-class post within one working day and 98.5% of second-class post within three days. Royal Mail is already under investigation by Ofcom, which said in May it was looking into the company for missing its delivery time targets in the year to March 2024. Under the watchdog\u2019s requirements, Royal Mail should deliver at least 93% of first-class post across the UK within one working day of collection, and 98.5% of second-class post within three days over the whole financial year. Ofcom fined the company \u00a35.6m last November for failing to meet its first- and second-class delivery targets in the financial year to the end of March 2023. Royal Mail said it is taking action to improve its quality of service and adapt to the structural decline in the volume of letters. The Royal Mail chief operating officer, Alistair Cochrane, said: \u201cDelivering a high quality service to our customers remains our top priority.\u201d It comes as the Czech billionaire Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s takeover bid for Royal Mail is reportedly close to being finalised. The \u00a33.57bn takeover by Royal Mail\u2019s largest shareholder, K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s EP Group, was agreed by parent company IDS in May. However, the sale of the formerly state-owned service by a foreign buyer is being examined by the government under the National Security and Investment Act.

As a result, GD said: \u201cWe have decided not to put the issue of opening negotiations with the European Union on the agenda until the end of 2028. Also, we refuse any budgetary grant from the European Union until the end of 2028.\u201d The South Caucasus country of 3.7 million people has the aim of EU accession written into its constitution and has long been among the most pro-western of the Soviet Union\u2019s successor states. Within months of the downturn in relations, the EU had said Georgia\u2019s application for membership was frozen. The EU\u2019s ambassador to Georgia, Pawe\u0142 Herczy\u0144ski, described the effective halt of the country\u2019s EU path as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and also condemned police violence against protesters at the pro-EU demonstration on Thursday. Opinion polls show that about 80% of Georgians support EU membership, and the bloc\u2019s flag flies alongside the national flag outside almost all government buildings in the country. The pro-western opposition reacted to GD\u2019s announcement with fury as protesters massed. Local media reported that protests also erupted in provincial cities. Giorgi Vashadze, a prominent opposition leader, wrote on Facebook: \u201cThe self-proclaimed, illegitimate government has already legally signed the betrayal of Georgia and the Georgian people.\u201d Zourabichvili, a pro-EU critic of GD whose powers are mostly ceremonial, said the ruling party had \u201cdeclared not peace, but war against its own people, its past and future\u201d. Her term concludes in December and GD has put forward Mikheil Kavelashvili, a former Manchester City striker known for his staunchly anti-western views, as her successor. The opposition said that an October election, in which official results gave the GD bloc almost 54% of the vote, was fraudulent and have refused to take their seats. Western countries have demanded an inquiry into irregularities. A global research and data firm called the official results reported by the electoral commission \u201cstatistically impossible\u201d. Both GD and Georgia\u2019s election commission claim the election was free and fair. Thousands of Georgians took to the streets in late October to rally against the results of the contested parliamentary election, but the protests soon ended. The pro-EU opposition will now hope that GD\u2019s candid admission of plans to delay the country\u2019s EU integration aspirations will inspire more widespread and sustained protests in Tbilisi and across Georgia. There have also been signs of cracks in the country\u2019s elite. More than 100 serving Georgian diplomats have signed an open letter criticising the new government\u2019s suspension of EU accession talks and more than 45 officials at the country\u2019s defence ministry signed an open letter in favour of closer EU cooperation. Three leading Tbilisi universities said they were suspending studies amid the unrest. Earlier on Thursday, Kobakhidze claimed EU membership could harm Georgia\u2019s economy because it would require Tbilisi to cancel visa-free agreements and trade deals with other countries. The EU gave Georgia candidate status in December 2023, but has said that a number of laws passed since by GD, including curbs on \u201cforeign agents\u201d and LGBTQ+ rights, are authoritarian, Russian-inspired, and obstacles to EU membership. Foreign and domestic critics of GD say the party, which is seen as dominated by its billionaire founder, the former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, is steering Georgia back towards Moscow, from which it gained independence in 1991. Russia and Georgia have had no formal diplomatic relations since Moscow won a brief 2008 war, but have had a limited rapprochement recently. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, speaking during a visit to Kazakhstan, praised the \u201ccourage and character\u201d he said Georgian authorities had shown in passing the law on foreign agents, which domestic critics have likened to Russian legislation.

There are phone calls and texts delivering information too, and carrying only one side of the dialogue. The central reveal is truncated and does not create the horror it should. When Jade (Maya Bartley O\u2019Dea), a young white victim of sexual grooming enters, she seems like a functionary, delivering information, and we glean brief, confusing, hints of her story. One side-plot features a gay Muslim man, again off-stage, and it is moving but covered hastily, without the space it deserves, in a phone call.</p> <p>Under the direction of Esther Richardson, there is much speaking aloud of the themes which in themselves are important ones, very much of our times, but they are waiting to be built upon by the drama.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/expendable/\">Royal Court theatre, London</a>, until 21 December</p>",

There are phone calls and texts delivering information too, and carrying only one side of the dialogue. The central reveal is truncated and does not create the horror it should. When Jade (Maya Bartley O\u2019Dea), a young white victim of sexual grooming enters, she seems like a functionary, delivering information, and we glean brief, confusing, hints of her story. One side-plot features a gay Muslim man, again off-stage, and it is moving but covered hastily, without the space it deserves, in a phone call. Under the direction of Esther Richardson, there is much speaking aloud of the themes which in themselves are important ones, very much of our times, but they are waiting to be built upon by the drama. \u2022 At Royal Court theatre, London, until 21 December",

The best-of-14-games match is scheduled to take place from 23 November to 15 December at Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore for an overall prize fund of $2.5m (\u00a31.98m).</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ding became China's first men\u2019s world chess champion by defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi last year in Kazakhstan, winning the title vacated by longtime world No 1 Magnus Carlsen of Norway. But the 32-year-old from Zhejiang province has played only 44 classical games in the 19 months since winning the world title while battling personal difficulties including depression and will go off as an underdog in his first world title defense.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Gukesh, commonly known as Gukesh D, stunned the chess establishment by winning the eight-man Candidates tournament in Toronto aged 17 to become the youngest ever challenger for the world championship, finishing top of a stacked field that included Nepomniachtchi, Hikaru Nakamura and Fabiano Caruana. The 18-year-old can shatter the record for youngest ever world champion held by Garry Kasparov, who was 22 when he dethroned Karpov in their 1985 rematch in Moscow.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The format</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The match will consist of 14 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches seven and a half points first will be declared the champion.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The time control for each game in the classical portion is 120 minutes per side for the first 40 moves, then 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with a 30-second increment per move starting with move 41.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If the score is equal after 14 games, tiebreak games with faster time controls will be played:</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;A match consisting of four rapid games with 15 minutes per side and a 10-second increment starting with move 1 would be played. If a player scores 2\u00bd points or more, he would win the championship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;If the score is still equal, a mini-match of two rapid games would be played, with 10 minutes per side and a five-second increment starting with move 1. If a player scored 1\u00bd points or more, he would win the championship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;If the score is equal after the rapid portion, a mini-match of two blitz games would be played, with a time control of three minutes per side and a two-second increment starting with move 1. If a player scored 1\u00bd points or more, he would win the championship. A drawing of lots would take place before each mini-match to decide which player plays with the white pieces.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;If the blitz mini-match are tied, a single blitz game with a time control of three minutes per side and a two-second increment starting with move 1 would be played, and the winner would win the championship. A drawing of lots would decide which player plays with the white pieces. If this game was drawn, another blitz game with reversed colors would be played with the same time control, and the winner would win the championship. This process is repeated until either player wins a game.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Players are not allowed to agree to a draw before black's 40th move. A draw claim before then is only permitted if a threefold repetition or stalemate has occurred.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The schedule</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Sat 23 Nov</b> Opening ceremony and technical meeting</p>\n    <p><b>Sun 24 Nov</b> Rest day</p>\n    <p><b>Mon 25 Nov</b> Game 1</p>\n    <p><b>Tue 26 Nov</b> Game 2</p>\n    <p><b>Wed 27 Nov</b> Game 3</p>\n    <p><b>Thu 28 Nov</b> Rest day</p>\n    <p><b>Fri 29 Nov</b> Game 4</p>\n    <p><b>Sat 30 Nov</b> Game 5</p>\n    <p><b>Sun 1 Dec</b> Game 6</p>\n    <p><b>Mon 2 Dec</b> Rest day</p>\n    <p><b>Tue 3 Dec</b> Game 7</p>\n    <p><b>Wed 4 Dec</b> Game 8</p>\n    <p><b>Thu 5 Dec</b> Game 9</p>\n    <p><b>Fri 6 Dec</b> Rest day</p>\n    <p><b>Sat 7 Dec</b> Game 10</p>\n    <p><b>Sun 8 Dec</b> Game 11</p>\n    <p><b>Mon 9 Dec</b> Game 12</p>\n    <p><b>Tue 10 Dec</b> Rest Day</p>\n    <p><b>Wed 11 Dec</b> Game 13</p>\n    <p><b>Thu 12 Dec</b> Game 14</p>\n    <p><b>Fri 13 Dec</b> Tiebreaks (if necessary)</p>\n    <p><b>Sat 14 Dec</b> Closing ceremony</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>All games start at 5pm local time, 2.30pm in India, 9am in London, 4am in New York.</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, a crucial few weeks has just begun for England\u2019s leading masters and rising talents.

But don\u2019t forget, too, her roles in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/01/the-nutcracker-and-the-four-realms-review-keira-knightley\">2018 version</a> of The Nutcracker and the apocalyptic 2021 comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/01/silent-night-review-jolly-hockey-sticks-its-the-end-of-the-world-keira-knightley\">Silent Night</a>. Now, the new six-part Netflix comedy thriller Black Doves finds her gunning \u2013 literally, this time \u2013 for the Christmas audience. Knightley plays Helen, a spy recruited years earlier by the M-style boss (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/sarah-lancashire\">Sarah Lancashire</a>) of a shady international intelligence outfit. As the series begins, Helen\u2019s cover as the wife of a prominent MP is about to be blown, endangering the lives of her oblivious husband and children. Enter her protector, Sam, played by Ben Whishaw, whose arrival heralds a family-size helping of Christmas carnage.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to completely ruin the festivities with this one,\u201d says the 39-year-old Knightley, possibly thinking of the scene in which she greets Sam warmly while wearing an adversary\u2019s blood and brains all over her face. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling angry with your relatives and you want to see two possible psychopaths killing lots of people at Christmastime, this is the show to go for.\u201d</p> <p>Whishaw, 44, joins her today in a London hotel suite, wearing thick-framed Yvan-style glasses and a scraggly beard, which he has grown for his role in the current West End <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/jul/29/waiting-for-godot-samuel-beckett-ben-whishaw-james-macdonald\">revival of Beckett</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.waitingforgodottheplay.com/\">Waiting for Godot</a>. He is dressed in pistachio-coloured trousers and a green cardigan worn over a collarless grandad shirt, while Knightley sports an androgynous look (white shirt, black suit with fob watch, slicked-back hair) redolent of Joel Grey in Cabaret or Marlene Dietrich in Morocco.</p>    <p>Black Doves is tremendous fun, with special guests (Tracey Ullman, Paapa Essiedu, Kathryn Hunter, even Rat Scabies of the Damned) popping up like plums in a Christmas pudding, and Knightley and Whishaw making a fond, funny double act. Her two children, both under 10, were confused to learn that their mother was working with Paddington himself; Whishaw, after all, has provided the bear\u2019s soothing voice in all three films, including the latest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/04/paddington-in-peru-review\">Paddington in Peru</a>. \u201cThey thought I meant the actual bear,\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get it at all.\u201d A voice message from him as Paddington would make a priceless Christmas gift, I suggest. \u201cOh shit, yeah!\u201d coos Knightley, eyes sparkling.

Later in the series, we hear assassins discussing their favourite Christmas movies. Very meta. But is Black Doves the TV equivalent of East 17\u2019s Stay Another Day, which was a Christmas No 1 purely because of its blasted bells? \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d nods Whishaw, momentarily distracted. \u201cThat song has <em>nothing</em> to do with Christmas.\u201d Knightley points out that the seasonal setting of Black Doves does introduce a countdown element: \u201cIt all has to be wrapped up by Christmas so Helen can be with her children,\u201d she says. Whishaw notes \u201cthe absurdity of being bombarded with jolly songs when you\u2019re busy shooting everyone\u201d.</p> <p>Well, quite. Black Doves, black comedy: the violence is gory yet cartoonish. \u201c<em>He</em> gets blown out of two bloody buildings in a week,\u201d exclaims Knightley. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t have a scratch on him!\u201d</p> <p>Whishaw has done plenty of television work, scooping Baftas for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/jul/01/hollow-crown-richard-ii-shakespeare\">The Hollow Crown: Richard II</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/20/a-very-english-scandal-review-funny-and-confident-like-jeremy-thorpe\">A Very English Scandal</a> and the acerbic medical comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/08/this-is-going-to-hurt-review-ben-whishaw-stars-in-a-realism-packed-adaptation\">This Is Going to Hurt</a>.

Not forgetting an appearance back in 1995 at the age of nine as a child arrested for theft in The Bill. \u201cI was a tomboyish scruffbag at that age. Every other girl at the audition was having her hair brushed and wearing a party dress. And <em>I</em> was the one who got it.\u201d She still sounds chuffed. \u201cI was in year five and The Bill was the coolest fucking thing <em>ever</em>.\u201d</p>    <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really watch television,\u201d says Whishaw, drizzling on her parade. \u201cWhat, <em>nothing?</em>\u201d Knightley splutters. \u201cNot really,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t binge things. I wouldn\u2019t find that remotely relaxing.\u201d Having young children precludes Knightley\u2019s own binge-viewing, though her husband, the ex-Klaxons musician James Righton, recently took the kids away, leaving her to a week of comfort viewing: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/sep/05/the-perfect-couple-review-nicole-kidman-murder-mystery\">The Perfect Couple</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/26/nobody-wants-this-review-kristen-bell-and-adam-brodys-joyous-romcom-is-as-funny-as-when-harry-met-sally\">Nobody Wants This</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/18/rivals-review-even-the-naked-tennis-scene-is-a-triumph\">Rivals</a>. Her voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper: \u201cAnd I fucking <em>loved </em>all of it.\u201d</p> <p>Neither actor watches their own work but they have been debating whether to make an exception for Black Doves. At the very least, it may give them a better idea of what was going on. \u201cThe first few episodes were written when we started,\u201d says Knightley. \u201cBut not the rest. We didn\u2019t <em>entirely</em> know where we were going.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s generous,\u201d snorts Whishaw. \u201cWe had no clue!\u201d</p> <p>This, it seems, is the elastic approach of the show\u2019s creator, Joe Barton, whose past hits include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/17/giri-haji-review-kelly-macdonald-bbc-netflix\">Giri/Haji</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jun/16/the-lazarus-project-review-paapa-essiedu-thrills-in-fun-stylish-brain-scrambler\">The Lazarus Project</a>. \u201cHe writes to the areas and people that he finds interesting as he goes along,\u201d says Knightley. What can be ascertained from the first two episodes is that Sam is returning reluctantly to London, which was the scene of a difficult breakup with his boyfriend. He is casually carnal: in only his second scene, he is shown having sex against the window of his hotel room with a pick-up from the bar downstairs. Refreshingly, though, no special fuss is made about his sexuality.</p> <p>\u201cI like that he\u2019s just this queer guy who shoots people,\u201d says Whishaw. The actor previously described the fleeting reference to the sexuality of his character, Q, in the most recent James Bond film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/29/no-time-to-die-review-daniel-craig-dispatches-james-bond-with-panache-rage-and-cuddles\">No Time to Die</a>, as \u201cunsatisfying\u201d in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I do feel disappointed about that,\u201d he says now. \u201cI was just agreeing with the journalist because <em>he</em> was disappointed. I was saying: \u2018It\u2019s fair enough to feel that \u2026 \u2019 Someone else told me: \u2018It\u2019s a big deal that it\u2019s in the film at all.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Whishaw has been drawn to espionage repeatedly in his career, and has confessed to a general fascination with spies. I mention that it is common knowledge that his own German-Russian grandfather spied for the British during the second world war. At this, Knightley nearly leaps out of her seat. \u201c<em>I</em> didn\u2019t know that!\u201d she squawks, jaw hitting the floor. \u201cWell, we don\u2019t know much about what he did,\u201d he replies calmly. \u201cBut I can see why he made a good spy. He was taciturn. He sat there smoking in his armchair. And he had a skull ashtray.\u201d Whishaw mimes his grandfather flicking the ash into the skull. \u201cHe was frightening. He thought we looked like thugs, my brother and I, because we had short hair.</p>    <p>\u201cHe was someone to be cautious around. I think he was disappointed. The war had wrecked everyone\u2019s lives, and whatever ambitions they might have had. I think he wanted to be a writer. A poet. Instead, he ended up fixing radios in Britain, and selling them at a market. It\u2019s not what he thought life would be.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBless him. I don\u2019t mean to speak ill of him.\u201d At that, Knightley and I offer identical responses in stereo: \u201cHe sounds fascinating!\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Whishaw has followed in his grandfather\u2019s footsteps after all. Are the skillsets required by actors and spies so very different? \u201cI think all actors are always acting, all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich is really annoying. But it applies to everyone. You have to be an actor to live.\u201d</p> <p>Knightley warms to the idea. \u201cYou hide all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have an argument with your partner, you go into work, you go \u2018Hiii!\u2019 even though you\u2019re feeling like shit. That\u2019s what acting is.\u201d</p> <p>Helen in Black Doves is described as \u201ca coiled spring\u201d and \u201can intelligent risk-taker\u201d, which sums up many actors. \u201cYes,\u201d Knightley agrees. \u201cI think there\u2019s an inherent rage to actors. I see that quite a lot. Masked brilliantly but easy to access. Not that people behave badly, because generally they don\u2019t. But there\u2019s a well of anger that opens very quickly. It comes from this being such a subjective industry where it is very public when things go wrong. And it\u2019s an industry of people searching for a truth that by its very nature they can\u2019t find because it\u2019s fiction. Maybe that creates the coiled spring, which is where some performances come from.\u201d</p> <p>Whishaw leans forward, looking rapt. Does the description ring true to him? \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, then turns to Knightley: \u201cI\u2019m fascinated by how you articulated that.\u201d<br><br>She smiles back. \u201cThey\u2019re interesting creatures, actors. Funny creatures, I think.\u201d Does she have that well of anger in herself? \u201cSure! It\u2019s what I use. You use what\u2019s in you. You bring it out of yourself and then you just kind of \u2026 \u201d She makes a noise that is part splurge, part vomit, part conjuror\u2019s \u201cta-da!\u201d I ask how on earth I\u2019m supposed to spell that on the page, and her eyes glint wickedly. \u201cGood luck \u2013 and you\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p> <p><em>Black Doves is on Netflix from </em><em>5 December</em><em>.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "It has happened almost by stealth, and so incrementally that it might easily have passed without comment, but at last the truth can be revealed: Keira Knightley is out to monopolise Christmas. \u201cYes, I am planning to take it over,\u201d she confirms primly. Love Actually, in which her husband\u2019s best friend declares his love for her (creepily, if we\u2019re being honest) via cue cards as fairy lights twinkle around them, is the most overt part of the campaign so far. But don\u2019t forget, too, her roles in the 2018 version of The Nutcracker and the apocalyptic 2021 comedy Silent Night. Now, the new six-part Netflix comedy thriller Black Doves finds her gunning \u2013 literally, this time \u2013 for the Christmas audience. Knightley plays Helen, a spy recruited years earlier by the M-style boss (Sarah Lancashire) of a shady international intelligence outfit. As the series begins, Helen\u2019s cover as the wife of a prominent MP is about to be blown, endangering the lives of her oblivious husband and children. Enter her protector, Sam, played by Ben Whishaw, whose arrival heralds a family-size helping of Christmas carnage. \u201cI\u2019m planning to completely ruin the festivities with this one,\u201d says the 39-year-old Knightley, possibly thinking of the scene in which she greets Sam warmly while wearing an adversary\u2019s blood and brains all over her face. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling angry with your relatives and you want to see two possible psychopaths killing lots of people at Christmastime, this is the show to go for.\u201d Whishaw, 44, joins her today in a London hotel suite, wearing thick-framed Yvan-style glasses and a scraggly beard, which he has grown for his role in the current West End revival of Beckett\u2019s Waiting for Godot. He is dressed in pistachio-coloured trousers and a green cardigan worn over a collarless grandad shirt, while Knightley sports an androgynous look (white shirt, black suit with fob watch, slicked-back hair) redolent of Joel Grey in Cabaret or Marlene Dietrich in Morocco. Black Doves is tremendous fun, with special guests (Tracey Ullman, Paapa Essiedu, Kathryn Hunter, even Rat Scabies of the Damned) popping up like plums in a Christmas pudding, and Knightley and Whishaw making a fond, funny double act. Her two children, both under 10, were confused to learn that their mother was working with Paddington himself; Whishaw, after all, has provided the bear\u2019s soothing voice in all three films, including the latest, Paddington in Peru. \u201cThey thought I meant the actual bear,\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get it at all.\u201d A voice message from him as Paddington would make a priceless Christmas gift, I suggest. \u201cOh shit, yeah!\u201d coos Knightley, eyes sparkling. The terminally shy Whishaw clutches his head at the thought, folding himself up like a deck chair. Black Doves opens with Santa Claus elbowing his way through a crowded pub. Later in the series, we hear assassins discussing their favourite Christmas movies. Very meta. But is Black Doves the TV equivalent of East 17\u2019s Stay Another Day, which was a Christmas No 1 purely because of its blasted bells? \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d nods Whishaw, momentarily distracted. \u201cThat song has nothing to do with Christmas.\u201d Knightley points out that the seasonal setting of Black Doves does introduce a countdown element: \u201cIt all has to be wrapped up by Christmas so Helen can be with her children,\u201d she says.

Black Doves, black comedy: the violence is gory yet cartoonish. \u201cHe gets blown out of two bloody buildings in a week,\u201d exclaims Knightley. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t have a scratch on him!\u201d Whishaw has done plenty of television work, scooping Baftas for The Hollow Crown: Richard II, A Very English Scandal and the acerbic medical comedy This Is Going to Hurt. For Knightley, it has been movies all the way \u2013 Pride &amp; Prejudice, Atonement, the Pirates of the Caribbean series \u2013 with rare exceptions such as a 2002 Dr Zhivago miniseries. Not forgetting an appearance back in 1995 at the age of nine as a child arrested for theft in The Bill. \u201cI was a tomboyish scruffbag at that age.

But the 32-year-old from Zhejiang province has played only 44 classical games in the 19 months since winning the world title while battling personal difficulties including depression and will go off as an underdog in his first world title defense.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Gukesh, commonly known as Gukesh D, stunned the chess establishment by winning the eight-man Candidates tournament in Toronto aged 17 to become the youngest ever challenger for the world championship, finishing top of a stacked field that included Nepomniachtchi, Hikaru Nakamura and Fabiano Caruana. The 18-year-old can shatter the record for youngest ever world champion held by Garry Kasparov, who was 22 when he dethroned Karpov in their 1985 rematch in Moscow.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The format</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The match will consist of 14 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches seven and a half points first will be declared the champion.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The time control for each game in the classical portion is 120 minutes per side for the first 40 moves, then 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with a 30-second increment per move starting with move 41.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If the score is equal after 14 games, tiebreak games with faster time controls will be played:</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;A match consisting of four rapid games with 15 minutes per side and a 10-second increment starting with move 1 would be played. If a player scores 2\u00bd points or more, he would win the championship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;If the score is still equal, a mini-match of two rapid games would be played, with 10 minutes per side and a five-second increment starting with move 1. If a player scored 1\u00bd points or more, he would win the championship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;If the score is equal after the rapid portion, a mini-match of two blitz games would be played, with a time control of three minutes per side and a two-second increment starting with move 1. If a player scored 1\u00bd points or more, he would win the championship. A drawing of lots would take place before each mini-match to decide which player plays with the white pieces.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;If the blitz mini-match are tied, a single blitz game with a time control of three minutes per side and a two-second increment starting with move 1 would be played, and the winner would win the championship. A drawing of lots would decide which player plays with the white pieces. If this game was drawn, another blitz game with reversed colors would be played with the same time control, and the winner would win the championship. This process is repeated until either player wins a game.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Players are not allowed to agree to a draw before black's 40th move. A draw claim before then is only permitted if a threefold repetition or stalemate has occurred.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The schedule</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Sat 23 Nov</b> Opening ceremony and technical meeting</p>\n    <p><b>Sun 24 Nov</b> Rest day</p>\n    <p><b>Mon 25 Nov</b> Game 1</p>\n    <p><b>Tue 26 Nov</b> Game 2</p>\n    <p><b>Wed 27 Nov</b> Game 3</p>\n    <p><b>Thu 28 Nov</b> Rest day</p>\n    <p><b>Fri 29 Nov</b> Game 4</p>\n    <p><b>Sat 30 Nov</b> Game 5</p>\n    <p><b>Sun 1 Dec</b> Game 6</p>\n    <p><b>Mon 2 Dec</b> Rest day</p>\n    <p><b>Tue 3 Dec</b> Game 7</p>\n    <p><b>Wed 4 Dec</b> Game 8</p>\n    <p><b>Thu 5 Dec</b> Game 9</p>\n    <p><b>Fri 6 Dec</b> Rest day</p>\n    <p><b>Sat 7 Dec</b> Game 10</p>\n    <p><b>Sun 8 Dec</b> Game 11</p>\n    <p><b>Mon 9 Dec</b> Game 12</p>\n    <p><b>Tue 10 Dec</b> Rest Day</p>\n    <p><b>Wed 11 Dec</b> Game 13</p>\n    <p><b>Thu 12 Dec</b> Game 14</p>\n    <p><b>Fri 13 Dec</b> Tiebreaks (if necessary)</p>\n    <p><b>Sat 14 Dec</b> Closing ceremony</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>All games start at 5pm local time, 2.30pm in India, 9am in London, 4am in New York.</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After 24 Nxe4 and subsequent exchanges, the game transitioned into an equal rook endgame.

Earlier this week the government launched a fast-track consultation to determine what types of electric vehicles carmakers can sell after a ban on new petrol and diesel cars, which is due to come into force from 2030. The transport secretary, Louise Haigh, who resigned on Friday after it emerged she had been convicted of fraud in 2014 over a missing work phone, had been reported as being open to allowing the sale of \u201cfull hybrid\u201d models that use a normal engine as well as a battery, according to the Financial Times. This technology was pioneered by Toyota with its Prius model and is now used by several manufacturers. It cuts overall emissions but does not allow cars to drive for long periods without using the polluting petrol or diesel engine.

No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035. However, a decision to allow the sale of Prius-style cars after 2030 would be welcomed by the industry to help the transition away from full petrol and diesel cars. The Financial Times cited a government source who said that allowing the sale of full hybrids after 2030 would be a \u201cbreak glass in case of emergency\u201d scenario.

      "body": "<p>One of Gregg Wallace\u2019s wives used to be charged with compiling his daily to-do list. As the MasterChef host once explained, in words he somehow said out loud: \u201cIt starts off every morning with \u2018yoghurt\u2019, then \u2018leg band\u2019, then it\u2019ll be \u2018teeth\u2019, then it\u2019ll say \u2018tablets\u2019 because I\u2019ve got to take my cholesterol tablets and vitamin C, then \u2018check BBC News\u2019. Those are all the things I must do before I leave the flat. Then it\u2019ll say \u2018Twitter\u2019 because I want to tweet twice a day, then it\u2019ll say \u2018H\u2019 for Heidi because of all the things I need to discuss with her.\u201d </p> <p>As you can see, at no stage does this list say \u201cremove all clothes and walk around workplace with sock over penis\u201d \u2013 so it\u2019s a mystery why, in a period possibly contemporaneous with this list running his life, Gregg is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/nov/28/gregg-wallace-steps-away-from-masterchef-after-allegations-of-misconduct\">alleged to have done that</a>. And indeed, alleged to have joshed in a whole host of other inappropriate ways, over a period of 17 years, presumably under the aegis of other lists. Certainly while married to other wives. I\u2019m sure Gregg would say that the idea that any list could schedule and micromanage his critically acclaimed banter would be absolutely ludicrous \u2013 and yet, I\u2019m looking at the words \u201ccheck BBC News\u201d and thinking that perhaps he would not be the best arbiter of what is ludicrous.</p> <p>Nor is he allegedly the best arbiter of what constitutes suitable workplace conduct according to \u2013 oh dear \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd7n1e8n721o\">BBC News.</a> Evidence reportedly provided by 13 people and counting, including the broadcaster Kirsty Wark, casts Gregg as a serial indulger in \u201csexualised\u201d jokes and inappropriate behaviour. His lawyers deny he engaged in any sexual harassment. MasterChef is made by the production company Banijay UK, which is conducting an immediate review of the allegations, and has announced that Gregg will be \u201cstepping away\u201d from the show while it investigates. \u201cStepping away\u201d is rather a twee way of putting it. Then again, I always feel the words \u201chistorical allegations\u201d also create a misleadingly quaint impression. Reading them, it\u2019s hard not to think of Gregg allegedly behaving inappropriately at work while wearing a doublet and hose. Or, on this evidence, while not wearing them. Ye olde penis socke, perhaps.</p> <p>Before we go on, I should say that no one has alleged Gregg is some serious sex criminal \u2013 certainly not his lawyers. Indeed, there are already defenders out there posting along the lines of: \u201cOh my God the BBC is so woke for suspending him, I actually love being spoken to like this.\u201d Remarkably, they will also be the same people who frequently rage that the BBC is absolutely riddled with sex cases. Go figure. Actually, don\u2019t bother.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Gregg has posted <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DC7VdFvIHAW/?hl=en]\">yet another Instagram video</a> inspired by the allegations \u2013 videos that primarily have me asking: who on earth is Gregg Wallace\u2019s agent? What are you doing, mate? Maybe cut his internet? Tether him to his cross trainer?</p> <p>Because it is the videos that reveal far more than Gregg presumably intends about the whole business. Consider one from October, made after this story first started breaking, in which he hotly denies saying anything \u201csexual\u201d on the basis that: \u201cI have ALWAYS been true to my wife Anna, and have NEVER flirted or hit on anybody in the 12 years that I met her and fell in love with her\u201d.<strong> </strong>(Anna is wife number four, following Gregg\u2019s sundering with Heidi.)</p> <p>And there it is. You will note that Gregg seems to see all women as divided into two categories: the ones he would consider flirting with and hitting on (a category containing only his wife), and then all other ones, who just have to soak up the banter like they\u2019re a really absorbent kitchen towel. I can\u2019t help feeling that Gregg\u2019s mistake is not to have realised that there is actually a third category of women, which is by far and away the biggest category. In fact, it genuinely contains multitudes, and comprises the ones who honestly don\u2019t want to hear any of this boringly gross stuff, who make that abundantly clear by not \u201cgetting into the spirit\u201d of it, and whose cues deserve to be read and respected rather than repeatedly, endlessly ignored because you want to tell them you aren\u2019t wearing any pants.</p> <p>Amazing, really, that all Gregg seems to care about is the idea that people would think he had in some way disrespected his wife. The idea that there are multiple junior women who found his behaviour unpleasant to the point of complaint does not warrant acknowledgment in any of his video output thus far \u2013 not even a \u201csorry if I made anyone feel uncomfortable\u201d. Whatever he\u2019s serving, it certainly isn\u2019t humble pie.</p> <p>As I say, perhaps the agent should by now have delivered a primer? But if it falls to me to break it down for you, Gregg: <em>this is literally nothing to do with your wife</em>. Nothing. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s great and that\u2019s great.

      "bodyText": "One of Gregg Wallace\u2019s wives used to be charged with compiling his daily to-do list. As the MasterChef host once explained, in words he somehow said out loud: \u201cIt starts off every morning with \u2018yoghurt\u2019, then \u2018leg band\u2019, then it\u2019ll be \u2018teeth\u2019, then it\u2019ll say \u2018tablets\u2019 because I\u2019ve got to take my cholesterol tablets and vitamin C, then \u2018check BBC News\u2019. Those are all the things I must do before I leave the flat. Then it\u2019ll say \u2018Twitter\u2019 because I want to tweet twice a day, then it\u2019ll say \u2018H\u2019 for Heidi because of all the things I need to discuss with her.\u201d As you can see, at no stage does this list say \u201cremove all clothes and walk around workplace with sock over penis\u201d \u2013 so it\u2019s a mystery why, in a period possibly contemporaneous with this list running his life, Gregg is alleged to have done that. And indeed, alleged to have joshed in a whole host of other inappropriate ways, over a period of 17 years, presumably under the aegis of other lists. Certainly while married to other wives. I\u2019m sure Gregg would say that the idea that any list could schedule and micromanage his critically acclaimed banter would be absolutely ludicrous \u2013 and yet, I\u2019m looking at the words \u201ccheck BBC News\u201d and thinking that perhaps he would not be the best arbiter of what is ludicrous. Nor is he allegedly the best arbiter of what constitutes suitable workplace conduct according to \u2013 oh dear \u2013 BBC News. Evidence reportedly provided by 13 people and counting, including the broadcaster Kirsty Wark, casts Gregg as a serial indulger in \u201csexualised\u201d jokes and inappropriate behaviour. His lawyers deny he engaged in any sexual harassment. MasterChef is made by the production company Banijay UK, which is conducting an immediate review of the allegations, and has announced that Gregg will be \u201cstepping away\u201d from the show while it investigates. \u201cStepping away\u201d is rather a twee way of putting it. Then again, I always feel the words \u201chistorical allegations\u201d also create a misleadingly quaint impression. Reading them, it\u2019s hard not to think of Gregg allegedly behaving inappropriately at work while wearing a doublet and hose. Or, on this evidence, while not wearing them. Ye olde penis socke, perhaps. Before we go on, I should say that no one has alleged Gregg is some serious sex criminal \u2013 certainly not his lawyers. Indeed, there are already defenders out there posting along the lines of: \u201cOh my God the BBC is so woke for suspending him, I actually love being spoken to like this.\u201d Remarkably, they will also be the same people who frequently rage that the BBC is absolutely riddled with sex cases. Go figure. Actually, don\u2019t bother. Meanwhile, Gregg has posted yet another Instagram video inspired by the allegations \u2013 videos that primarily have me asking: who on earth is Gregg Wallace\u2019s agent? What are you doing, mate? Maybe cut his internet? Tether him to his cross trainer? Because it is the videos that reveal far more than Gregg presumably intends about the whole business. Consider one from October, made after this story first started breaking, in which he hotly denies saying anything \u201csexual\u201d on the basis that: \u201cI have ALWAYS been true to my wife Anna, and have NEVER flirted or hit on anybody in the 12 years that I met her and fell in love with her\u201d. (Anna is wife number four, following Gregg\u2019s sundering with Heidi.) And there it is. You will note that Gregg seems to see all women as divided into two categories: the ones he would consider flirting with and hitting on (a category containing only his wife), and then all other ones, who just have to soak up the banter like they\u2019re a really absorbent kitchen towel. I can\u2019t help feeling that Gregg\u2019s mistake is not to have realised that there is actually a third category of women, which is by far and away the biggest category. In fact, it genuinely contains multitudes, and comprises the ones who honestly don\u2019t want to hear any of this boringly gross stuff, who make that abundantly clear by not \u201cgetting into the spirit\u201d of it, and whose cues deserve to be read and respected rather than repeatedly, endlessly ignored because you want to tell them you aren\u2019t wearing any pants. Amazing, really, that all Gregg seems to care about is the idea that people would think he had in some way disrespected his wife. The idea that there are multiple junior women who found his behaviour unpleasant to the point of complaint does not warrant acknowledgment in any of his video output thus far \u2013 not even a \u201csorry if I made anyone feel uncomfortable\u201d. Whatever he\u2019s serving, it certainly isn\u2019t humble pie. As I say, perhaps the agent should by now have delivered a primer? But if it falls to me to break it down for you, Gregg: this is literally nothing to do with your wife. Nothing. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s great and that\u2019s great. This is about how you made women other than your wife feel. Mad that such creatures exist \u2013 and yet, they do, Some of them are probably even other people\u2019s wives. One of them seems to be Rod Stewart\u2019s wife. The point is: it is possible to repeatedly, serially be a dick to people you work with, and for it to be nothing at all to do with cheating.

      "body": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>Today I begin three days of being locked in a tiny, soundproofed, windowless room, alone except for a book. In so many ways, it is the dream. The only flaw is that the book is one I wrote and I have to read it aloud into a microphone so that it may be recorded and turned into an audiobook. So really, it\u2019s three days of continuous talking and of periodically hearing your voice played back to you so that you can hear where you went wrong. In other words, the nightmare.</p> <p>And that\u2019s before you get to all the typos and other more profound infelicities you notice in your prose only once you read it aloud. Dear God, you think. Who wrote this drivel? And then the crushing realisation: it was you. It took you ages and you really tried your best and now \u2013 this. You are a disgrace to the profession. And to typing.</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019s called Bookish: How Reading Shapes Our Lives. It\u2019s the sequel to Bookworm: A Memoir of Childhood Reading, and it\u2019s out next year, in case you\u2019re interested in making my pain worth it. </p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>Oh, to be young again! For once, I really mean it. According to David McDowall, the chief executive of Stonegate Group which runs more than 4,000 bars, the era of the big night out \u2013 Friday, Saturday, Friday into Saturday \u2013 is well and truly over. The busiest hour at the Slug and Lettuce chain, for example, is now 3-4pm on a Saturday instead of 9-10pm. On Friday nights, they host bingo events, so sparse is attendance otherwise.</p> <p>A mere 30 years too late, the world is being remade to suit me. Young people are finally admitting that going out is awful and that home and bed by nine is the time and place to be. I\u2019m so proud of them, and relieved. I feel like a mother hen counting her chicks back into the coop for the night and tucking them safely under her till morning.</p> <p>Of course, there are some who say this is a sign of the parlous state of youngsters\u2019 finances, mental health and that their energy is being sapped by the precarity of their jobs and the demands of the side-hustles needed to keep the business of life afloat. I choose to ignore such possibilities and imagine instead that this is a sign of progress, a sign that people are no longer allowing themselves to be pressed by their extrovert peers into nights of loud, pointless misery but heading home to wrap themselves in the inestimable pleasures of the duvet and Brooklyn Nine-Nine repeats instead, as they always wanted. Proud, I am. Proud.</p>    <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>Rumours abound that Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s vaginal maintenance empire Goop is about to fall. There have been three rounds of redundancies this year and a restructuring of the business that at one point was valued at \u00a3199m.</p> <p>This cannot be allowed to happen.

      "bodyText": "Monday Today I begin three days of being locked in a tiny, soundproofed, windowless room, alone except for a book. In so many ways, it is the dream. The only flaw is that the book is one I wrote and I have to read it aloud into a microphone so that it may be recorded and turned into an audiobook. So really, it\u2019s three days of continuous talking and of periodically hearing your voice played back to you so that you can hear where you went wrong. In other words, the nightmare. And that\u2019s before you get to all the typos and other more profound infelicities you notice in your prose only once you read it aloud. Dear God, you think. Who wrote this drivel? And then the crushing realisation: it was you. It took you ages and you really tried your best and now \u2013 this. You are a disgrace to the profession. And to typing. Anyway, it\u2019s called Bookish: How Reading Shapes Our Lives. It\u2019s the sequel to Bookworm: A Memoir of Childhood Reading, and it\u2019s out next year, in case you\u2019re interested in making my pain worth it. Tuesday Oh, to be young again! For once, I really mean it. According to David McDowall, the chief executive of Stonegate Group which runs more than 4,000 bars, the era of the big night out \u2013 Friday, Saturday, Friday into Saturday \u2013 is well and truly over. The busiest hour at the Slug and Lettuce chain, for example, is now 3-4pm on a Saturday instead of 9-10pm. On Friday nights, they host bingo events, so sparse is attendance otherwise. A mere 30 years too late, the world is being remade to suit me. Young people are finally admitting that going out is awful and that home and bed by nine is the time and place to be. I\u2019m so proud of them, and relieved. I feel like a mother hen counting her chicks back into the coop for the night and tucking them safely under her till morning. Of course, there are some who say this is a sign of the parlous state of youngsters\u2019 finances, mental health and that their energy is being sapped by the precarity of their jobs and the demands of the side-hustles needed to keep the business of life afloat. I choose to ignore such possibilities and imagine instead that this is a sign of progress, a sign that people are no longer allowing themselves to be pressed by their extrovert peers into nights of loud, pointless misery but heading home to wrap themselves in the inestimable pleasures of the duvet and Brooklyn Nine-Nine repeats instead, as they always wanted. Proud, I am. Proud. Wednesday Rumours abound that Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s vaginal maintenance empire Goop is about to fall. There have been three rounds of redundancies this year and a restructuring of the business that at one point was valued at \u00a3199m. This cannot be allowed to happen. Not just because of all the ladyparts dependent on Paltrow\u2019s steamers, but because there is nothing else out there that gives us mere mortals such a laugh. And never more so, I found, than when our labial queen launched a Netflix documentary series about her wellness mission, The Goop Lab, in which it was revealed that Paltrow didn\u2019t actually know what a vagina was. The late, great old-school feminist and female masturbation workshopper Betty Dodson pointed out that that was just the birth canal. \u201cYa wanna talk about the vulva \u2013 that\u2019s the clitoris, the inner lips and all that good shit around it.\u201d The high priestess of the pudenda was shook. \u201cI thought the vagina was the whole thing?\u201d Perhaps this is the moment Goop\u2019s fortunes began to turn. Let us hope they turn back. There is little enough humour in the world right now. Thursday Wine is over, stinky plebs! It\u2019s all about olive oil now. God, the middle classes are awful. Apparently we are raising liquid fat to high art now. Booze was evidently getting too easy. Everyone knew roughly what they liked to drink and what to bring to what kind of do, so of course some numbnuts have moved the goalposts so that everyone wishes they were dead again. Now, to mix my metaphors because I\u2019ve just spent three days expunging them from the stupid book I wrote and they\u2019ve got to go somewhere, there is a new minefield to pick your way through and a new set of properties to pretend you can discern.

The president-elect appears to have settled on a number of cabinet nominees himself without being aggressively pushed by advisers, including Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, Marco Rubio for secretary of state and Russ Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget. But for other cabinet roles or major White House positions for which Trump did not have a clear preference or a frontrunner in mind, a handful of individuals with outsized influence have come to dominate the decision-making in meetings and interviews being held at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. There are still factions, according to half a dozen people involved in transition planning, though they have been nowhere near as concrete as they were in 2017, when there were clear demarcations between Trump\u2019s family, the Republican National Committee, establishment Republicans and people allied with Trump\u2019s strategist Steve Bannon. And in recent months, the previously distinct camp informally led by Wiles, who has had influence over West Wing picks and some cabinet roles, and the other camp led by Vance have combined and engulfed the wider Trump orbit, the people said. \u201cIt\u2019s ever-shifting sands of allegiance. The people who you think are your friends may not be the case in 24 hours. We\u2019re all friends but none of us are friends,\u201d said one person adjacent to the Trump team. Although there are people in Trump\u2019s orbit who disagree with Epshteyn, there is universal acknowledgment that he has had significant influence in the first weeks of the presidential transition, a reflection of Trump\u2019s appreciation for his help in coordinating the defeat of the criminal cases against him. When Trump floated the idea of having the congressman Matt Gaetz for attorney general, Epshteyn was supportive of him during a round-trip flight from Palm Beach, Florida, to Washington when the president-elect announced he was nominating Gaetz. After the Gaetz nomination sank in the face of holdout Senate Republicans refusing to confirm him over sexual misconduct allegations, Trump nominated as a replacement former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi \u2013 who has been friendly over the years with Epshteyn. Epshteyn has also played key roles in finalizing the leadership at the justice department, recommending that Trump keep his personal lawyers in key jobs: Todd Blanche for deputy attorney general, Emil Bove for the principal deputy position and John Sauer for solicitor general. One through-line about those lawyers was that they were successful in delaying until after the election the federal criminal cases against Trump, which were dismissed on Monday. But the other was that they were all recruited by Epshteyn. Epshteyn, whose physically imposing presence is regularly fitted into a navy three-piece suit, has flexed his power away from the department as well, recommending Bill McGinley to be the next White House counsel. Epshteyn has told associates that the choices are for Trump to make. Some of the picks he has suggested have been names endorsed by other allies or people who have appeared on his longtime friends Steve Bannon\u2019s War Room podcast. From the outside, Bannon pushed for McGinley to be White House counsel and may yet get another victory if Trump picks Kash Patel, a regular guest on War Room, for the FBI director or the deputy FBI director roles for which he remains in the running, the Guardian has reported. Bannon lobbied for Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget and, in a particularly audacious play, managed to get Sebastian Gorka, the deeply polarizing national security aide from the first Trump administration, into the incoming team as the senior counter-terrorism director. He also played an instrumental role in bringing Scott Bessent to the fore, according to a person directly familiar with the matter. Bannon made the first introduction to Trump years ago, while his allies have advocated for him at Mar-a-Lago and pushed his agenda. But a main power center for cabinet picks is widely seen to rest with JD Vance\u2019s crew, which pushed for Bessent to be named as treasury secretary and Brendan Carr to lead the Federal Communications Commission, among others. The Vance crew is informally said to involve Trump\u2019s eldest son, Don Jr \u2013 who pushed for Vance to be his father\u2019s running mate \u2013 and Don Jr\u2019s close advisers including Arthur Schwartz and Andrew Surabian, as well as former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. In addition to being seen as getting Bessent the nod when Trump still had his doubts, the Vance crew have earned additional juice with Trump in probably securing enough Republican votes for Hegseth to be confirmed as defense secretary, despite another set of sexual misconduct allegations. For West Wing picks, the incoming White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, has extended her personal influence with Trump. Wiles has mostly been able to get the staff of her choosing without having to fight against competing interests. Wiles\u2019s top aides have landed in deputy chief of staff roles, including James Blair for legislative policy, Taylor Budowich for presidential personnel and Steven Cheung as communications director \u2013 although the factions are amorphous and Budowich and Cheung are also close to the Vance crew. Then there are individuals \u2013 relative newcomers to the Trump orbit \u2013 who have been in transition meetings at Mar-a-Lago as a result of their unique situations: Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, and Howard Lutnick, the chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald, who is also the co-chair of the Trump transition team. By weighing in on major cabinet picks, Musk has gotten on the nerves of some Trump loyalists, including Epshteyn, who have complained that the billionaire knows little of the Trump agenda they are trying to bring about and has little idea about who would be best placed to enact it. Lutnick has retained his authority through his transition co-chair role, although he recently engaged in some accidental self-sabotage by pushing too hard to be treasury secretary and appeared to have been caught in a leak investigation over the nominee for secretary of agriculture. Trump was irritated by Musk\u2019s post on X pushing Lutnick for treasury secretary, which gave an opening for his main rival Bessent to secure the job instead. Still, Lutnick has continued to be close to Trump and last week was named commerce secretary. Musk, who is staying off-site in Palm Beach, has become more judicious with his interactions with Trump since that episode and after he secured himself his own role to lead the so-called \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d.",

We know this through the testimony of the women in his life: Popo, a sex worker for whom he has a vicious passion; Mana Lala, the mother of his son, Chunksee; Rosie, a shopkeeper who remembers him as a \u201craggedy\u201d orphan; and Doris, a social-climbing beauty who carries herself \u201clike I already married a rich man and was living in a big, brick house with a motor car parked up outside\u201d.</p> <p>Ingrid Persaud\u2019s vivid and fitfully violent novel is the fictionalised story of the real-life Singh, who terrorised the denizens of Port of Spain and the Gulf of Paria in the 1940s and 50s. Boysie is bad news but he also has a rare charisma, which means women can rarely resist him. At the start, we learn via a newspaper article that Boysie has been hanged for murder. Shortly before he died, he protested his innocence, claiming: \u201cI always tried to help people and that is how I got a great deal of my troubles. That is what has me here now.\u201d The hangman, the article continues, \u201cwas paid $77 per man for his duties.\u201d</p> <p>This story, which alternates between the four women, is told in Trinidadian dialect and narrated by Persaud (who reads Mana Lala), Melanie La Barrie (Popo), Martina Laird (Doris) and Chanel Quesnel (Rosie).

We know this through the testimony of the women in his life: Popo, a sex worker for whom he has a vicious passion; Mana Lala, the mother of his son, Chunksee; Rosie, a shopkeeper who remembers him as a \u201craggedy\u201d orphan; and Doris, a social-climbing beauty who carries herself \u201clike I already married a rich man and was living in a big, brick house with a motor car parked up outside\u201d. Ingrid Persaud\u2019s vivid and fitfully violent novel is the fictionalised story of the real-life Singh, who terrorised the denizens of Port of Spain and the Gulf of Paria in the 1940s and 50s. Boysie is bad news but he also has a rare charisma, which means women can rarely resist him. At the start, we learn via a newspaper article that Boysie has been hanged for murder. Shortly before he died, he protested his innocence, claiming: \u201cI always tried to help people and that is how I got a great deal of my troubles. That is what has me here now.\u201d The hangman, the article continues, \u201cwas paid $77 per man for his duties.\u201d This story, which alternates between the four women, is told in Trinidadian dialect and narrated by Persaud (who reads Mana Lala), Melanie La Barrie (Popo), Martina Laird (Doris) and Chanel Quesnel (Rosie). Their performances are lively and richly textured, with each character viewing this dangerous man through the lens of their own experience and desires. \u2022 Available via Faber, 14hr 11min Further listening Boy from the Valleys Luke Evans, Penguin Audio, 9hr 50min The Hobbit actor reads his memoir which plots his path from Pontypool in south Wales where he was raised as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness all the way to Hollywood.

The food historian and typographer Gillian Riley, who has died aged 90, fulfilled all these requirements when composing that very book. That a single person was able to master the labyrinthine complexities of Italian food culture, embracing history, literature, the visual arts, politics and an infinite quantity of processes, ingredients and recipes is remarkable.

MPs recounted their personal experiences of illness and death, and the appeals they have heard from their constituents on assisted dying.

      "body": "<p>This could have been the week that finished Julen Lopetegui at West Ham. Given a fortnight to save his job, the manager met the challenge head on in the first and lifted the pressure by masterminding a disciplined, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/newcastle-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">clever 2-0 victory</a> at Newcastle on&nbsp;Monday.</p> <p>Here, after a series of underwhelming performances, was belated evidence of why West Ham replaced David Moyes with Lopetegui in the summer. Internally there was satisfaction that the international break had not been used to make a change. West Ham, who go into Saturday evening\u2019s home game with Arsenal in a curious spot, six points above the bottom three and seven off the top four, can see how hard Lopetegui has been working to reverse the slump. Although their faith has been tested, they were determined not to act hastily and it is hoped the&nbsp;win over Newcastle will not prove to be the exception rather than the norm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/ruud-van-nistelrooy-set-to-succeed-steve-cooper-as-leicester-manager\">Ruud van Nistelrooy set to succeed Steve Cooper as Leicester manager</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet it should not be overlooked that West Ham\u2019s response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/west-ham-everton-premier-league-match-report\">grim 0-0 home draw with Everton</a> this month was to begin considering potential replacements. Alarm bells were ringing, intermediaries were on alert and there were suggestions that a heavy defeat to Newcastle would have forced David Sullivan, the largest shareholder, into an uncharacteristically early&nbsp;dismissal.</p> <p>It means, then, that questions remain over whether this was more than a one-off. Comparisons can be drawn to Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s reprieve when West Ham won 1-0 at Chelsea in November 2019. That result came out of nowhere, like the one at Newcastle, but it did not do much for Pellegrini given that he departed the club a month later.</p> <p>In that context Lopetegui needs to keep his guard up. Although suggestions that the former Borussia Dortmund manager Edin Terzic was being lined up to take over are wide of the mark, the situation remains precarious. Another bad run would inevitably bring more noise. Some at the club were unsure about Lopetegui\u2019s appointment and suggested alternatives. However Sullivan, still&nbsp;the main power, has championed the 57-year-old and is determined to give him time to silence the doubters.</p>    <p>That support is vital for Lopetegui, who benefited from altering his tactics against Newcastle. Aaron Wan-Bissaka, the former Manchester United right-back, played a more conventional role, having spent most of his previous outings operating unconvincingly as an inverted full-back. </p> <p>Lucas Paquet\u00e1, who had a point to prove after being dropped by Brazil, had his best game since March.

      "bodyText": "This could have been the week that finished Julen Lopetegui at West Ham. Given a fortnight to save his job, the manager met the challenge head on in the first and lifted the pressure by masterminding a disciplined, clever 2-0 victory at Newcastle on Monday. Here, after a series of underwhelming performances, was belated evidence of why West Ham replaced David Moyes with Lopetegui in the summer. Internally there was satisfaction that the international break had not been used to make a change. West Ham, who go into Saturday evening\u2019s home game with Arsenal in a curious spot, six points above the bottom three and seven off the top four, can see how hard Lopetegui has been working to reverse the slump. Although their faith has been tested, they were determined not to act hastily and it is hoped the win over Newcastle will not prove to be the exception rather than the norm. Yet it should not be overlooked that West Ham\u2019s response to the grim 0-0 home draw with Everton this month was to begin considering potential replacements. Alarm bells were ringing, intermediaries were on alert and there were suggestions that a heavy defeat to Newcastle would have forced David Sullivan, the largest shareholder, into an uncharacteristically early dismissal. It means, then, that questions remain over whether this was more than a one-off. Comparisons can be drawn to Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s reprieve when West Ham won 1-0 at Chelsea in November 2019. That result came out of nowhere, like the one at Newcastle, but it did not do much for Pellegrini given that he departed the club a month later. In that context Lopetegui needs to keep his guard up. Although suggestions that the former Borussia Dortmund manager Edin Terzic was being lined up to take over are wide of the mark, the situation remains precarious. Another bad run would inevitably bring more noise. Some at the club were unsure about Lopetegui\u2019s appointment and suggested alternatives. However Sullivan, still the main power, has championed the 57-year-old and is determined to give him time to silence the doubters. That support is vital for Lopetegui, who benefited from altering his tactics against Newcastle. Aaron Wan-Bissaka, the former Manchester United right-back, played a more conventional role, having spent most of his previous outings operating unconvincingly as an inverted full-back. Lucas Paquet\u00e1, who had a point to prove after being dropped by Brazil, had his best game since March. Michail Antonio worked hard up front and bullied Lloyd Kelly. Jarrod Bowen and Crysencio Summerville were lively on the flanks. Tomas Soucek got one of his characteristic big goals. There were flashes of the old Moyesian grit, physicality and counterattacking threat, along with greater calm on the ball. West Ham had faltered at St James\u2019 Park last season, throwing away a two-goal lead and losing 4-3 after a defensive substitution from Moyes. This time, they calmly saw it out after Bowen sent Wan-Bissaka through to make it 2-0 early in the second half. This, at long last, was a team with an identity. There have been times when it is hard to work out what Lopetegui wants. West Ham have lacked conviction when playing out from the back. They have been open on transitions \u2013 Wan-Bissaka\u2019s positioning had not helped \u2013 and vulnerable to pace in central areas.

Perhaps he has not forgotten that last month\u2019s flukey win over Manchester United was followed by Edson \u00c1lvarez picking up his second red card of the season when West Ham lost 3-0 to Nottingham Forest a week later. Discipline has been an issue. Mohammed Kudus lost his head against Spurs and will serve the last of his five-match ban on Saturday.

Having been elected in 2015, she was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership that year. She was rewarded for that decision with a frontbench role when he made her a shadow Cabinet Office minister aged just 28. The MP for Sheffield Heeley rose through the junior ministerial ranks and was one of a handful of Corbyn\u2019s frontbench to be appointed to Keir Starmer\u2019s first cabinet when he took over. She became the shadow Northern Ireland secretary. Known for her vivid red hair and engaging communication style, she retained her frontbench role even as Starmer moved his party to the right, becoming a rare outspoken leftwinger within his top team. Haigh won plaudits for the deft and dedicated way she handled the Northern Ireland brief, and was moved to transport in 2021, where she began work on Labour\u2019s plans to renationalise the railways. The seeds of her downfall had already been sown however, seven years earlier when she worked in the private sector for the insurance company Aviva. One night in 2013, Haigh was coming home from a night out in London when she was mugged. Friends say the attack was on the verge of becoming violent. In her resignation letter to Starmer on Friday morning she described the ordeal as \u201cterrifying\u201d. That night, friends say, Haigh got home and went through her bag to check what items had been taken, and discovered that her work phone was not there. She went to police to notify them and her employer duly gave her a new mobile. Some time later, Haigh\u2019s allies say she discovered her old phone in a drawer, switched it on to check the messages, and then put it back again, apparently thinking nothing more of it. The signal however had been picked up by the phone company, which alerted the police, who then asked Haigh to come in and make a statement. The exact timeline of what happened next is disputed, but one person with knowledge of the events says it took several months for Haigh to go in and speak to the police. She declined to comment throughout her police interview, which she said on Thursday was as a result of her lawyer\u2019s advice. In 2014, she pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation. \u201cThe police referred the matter to the CPS and I appeared before Southwark magistrates,\u201d Haigh said in a statement on Thursday night. \u201cUnder the advice of my solicitor I pleaded guilty, despite the fact this was a genuine mistake from which I did not make any gain. \u201cThe magistrates accepted all of these arguments and gave me the lowest possible outcome (a discharge) available.\u201d Meanwhile, sources say Aviva had become aware of at least one other mobile phone that had gone missing, and had begun an investigation. Haigh\u2019s allies insist that while she may have mislaid other phones \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly for a partygoing twentysomething living in London \u2013 none of these were as a result of criminality or fraud. But sources say the fact that Aviva had launched an investigation suggests the company had questions over whether she was deliberately mislaying phones in order to get upgrades. Eventually Haigh resigned from Aviva, an act that friends say was prompted by what she saw as the unfairness of the company\u2019s investigation. Aviva declined to comment. As she moved on with her career, Haigh put the mugging and the mobile phone controversy behind her, and her conviction expired. Her allies say she told Starmer about it when he appointed her to the shadow cabinet and that he was supportive, saying it sounded as if she had been mistreated by the criminal justice system. Downing Street on Thursday declined to confirm that version of events. Haigh did not mention the conviction to the government\u2019s propriety and ethics team when she entered the cabinet earlier this year, because she was only asked about unspent convictions. The incident had been largely forgotten by all parties concerned. Haigh set to work as transport secretary, becoming one of the first cabinet secretaries to pass a piece of legislation through parliament, with her bill to renationalise the railways. She also won praise for smaller political decisions, such as switching off the giant electronic advertising display at Euston station that had earned bitter complaints from regular commuters. Earlier this year, however, Haigh landed in hot water for saying she was boycotting P&amp;O Ferries over its previous treatment of employees, just as the ferry company\u2019s owner was planning to announce a \u00a31bn investment in the UK. With P&amp;O\u2019s parent company threatening to pull out of the investment, Downing Street distanced itself from her comments, and reports began to emerge suggesting she would be the first to be sacked in any future reshuffle. Her allies say she was left feeling isolated and bruised by the row. It was to be a much older controversy that caused Haigh\u2019s eventual downfall, however.

She did so in a page-long letter on Friday morning which praised him and his government, insisting she remained \u201ctotally committed to our political project\u201d. The terseness of Starmer\u2019s response gave an indication of how far the two had drifted apart. \u201cThank you for all you have done to deliver this government\u2019s ambitious transport agenda,\u201d the prime minister wrote in a two-paragraph letter. \u201cYou have made huge strides to take our rail system back into public ownership through the creation of Great British Railways, investing \u00a31bn in our vital bus services and lowering cost for motorists. \u201cI know you still have a huge contribution to make in the future.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Men don\u2019t pay and won\u2019t pay. Governments for more than 30 years have failed abysmally to make fathers pay for their children. The latest report, following a long line of them, shows how few fathers are paying maintenance, and how many separated mothers are giving up in despair. Child poverty has risen to 44% in single-parent households, but when children do receive maintenance it cuts the child poverty rate by 25%. Why does the state fail to collect on children\u2019s behalf?</p> <p>The long and sorry saga of the Child Support Agency began in 1993. It was disastrously mismanaged from the start, arousing maximum rage with rebellious fathers\u2019 protests for minimum actual collection of cash. When it was shut down, billions in arrears owed to mothers and children were simply wiped clean, never collected. The Child Maintenance Service (CMS) that replaced it has done no better. <a href=\"https://www.gingerbread.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Gingerbread-Fix-The-CMS-Report-WEB.pdf\">This week\u2019s report</a> from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and Gingerbread, the single parents\u2019 charity, finds 41% of parents caring for children (almost all women) have no maintenance agreement at all from non-resident parents (almost all fathers). They have been failed by the CMS.</p> <p>Parliament passes ever more legislation and regulation designed to make fathers pay, but this has been gesture politics, performative indignation that shows how little effect any law has without effective enforcement. I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/03/fathers-children-poverty-child-maintenance-biased-against-women\">wrote about this</a> two years ago, and in that time things have only got worse. The CMS has magnificently draconian powers on paper. If a father fails to pay the sum assessed, the CMS can take payments directly from his salary or his bank account. It can remove his passport and his driving licence until he pays up. It can even imprison him. If you didn\u2019t know that, it\u2019s because those powers are virtually never used: the CMS has removed just three passports and one driving licence since 2019. Boris Johnson\u2019s government ran a consultation proposing a tag and a curfew to make recalcitrant fathers \u201cremain at a specified place at specified times\u201d for up to six months, but they dropped it, saying they would \u201ckeep it under review\u201d.</p> <p>What the CMS has never had is the administrative capacity to impose those laws. Between 2019 and 2024 it suffered cuts from 5,958 staff to 3,779, despite rising number of mothers applying. It\u2019s not the fault of the beleaguered civil servants in an understaffed service. No surprise there\u2019s a high staff turnover: it must be the job from hell coping with distraught mothers, while trying to get honest earnings information from furious fathers.</p> <p>I talked to one mother of three children who has been failing to get what she is owed by her ex-husband for so long that she advises others on dealing with the CMS. After being abused by him for years \u2013 three wrist-breaks, two skull fractures and a rape ascertained in the family courts \u2013 she finally left when he hit their children. Sometimes he pays, sometimes not, and arrears over the years have amounted to about \u00a311,000. Her home was repossessed this month for non-payment of her mortgage, after Liz Truss\u2019s budget sent it soaring. As so many find, retelling their story over and again to a new person on the phone (often with two-hour waits, says the report), inexperienced CMS staff are \u201ctoo easily convinced by fathers\u201d. This woman\u2019s ex did what many do, on getting a CMS demand: \u201cHe got his employer to make him self-employed, and had the money paid to his girlfriend\u2019s account, and said he had nothing.\u201d When a bailiff went round he took out a knife and threatened suicide so he was written off as \u201ctoo vulnerable\u201d. She says he\u2019s a high earner and he and his partner flaunt their wealth online, taking holidays she and her children could never afford. She says they post poisonous stories about her on social media. Last Christmas she and her children relied on food banks.</p> <p>Imagine working at the CMS in the midst of all that, with a short time for each call, not on a high pay grade. With no dedicated caseworkers, every call means starting again from the beginning. It would take very skilled and sensitive staff to deal with the high proportion of domestic violence cases: they get just three hours\u2019 domestic abuse training. Good fathers who do pay find the service as difficult, both sides believing the CMS biased against them, both believing it makes friction worse.</p> <p>Some non-payers are put on a collect and pay system, where the CMS collects the money on the mother\u2019s behalf. But if he still doesn\u2019t pay, it\u2019s the mother who gets nothing. Why doesn\u2019t the state pursue him? Because it\u2019s not the state that forfeits the payment. The state is exceedingly \u2013 sometimes excessively \u2013 good at chasing after fines and debts. Look how the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) pursued vulnerable carers after they were mistakenly overpaid a carer\u2019s allowance, seeking mammoth amounts that carers never knew they owed, until Patrick Butler\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/series/carers-allowance-crisis\">Guardian investigation</a> hounded them into relenting. How about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/27/passengers-rail-ticketing-britain-transport-secretary-louise-haigh\">prosecuting someone for \u00a31.90</a> for a possibly wrong train ticket? </p> <p>Since the DWP is so good at chasing after small benefits infractions, it\u2019s time it took on the duty to collect from non-paying fathers. Once the CMS has awarded maintenance, if the father fails to pay up, the DWP should pay the mother the missing money. If it were the state, not the mother and children, out of pocket, the chances are the DWP would pursue the father with far more vigour, and children get the money they need. This government has already recommitted to Labour\u2019s aim to abolish child poverty. Much of that will depend on better benefits and better childcare, with work and training support from jobcentres. But a good place to begin would be with those many children who deserve maintenance from their fathers. There has always been something bizarre about the state\u2019s inability \u2013 or fundamental unwillingness \u2013 to level up the costs of children between mothers and fathers.</p> <ul> <li><p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p></li> <li><p>In the UK, call the national <a href=\"https://www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk/\">domestic abuse helpline</a> on 0808 2000 247, or visit <a href=\"https://www.womensaid.org.uk/\">Women\u2019s Aid</a>.

How long will this bromance last? | Katrina vanden Heuvel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hiller started the sticker range last year after deciding against buying a Tesla due to Musk\u2019s \u201camplifying of horrible people and silencing of others\u201d on X, formerly Twitter, another of his companies. Several hundred stickers a day are now being sold, primarily to Tesla owners, Hiller said, bearing texts such as \u201cAnti Elon Tesla Club\u201d or \u201cI Bought This Before Elon Went Crazy\u201d, or a picture of Musk in clown makeup with the words \u201cSpace Clown\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPeople keep telling me that they feel they can drive their Teslas again with these stickers,\u201d said Hiller, who has had to set aside part of his house to accommodate the growing operation. Hiller devises slogans such as \u201cElon Ate My Cat\u201d, a reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/14/racist-history-trump-pet-eating-immigrant\">a debunked falsehood</a> about migrants eating pets in Ohio, that are then sold on Etsy and Amazon. \u201cPeople are shaken up. It\u2019s a relief really to see they are awake,\u201d he said of the surging demand.</p> <p>Musk, who has an estimated <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/\">wealth</a> of $314bn, was once considered an environmental hero and technology pioneer by many US liberals after turning Tesla into the most <a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/the-10-most-valuable-auto-companies-in-the-world\">valuable</a> car company in the world while warning that \u201cclimate change is the biggest threat that humanity faces this century, except for AI\u201d.</p> <p>But his reputation among electric vehicle-buying liberals curdled as he used X to trumpet far-right <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/14/elon-musk-tweets-trump-conspiracy\">conspiracies</a>, fulminated about the \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d and enthusiastically promoted Trump, even appearing at the president-elect\u2019s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-donald-trump-rally-butler-election-f718967ec29431a2b9858b1121e70da1\">rallies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/elon-musk-america-pac-donald-trump-campaign\">funding</a> campaign operations for him in key battleground states.</p>    <p>Musk is now intimately involved in Trump\u2019s incoming administration, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/trump-appoints-elon-musk-government-efficiency-department\">heading</a> a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d that plans mass layoffs of US government workers. Some Tesla owners have been left horrified. \u201cI thought Elon was progressing our country, but he\u2019s turned out to be kind of an evil person. It\u2019s scary for someone with that sort of money to be so close to a politician,\u201d said Mika Houston, a gymnastics teacher in Las Vegas who has had a Tesla Model 3 for the past three years.</p> <p>\u201cI still love my car, but I think about whether I\u2019m endorsing that sort of behavior when I drive it. I\u2019m embarrassed driving this car around after the election, thinking about the man behind it,\u201d said Houston, who has bought an \u201cAnti Elon Tesla Club\u201d magnet for her car and is mulling whether to sell it.</p> <p>Pamela Perkins, a photographer who lives in the Tesla heartland of California\u2019s Silicon Valley, has a Model Y but is among a group of friends who are all considering ditching their Teslas.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m turning 80 in January so I thought I\u2019d have a sporty car that I could race anyone when the light turns green,\u201d Perkins said of her purchase. \u201cThere was a time I thought Elon Musk was a genius but he went bad very quickly. I remember saying to my husband I should sell this car and send a message, for my own conscience.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people have asked if I\u2019m going to sell the car, I have a friend who was about to get a Tesla but decided not to because of him. But [Musk] doesn\u2019t care about us, he has bigger fish to fry. He wants to colonize Mars.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear whether this backlash against Musk will hurt Tesla, which remains the dominant electric car company in the US. Sales have struggled somewhat this year, with a 7% drop <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/735231/ev-sales-q3-2024-tesla/\">forecast</a> in the latest quarter compared with the same period in 2023, although analysts put this down to increased competition from other car makers and a stale Tesla lineup that has little changed apart from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/22/cybertruck-tesla-unveils-the-pickup-truck-we-have-to-have\">much-hyped Cybertruck</a>.</p> <p>\u201cTesla isn\u2019t the only player in town now and they haven\u2019t been aggressive in putting new products out,\u201d said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.</p> <p>\u201cElon is Tesla: his persona definitely has an impact upon the perception of the brand, and he has been polarizing.

      "bodyText": "As Elon Musk has embraced Donald Trump and various far-right conspiracy theories, he has left behind an aghast cohort of Tesla owners who suddenly feel embarrassed by their own cars. Many of them are now publicly displaying their dismay at Musk on their vehicles. Sales of anti-Musk stickers have boomed since the world\u2019s richest man declared his support for Trump and helped propel him to victory in the US presidential election, as owners of Teslas, the car brand headed by Musk, try to distance themselves from the South African-born multibillionaire. \u201cSales have really spiked. The day after the election was the biggest day ever,\u201d said Matt Hiller, a Hawaii-based aquarium worker who sells a range of stickers online that denounce Musk. \u201cPeople saw a billionaire supervillain buy his way into the administration and it rubbed them the wrong way.\u201d Hiller started the sticker range last year after deciding against buying a Tesla due to Musk\u2019s \u201camplifying of horrible people and silencing of others\u201d on X, formerly Twitter, another of his companies. Several hundred stickers a day are now being sold, primarily to Tesla owners, Hiller said, bearing texts such as \u201cAnti Elon Tesla Club\u201d or \u201cI Bought This Before Elon Went Crazy\u201d, or a picture of Musk in clown makeup with the words \u201cSpace Clown\u201d. \u201cPeople keep telling me that they feel they can drive their Teslas again with these stickers,\u201d said Hiller, who has had to set aside part of his house to accommodate the growing operation. Hiller devises slogans such as \u201cElon Ate My Cat\u201d, a reference to a debunked falsehood about migrants eating pets in Ohio, that are then sold on Etsy and Amazon. \u201cPeople are shaken up. It\u2019s a relief really to see they are awake,\u201d he said of the surging demand. Musk, who has an estimated wealth of $314bn, was once considered an environmental hero and technology pioneer by many US liberals after turning Tesla into the most valuable car company in the world while warning that \u201cclimate change is the biggest threat that humanity faces this century, except for AI\u201d. But his reputation among electric vehicle-buying liberals curdled as he used X to trumpet far-right conspiracies, fulminated about the \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d and enthusiastically promoted Trump, even appearing at the president-elect\u2019s rallies and funding campaign operations for him in key battleground states. Musk is now intimately involved in Trump\u2019s incoming administration, heading a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d that plans mass layoffs of US government workers. Some Tesla owners have been left horrified. \u201cI thought Elon was progressing our country, but he\u2019s turned out to be kind of an evil person. It\u2019s scary for someone with that sort of money to be so close to a politician,\u201d said Mika Houston, a gymnastics teacher in Las Vegas who has had a Tesla Model 3 for the past three years. \u201cI still love my car, but I think about whether I\u2019m endorsing that sort of behavior when I drive it. I\u2019m embarrassed driving this car around after the election, thinking about the man behind it,\u201d said Houston, who has bought an \u201cAnti Elon Tesla Club\u201d magnet for her car and is mulling whether to sell it. Pamela Perkins, a photographer who lives in the Tesla heartland of California\u2019s Silicon Valley, has a Model Y but is among a group of friends who are all considering ditching their Teslas. \u201cI\u2019m turning 80 in January so I thought I\u2019d have a sporty car that I could race anyone when the light turns green,\u201d Perkins said of her purchase. \u201cThere was a time I thought Elon Musk was a genius but he went bad very quickly. I remember saying to my husband I should sell this car and send a message, for my own conscience. \u201cA lot of people have asked if I\u2019m going to sell the car, I have a friend who was about to get a Tesla but decided not to because of him. But [Musk] doesn\u2019t care about us, he has bigger fish to fry. He wants to colonize Mars.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether this backlash against Musk will hurt Tesla, which remains the dominant electric car company in the US. Sales have struggled somewhat this year, with a 7% drop forecast in the latest quarter compared with the same period in 2023, although analysts put this down to increased competition from other car makers and a stale Tesla lineup that has little changed apart from the much-hyped Cybertruck. \u201cTesla isn\u2019t the only player in town now and they haven\u2019t been aggressive in putting new products out,\u201d said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. \u201cElon is Tesla: his persona definitely has an impact upon the perception of the brand, and he has been polarizing. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen any impacts in sales because of this \u2013 yet. I do think this will happen, but it remains to be seen which consumers he attracts and which he loses.\u201d Another uncertainty is how Tesla will be affected by policies pursued by Trump. The incoming president has called the shift to electric cars \u201clunacy\u201d, said that supporters of such vehicles should \u201crot in hell\u201d and vowed to strip away incentives to purchase them. Trump has somewhat tempered his invective against electric vehicles following Musk\u2019s endorsement but is still planning to remove a key tax credit for new buyers. For now, though, there is a windfall for those selling anti-Musk merchandise. \u201cI feel like people really wanted to make their voices heard in some way, even as passive as it is,\u201d said Stacey Davis, who started selling Musk bumper stickers a year ago. Davis, who has a Tesla, said she has had an 800% increase in sales of these bumper stickers on Etsy since the election. \u201cElon started not aligning with what I believe in and he just started being really weird, extra,\u201d said Davis. \u201cAt first we\u2019re like, OK, he\u2019s just one of those eccentric types of people. But then when he went into his political stuff and I was like, oh no, this is not it.\u201d With a Trump presidency looming over the US for the next four years, Musk\u2019s involvement is a bittersweet prospect for some sellers. \u201cI\u2019d be happy for him to disappear from public discourse and just be another rich guy,\u201d Hiller said. \u201cIf I never sell another Elon sticker that\u2019s fine. I\u2019d rather him just be gone for the country\u2019s sake and I can go back to making stickers of fish.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "TSB has appointed the former executive Marc Armengol as its new chief executive as the bank faces uncertainty over its future, with its parent company facing a hostile $13bn (\u00a310.2bn) takeover bid. Armengol, a former strategy director at TSB who has served on the board since 2022, originally joined the UK bank\u2019s Spanish owner Sabadell in 2002. He will take over as CEO at the start of 2025. In May, the Spanish rival BBVA launched a $13bn hostile takeover of Sabadell after its board rejected a bid of the same value. Earlier this week, the European Commission said it did not have any objections to the takeover of Sabadell \u2013 the Spanish lender that was created in 1881 by 127 families in Catalonia \u2013 after completing a foreign subsidies review. However, the bid still faces a longer antitrust review by Spain\u2019s competition watchdog, the CNMC, that could extend the process well into next year. If the takeover is completed it raises questions over the future of Sabadell-owned subsidiaries such as TSB, which it acquired in 2015. Armengol replaces Robin Bulloch, who has served as TSB\u2019s chief executive since April 2022 and is retiring. \u201cMarc is a proven leader who knows TSB well,\u201d said Nick Prettejohn, the chair of TSB. \u201cMarc\u2019s appointment will allow us to build further on the progress of recent years.\u201d Sabadell, which bought TSB for \u00a31.7bn in 2015, reaffirmed its commitment to help TSB become a main contributor to improving the Spanish group\u2019s profitability. The Sabadell chief executive, C\u00e9sar Gonz\u00e1lez-Bueno, said it would continue to see TSB\u2019s \u201cturnaround strategy in action\u201d under Armengol. TSB has had a relatively high turnover of chief executives in recent years. Debbie Crosbie, who led the turnaround of the troubled bank at the turn of the decade, lasted just under three years. She joined in May 2019 and announced her departure to join Nationwide as its first female chief executive in the building society\u2019s 175-year history in December 2021. In 2018, Paul Pester stepped down as chief executive after an IT meltdown that locked thousands of customers out of their accounts. He had held the role for seven years.",

      "body": "<p>In June 1990, just minutes after his shocking first-round defeat to upset specialist Derrick Rostagno at Wimbledon, a suddenly aging and forlorn John McEnroe sat down with NBC\u2019s Bud Collins, along with rival Jimmy Connors, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1I9_EFsrps\">for an interview</a>. Connors was working for NBC that summer as an analyst while nursing a wrist injury.</p> <p>It was a rare moment of revealing, subdued reflection from the usually fiery McEnroe. The loquacious New Yorker spoke about his disappointment with himself and his level of play and how difficult it had become to balance family life and a pro tennis career. Connors pointed out that his fellow Irish-American seemed to be lacking direction and was in need of advice on how to proceed.</p> <p>And then something extraordinary happened: Connors offered to be the one to guide McEnroe back to glory by suggesting he himself step into the role of McEnroe\u2019s coach. McEnroe literally extended his hand to seal the deal and for a brief moment the impossible was about to happen: two fierce \u2013 and often hated \u2013 on-court rivals were about to team up and give their tennis generation one last chance of glory before being rudely \u2013 and permanently \u2013 kicked out of the party.</p> <p>But, alas, it wasn\u2019t meant to be. Those few minutes were as far as the coaching proposition went. Years later Connors would remark that shortly after the interview both he and McEnroe decided \u201cto run the other way\u201d.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t help but think of that might-have-been moment when the shock announcement came last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/23/andy-murray-to-coach-novak-djokovic-australian-open-tennis\">that Andy Murray would be teaming up with Novak Djokovic</a>, serving as the Serb\u2019s coach to start the 2025 campaign. The brilliant Djokovic will be seeking his 11th Australian Open title in January and, what is likely even greater motivation, his 25th major title overall which would allow Djokovic to surpass Margaret Court as the all-time winning slam champion, man or woman.</p> <p>In some ways Murray\u2019s coaching of his longtime friend and rival makes sense as the two have been joined for decades. Consider: Roger Federer is six years older than both Murray and Djokovic and started in an entirely different tennis generation. Rafael Nadal had such unprecedented early success that he separated himself from his slightly younger rivals early on and solidified his pairing with Federer as early as 2004. But Murray and Djokovic have a history that extends back to when they competed frequently in their junior days. And they were also born days apart from each other in May 1987.</p> <p>Further, though Murray is a three-time slam champion himself (impressively twice beating Djokovic in major finals), and a surefire Hall of Famer, his relationship to Djokovic, as opposed to McEnroe and Connors\u2019 fractious interactions, was never one of co-equals; Djokovic, Federer and Nadal are obviously in a world of their own and the whole notion of there ever being a \u201cBig Four\u201d, as it was coined early on, was false, as well as an unfair burden on Murray. There was the Big Three with an occasional plus-one (that \u201cone\u201d being either Murray or Wawrinka).</p> <p>Being that he was a great player in his own right, it\u2019ll be interesting to see what Murray can do to help Djokovic get that one last slam before he retires as perhaps the greatest player of all time (if one is judging it solely by the faulty metric of slam titles). Murray just may be able to provide that little bit of a mental edge or confidence boost that Djokovic needs, something that - perhaps - only another former top player can provide. Djokovic has tried this previously when Boris Becker assisted his coaching team for several years with much success.</p> <p>Maybe Murray will be able to channel the positive effects that his former coach Ivan Lendl had. Lendl is that very rare breed \u2013 someone who was an all-time great on the court and also reached huge success as a head coach, guiding Murray to all three of his slam triumphs. But Lendl is indeed the exception that proves the rule.</p> <p>The sporting world is littered with great players who couldn\u2019t transfer their successes from the playing arenas to the coaching box. Consider Ted Williams. Inarguably the greatest hitter to have ever lived, Williams was also a passionate teacher and he fulfilled a personal dream when he became the manager of the less-than-mediocre Washington Senators in 1969, winning the Manager of the Year award his first year. But the perfectionist Williams soon discovered how difficult it was to instill his preternatural baseball abilities into subpar talents. During his four years at the helm in Washington (and Texas, where the Senators were and relocated and renamed the Rangers), Williams finished with a career won-lost percentage of .429 \u2013 lower than his career on base percentage as a player, .482.</p>    <p>Wayne Gretzky, Isaiah Thomas, Bart Starr, Mike Singletary, Magic Johnson and many other all-time greats all tried their hands at coaching and none came remotely close to replicating their triumphs as players. Obviously some if it is luck and one has to accept the players one inherits on a team but the vast majority of the most successful coaches were not great players.</p> <p>If one thinks of the best coaches across all sports the last several decades, none of them were stars on the field: Andy Reid and Bill Belichick in the NFL, Bruce Bochy and Dave Roberts in baseball, Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr in the NBA, etc.</p> <p>But why is this? Why is it so hard for those that perfected their craft in competition to pass on their gifts to their eager students? Malcolm Gladwell, the popular writer of The Tipping Point, who specializes in research at the intersection of the social sciences had a theory. While speaking to ESPN promoting his book 2005 book Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, which focused on the effectiveness of instinctive vs. well thought-out actions, Gladwell mentioned an anecdote in which legendary tennis coach Vic Braden said,<strong> </strong>\u201cWe haven\u2019t found a single top tennis player who is consistent in knowing and explaining exactly what he does.\u201d</p> <p>Gladwell had an explanation: \u201cThat\u2019s precisely why top athletes so often make bad coaches or general managers. They often don\u2019t really know why they were as good as they were. They can\u2019t describe it, which means that they can\u2019t teach it and they quickly become frustrated at their inability to lift others up to their own level. Mediocre players \u2013 or non-athletes \u2013 tend to make better coaches because their knowledge isn\u2019t unconscious. It\u2019s the same thing with writing. I know very little about science. But I think I write about science more clearly than many scientists, because I have to go over every step, carefully and deliberately.\u201d</p> <p>There is a kind of middle-ground, what I\u2019d call the B-plus category of very good players - but not truly great - who also became stellar managers. The most obvious example of this is Joe Torre. Though the back page of the Daily News tabloid headline infamously read \u201cClueless Joe\u201d upon the Yankees hiring Torre in November 1995, he went on to become a 4-time World Series champion with the Yankees and is in the Hall of Fame because of it.</p> <p>When it comes to the coaching of the aforementioned Big Three, none of them ever had a great player as a long-time coach: Federer never had a long-term coach, but he had Paul Annacone and Tony Roche alongside him for extended periods, both of whom were solid pros but neither a dominant singles player; Djokovic\u2019s longest serving coach who was with him throughout his career until recently was Marian Vajda, a former pro who never advanced past the third round in a slam as a player; and of course Nadal had Uncle Toni, who never played professional tennis.</p> <p>The Murray-Djokovic partnership would, on the face of it, seem like an ideal setup. There\u2019s obviously no long-term commitment stress since Djokovic is at the very end of his career. The two clearly have the utmost and sincere affection and respect for each other. And though the 10-time Australian Open champ is now overmatched by the brute force of Jannik Sinner\u2019s groundstrokes and the dazzling variety of Carlos Alcaraz, Murray can serve as an invaluable source for countering the younger players. A master of defense and counter-punching himself, Murray has also competed against Sinner and Alcaraz. And having faced off against Djokovic so many times over the last quarter century, he knows the scant few areas where his new student is more vulnerable.</p> <p>Whatever happens in Australia and the rest of 2025, Murray taking on this role is a unique and somewhat joyful coda to this golden era in the sport. And the extra burst of enthusiasm and energy that this partnership will undoubtedly provide may well make that tiny percentage of difference as Djokovic strives for that one final slam.</p> <p>And for their part, both Connors and McEnroe did end up trying their hand at coaching. Connors saw some success with Andy Roddick during their two years together, with Roddick reaching the US Open final in 2006 with Connors in his box. And McEnroe briefly worked with Milos Raonic during the 2016 grass-court season, helping the tall Canadian reach the Wimbledon final where he lost \u2026 to Murray.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I am at that stage in life where my options are narrowing when it comes to the jobs I dreamed of doing as a child. I am too old to play football for Scotland, I will not own a brewery or become an astronaut. (In retrospect, aspiring to a job that combined all three was a tad ambitious.) It\u2019s also risky to give up any job in this economy without knowing whether the new one will work out. Luckily, thanks to video games, I can try them out before taking the plunge. And you are never too old to be a gangster, are you? Which is why I started playing Mafia: Definitive Edition.</p> <p>I did play it briefly in its original incarnation, 70bn years ago. Not for long, though, because it had driving sections as unintuitive and poorly controlled as that buggy on Mars.</p> <p>For me, the fantasy of being a mobster was always less about the murder, extortion and whatnot, and more about the social side: just hanging with guys and having bants. That is more than adequately represented in this game. As soon as I start showing interest in the bar owner\u2019s daughter the guys tell me that I\u2019m \u201calways soft when it comes to broads\u201d. Boy, do those jabronis really have my number!</p> <p>The main character Tommy\u2019s story is how I imagine my own path into the mafia. I was born from Polish stock on the east coast of Scotland and therefore could not trace my lineage back to Sicily, nor did I have any blood connection to the five families. Like Tommy, I imagined that I too would start off as a taxi driver, whisk some wounded guys away from rival mobsters one night, and do such a quality job that I would be invited to come and do some more work for them. This is the mobster equivalent of a five-star review on Uber.</p>    <p>You don\u2019t actually have to do a lot of driving in the updated edition. You can skip between destinations with the press of a button, although this does mean you miss out on in-journey chat which helps give the story more detail. And it is a good story. It\u2019s not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/21/goodfellas-at-30-martin-scorsese-robert-deniro-joe-pesci\">Goodfellas</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/23/the-godfather-review-a-brutal-sweep-of-magnificent-storytelling\">The Godfather</a>, but it\u2019s solid, and I thought the voice acting was pretty strong.</p> <p>The script is full of cliches, but I find them reassuring because they remind me of the mafia movies I grew up loving. Politicians are always \u201con the take\u201d. Gangsters are always wanting to eventually \u201cgo legit\u201d. You don\u2019t save lives, you save \u201casses\u201d. You don\u2019t do <em>things</em>, you \u201cdo what you gotta do.\u201d You aren\u2019t brave, you have \u201ca real set of balls\u201d. Not just <em>any</em> set of balls, but a set that warrants frequent commentary and admiration. My boss, Don Salieri, kept telling my work colleagues to \u201clook at the set of balls on this kid\u201d. Is it any wonder the mafia don\u2019t have a HR department? After one meeting everyone exits the room leaving not one but two cigars burning in an ashtray. So, I don\u2019t think much of the health and safety in this workplace, either.</p> <p>Some things are a bit silly.

      "bodyText": "I am at that stage in life where my options are narrowing when it comes to the jobs I dreamed of doing as a child. I am too old to play football for Scotland, I will not own a brewery or become an astronaut. (In retrospect, aspiring to a job that combined all three was a tad ambitious.) It\u2019s also risky to give up any job in this economy without knowing whether the new one will work out. Luckily, thanks to video games, I can try them out before taking the plunge. And you are never too old to be a gangster, are you? Which is why I started playing Mafia: Definitive Edition. I did play it briefly in its original incarnation, 70bn years ago. Not for long, though, because it had driving sections as unintuitive and poorly controlled as that buggy on Mars. For me, the fantasy of being a mobster was always less about the murder, extortion and whatnot, and more about the social side: just hanging with guys and having bants. That is more than adequately represented in this game. As soon as I start showing interest in the bar owner\u2019s daughter the guys tell me that I\u2019m \u201calways soft when it comes to broads\u201d. Boy, do those jabronis really have my number! The main character Tommy\u2019s story is how I imagine my own path into the mafia. I was born from Polish stock on the east coast of Scotland and therefore could not trace my lineage back to Sicily, nor did I have any blood connection to the five families. Like Tommy, I imagined that I too would start off as a taxi driver, whisk some wounded guys away from rival mobsters one night, and do such a quality job that I would be invited to come and do some more work for them. This is the mobster equivalent of a five-star review on Uber. You don\u2019t actually have to do a lot of driving in the updated edition. You can skip between destinations with the press of a button, although this does mean you miss out on in-journey chat which helps give the story more detail. And it is a good story. It\u2019s not Goodfellas or The Godfather, but it\u2019s solid, and I thought the voice acting was pretty strong. The script is full of cliches, but I find them reassuring because they remind me of the mafia movies I grew up loving. Politicians are always \u201con the take\u201d. Gangsters are always wanting to eventually \u201cgo legit\u201d. You don\u2019t save lives, you save \u201casses\u201d. You don\u2019t do things, you \u201cdo what you gotta do.\u201d You aren\u2019t brave, you have \u201ca real set of balls\u201d. Not just any set of balls, but a set that warrants frequent commentary and admiration. My boss, Don Salieri, kept telling my work colleagues to \u201clook at the set of balls on this kid\u201d. Is it any wonder the mafia don\u2019t have a HR department? After one meeting everyone exits the room leaving not one but two cigars burning in an ashtray. So, I don\u2019t think much of the health and safety in this workplace, either. Some things are a bit silly. My character is still called \u201cThe Kid\u201d when he is 30; perhaps they\u2019re bootlegging an elixir of eternal youth alongside all the bourbon. I have to go and see a guy called Vincenzo to get weapons. I am frequently told he will have just what I need. Most of the time it ends up being a baseball bat. I could have got that from Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. But I find this game so comforting to play in a predictable, undemanding way. For the most part it\u2019s like settling down with a cosy crime thriller or a potato-based soup, though there are a couple of levels that are insanely hard: a race that was completely unforgiving, a motorbike chase with zero room for error, and a level where you have to shoot down a plane for which I not only had to drop down to easy difficulty, but also had to turn the controller sensitivity down so low that my gunsight moved like an ocean tanker.

      "bodyText": "Irish-language rap trio Kneecap have won their case against new Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch after she blocked an arts grant to the band citing anti-British politics. They took Badenoch, then business secretary, to court in the summer and at a hearing in Belfast\u2019s high court, the new government said the refusal of \u00a314,250 in funding was \u201cunlawful\u201d, agreeing to release the money and pay Kneecap\u2019s costs. Lead band member DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed, whose real name is JJ \u00d3 Dochartaigh, turned up at court wearing his trademark tricolour balaclava and arriving in a mock police Land Rover bearing a Palestinian and Irish flag. To the mirth of onlookers in court, Mr Justice Scoffield said he was happy to hear there had been a settlement, wishing all sides well with a cheerful Go Raibh Maith Agat, Irish language for thank you. DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed told reporters outside that the case was \u201cnever about money\u201d but about equality of expression for all sides in Northern Ireland, as guaranteed in the Good Friday agreement. The trio are known for imagery and lyrics that use and subvert republican tropes, including the 2019 hit Get Your Brits Out, a play on the \u201cBrits out\u201d mantra of the IRA, and once depicted then-prime minister Boris Johnson on a rocket. The group is named after the Troubles-era paramilitary tactic of targeting knees in so-called punishment attacks. \u201cToday we will send the full amount awarded to two organisations in Belfast who will work with the two communities to create a better future for our young people,\u201d he said, naming Gl\u00f3r na M\u00f3na, which promotes Irish language activities and culture, and R-City Belfast, which offers personal and social development for young people. In a statement the band hit out against the then Conservative government, expressing cross-community belief that London ignores the needs of working classes on both sides in Northern Ireland: \u201cThey don\u2019t like that we oppose British rule, that we don\u2019t believe that England serves anyone in Ireland and the working classes on both sides of the community deserve better; deserve funding, deserve appropriate mental health services, deserve to celebrate music and art and deserve the freedom to express our culture. \u201cThey didn\u2019t like the fact that we are totally opposed to all they represent, embodied right now by their arming of genocide in Gaza. What they did was a fascist type action, an attempt to block art that does not agree with their views after an independent body made a decision. Their own courts have now found in Kneecap\u2019s favour, as we knew they would. They have tried to silence us and they have failed,\u201d the band added. The UK\u2019s Department for Business and Trade said it would no longer be contesting the case and that it agreed the original decision had been \u201cunlawful and procedurally unfair\u201d. In 2023 the Belfast group applied for a grant from the Music Export Growth Scheme, an independent government-backed arts initiative that provides funding to promote artists overseas. The British Phonographic Industry approved the application. In June it emerged that the Department for Business and Trade and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport oversee the scheme, and that business secretary, Badenoch, had rescinded the funding. A government spokesperson said it did not want to give taxpayers\u2019 money to \u201cpeople that oppose the United Kingdom itself\u201d. Kneecap\u2019s solicitor, Darragh Mackin, said: \u201cKneecap continue to lead by example in practising what they preach. Not only do they sing about cearta (rights), but today they have shown they will even hold the British government itself to account to protect them.\u201d The band closed their statement advocating for a free Palestine. On 13 December, Kneecap will perform at the Gig for Gaza at the O2 Academy Brixton in London alongside Paul Weller, Primal Scream, Paloma Faith and Liam Bailey.",

      "bodyText": "Once again, the Young Country Diary series is open for submissions! Every three months, as the UK enters a new season, we ask you to send us an article written by a child aged 8-14. The article needs to be about a recent encounter they\u2019ve had with nature \u2013 whether it\u2019s a majestic deer, a busy rock pool or a yomp in the woods. Crucially, it doesn\u2019t matter if the child is a nature expert or has never picked up a pair of binoculars. We are especially keen to reach teachers who might like to get their class outside and noticing nature. You can submit your piece any time between now and noon on Friday 3 January. Six winning entries will be chosen. These will be published in the Guardian newspaper and online \u2013 two in December, two in January and a final two in February. Then on 28 February the form will reopen again below, for articles about early spring. Note that if you send your piece in early enough, you stand a chance of being published on 28 December. How your child can take part First of all, we\u2019re looking for children age 8 to 14, so we will need your permission, as parent or guardian. Then here\u2019s what the child needs to do: Step 1 \u2013 Go out one day to where there is some nature. It could be their local woods or beach, their garden, a farm, or simply the nearest park. Step 2 \u2013 Write an article of 200-250 words telling us what they saw and what happened. Step 3 \u2013 Send the article to us using the form below. We ask that you fill in the form yourself rather than the child. Photos/drawings \u2013 These are helpful (especially landscape rather than portrait) but they are not a condition of entry. If you have some, please tell us in the \u201cmore information\u201d field, as there\u2019s no way to attach them to the form. Hints and tips for any budding YCD writers If the child gets stuck and doesn\u2019t know what to write about, here are a few pointers: \u2022 Good nature writing starts with the senses \u2013 so what did you see and hear? What about smell and touch? Take notes when you\u2019re out and about so you don\u2019t forget \u2022 How would you describe what happened?

For example, if you find an interesting-looking bug, see if you can find out what type of butterfly it was, how long they live \u2013 any juicy titbits! \u2022 You can think big, and describe the whole scene \u2013 the sky, the horizon, the landscape. Or you can think small, and tell us some details about the butterfly\u2019s wings or the beetle\u2019s markings. \u2022 What did your encounter with nature make you think about? How did it make you feel? The deadline for entry is noon on Friday 3 January. Anyone can enter their child who is aged between 8 and 14 and based in the UK. You the parent/guardian will be contacted if your child\u2019s piece is selected for publication, and you will be paid on behalf of the child.

After meeting in a high school play, the band have made a dozen such albums since their 1989 debut, each based around frontwoman Karen Peris\u2019s childlike, otherworldly vocal. On this exquisite 13th studio album, the sparse instrumentation and soft focus, lo-fi production gives the music an affectingly ethereal, distant quality, which the singer-songwriter says is intended to rekindle \u201cthe half-remembered beauty of singalongs of our 1970s childhoods\u201d.</p>    <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Innocence Mission: Midwinter Swimmers\">  <iframe style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0Ufe9awqSXLH336pI6Fimp?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Her husband Don\u2019s delicately strummed guitars, Mike Bitts\u2019 gently plucked bass and occasional piano frame songs of indefinable yearning, pitched somewhere between Vashti Bunyan and Galaxie 500. In This Thread Is a Green Street, daily objects operate as a \u201cside doorway\u201d to memories of people lost. The words are audibly informed by literature and poetry. In the title track, the singer compares the imminent arrival of a loved one to \u201cMarch, with the snowdrops and magnolias\u201d. Orange of the Westering Sun recalls the lily-smelling air when they recorded their first two albums at Joni Mitchell\u2019s house. Other lyrics are less clear, but some phrases leap out: \u201cLet\u2019s go out together dancing\u201d or \u201cCan you meet me?\u201d As with Cocteau Twins\u2019 Elizabeth Fraser, the words don\u2019t always need to be intelligible when the feeling is enough. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Sufjan Stevens once described his enduring love of Pennsylvania\u2019s the Innocence Mission by explaining that for all his awe at big songs, Broadway musicals and all, he would always return to \u201csmall songs which make careful observations about everyday life\u201d. After meeting in a high school play, the band have made a dozen such albums since their 1989 debut, each based around frontwoman Karen Peris\u2019s childlike, otherworldly vocal. On this exquisite 13th studio album, the sparse instrumentation and soft focus, lo-fi production gives the music an affectingly ethereal, distant quality, which the singer-songwriter says is intended to rekindle \u201cthe half-remembered beauty of singalongs of our 1970s childhoods\u201d. Her husband Don\u2019s delicately strummed guitars, Mike Bitts\u2019 gently plucked bass and occasional piano frame songs of indefinable yearning, pitched somewhere between Vashti Bunyan and Galaxie 500. In This Thread Is a Green Street, daily objects operate as a \u201cside doorway\u201d to memories of people lost. The words are audibly informed by literature and poetry. In the title track, the singer compares the imminent arrival of a loved one to \u201cMarch, with the snowdrops and magnolias\u201d. Orange of the Westering Sun recalls the lily-smelling air when they recorded their first two albums at Joni Mitchell\u2019s house. Other lyrics are less clear, but some phrases leap out: \u201cLet\u2019s go out together dancing\u201d or \u201cCan you meet me?\u201d As with Cocteau Twins\u2019 Elizabeth Fraser, the words don\u2019t always need to be intelligible when the feeling is enough.",

      "bodyText": "The Israeli military will remain in Gaza for many years, fighting against fresh Hamas recruits in the territory and could be responsible for delivery of humanitarian aid there, a senior Israeli minister has said. The comments by Avi Dichter, Israel\u2019s minister for food security and a member of the Israeli security cabinet, confirm an emerging picture of a long-term deployment of Israeli troops inside Gaza, with no immediate Israeli plan for any other administration to govern the territory\u2019s 2.3 million people and begin reconstruction there. \u201cI think that we are going to stay in Gaza for a long time. I think most people understand that [Israel] will be years in some kind of West Bank situation where you go in and out and maybe you remain along Netzarim [corridor],\u201d Dichter said. Reservists who recently served in Gaza have described to the Guardian the scale of the new military infrastructure built in the territory by Israel. This includes extensive new camps and roads across a swath of northern and central Gaza. One recently demobilised officer said he had spent much of the previous 70 days demolishing houses to clear more ground for what had become a series of big military bases in Gaza\u2019s Netzarim corridor, a military zone that has been established between the Mediterranean coast and Gaza\u2019s eastern perimeter fence. \u201cThat was the only mission. There was not a single construction left that was taller than my waist anywhere (in the corridor), except our bases and observation towers,\u201d he said. The eyewitness accounts confirm reporting by Israeli media of extensive construction by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in the Netzarim corridor and elsewhere in Gaza. So much explosive has been used to destroy buildings to the north and south of the Netzarim corridor that some units have run short, other demobilised reservists said. \u201cWe are not again at the beginning \u2026 but we\u2019re definitely not at the beginning of the end because we still have a lot of work to do,\u201d Dichter said last Sunday in a press briefing in Jerusalem. Israeli military strikes killed at least 21 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, medics said, as tanks pushed deeper into the north and south of the territory. The escalation came a day after Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah began a ceasefire in Lebanon, halting more than a year of hostilities and raising hopes among many Palestinians in Gaza for a similar deal with Hamas, which ruled the territory from 2007 until the current conflict. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, has repeatedly said that Hamas must be completely destroyed and Israel must retain lasting control over parts of Gaza. Months of ceasefire talks have failed and negotiations for the return of about 100 hostages held by Hamas are now paused. Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has killed nearly 44,200 people and displaced nearly all the territory\u2019s population at least once, Gaza officials say. Most victims are civilians. Vast swathes of the territory are in ruins. The Hamas-led militants who attacked southern Israeli communities 13 months ago killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and captured more than 250 hostages. On Thursday, six people were killed in two separate airstrikes on a house and near the hospital of Kamal Adwan in Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip, while four others were killed when an Israeli strike hit a motorcycle in Khan Younis in the south, medics said. In Nuseirat, one of Gaza\u2019s eight historical refugee camps, Israeli planes carried out several airstrikes, destroying a multi-storey building and hitting roads outside mosques. At least 11 people were killed in those strikes, according to health officials at al-Awda hospital in the camp. The Israeli military said its forces were continuing to \u201cstrike terror targets as part of the operational activity in the Gaza Strip\u201d. Israel has been accused of clearing parts of Gaza as part of a deliberate plan to permanently displace residents, but denies the charge. Dichter, a former chief of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet internal security service, said Hamas still had some military capabilities because Israel had not \u201creached every single place in all Gaza\u201d. \u201cWe know that [Hamas] recruited more people \u2026 They have less capabilities but they have new people,\u201d he said. The ceasefire in the north leaves Hamas \u2013 its capabilities already severely damaged by Israel\u2019s offensive \u2013 to fight alone. Khalil Sayegh, a Palestinian analyst, said the ceasefire could make Hamas even less popular in Gaza by proving the failure of its gambit that its attack on Israel would rally other militant groups to the fight. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment where we can see the Hamas messaging become weaker and weaker, as they struggle to justify their strategy to the public,\u201d he said.

Nowland fell and struck her head, dying a week later from inoperable bleeding on the brain. On Wednesday this week, White was found guilty of manslaughter, in a unanimous jury verdict in the NSW supreme court. On Friday, justice Ian Harrison continued White\u2019s bail until February \u2013 the police officer has not spent any time in prison \u2013 telling the court jail was not an \u201cinevitable\u201d sentence.

White will return to court in February for sentencing. Harrison told the court he was not in a position to make a decision on White\u2019s ultimate liberty, but that a jail sentence was not \u201cinevitable\u201d. \u201cI should not want to give unwarranted hope to Mr White that he will avoid a sentence of full-time imprisonment or to cause distress or frustration to those whose reasonably available and strongly held view is that nothing less than such a result would be appropriate. \u201cI am not prepared to say, in what I consider to be an acceptably judicial way, that it is realistically inevitable that Mr White will be sentenced to imprisonment to be served by full-time detention.\u201d The judge said on the \u201cnotoriously protean nature of manslaughter offences\u201d and the \u201cextraordinary range\u201d of sentencing options available to the court: from 25 years\u2019 imprisonment to a non-custodial sentence. Harrison said the case was \u201cunlike any other that I have had to confront\u201d over nearly two decades on the bench. \u201cMs Nowland\u2019s death resulted from what was on almost any view a failure by Mr White correctly to assess the seriousness of the threat confronting him or, on another view, a failure to recognise or appreciate that he was not confronted with a serious threat at all.

The fact that the jury\u2019s verdict represents a conclusion that Mr White\u2019s actions should be punished as a crime does not alone foreclose upon the ultimate sentencing outcome.\u201d The prosecution had applied for White to be detained ahead of sentencing next year, arguing the police officer\u2019s imprisonment was \u201crealistically inevitable\u201d. But White\u2019s defence barrister, Troy Edwards SC, argued his client\u2019s bail should be continued until he is sentenced and invited the judge to consider that the manslaughter offence was the \u201clowest end\u201d in terms of seriousness. Evidence filed with the court showed that were White to be jailed, he would be placed into protective custody because of his status as a police officer. \u201cThe prisoner would be classified as \u2018protection non-association\u2019 meaning he will not be in the physical presence of other inmates at any time,\u201d Det Sgt Mitchell Bosworth of the homicide squad wrote. NSW police announced on Thursday morning that White was suspended from the force without pay after his conviction.

      "bodyText": "The buildup to England women\u2019s friendly against the USA on Saturday has lived up to its title. Whatever animosity there was between the teams in the past, the current managers have packed their media appearances with mutual compliments, and radiated enough warmth to defrost the Wembley pitch. Emma Hayes, who swapped Chelsea for the USA a year ago, is looking forward to a hug from Sarina Wiegman. The Dutchwoman, in turn, was thrilled for Hayes\u2019s instant gold in Paris this summer, only 72 days after she began training the side. If the Netherlands, Wiegman\u2019s previous team, hadn\u2019t scuppered Team GB\u2019s Olympic qualification, the first meeting between Wiegman and Hayes might not have been quite this friendly. But the first time that the English game\u2019s two most successful female football coaches met on the pitch was always going to be a fascinating prospect, whenever it happened. Their only previous clashes have been over player availability, during the years they shared custody of some of the same star names \u2013 Millie Bright, Lucy Bronze, Lauren James. Chelsea were one of the clubs who got angriest at Wiegman\u2019s demand to release them a full month before last year\u2019s World Cup. That must have been an interesting tussle, given that both women have a reputation for being \u201cdirect\u201d. And yet their personalities don\u2019t appear, at first sight, particularly similar. You can\u2019t imagine Wiegman going off script to deliver an on-camera takedown of Joey Barton\u2019s misogyny. It\u2019s just as hard to picture Hayes turning up on the sidelines in an M&amp;S suit and oversize glasses. So how similar are the two? This summer Hayes published A Completely Different Game: My Leadership Playbook. Wiegman\u2019s own book, What It Takes, is subtitled \u201cMy Playbook on Life and Leadership\u201d. The two tomes reflect their subjects: Wiegman\u2019s, for instance, delivers the story of her career in a manner as understated as her press conferences. Take her almost parodically matter-of-fact description of the moment England win the Euros: \u201cI cheered and what followed was a group hug.\u201d If Wiegman has a hinterland, you won\u2019t find it in these pages.

I\u2019m conflicted: I don\u2019t want to lose who I&nbsp;am and my identity, but I don\u2019t necessarily agree with us having different names either.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/sep/25/you-be-the-judge-send-us-your-domestic-disputes\">You be the judge - send us your domestic disputes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ve reached an impasse, because&nbsp;Teddy isn\u2019t willing to make any changes himself. From a&nbsp;feminist standpoint, I want him to change <em>his</em>&nbsp;name to mine. Nearly everyone around me says that\u2019s not right \u2013 but why isn\u2019t it?</p> <p>But I am slowly easing into it: I\u2019ve changed my surname to Teddy\u2019s on Instagram, but can\u2019t bear the thought of changing it officially yet. Teddy\u2019s mum changed her name twice when she got married: first she went double-barrelled, and then she dropped her surname and took her husband\u2019s. Teddy said I could do that as a compromise, but that would be two lots of admin, which is a pain in the arse. I can\u2019t see a way out of this.</p> <h2><strong>The defence: Teddy</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>I\u2019m easy with whatever Annabelle wants, but don\u2019t want to change my&nbsp;name. It\u2019s just not the done thing</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t mind if Annabelle keeps her surname and I keep mine, but if we have kids I\u2019d like them to take mine, too.</p> <p>Annabelle doesn\u2019t want that. She thinks we should go double-barrelled, or that I should change my name to hers. I\u2019m easy with whatever she wants to do, but I don\u2019t want to change my own surname. That was never on the cards, and I can\u2019t see it happening.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Annabelle\u2019s mum is on my side. She was disgusted that Annabelle didn\u2019t want to take my name</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Besides, the double-barrelled thing sounds really posh to me, which I don\u2019t like. I also don\u2019t think our names go well together.</p> <p>Annabelle disagrees, and thinks that double-barrelling is the best compromise, but I really don\u2019t want that. I sympathise with her having to do all the admin, and I\u2019d give her money to help pay for it all. She thanked me sarcastically when I suggested this, but I\u2019m just trying to help.</p> <p>I don\u2019t mean to patronise her, but I&nbsp;can\u2019t see myself ever changing my name to hers \u2013 it\u2019s just not the done thing. I watched my mum go double-barrelled after marrying, but then she eventually took my dad\u2019s name. I\u2019d be fine for Annabelle to do this as I\u2019m not in a rush for her to&nbsp;take my name straight away. I feel like that\u2019s a good compromise, but Annabelle thinks it\u2019s too much hassle.</p> <p>Annabelle\u2019s mum is on my side. She was disgusted that Annabelle didn\u2019t want to take my name. I guess we are all quite traditional in that sense. I don\u2019t have a reason for wanting it that way \u2013 it\u2019s just how it\u2019s always been. I won\u2019t ever tell Annabelle what to do \u2013 at the moment we\u2019re just letting it roll.</p> <p>We have a fairly relaxed relationship overall and don\u2019t really argue. We didn\u2019t talk about this stuff before we&nbsp;got married, as I just assumed Annabelle would be happy with the status quo. I guess most men are, because it benefits us. But when you sit down and think about it, there\u2019s no&nbsp;real reason for this tradition.</p> <p>Saying that, though, I\u2019m glad it exists because I want my name to be&nbsp;passed on through our children. Annabelle will probably come around. It\u2019s just a matter of time.</p> <h2>The jury of Guardian readers</h2> <p><strong>Should Annabelle take Teddy\u2019s surname?</strong></p> <p>Should she and Teddy have children biologically, she will be the one carrying them for nine months. Why shouldn\u2019t they carry her name too? Annabelle is&nbsp;willing to compromise by double barrelling their surnames but Teddy expects his wife to lose hers.<br><strong>Claire, 32</strong></p> <p>The assumption that a woman will take a man\u2019s name is completely outdated. I\u2019m glad I kept my own identity and surname when I got married. I would have been resentful if&nbsp;I hadn\u2019t \u2013 and that\u2019s no way to start a&nbsp;marriage.<br><strong>Chrissie, 58</strong></p> <p>Teddy\u2019s compromise is weak at best, as he won\u2019t even consider changing his last name. Either way, the politics around changing last names is old-fashioned. Why not do something wild and pick a new last name they could both adopt?<br><strong>Jason, 36</strong></p> <p>In southern Europe and South America it\u2019s usual for a married couple to amalgamate their surnames. Not so in the UK, but women very commonly keep their maiden name for work \u2013 maybe this would be a good compromise for Annabelle and Teddy, too?<br><strong>Michael, 64</strong></p> <p>Annabelle needs her original surname for her career. Either do nothing, which is her preferred option, or use her husband\u2019s name for limited purposes (if they have children, then for school, for example). But otherwise, leave it alone.<br><strong>Stephen, 57</strong></p> <h2><strong>Now you be the judge</strong></h2> <p><strong>In our online poll, tell us: should Annabelle change her name?</strong></p> <p><strong>The poll closes on Friday 6 December at 8am GMT</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"poll\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/js.php/ybtj_poll_28_nov_2024_closing_fri_6_december_&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/ybtj_poll_28_nov_2024_closing_fri_6_december_&quot; title=&quot;Online Form&quot;&gt;Online Form - YBTJ poll - 28 Nov 2024 (closing Fri 6 December)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; font-size:x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.formstack.com?utm_source=jsembed&amp;utm_medium=product&amp;utm_campaign=product+branding&amp;fa=h,6025787&quot; title=&quot;Powered by Formstack&quot;&gt;Powered by Formstack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Previous result</strong></h2> <p>On 15 November we asked whether Amma should listen to her housemate and use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/15/you-be-the-judge-should-my-flatmates-use-separate-towels-and-dish-cloths\">separate towels and dish cloths</a>.</p> <p><strong>39% </strong>of you said Amma is guilty.<strong><br>61% </strong>of you said Amma is innocent.</p>",

We\u2019ve reached an impasse, because Teddy isn\u2019t willing to make any changes himself. From a feminist standpoint, I want him to change his name to mine. Nearly everyone around me says that\u2019s not right \u2013 but why isn\u2019t it? But I am slowly easing into it: I\u2019ve changed my surname to Teddy\u2019s on Instagram, but can\u2019t bear the thought of changing it officially yet. Teddy\u2019s mum changed her name twice when she got married: first she went double-barrelled, and then she dropped her surname and took her husband\u2019s. Teddy said I could do that as a compromise, but that would be two lots of admin, which is a pain in the arse. I can\u2019t see a way out of this. The defence: Teddy I\u2019m easy with whatever Annabelle wants, but don\u2019t want to change my name. It\u2019s just not the done thing I don\u2019t mind if Annabelle keeps her surname and I keep mine, but if we have kids I\u2019d like them to take mine, too. Annabelle doesn\u2019t want that. She thinks we should go double-barrelled, or that I should change my name to hers. I\u2019m easy with whatever she wants to do, but I don\u2019t want to change my own surname. That was never on the cards, and I can\u2019t see it happening. Besides, the double-barrelled thing sounds really posh to me, which I don\u2019t like. I also don\u2019t think our names go well together. Annabelle disagrees, and thinks that double-barrelling is the best compromise, but I really don\u2019t want that. I sympathise with her having to do all the admin, and I\u2019d give her money to help pay for it all. She thanked me sarcastically when I suggested this, but I\u2019m just trying to help. I don\u2019t mean to patronise her, but I can\u2019t see myself ever changing my name to hers \u2013 it\u2019s just not the done thing. I watched my mum go double-barrelled after marrying, but then she eventually took my dad\u2019s name. I\u2019d be fine for Annabelle to do this as I\u2019m not in a rush for her to take my name straight away. I feel like that\u2019s a good compromise, but Annabelle thinks it\u2019s too much hassle. Annabelle\u2019s mum is on my side. She was disgusted that Annabelle didn\u2019t want to take my name. I guess we are all quite traditional in that sense. I don\u2019t have a reason for wanting it that way \u2013 it\u2019s just how it\u2019s always been. I won\u2019t ever tell Annabelle what to do \u2013 at the moment we\u2019re just letting it roll. We have a fairly relaxed relationship overall and don\u2019t really argue. We didn\u2019t talk about this stuff before we got married, as I just assumed Annabelle would be happy with the status quo. I guess most men are, because it benefits us. But when you sit down and think about it, there\u2019s no real reason for this tradition. Saying that, though, I\u2019m glad it exists because I want my name to be passed on through our children. Annabelle will probably come around. It\u2019s just a matter of time. The jury of Guardian readers Should Annabelle take Teddy\u2019s surname? Should she and Teddy have children biologically, she will be the one carrying them for nine months. Why shouldn\u2019t they carry her name too? Annabelle is willing to compromise by double barrelling their surnames but Teddy expects his wife to lose hers. Claire, 32 The assumption that a woman will take a man\u2019s name is completely outdated. I\u2019m glad I kept my own identity and surname when I got married. I would have been resentful if I hadn\u2019t \u2013 and that\u2019s no way to start a marriage. Chrissie, 58 Teddy\u2019s compromise is weak at best, as he won\u2019t even consider changing his last name. Either way, the politics around changing last names is old-fashioned. Why not do something wild and pick a new last name they could both adopt? Jason, 36 In southern Europe and South America it\u2019s usual for a married couple to amalgamate their surnames. Not so in the UK, but women very commonly keep their maiden name for work \u2013 maybe this would be a good compromise for Annabelle and Teddy, too? Michael, 64 Annabelle needs her original surname for her career. Either do nothing, which is her preferred option, or use her husband\u2019s name for limited purposes (if they have children, then for school, for example). But otherwise, leave it alone. Stephen, 57 Now you be the judge In our online poll, tell us: should Annabelle change her name? The poll closes on Friday 6 December at 8am GMT Previous result On 15 November we asked whether Amma should listen to her housemate and use separate towels and dish cloths. 39% of you said Amma is guilty. 61% of you said Amma is innocent.",

      "bodyText": "The Albanese government has celebrated its marathon final sitting day as an \u201cextraordinary result\u201d with more than 30 bills passing into law. The bundle of legislation, which passed on Thursday, brings the total number of laws Labor has passed this year to 140. After a late final night in the Senate, parliament has adjourned until February next year \u2013 unless the federal election is called early. But, for now, here\u2019s how some of the new laws might impact you. Restricted social media It\u2019s captured many of the following morning\u2019s headlines \u2013 and for good reason. The Labor government swiftly passed laws banning under-16s from having accounts on a number of social media platforms. The law is due to take effect in 12 months\u2019 time and will affect social media platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, X and the message board Reddit. Some messaging apps, such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, will be excluded. Many of the details on how the ban will work are still being worked out, but it will require further work. Labor\u2019s legislation has ruled out social media platforms using government identification to verify a person\u2019s age, but other forms of assurance might be required. As always, the devil could be in the details. Rules against doxing It will now be illegal to publicise a person\u2019s personal data, better known as doxing, because of their race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, disability, nationality or national or ethnic origin. Those found to have targeted someone by \u201cmaliciously\u201d releasing their data could be jailed for up to seven years. The new laws also include a new children\u2019s online privacy code to better protect children online, and financial penalties for companies that breach privacy laws that don\u2019t meet the \u201cserious\u201d threshold. Build-to-rent incentives Tax breaks to spur on the construction of about 80,000 new homes to rent passed the Senate after the Greens dropped their demands earlier this week. The changes provide incentives by increasing the capital works deduction rate to 4% a year and reducing the final withholding tax rate for properties in which institutional investors become landlords for long-term leases. The offer will be made available to developments with 50 or more apartments or dwellings and they must remain under single ownership for at least 15 years. A minimum 10% of the dwellings in a development need to affordable \u2013 defined as being rented out at 75% of market rate. Supermarket crackdown One of the bills to get a little less attention on Friday was the introduction of fines for supermarkets who break the rules in the food and grocery code. Under the changes, supermarkets could be slapped with the greater of a $10m fine, three times the value of the benefit gained from the breach, or 10% of the last year\u2019s turnover. The code will become mandatory for supermarkets from April 2025 and governs how supermarkets bargain with suppliers. It can have flow-on effects for consumers. A report delivered to the government earlier this year found there was \u201ca heavy imbalance in market power between suppliers and supermarkets in Australia\u2019s heavily concentrated supermarket industry\u201d. Country-specific visa bans possible Countries could be blacklisted by Australia under visa changes that allow the government to designate a country a \u201cremoval concern\u201d. It\u2019s part of a broader suite of migration bills designed to facilitate the removal of non-citizens from Australia after a series of unfavourable high court rulings against the federal government. The new power allows the government to ban new visa applications from countries that do not accept removals from Australia, described by the Greens as a \u201cTrump-style travel ban\u201d. There\u2019s a three-year sunset on the power for the minister to ban visa applications from a country, and a requirement to give reasons for such a designation. Surcharges removed for some government agencies Shortly before Thursday, the government announced it would stop passing on debit surcharges from the ATO and Services Australia from 1 January 2025. But the bills announced in the same media release also closed an inconvenient legislative blindspot revealed after New South Wales government agencies were found to have illegally charged people about $144m in merchant fees. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, acknowledged it had received advice that surcharges collected were \u201clikely unlawful in certain circumstances without a legislative basis to permit it\u201d.",

She hears of an opportunity to earn several months\u2019 salary by receiving an experimental facial injection, and takes it. The injection will render May\u2019s face unrecognisable to the ubiquitous hums. She\u2019s a guinea pig for a form of adversarial AI, a technology designed to confound the processing of other tech. She returns home in pain, and looking very subtly different. \u201cIt\u2019s really OK,\u201d says her husband, Jem. \u201cI&nbsp;just have a slightly new wife.\u201d</p> <p>Life is not easy for May and Jem and&nbsp;their two young children, Lu and&nbsp;Sy. Jem, formerly a photographer, takes gig work via an app, doing the odd jobs that rich people don\u2019t want to do: removing corpses from pest traps, or clearing rotting food from a fridge. The air in their city is poisonous and the tap water is tainted. Rubbish blows around; birds, plants and animals are traumatised, shrivelled or extinct. May, Jem, Lu and Sy are all addicted to their devices, spending long periods alone in their individual \u201cwooms\u201d: networked isolation chambers, like a&nbsp;smartphone you can crawl inside.</p> <p>Hum is Helen Phillips\u2019s sixth book and third speculative novel. Her first, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/06/beautiful-bureaucrat-helen-phillips-review\">The Beautiful Bureaucrat,</a> was praised by Ursula Le Guin, and her second, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/30/the-need-helen-phillips-review\">The&nbsp;Need,</a> was shortlisted for a US National Book award. The novels are conceptual, dealing with big data and&nbsp;paleobotany, but they have a thriller-like intensity. Hum induces a&nbsp;nervous wariness that comes in part&nbsp;from the disturbing events May reads about in the news. \u201cAccording to&nbsp;a new survey, more humans had&nbsp;experienced intense negative emotions in the past calendar year than at any other time in recorded history.\u201d A woman is arrested for hiding needles inside strawberries on&nbsp;shop shelves.<em> </em>\u201cFive hundred million plastic bottles are discarded in&nbsp;your city each year!\u201d An orca carries&nbsp;the corpse of her calf, pushing it before her or holding its tail in her mouth, for 10&nbsp;days.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Characters retreat to their individual \u201cwooms\u201d: networked isolation chambers, like a\u00a0smartphone you can crawl inside</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These news headlines, scattered through the novel, contribute to Hum\u2019s world building, enveloping May in an unsettling atmosphere. At the back of the book, references disclose that they are all true stories or events that Phillips has lightly rewritten. Her&nbsp;depiction of a conventional family struggling to pay the bills and breathe clean air, and trying not to pass too much of their lives on their devices, is&nbsp;also painful and familiar.</p> <p>The real world is present in May\u2019s gruelling life, its exploitative systems and the distressed environment that she longs to escape. When she receives payment for her injection, she immediately overspends on a family holiday to the Botanical Garden, a&nbsp;forested area walled off behind the city. Soon after they arrive in the garden, something disastrous happens. The crisis that unfolds fuses&nbsp;several different contemporary predicaments: online shaming, the stranglehold of tech corporations, and&nbsp;the bewildering proliferation of surveillance, which can both cause and resolve an emergency.</p> <p>Hum<em> </em>has a convincing quality of understatement: it is gripping, but its plot doesn\u2019t abide by the spikes and crescendos that the dystopian setup led me to anticipate.

      "bodyText": "May loses her office job when the \u201chums\u201d \u2013 humanoid robots \u2013 render her role obsolete. It\u2019s hard to find work again. She hears of an opportunity to earn several months\u2019 salary by receiving an experimental facial injection, and takes it. The injection will render May\u2019s face unrecognisable to the ubiquitous hums. She\u2019s a guinea pig for a form of adversarial AI, a technology designed to confound the processing of other tech. She returns home in pain, and looking very subtly different. \u201cIt\u2019s really OK,\u201d says her husband, Jem. \u201cI just have a slightly new wife.\u201d Life is not easy for May and Jem and their two young children, Lu and Sy. Jem, formerly a photographer, takes gig work via an app, doing the odd jobs that rich people don\u2019t want to do: removing corpses from pest traps, or clearing rotting food from a fridge. The air in their city is poisonous and the tap water is tainted. Rubbish blows around; birds, plants and animals are traumatised, shrivelled or extinct. May, Jem, Lu and Sy are all addicted to their devices, spending long periods alone in their individual \u201cwooms\u201d: networked isolation chambers, like a smartphone you can crawl inside. Hum is Helen Phillips\u2019s sixth book and third speculative novel. Her first, The Beautiful Bureaucrat, was praised by Ursula Le Guin, and her second, The Need, was shortlisted for a US National Book award. The novels are conceptual, dealing with big data and paleobotany, but they have a thriller-like intensity. Hum induces a nervous wariness that comes in part from the disturbing events May reads about in the news. \u201cAccording to a new survey, more humans had experienced intense negative emotions in the past calendar year than at any other time in recorded history.\u201d A woman is arrested for hiding needles inside strawberries on shop shelves. \u201cFive hundred million plastic bottles are discarded in your city each year!\u201d An orca carries the corpse of her calf, pushing it before her or holding its tail in her mouth, for 10 days. These news headlines, scattered through the novel, contribute to Hum\u2019s world building, enveloping May in an unsettling atmosphere. At the back of the book, references disclose that they are all true stories or events that Phillips has lightly rewritten. Her depiction of a conventional family struggling to pay the bills and breathe clean air, and trying not to pass too much of their lives on their devices, is also painful and familiar. The real world is present in May\u2019s gruelling life, its exploitative systems and the distressed environment that she longs to escape. When she receives payment for her injection, she immediately overspends on a family holiday to the Botanical Garden, a forested area walled off behind the city. Soon after they arrive in the garden, something disastrous happens. The crisis that unfolds fuses several different contemporary predicaments: online shaming, the stranglehold of tech corporations, and the bewildering proliferation of surveillance, which can both cause and resolve an emergency. Hum has a convincing quality of understatement: it is gripping, but its plot doesn\u2019t abide by the spikes and crescendos that the dystopian setup led me to anticipate. There is no dramatic or bloody confrontation. The stakes rise and then somewhat recede. It\u2019s a thoughtful and graceful novel, not very long, told in short chapters, with an offhand turn of phrase that immerses us in May\u2019s threatening environment, and just occasionally permits a glimpse of the richer world she craves: clean air and water, the smell of cedar, or the \u201cquartet of cardinals\u201d her mother sees one day, \u201csuch a red\u201d. There is a crucial scene in which a hum uses a screen on its abdomen to show May and her family images of their potential futures, created using their extant data. It\u2019s a turning point and also a moment of provocation, reminding the reader how the many recent films and novels set in disastrous near-futures can collectively be seen as a kind of forecast: frightening but not implausible. Many of these stories propose extreme and terrifying scenarios of apocalypse or cruelty. Hum, instead, is poised between speculation and reportage.

Disney+, from Tuesday 3 December *** The Sticky It\u2019s the kind of tale that\u2019s so odd it has to be based on a true story \u2013 and, sure enough, the Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist of 2011-12 is among the largest robberies in Canadian history. This comedy drama tells the story of a group of farmers, including Margo Martindale\u2019s Ruth Landry, who have had enough of being pushed around by huge, unaccountable food industry bullies and decide to take a (very big) slice of the profits they\u2019re being denied. The heist itself is surprisingly straightforward \u2013 but that\u2019s only the beginning of their problems. Prime Video, from Friday 6 December *** Sabrina Carpenter: A Nonsense Christmas Festive variety shows have become a fixture in the streaming era. This year, it\u2019s the turn of singer-actor Sabrina Carpenter to don a red and white fur-trimmed corset and a Santa hat, sing a few of her hit songs from the year, pretend to open some presents, take part in a series of mildly cringeworthy comic interludes and welcome a bunch of special guests. It\u2019s pretty starry stuff: expect turns from Shania Twain, Cara Delevingne, Chappell Roan and many more. Sabrina also has a festive EP, Fruitcake, to flog so don\u2019t expect there to be much reticence on that front. Netflix, from Friday 6 December",

We stayed here in the summer after getting stranded because of a cancelled connecting train. Our unplanned short stay became one of our favourite parts of the whole trip. It was excellently located, staff were friendly with great recommendations, the rooms were comfortable and there was a fantastic breakfast buffet.

The hotel is a former monastery, home to Carmelite monks in the 15th century, and is just a three-minute walk from Santa Lucia station. It has a lovely courtyard, perfect for reading a Donna Leon detective book and sipping a spritz while waiting for the evening train to Rome, as I did. The rooms have lovely classical paintings and polished wooden tables. You can also relax around the wood fire in the lounge where the monks used to have their Bible readings.<br><em>Doubles from \u20ac117, </em><em><a href=\"https://www.abbaziahotel.com/?stay_here=1\">abbaziahotel.com</a></em><br><strong>Ann</strong></p> \n<h2>Tivoli Gardens on your doorstep in Copenhagen</h2> \n<p>There\u2019s a delightful boutique hotel called <strong>Profilhotels Copenhagen Plaza</strong> right next to Copenhagen central station. It\u2019s reasonably priced considering the location, with the glorious Tivoli Gardens right across the road, and Copenhagen\u2019s huge pedestrian shopping street Str\u00f8get just 10 minutes walk away. The hotel is far from new and could be considered a bit rundown, but it more than compensates with bags of old-world charm and quirkiness. A pillar in the lobby lists dozens and dozens of famous guests since the early 20th century, and the lift is an experience in its own right. <br><em>Doubles from about 900 Danish kroner (\u20ac130), <a href=\"https://ligula.se/en/profilhotels/copenhagen-plaza/\">copenhagen-plaza</a></em><br><strong>Per Bilse</strong></p> \n<h2>Stay by the Roman arena, N\u00eemes</h2> \n<p>The <strong>H\u00f4tel de l\u2019Amphith\u00e9atre</strong> in N\u00eemes, southern France, is a charming boutique hotel, a stone\u2019s throw, as its name suggests, from an ancient Roman arena. Arriving at the Gare de N\u00eemes, the hotel is a leisurely 10-minute walk from the station along the wide, tree-lined Avenue Feuch\u00e8res. As you reach the end of the avenue, the arena suddenly comes into view, a magnificently preserved building, still in use for concerts throughout the summer months. Just beyond it, tucked away down a narrow street leading to the old town, is the charming 11-bedroom hotel.

      "body": "<p>This week, world leaders are gathering in Busan, South Korea, to hammer out a global plastics treaty to try to curb pollution from one of the most dangerous materials on the planet. While such a high-level event might seem far removed from our everyday lives, it is the products we use every day that are at the heart of the negotiations. Some plastics are worse than others and have a unique impact in various parts of the world. Here, we look at five of the worst offenders.</p> <h2><strong>Plastic sachets, Indonesia</strong></h2> <p>The sachet was popularised across Asia primarily <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/global-plastic-unilever/%23:~:text=Unilever,%2520the%2520maker%2520of%2520hundreds,a%2520London-based%2520environmental%2520group.\">by Unilever</a> in the 1980s as a way to sell food and hygiene products in smaller, more affordable quantities. But in Indonesia, they replaced existing bulk-buy, reuse and refill systems. The result is that <a href=\"https://zerowastelivinglab.enviu.org/blogs/rethinking-single-use-sachets-why-companies-need-to-think-ahead/\">5.5m sachets</a> are now sold every day just for detergent in the country, whose citizens each produce <a href=\"https://plasticdiet.id/en/evaluation-of-environmental-and-social-impacts-in-utilization-of-sachet-and-pouch-and-solution-expansion-for-reuse-in-greater-jakarta/\">4kg of sachet waste</a> a year, according to the nonprofit Plastic Diet movement.</p>    <p>The problem is that the sachets\u2019 multilayered construction \u2013 of plastic and metal \u2013 makes them virtually impossible to recycle. Overwhelmed waste management systems leak sachets into the environment, where they clog drains and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/24/plastic-waste-puts-millions-of-worlds-poorest-at-higher-risk-from-floods\">contribute to floods</a>. Some are burned as cooking fuel, which emit <a href=\"https://ipen.org/sites/default/files/documents/press_release_plastic_waste_poisons_indo_food_chain_2019_nov_14.pdf\">toxic chemicals that enter air and food</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe distribution is massive. We find them in even remote islands in Indonesia,\u201d says Zakiyus Shadicky, senior research lead at Plastic Diet Indonesia. </p> <p>Unilever said that tackling plastic sachet waste is a priority for the company, and that it has so far installed more than 1,000 refill stations across Indonesia, saving an estimated six tonnes of plastic.</p> <h2><strong>Polyester clothing, Ghana and Kenya</strong></h2> <p>We typically don\u2019t think of discarded clothes as plastic pollution. But between <a href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/plastic-in-textiles-towards-a/file\">60% and 70%</a> of textiles are manufactured from synthetic fibres such as polyester. This becomes a problem when it ends up in unmanaged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/05/yvette-yaa-konadu-tetteh-how-ghana-became-fast-fashions-dumping-ground\">landfills in places including Ghana</a> and Kenya. These countries accept secondhand and deadstock clothing traded by the EU and UK. But an <a href=\"https://changingmarkets.org/report/trashion-the-stealth-export-of-waste-plastic-clothes-to-kenya/%23:~:text=In%25202021,%2520over%2520900%2520million,to%2520contain%2520plastic-based%2520fibres\">investigation by the Changing Markets Foundation</a> revealed that in Kenya, up to half of these garments are discarded, often because they are too damaged to wear.</p>    <p>Dumped in open landfills, the clothes gradually disintegrate and pollute surrounding soils and rivers. \u201cThe trade of this used clothing from the global north to the global south is, to a large extent, the export of plastic waste,\u201d says Ur\u0161ka Trunk, senior campaign manager at the Changing Markets Foundation.</p> <p>Globally, less than 1% of textile fibres are recycled, so Trunk is concerned about the <a href=\"https://changingmarkets.org/press-releases/faster-fashion-growing-use-of-polluting-textiles-revealed-2/\">increasing use of synthetic fibres</a>, particularly by the 50 brands identified in its report. One of those was Shein, beloved by teenagers but, according to the Changing Markets Foundation, with the highest ratio of synthetic to natural fibres of the 50 fast fashion brands surveyed: <a href=\"https://changingmarkets.org/press-releases/faster-fashion-growing-use-of-polluting-textiles-revealed-2/#:~:text=Fast%20fashion%20leader%20SHEIN%20declared,materials%2C%20a%204%25%20increase.\">four-fifths of its material output is made from fossil fuel-based textiles</a>. \u201cPlastic fashion is a problem, and it should be dealt with at the source,\u201d says Trunk.</p> <p>Shein responded saying that \u201cwe are committed to continuously improving our sustainability practices\u201d, and added that it is working on sourcing lower-impact fibres, using surplus materials from other brands, and transitioning to 31% recycled polyester in its Shein-branded products.</p>    <h2><strong>Drinks bottles, Caribbean islands</strong></h2> <p>Every year in Ocean Conservancy\u2019s international coastal cleanup (ICC) one type of litter consistently appears in the top five most-collected items: plastic drinks bottles. In the Caribbean especially, an estimated 2,000 plastic items litter each kilometre, <a href=\"https://iucn.org/story/202407/closing-caribbean-plastic-tap-propelling-caribbean-sids-towards-plastic-free-future\">one-fifth</a> of which are bottles. Data from the ICC shows that in <a href=\"https://oceanconservancy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Annual-Report_FINAL_Digital.pdf\">2022</a> and <a href=\"https://oceanconservancy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ICCAnnualReport2024_Digital.pdf\">2023</a> alone, volunteers in Trinidad and Tobago collected 86,410 plastic bottles \u2013 almost half of all plastic waste collected there.</p> <p>Consumption patterns, paired with a shift from refillable glass bottles to single-use containers in the 1980s, might explain the scale of this pollution in the Caribbean. Plenty of plastic also washes up from other locations on to Caribbean shores. But there is also the role of increasing production by companies such as Coca-Cola, which sells more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/14/coca-cola-admits-it-produces-3m-tonnes-of-plastic-packaging-a-year\">100bn plastic drinks bottles</a> a year. A <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj8275\">study based on 1,576 brand audits</a> in 84 countries found that 11% of total branded plastic waste originated from Coca-Cola, more than any other company.</p>    <p>Coca-Cola responded, saying that in several Caribbean countries they \u201care working on efforts to increase recycling rates with ongoing projects\u201d. </p> <h2><strong>Tetra Pak, Vietnam</strong></h2> <p>In lives increasingly cluttered by plastic, there is a feelgood factor to rinsing out those folded cardboard containers that hold milk, pasta sauces and soups, and placing them in the recycling bin. Most of these packages are made by the multinational food packaging company, Tetra Pak. But their neat cardboard exteriors conceal a more complex truth: layers of paper, metal and plastic lie nestled within. Multi-material products can be incredibly challenging to process and global <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/tetra-pak-trials-removing-aluminium-layer-bid-crack-recyclability-challenge-2023-08-15/\">recycling rates of Tetra Pak hover at about 25%</a>.</p>      <p>Yet the company has <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/41657/pdf/\">claimed that its packages are \u201csimple\u201d to recycle</a>. In 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/09/billions-discarded-tetra-pak-cover-vietnams-beaches-towns\">the Guardian conducted an investigation</a> in Vietnam that showed recycling systems ill-equipped to process the complex material, paired with limited waste management. This created a scenario where Tetra Paks littered the country\u2019s beaches or were being incinerated. A Tetra Pak spokesperson responded, saying that its packages \u201ccan and are being recycled where collection, sorting, and recycling infrastructure exists at scale\u201d. The company added that in Vietnam it is working to meet a 15% government-mandated carton recycling target, and that since 2018 it has invested in local mills to increase their recycling capacity.</p> <h2><strong>Wet wipes, UK</strong></h2> <p>Each year, the <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/news/our-seas-are-swimming-in-wet-wipes-its-time-to-take-action/\">UK disposes of 11bn wet wipes</a>, but this ubiquitous symbol of personal cleanliness has a polluting underside.

Last year, the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/what-you-can-do/join-a-beach-clean/beachwatch-2023-what-you-found/\">cleared 21,000 wet wipes from beaches across the UK</a> and Channel Islands.</p>    <p>In 2024, the UK government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-wide-ban-on-wet-wipes-containing-plastic-to-be-put-into-law\">passed legislation</a> banning plastic-infused wet wipes, giving manufacturers 18 months to adapt their products. \u201cWe need to see this implemented as soon as possible to reduce the amount of plastic blocking up our pipes,\u201d says Catherine Gemmell, policy and advocacy manager at the MCS.</p> <p>Many manufacturers have switched to plastic-free materials in light of the legislation. However, the <a href=\"https://www.awe.international/article/1869795/wet-wipe-ban-will-target-11-billion-sold-year-uk\">UK will continue to allow the manufacture</a> of plastic wipes in the UK, which will then be exported to countries with looser regulations.

      "bodyText": "This week, world leaders are gathering in Busan, South Korea, to hammer out a global plastics treaty to try to curb pollution from one of the most dangerous materials on the planet. While such a high-level event might seem far removed from our everyday lives, it is the products we use every day that are at the heart of the negotiations. Some plastics are worse than others and have a unique impact in various parts of the world. Here, we look at five of the worst offenders. Plastic sachets, Indonesia The sachet was popularised across Asia primarily by Unilever in the 1980s as a way to sell food and hygiene products in smaller, more affordable quantities. But in Indonesia, they replaced existing bulk-buy, reuse and refill systems. The result is that 5.5m sachets are now sold every day just for detergent in the country, whose citizens each produce 4kg of sachet waste a year, according to the nonprofit Plastic Diet movement. The problem is that the sachets\u2019 multilayered construction \u2013 of plastic and metal \u2013 makes them virtually impossible to recycle. Overwhelmed waste management systems leak sachets into the environment, where they clog drains and contribute to floods. Some are burned as cooking fuel, which emit toxic chemicals that enter air and food. \u201cThe distribution is massive. We find them in even remote islands in Indonesia,\u201d says Zakiyus Shadicky, senior research lead at Plastic Diet Indonesia. Unilever said that tackling plastic sachet waste is a priority for the company, and that it has so far installed more than 1,000 refill stations across Indonesia, saving an estimated six tonnes of plastic. Polyester clothing, Ghana and Kenya We typically don\u2019t think of discarded clothes as plastic pollution. But between 60% and 70% of textiles are manufactured from synthetic fibres such as polyester. This becomes a problem when it ends up in unmanaged landfills in places including Ghana and Kenya. These countries accept secondhand and deadstock clothing traded by the EU and UK. But an investigation by the Changing Markets Foundation revealed that in Kenya, up to half of these garments are discarded, often because they are too damaged to wear. Dumped in open landfills, the clothes gradually disintegrate and pollute surrounding soils and rivers. \u201cThe trade of this used clothing from the global north to the global south is, to a large extent, the export of plastic waste,\u201d says Ur\u0161ka Trunk, senior campaign manager at the Changing Markets Foundation. Globally, less than 1% of textile fibres are recycled, so Trunk is concerned about the increasing use of synthetic fibres, particularly by the 50 brands identified in its report. One of those was Shein, beloved by teenagers but, according to the Changing Markets Foundation, with the highest ratio of synthetic to natural fibres of the 50 fast fashion brands surveyed: four-fifths of its material output is made from fossil fuel-based textiles. \u201cPlastic fashion is a problem, and it should be dealt with at the source,\u201d says Trunk. Shein responded saying that \u201cwe are committed to continuously improving our sustainability practices\u201d, and added that it is working on sourcing lower-impact fibres, using surplus materials from other brands, and transitioning to 31% recycled polyester in its Shein-branded products. Drinks bottles, Caribbean islands Every year in Ocean Conservancy\u2019s international coastal cleanup (ICC) one type of litter consistently appears in the top five most-collected items: plastic drinks bottles. In the Caribbean especially, an estimated 2,000 plastic items litter each kilometre, one-fifth of which are bottles.

Plenty of plastic also washes up from other locations on to Caribbean shores. But there is also the role of increasing production by companies such as Coca-Cola, which sells more than 100bn plastic drinks bottles a year. A study based on 1,576 brand audits in 84 countries found that 11% of total branded plastic waste originated from Coca-Cola, more than any other company. Coca-Cola responded, saying that in several Caribbean countries they \u201care working on efforts to increase recycling rates with ongoing projects\u201d. Tetra Pak, Vietnam In lives increasingly cluttered by plastic, there is a feelgood factor to rinsing out those folded cardboard containers that hold milk, pasta sauces and soups, and placing them in the recycling bin. Most of these packages are made by the multinational food packaging company, Tetra Pak. But their neat cardboard exteriors conceal a more complex truth: layers of paper, metal and plastic lie nestled within. Multi-material products can be incredibly challenging to process and global recycling rates of Tetra Pak hover at about 25%. Yet the company has claimed that its packages are \u201csimple\u201d to recycle. In 2018, the Guardian conducted an investigation in Vietnam that showed recycling systems ill-equipped to process the complex material, paired with limited waste management.

Wet wipes, UK Each year, the UK disposes of 11bn wet wipes, but this ubiquitous symbol of personal cleanliness has a polluting underside. Many wipes are manufactured with synthetic fibres such as polyester, which take years to disintegrate. When wipes are flushed, they accumulate in sewers, gathering fat and congealing with other waste to form gigantic, pipe-blocking \u201cfatbergs\u201d \u2013 such as the 35-tonne monster that was pumped out of London pipes in May. Last year, the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) cleared 21,000 wet wipes from beaches across the UK and Channel Islands. In 2024, the UK government passed legislation banning plastic-infused wet wipes, giving manufacturers 18 months to adapt their products. \u201cWe need to see this implemented as soon as possible to reduce the amount of plastic blocking up our pipes,\u201d says Catherine Gemmell, policy and advocacy manager at the MCS.

My father, a retired police officer, was one of them. He spends much of his free time on TikTok, and was swept up in Georgescu\u2019s rhetoric. TikTok\u2019s algorithm fed him a steady stream of short, stirring videos of Georgescu invoking patriotism and promising to \u201cput Romania first\u201d weeks before the election. My father explained to me that his vote wasn\u2019t necessarily an endorsement of Georgescu\u2019s nationalist beliefs \u2013 even though they did resonate in part with him \u2013 but more of a protest against the political establishment. \u201cI wanted to sanction the mainstream political class,\u201d he told me.</p> \n<p>His sentiment is not uncommon. For the past 35 years, Romania\u2019s two dominant parties \u2013 centre-left social democrats and centre-right liberals \u2013 have presided over <a href=\"https://www.libertatea.ro/stiri/mircea-geoana-despre-cumnatul-sau-ionut-costea-dat-in-urmarire-internationala-neamurile-nu-ti-le-alegi-5013040\">corruption scandals</a>, <a href=\"https://publicrecord.ro/2024/11/05/averile-din-umbra-votului-nepotul-tamara/\">nepotism</a>, <a href=\"https://recorder.ro/schema-nordis-masinaria-de-facut-bani-a-celui-mai-puternic-clan-politico-imobiliar/\">politically connected fraud</a> and <a href=\"https://snoop.ro/panourile-ostasului-ciuca-2-milioane-de-euro-platiti-din-bani-publici-de-pnl-pentru-cartea-lui-nicolae-ciuca/\">opaque use of public funds</a>. Their decision to govern together in a coalition for the past three years has only deepened public mistrust, reinforcing the perception that they are all in it together against the people. For many Romanians, voting for Georgescu wasn\u2019t just about ideology, but frustration.</p> \n<p>Still, I\u2019ll admit I was furious when my father first told me he voted for Georgescu. But as we talked, I began to understand his perspective. He is part of the sacrificial generation, those who were in their 20s when communism fell and have since endured decades of broken promises. His vote, like those of many others, wasn\u2019t about alignment with far-right extremism \u2013 it was a desperate cry for change.</p> \n<p>This is not just a generational divide. Young people, too, have been drawn to Georgescu. As I scroll through social media, I see old school friends \u2013 some with university degrees, some working stable jobs \u2013 sharing posts that echo his nationalist rhetoric. Their frustrations mirror those of older voters: a rising cost of living, stagnating wages and a pervasive sense that the system is rigged against them.</p> \n<p>Yet there\u2019s a deeper issue here, one that goes beyond protest votes and political frustration. It\u2019s tempting to dismiss Georgescu\u2019s supporters as uneducated, misinformed, or duped by social media algorithms. But doing so ignores the broader context. Romania\u2019s mainstream parties have not only failed to address core issues like inflation \u2013 currently one of the highest rates in Europe \u2013 but their corruption has also alienated voters. The results of this election should be a wake-up call to these parties.

      "body": "<p>Good morning. Today, MPs will gather in the Houses of Parliament to debate and vote on one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in recent history. The bill, titled terminally ill adults (end of life) bill, would legalise assisted dying in England and Wales for terminally ill adults who have been given less than six months to live.</p> <p>MPs have been given a free vote, meaning they can follow their conscience instead of supporting a party-mandated position. They have been carefully examining the bill and listening to various interest groups and campaigners.</p> <p>It is a highly charged and intensely emotive conversation for many. An estimated 20 terminally ill people in the UK die in unrelieved pain each day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/25/about-20-terminally-ill-people-in-uk-die-in-unrelieved-pain-each-day-research-finds\">according to a study</a> by the independent Office of Health Economics. Those who support the bill say these people deserve autonomy and the right to choose to die in a dignified way, with appropriate pain-management. Opponents cite concerns about the wider implications of the legislation, particularly for disabled people.</p> <p>For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke with the Guardian\u2019s deputy politics editor, Jessica Elgot, about how this bill came to be and what MPs will be weighing up on the morning of the debate. That\u2019s right after the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Labour </strong></em>| <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/29/louise-haigh-resigns-as-transport-secretary\">Transport secretary Louise Haigh has resigned</a> after admitting that she pleaded guilty to an offence in connection with wrongly telling police a phone was stolen in 2013. Haigh said the story was a \u201cdistraction\u201d from government. </p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Ireland </strong></em>| Ireland goes to the polls today with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/29/ireland-election-parties-neck-and-neck\">voters expected to choose either a second term for the incumbent centre-right coalition or a left-leaning rainbow coalition led by a resurgent Sinn F\u00e9in</a>, the former political wing of the IRA. Opinion polls show a dead heat, with the two main government parties \u2013 Fine Gael, led by the taoiseach, Simon Harris, and Fianna F\u00e1il, led by the former PM Miche\u00e1l Martin \u2013 and Sinn F\u00e9in all hovering at about 20% of the vote.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Immigration</strong></em> | Keir Starmer\u2019s government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/28/uk-deal-iraq-people-smugglers-europe\">signed a deal with Iraq</a> to tackle people smugglers across Europe, as new figures showed that net migration to the UK hit a record high of nearly 1 million in a period covering Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak\u2019s tenures as prime minister. </p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Ukraine </strong></em>| Vladimir Putin has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/28/putin-threatens-kyiv-oreshnik-missiles-praises-trump\">threatened to strike Kyiv with Oreshnik missiles</a>, an intermediate-range weapon that Moscow used against the city of Dnipro last week and that Putin has claimed cannot be shot down by any air defence system.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Television</strong></em> | The TV presenter Gregg Wallace will step away from his role on MasterChef <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/nov/28/gregg-wallace-steps-away-from-masterchef-after-allegations-of-misconduct\">after the BBC received complaints</a> about historical allegations of misconduct. Wallace, 60, is \u201ccommitted to fully cooperating throughout the process\u201d, a statement from the show\u2019s production company, Banijay UK, said.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: \u2018It fundamentally changes the state\u2019s attitude to life and death\u2019</h2>    <p>Assisted dying has been voted on, and rejected, twice in parliament (in 1997 and 2015) in the last 27 years. In 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/11/mps-begin-debate-assisted-dying-bill\">it was defeated</a> by a three-to-one margin. In both cases, it seemed clear that it was not going to pass because of a lack of support among MPs at the time.</p> <p>The outcome of today\u2019s vote could have profound and far-reaching consequences. As an issue of moral debate, some have likened assisted dying to capital punishment, abortion and equal marriage. \u201cIt fundamentally changes the attitude the state has to life and death. I can\u2019t think of many things that are more important,\u201d Jessica says. \u201cIt affects more people than any other issue. We might not all get married or need an abortion but everyone is going to die at some point\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Why now?</strong></p> <p>It might seem confusing why, so early in Labour\u2019s reign, this bill has emerged as the most prominent piece of legislation.</p> <p>But the reason is simple: Kim Leadbeater (pictured above, left), the Labour MP behind the bill, came first in the private member\u2019s ballot, essentially a lottery at the start of a parliamentary session giving 20 backbench MPs priority time for their chosen cause. \u201cIt was basically an accident of luck,\u201d Jessica says. \u201cThe further you are down the ballot, the less time there is for your bill to become law. In practice, only the first five or six bills ever really get enough time to become law.\u201d</p> <p>There is an added layer to this unique situation: prime minister Keir Starmer has been a proponent of changing the law.

No such issues on GNX, an album that covers a lot of different topics but on which the overall message seems to be: who else wants some? It\u2019s a huge leap from the racked figure at the centre of Mr Morale, and it would seem faintly risible were it not for the fact that GNX is evidently an album made by an artist at the top of his game. The braggadocio is richly, hugely entertaining, and his depictions of his early years and of his Los Angeles home town are consistently enthralling. The rhymes shift away from Lamar\u2019s trademark storytelling, but what they lack in plotting and depth, they make up for in the sharpness of wordplay and wit. <em><strong>Alexis Petridis</strong></em></p> <p><strong>TV</strong><br><strong>The Madness | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</strong>\u2606<br>Just because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not out to get you. It is the guiding principle behind all successful conspiracy thrillers, and The Madness has taken it to heart. Our hero is CNN-ish TV host and media pundit Muncie Daniels (Colman Domingo), who is on the brink of being offered his own show and all coming right with his world, professionally at least, and so takes a little break in the Poconos mountains. Soon, two balaclava-wearing men are chasing him through the woods. Soon after that, he has stabbed one of them with his fountain pen in self-defence and left him writhing in a putrid swamp while he makes his escape. Setup concluded, you can sit back and relax knowing you are in the hands of an expert team who are about to deliver a slick conspiracy thriller that is a cut above the rest. <em><strong>Lucy Mangan</strong></em><br><br><strong>Film<br>Conclave | </strong>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606<br>Edward Berger\u2019s drama is adapted with masterly flair by screenwriter Peter Straughan from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/robert-harris\">Robert Harris</a> page-turner; Ralph Fiennes is on sumptuous form as the deeply troubled Cardinal Lawrence at the centre of a murky Vatican plot. The result is a high-camp gripper, like the world\u2019s most serious Carry On film. Berger orchestrates marvellously tense, explosively dramatic scenes and, with cinematographer St\u00e9phane Fontaine and production designer Suzie Davies, contrives some spectacularly strange and dream-like tableaux.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Today, MPs will gather in the Houses of Parliament to debate and vote on one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in recent history. The bill, titled terminally ill adults (end of life) bill, would legalise assisted dying in England and Wales for terminally ill adults who have been given less than six months to live. MPs have been given a free vote, meaning they can follow their conscience instead of supporting a party-mandated position. They have been carefully examining the bill and listening to various interest groups and campaigners. It is a highly charged and intensely emotive conversation for many. An estimated 20 terminally ill people in the UK die in unrelieved pain each day, according to a study by the independent Office of Health Economics. Those who support the bill say these people deserve autonomy and the right to choose to die in a dignified way, with appropriate pain-management. Opponents cite concerns about the wider implications of the legislation, particularly for disabled people. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke with the Guardian\u2019s deputy politics editor, Jessica Elgot, about how this bill came to be and what MPs will be weighing up on the morning of the debate. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories Labour | Transport secretary Louise Haigh has resigned after admitting that she pleaded guilty to an offence in connection with wrongly telling police a phone was stolen in 2013. Haigh said the story was a \u201cdistraction\u201d from government. Ireland | Ireland goes to the polls today with voters expected to choose either a second term for the incumbent centre-right coalition or a left-leaning rainbow coalition led by a resurgent Sinn F\u00e9in, the former political wing of the IRA. Opinion polls show a dead heat, with the two main government parties \u2013 Fine Gael, led by the taoiseach, Simon Harris, and Fianna F\u00e1il, led by the former PM Miche\u00e1l Martin \u2013 and Sinn F\u00e9in all hovering at about 20% of the vote. Immigration | Keir Starmer\u2019s government has signed a deal with Iraq to tackle people smugglers across Europe, as new figures showed that net migration to the UK hit a record high of nearly 1 million in a period covering Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak\u2019s tenures as prime minister. Ukraine | Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike Kyiv with Oreshnik missiles, an intermediate-range weapon that Moscow used against the city of Dnipro last week and that Putin has claimed cannot be shot down by any air defence system. Television | The TV presenter Gregg Wallace will step away from his role on MasterChef after the BBC received complaints about historical allegations of misconduct. Wallace, 60, is \u201ccommitted to fully cooperating throughout the process\u201d, a statement from the show\u2019s production company, Banijay UK, said. In depth: \u2018It fundamentally changes the state\u2019s attitude to life and death\u2019 Assisted dying has been voted on, and rejected, twice in parliament (in 1997 and 2015) in the last 27 years. In 2015, it was defeated by a three-to-one margin. In both cases, it seemed clear that it was not going to pass because of a lack of support among MPs at the time. The outcome of today\u2019s vote could have profound and far-reaching consequences. As an issue of moral debate, some have likened assisted dying to capital punishment, abortion and equal marriage. \u201cIt fundamentally changes the attitude the state has to life and death. I can\u2019t think of many things that are more important,\u201d Jessica says. \u201cIt affects more people than any other issue. We might not all get married or need an abortion but everyone is going to die at some point\u201d. *** Why now? It might seem confusing why, so early in Labour\u2019s reign, this bill has emerged as the most prominent piece of legislation. But the reason is simple: Kim Leadbeater (pictured above, left), the Labour MP behind the bill, came first in the private member\u2019s ballot, essentially a lottery at the start of a parliamentary session giving 20 backbench MPs priority time for their chosen cause. \u201cIt was basically an accident of luck,\u201d Jessica says. \u201cThe further you are down the ballot, the less time there is for your bill to become law. In practice, only the first five or six bills ever really get enough time to become law.\u201d There is an added layer to this unique situation: prime minister Keir Starmer has been a proponent of changing the law. Although the government has stayed neutral, \u201cthere has been a feeling that, potentially, there was a bit of pressure for someone who was early in that private member\u2019s bill ballot to pick this as an issue,\u201d Jessica adds. *** Fraught mood Some figures have changed their minds on the issue since the bill was proposed: former prime minister David Cameron, who previously opposed moves to legalise assisted dying, said that he now believes the current proposal was \u201cnot about ending life, it is about shortening death\u201d. Conversely, health secretary Wes Streeting, who voted for the legalisation of assisted dying back in 2015, has now strongly come out against changing the law. The changes of opinion have put people in perhaps counterintuitive oppositional stances, creating a fractious atmosphere in Westminster. Stephen Kinnock, the minister responsible for palliative care who would oversee assisted dying if legalised, has made it clear he is strongly in favour of the bill, putting him out of step with Streeting, his boss. The bill has also led to unlikely alliances: Labour\u2019s Diane Abbott and the Conservative Sir Edward Leigh, Britain\u2019s longest-standing MPs, issued a joint call in the Guardian urging the Commons to reject the bill, arguing it is being rushed through and puts vulnerable people at risk. *** Why are MPs hesitant? Many will vote against the bill on principle, potentially guided by religious conviction, concerns about disabled people\u2019s rights, or fears over whether the NHS can manage such a responsibility, particularly in the area of palliative care. The bill does have tough safeguards: any intervention would require approval from two doctors and a high court judge, which Leadbeater says would make assisted dying the \u201csafest choice\u201d and the UK\u2019s legislation the\u201cstrictest\u201d in the world for terminally ill adults. However, Dominic Grieve, a former Conservative attorney general under Cameron, said he had concerns about terminally ill patients being coerced into opting for assisted dying, and worries that the bill\u2019s definition of coercion and control was too narrow. A UN report noted that there are \u201cattitudinal barriers as well as the lack of appropriate services and support\u201d that could pressure someone into ending their lives prematurely. So challenging is the subject at hand that some MPs have decided to turn to their constituents directly, holding public meetings and canvassing them for their opinions. Though those relying solely on this method to make their decision have garnered some criticism \u2013 (one Reform MP literally got his constituents to choose for him via informal referendum). \u201cCritics have said that MPs actually have a bit of a different job to the average person, which is to consider the impacts of a bill like this on wider society as a whole, and that is a different responsibility to when you think about what you might want for yourself,\u201d Jessica says. New Labour MPs, barely six months into their parliamentary careers, are particularly conflicted. \u201cThis is potentially the biggest conscience issue they\u2019ll face,\u201d Jessica says. \u201cMany might never have deeply considered this topic before.\u201d *** What\u2019s next? A significant number of MPs remain undecided. \u201cMany people will be listening in the chamber to hear speeches before they make their final decisions,\u201d Jessica says. And even if Leadbeater secures enough votes to win today, the bill faces a complex legislative journey. MPs could vote twice more on the bill, including on any amendments, after which it would go to the House of Lords. \u201cIt will be a historic parliamentary moment, but this is just the first stage,\u201d Jessica says. Proponents view this as a once-in-a-generation opportunity. \u201cThis is a very progressive parliament, and public opinion is strong,\u201d Jess says. Three-quarters of the public are in favour of the legislation, according to a recent YouGov poll. \u201cIt really feels like this is the moment \u2013 if it\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s now,\u201d Jessica says. \u201cAnd if it isn\u2019t the moment today, it might feel like it is unlikely to ever happen\u201d.

It\u2019s a huge leap from the racked figure at the centre of Mr Morale, and it would seem faintly risible were it not for the fact that GNX is evidently an album made by an artist at the top of his game. The braggadocio is richly, hugely entertaining, and his depictions of his early years and of his Los Angeles home town are consistently enthralling. The rhymes shift away from Lamar\u2019s trademark storytelling, but what they lack in plotting and depth, they make up for in the sharpness of wordplay and wit. Alexis Petridis TV The Madness | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Just because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not out to get you. It is the guiding principle behind all successful conspiracy thrillers, and The Madness has taken it to heart. Our hero is CNN-ish TV host and media pundit Muncie Daniels (Colman Domingo), who is on the brink of being offered his own show and all coming right with his world, professionally at least, and so takes a little break in the Poconos mountains. Soon, two balaclava-wearing men are chasing him through the woods. Soon after that, he has stabbed one of them with his fountain pen in self-defence and left him writhing in a putrid swamp while he makes his escape. Setup concluded, you can sit back and relax knowing you are in the hands of an expert team who are about to deliver a slick conspiracy thriller that is a cut above the rest. Lucy Mangan Film Conclave | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Edward Berger\u2019s drama is adapted with masterly flair by screenwriter Peter Straughan from the Robert Harris page-turner; Ralph Fiennes is on sumptuous form as the deeply troubled Cardinal Lawrence at the centre of a murky Vatican plot. The result is a high-camp gripper, like the world\u2019s most serious Carry On film. Berger orchestrates marvellously tense, explosively dramatic scenes and, with cinematographer St\u00e9phane Fontaine and production designer Suzie Davies, contrives some spectacularly strange and dream-like tableaux. And so the conclave becomes a nail-biting horse race with a photo-finish. Peter Bradshaw Podcast The Rest Is Classified The latest addition to Goalhanger\u2019s stable of The Rest Is \u2026 shows focuses on espionage. It\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect: a slick, info-packed chat between two hosts with sparkling rapport \u2013 specifically CIA analyst turned spy novelist David McCloskey and veteran national security journalist Gordon Corera. They are looking at the 1953 Iranian coup, and it\u2019s a hugely enjoyable tale of diplomacy, power play, drunkenness \u2013 and a man named Kermit. Alexi Duggins Today in Focus Lebanon: a fragile ceasefire in a shattered nation After more than a year of fighting and two months of all-out war, a fragile and incomplete peace has finally come to Lebanon. Now the country is left to assess the ruins of villages, damaged towns and city streets blown apart \u2013 and a shattered worldview. Cartoon of the day | Ben Jennings The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world\u2019s not all bad When the actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet showed up at his own lookalike competition in New York, the event attracted thousands of spectators and quickly went viral. It also inspired dozens of similar contests \u2013 doppelgangers of celebrities including Paul Mescal, Jeremy Allen White and Zendaya have shown up in their droves in cities across the world in recent weeks. The Chalamet contest was organised by YouTuber Anthony Po, who described the event as \u201creally wholesome\u201d. Cynics may suggest that some of the competition winners bear at best a passing resemblance to the celebrities in question, but Po says: \u201cEveryone understood the absurdity and how stupid it was.\u201d Alice Leppert, an assistant professor of media and communications at Ursinus College, Pennsylvania, said that these days, \u201cwhere there\u2019s a lot of division and a lot of animosity\u201d, these events are something \u201cthat people can unite around\u201d.

slapped with fines of almost $100,000 for misusing valuable flight slots at Australia\u2019s busiest airport, AAP reports.</p> \n  <p>Reforms passed by federal parliament on Thursday aim to increase competition in the airline sector at Sydney airport after allegations carriers were deliberately cancelling services to maintain valuable slots at terminals.</p> \n  <p>Under the changes, the federal transport department will be responsible for the slot management scheme at Sydney airport and will have the power to force airlines to provide information about their misuse.</p> \n  <p>Carriers will be fined $99,000 if they apply for slots with no prospect of them being used, not properly using them or not meeting slot requirements.</p> \n  <p>The transport minister, <strong>Catherine King,</strong> says the changes will help to level the playing field.</p> \n  <p>\u201cOur reforms directly address these issues, allowing better access for new entrants and cracking down on airline misbehaviour,\u201d she says.</p> \n  <p>Slots at Sydney airport are limited to 80 take-offs and landings an hour.</p> \n  <p>The laws will allow for the number of flights an hour at Sydney airport to be increased if there is bad weather.</p> \n  <p>If flight landings or take-offs are affected by weather, the cap will be lifted to 85 flights an hour for two hours.</p> \n  <p>But the number of

Yet these boomers clearly have no idea how young people engage with the internet.</p> \n   <p>This bill might make oldies feel like they\u2019ve done something but in reality it only delivers a false sense of security. Young people will be pushed to darker spaces on the web and regional, marginalised and vulnerable kids will be further isolated.</p> \n   <p>Instead, the parliament should have supported the Greens\u2019 duty of care amendment, and implemented measures that address the dangerous and predatory business models of the tech giants.</p> \n   <p>The passage of this law is a world-leading failure by the PM and Peter Dutton.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-29T06:35:36.938Z\">at 6.35am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-674953688f088c7046fdf593\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-29T05:46:11.941Z\">5.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>More consumers chasing savings in Black Friday sales</strong></p> \n  <p>Electronic gadgets, home entertainment and holiday bookings have helped drive booming Black Friday sales, putting shoppers on track to spend a record amount despite cost-of-living pressures.</p> \n  <p>Australian consumers are on target to splurge $6.7bn at this year\u2019s Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales, up 5.5% from 2023, the Australian Retail Association says.</p> \n  <p>The bumper figure is being largely attributed to cash-strapped consumers seeking discounted holiday-season gifts as many household budgets feel the pressure from high interest rates and inflation.</p> \n  <p>The association\u2019s chief industry affairs officer, Fleur Brown, says crowds were big in stores for most segments, with actual trade expected to hit the industry group\u2019s multibillion-dollar forecast.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere is a leaning to things like clothing and accessories, technology, television, mobile phones, that kind of thing,\u201d she says.</p> \n  <p>\u201cEven services have got offers out there,\u201d she adds, pointing to the likes of travel companies and beauty parlours.</p> \n  <p>The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia\u2019s chief executive, Luke Achterstraat, says electronics, holiday bookings and music are proving popular.</p> \n  <p>More than one-quarter of small businesses are expected to take part in this Black Friday, which Achterstraat says is the highest percentage on record.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThings like Black Friday sales and Cyber Monday are a reminder that consumers do still vote with their wallets and are looking to purchase in the lead-up to Christmas.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Almost 66% of shoppers plan to shop at sales in November and December, according to recent research from Monash Business School.</p> \n  <p>About 30% intend to use buy-now, pay-later schemes.</p> \n  <p>Via AAP.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-29T06:00:29.448Z\">at 6.00am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-67494db78f088c7046fdf566\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-29T05:17:40.597Z\">5.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>\u2018Buy now, pay later\u2019 users to be better protected under national credit laws</strong></p> \n  <p>Some consumer groups have applauded the government\u2019s regulation of \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d products, passed late last night in the Senate.</p> \n  <p>The new law will bring the services under the national credit laws, meaning consumers will have access to greater protections that apply to similar credit products.</p> \n  <p>Services affected include Afterpay, Humm, and Zip, which usually allow consumers to pay for products or services by instalments.</p> \n  <p> The chief executive of the consumer group Choice, Ashely de Silva, says the new laws are a step forward for consumer rights.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The new laws will greatly reduce the risk of people being signed up to unaffordable BNPL loans that leave them worse off.

Here are the main stories: Leaked sections of a report outlining an overhaul of New South Wales\u2019 gambling policy have confirmed \u201ca clear win\u201d for the gambling industry. In light of a slew of bills passed last night, prime minister Anthony Albanese says Labor is \u201cworking hard to make Australians\u2019 lives better\u201d. The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, says he believes a minority government is possible at the next election. 6 News founder Leo Puglisi says the under-16s social media ban will \u201crestrict young people\u2019s creativity\u201d. Shadow communications minister, David Coleman, says enforcing the under-16s social media ban will be the Coalition\u2019s \u2018number one priority\u2019 if elected. Independent senator Tammy Tyrrell said the bill \u201cisn\u2019t worth the paper it\u2019s written on.\u201d Murray Watt says that if social media companies don\u2019t \u201cplay ball\u201d on the ban, Labor can \u201cgo after them.\u201d Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has said it is concerned about the \u201crushed\u201d under-16s social media ban. The retiring opposition leader in the Senate, Simon Birmingham, said he was confident in Dutton. The vice-chancellor of the University of Sydney, Mark Scott said the university \u201cdid not get everything right\u201d during pro-Palestine encampment. Western Australia\u2019s emergency services commissioner, Darren Klemm says bushfires north of Perth in the state\u2019s wheatbelt remain out of control. Queensland premier David Crisafulli launched a 100-day review to determine which stadium will host the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. Parks and environment organisations say they were blindsided by the Victorian government\u2019s review into Parks Victoria, announced late on the last sitting day of state parliament. Airlines that misuse Sydney airport flight slots face heavy fines Airlines will be slapped with fines of almost $100,000 for misusing valuable flight slots at Australia\u2019s busiest airport, AAP reports. Reforms passed by federal parliament on Thursday aim to increase competition in the airline sector at Sydney airport after allegations carriers were deliberately cancelling services to maintain valuable slots at terminals. Under the changes, the federal transport department will be responsible for the slot management scheme at Sydney airport and will have the power to force airlines to provide information about their misuse. Carriers will be fined $99,000 if they apply for slots with no prospect of them being used, not properly using them or not meeting slot requirements. The transport minister, Catherine King, says the changes will help to level the playing field. \u201cOur reforms directly address these issues, allowing better access for new entrants and cracking down on airline misbehaviour,\u201d she says. Slots at Sydney airport are limited to 80 take-offs and landings an hour. The laws will allow for the number of flights an hour at Sydney airport to be increased if there is bad weather. If flight landings or take-offs are affected by weather, the cap will be lifted to 85 flights an hour for two hours. But the number of flights in total will not increase and will still be subject to the airport curfew. The Greens communications spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, has condemned the government for passing a social media ban for under-16s. Hanson-Young called the passage of the law a \u201cworld-leading failure,\u201d saying the bill was rushed through, and is a \u201csham\u201d that has been through a \u201csham process\u201d: There is no excuse for rushing this bill through and racing Peter Dutton to the bottom \u2013 it won\u2019t even commence for 12 months. It is a sham bill that\u2019s been through a sham process. It is a piece of legislation that doesn\u2019t do what the PM or Peter Dutton say it will do \u2013 it won\u2019t make young people safer online and doesn\u2019t make social media safer for anyone. What we\u2019ve witnessed this week is boomers trying to tell young people how the internet should work. Yet these boomers clearly have no idea how young people engage with the internet. This bill might make oldies feel like they\u2019ve done something but in reality it only delivers a false sense of security. Young people will be pushed to darker spaces on the web and regional, marginalised and vulnerable kids will be further isolated. Instead, the parliament should have supported the Greens\u2019 duty of care amendment, and implemented measures that address the dangerous and predatory business models of the tech giants. The passage of this law is a world-leading failure by the PM and Peter Dutton. More consumers chasing savings in Black Friday sales Electronic gadgets, home entertainment and holiday bookings have helped drive booming Black Friday sales, putting shoppers on track to spend a record amount despite cost-of-living pressures. Australian consumers are on target to splurge $6.7bn at this year\u2019s Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales, up 5.5% from 2023, the Australian Retail Association says. The bumper figure is being largely attributed to cash-strapped consumers seeking discounted holiday-season gifts as many household budgets feel the pressure from high interest rates and inflation. The association\u2019s chief industry affairs officer, Fleur Brown, says crowds were big in stores for most segments, with actual trade expected to hit the industry group\u2019s multibillion-dollar forecast. \u201cThere is a leaning to things like clothing and accessories, technology, television, mobile phones, that kind of thing,\u201d she says. \u201cEven services have got offers out there,\u201d she adds, pointing to the likes of travel companies and beauty parlours. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia\u2019s chief executive, Luke Achterstraat, says electronics, holiday bookings and music are proving popular. More than one-quarter of small businesses are expected to take part in this Black Friday, which Achterstraat says is the highest percentage on record. \u201cThings like Black Friday sales and Cyber Monday are a reminder that consumers do still vote with their wallets and are looking to purchase in the lead-up to Christmas.\u201d Almost 66% of shoppers plan to shop at sales in November and December, according to recent research from Monash Business School. About 30% intend to use buy-now, pay-later schemes. Via AAP. \u2018Buy now, pay later\u2019 users to be better protected under national credit laws Some consumer groups have applauded the government\u2019s regulation of \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d products, passed late last night in the Senate. The new law will bring the services under the national credit laws, meaning consumers will have access to greater protections that apply to similar credit products. Services affected include Afterpay, Humm, and Zip, which usually allow consumers to pay for products or services by instalments. The chief executive of the consumer group Choice, Ashely de Silva, says the new laws are a step forward for consumer rights. The new laws will greatly reduce the risk of people being signed up to unaffordable BNPL loans that leave them worse off. It also ensures customers can take disputes with BNPL providers to the financial complaints body and have their complaint fairly heard. NSW residents warned to prepare for more storms, possible flash flooding NSW State Emergency Services are urging residents around the state to brace for more storms on Friday afternoon and into the weekend. Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds, large hailstones and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding in the Southern Tablelands and parts of the Illawarra, South Coast, Sydney Metro, Central Tablelands, North West Slopes, South West Slopes, Central West Slopes and Plains and Snowy Mountains districts. NSW SES State Duty Commander, Acting Assistant Commissioner, Paul McQueen, has advised people in those areas to remain vigilant: I\u2019m urging residents to monitor the conditions as we see these storms continue into the weekend. There is the potential for flash flooding so please ensure you make safe decisions on the road and do not enter any flooded causeways or roads. Please do not drive, play or ride through flood waters. Stop, turn around and find an alternative route. If you find yourself trapped on a flooded road call Triple Zero (000) immediately. A flood watch is in place for minor flooding for the following catchments: Colo River Macdonald River Castlereagh River Macquarie River to Bathurst Macquarie River downstream of Burrendong Dam Bogan River Lachlan River to Cotton\u2019s Weir Mandagery Creek Tumut River Upper Murrumbidgee River to Burrinjuck Dam and Cooma Creek Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers. Covid-19 vaccination rates fall across Australia, Victoria hospitalisations surge A \u201csignificant\u201d jump in Covid-19 hospitalisations and infections has health authorities urging caution as the festive season heats up. The number of people hospitalised with the virus in Victoria rose 59% between October and November, the state\u2019s latest Covid-19 surveillance report revealed. Victoria\u2019s seven-day hospitalisation average had risen to 197 by 26 November, representing a \u201csignificant increase\u201d, according to the health department. The number of cases notified to the department has also increased in recent weeks, up 44% in the past month. Victorians have been urged to protect themselves and those around them in the lead up to summer, particularly those most vulnerable. \u201cIt\u2019s the simple things that can have a big impact: if you\u2019re feeling sick, please stay home,\u201d chief health officer Dr Clare Looker said on Friday. \u201cIf you need to go out, or you\u2019re visiting a higher-risk setting, like an aged-care home or a hospital, it\u2019s a good idea to wear a mask.\u201d She urged people to stay up to date with their Covid-19 vaccinations, as immunity to the virus wanes over time. Dr Looker said JN.1 was the dominant variant in the community and there was no indication that the virus had become more severe. Covid-19 infections have also increased in Western Australia after three months of relatively low and stable figures, according to WA Health Department data on hospitalisations and wastewater sampling. NSW and Queensland have experienced slight increases to reported infections, but their overall numbers of Covid-19 cases remains low. According to the Department of Health and Aged Care, vaccination rates fell in all states and territories in the November reporting period. Via AAP. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you for the rest of the day\u2019s news. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today \u2013 and over these past two weeks! It\u2019s been an honour to briefly jump into the political blogger chair to bring you the latest news from Parliament House \u2013 alongside the fantastic Guardian Australia team in Canberra. For the rest of this Friday afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani is here for our rolling coverage. Take care. After a very busy two weeks here in Canberra, things have well and truly quietened down. After the Senate sat long into the night to pass a raft of legislation, the lower house waved the final amendments through this morning \u2013 and MPs and senators are beginning to head home for the holidays. Mike Bowers has been our eyes and ears throughout Parliament House, during these final two sitting weeks of 2024 \u2013 and here is some of the action he has captured: Read the latest Weekly Beast It\u2019s a Friday afternoon, which can only mean one thing \u2013 it\u2019s time to get stuck into the latest Weekly Beast from Amanda Meade: Queensland premier David Crisafulli has officially launched a 100-day review set to determine which stadium will host the 2032 Brisbane Olympics, naming a board of directors stacked with property industry figures. Crisafulli announced a seven-member board for an independent infrastructure and coordination authority today in a bid to put an end to the stadium debate, which has raged in the sunshine state for years. It will be chaired by property industry executive Stephen Conry, and also include Property Council of Australia\u2019s Queensland boss, Jess Caire, and developer Laurence Lancini. Former Gold Coast Suns\u2019 chair Tony Cochrane, Jill Davies, Jamie Fitzpatrick and recently axed Transurban executive, Sue Johnson, will also be on the board. Then-Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, announced the Gabba would be knocked down and rebuilt as the Game\u2019s centrepiece in 2021. That plan was eventually dumped by her successor, Steven Miles, who opted to refurbish the Queensland Sport and Athletic Centre, which was in turn ruled out by the new premier. Prepare for \u2018challenging\u2019 summer, WA residents warned WA\u2019s emergency services commissioner, Darren Klemm is warning West Australian\u2019s to be prepared for a \u201cchallenging\u201d summer ahead \u2013 with more than 93% of the state bushfire prone, but less than 2% of households having a recorded bushfire plan. I think we have some significant parts of the state, particularly in the southern half, that are incredibly dry \u2026 [We] started 2024 [with] a really extended dry hot period, pretty well from the start of January through to late May into June, where we had minimal rainfall. At some point over the course of this fire season that will play out in terms of the impacts of that lack of rainfall on the vegetation being incredibly dry. Sticking with the bushfires north of Perth in WA\u2019s wheatbelt: the state\u2019s emergency services commissioner, Darren Klemm, is addressing the media with an update. He says the situation is still challenging, and people should remain alert: Over 73,000 hectares of land has been burned so far in this fire and it remains out-of-control and uncontained. The fire is burning in varying fuel loads, including heavy vegetation areas, which burn very high \u2026 the 50km long western flank of the fire will continue to challenge crews, with forecast strong easterly winds, which will contest these containment lines. The commissioner says two volunteers were injured responding to a fire on Wednesday \u2013 one received minor injuries and didn\u2019t require an ambulance, and the other sustained non-life threatening burns and has been discharged from hospital. And yesterday, volunteer firefighters had a lucky escape when a power line came down on top of their fire appliance, temporarily trapping them. They were not injured and we are investigating both of those incidents. Residents rescued from beach as WA bushfire nears coastal communities Stepping away from politics for a moment for the latest on the WA bushfires: residents have been rescued from a beach by boat, as firefighters continue to fight a fierce blaze threatening a series of coastal communities about 200km north of Perth. As AAP reports, an emergency warning remains in place for parts of Wedge Island, Grey, Nambung and Cooljarloo in the Shire of Dandaragan \u2013 this includes the fishing shack villages of Grey and Wedge, and Cervantes, a town with a population of about 500 people. The fire has burned through more than 70,000 hectares of bushland since it was started by a fatal car crash on Monday The shire president, Tony O\u2019Gorman, says some residents from Grey were rescued by boat from a beach yesterday: Our fisheries vessel (in Jurien Bay to the north) and our marine rescue people went down and took those people off the beach because it was just too risky to leave them there. The bushfire is moving in a westerly direction and is not contained or controlled, with more than 200 firefighters battling the blaze. Kean warns of \u2018vested interests\u2019 detracting from renewables transition The chair of the Climate Change Authority, Matt Kean, has responded to the latest modelling out this week showing energy bills could shrink by a fifth over the next decade amid the renewables transition. In a post to X earlier this morning, Kean \u2013 a former NSW energy minister \u2013 said: This independent unbiased modelling out this week shows the energy transition to renewables \u201cwould lower total household energy expenditure by nearly $1,000 per year\u201d in coming years. Don\u2019t let the vested interests take them away from you. Dozens of organisations pen open letter calling for focus on prevention and early intervention at NSW drug summit Ahead of the drug summit in Sydney next week, more than 30 leaders from community, health and Aboriginal organisations are calling on the NSW government to prioritise prevention and early intervention. The organisations have penned an open letter, saying the summit should include a holistic strategy including: Increasing the number and capacity of NSW communities participating in place-based prevention of alcohol and other drugs related harm; Developing and implementing targeted information and behaviour change programs and support for young people and their families. The organisations including the Alcohol and Drug Foundation, Network of Alcohol and other Drugs Agencies, Aboriginal Drug and Alcohol Residential Rehabilitation Network, NSW Council of Social Service and the Matilda Centre. The Alcohol and Drug Foundation CEO, Dr Erin Lalor, says a proactive and balanced strategy is needed. Prevention efforts, especially those led by communities, play a powerful role in reducing harmful drug use by tackling the root causes at a local level. By investing in targeted programs, particularly for at-risk groups like youth in disadvantaged communities, we not only improve individual wellbeing, but also generate significant returns for our health and social systems; every dollar invested in prevention returns approximately $14. More on the review into Parks Victoria Continuing from our last post: Matt Ruchel said it was odd that the review mentioned customer satisfaction, given a report tabled in parliament \u2013 the same day \u2013 found 85.9% visitor satisfaction across all parks. Ruchel said Parks Victoria had a huge task managing 4m hectares of public land, national and metropolitan parks amid pressures related to biodiversity, climate change, feral animals, weeds and increased visitors, and was doing so in the context of funding cuts. Jono La Nauze said: The biggest question before the government is why it is chronically underfunding conservation in this state, including the management of national parks. The review will be completed by March 2025, and will be overseen by the Victorian government with the support of Korda Mentha. Graeme Dear, chair of the Victorian Fisheries Authority, has been appointed as interim CEO. Guardian Australia has asked the minister\u2019s office about the reasons for the review and its terms of reference. The review follows ongoing consultation on a proposed management plan for the Dyurrite Cultural Landscape (Mount Arapiles - Tooan state park), opposed by some in the rock climbing community. However, the issue was not mentioned by the minister when announcing the review. Parks and environment organisations say they were blindsided by the Victorian government\u2019s review into Parks Victoria, announced late on the last sitting day of state parliament. The state\u2019s environment minister, Steve Dimopoulos, ordered a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of the statutory authority and announced the departure of Parks Victoria CEO Matthew Jackson. In a statement, Dimopoulos said the review would focus on Parks Victoria\u2019s priorities, and would \u201cidentify ways to reduce red tape, improve customer service and deliver better outcomes for Victorians\u201d. Matt Ruchel, executive director of the Victorian National Parks Association, said the announcement at 4pm yesterday came \u201ccompletely out of the blue\u201d. We are deeply concerned this is a trojan horse for dismantling hard-won nature protections. Environment Victoria\u2019s CEO, Jono La Nauze, said the environment campaign organisation was also \u201cblindsided\u201d, along with many others in the conservation community. \u201cWe have real questions about the motivation and the basis for this review,\u201d La Nauze said, especially as the government had not provided any evidence suggesting issues or concerns with Parks Victoria. Leaked sections of a 530-page report outlining an overhaul of New South Wales gambling policy have confirmed \u201ca clear win\u201d for the gambling industry, with the government urged not to further restrict poker machine operating hours. This is despite the NSW government publishing independent research that confirms people who use poker machines after 2am are \u201cexperiencing significant negative consequences\u201d. When the draft proposal by executive members of a panel advising the government on gaming reform was first exposed by Guardian Australia, public health campaigners hoped other panellists would be able to see it removed or amended in the final report. Several members of the panel have previously called for poker machine operating hours to be cut to reduce community harm. Members of the panel are unable to publicly comment on the report until its public release due to confidentiality agreements. They include representatives for the biggest gaming venues in the state, machine manufacturers, NSW police, Wesley Mission, the NSW Council of Social Services, the United Workers Union, two academics and one person with lived experience. Sections of the final report seen by Guardian Australia urge the government to \u201cretain the minimum six-hour shutdown period, commencing no later than 4am\u201d. This would allow poker machine venues to stay open from 10am to 4am. Tim Costello, the chief advocate of the Alliance for Gambling Reform, has described that recommendation as ridiculous, given the scale of harm caused by poker machines. That\u2019s clearly an industry win. The NSW government is now considering the final report. ACCC approves more Qatar Airways and Virgin flights The competition watchdog has granted interim approvals for Qatar Airways\u2019 plan to increase its flights between Australia and Doha as part of an alliance with Virgin Australia. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) announced it had granted interim authorisation for the two carriers\u2019 plans to enter into an alliance, which allows the two carriers to begin marketing and selling tickets for the new 28 weekly return services from June 2025. The agreement will see Virgin Australia, which has not owned any planes capable of long-haul flights since its pandemic-induced restructure, enter into a \u201cwet lease\u201d agreement with Qatar Airways, in which it leases not just the Middle-Eastern carrier\u2019s aircraft but also its crew. In effect, the authorisation via an Australian airline allows Qatar Airways to bypass the requirement for its government to secure increased bilateral air rights with Australia, more than a year after the Albanese government infamously shot down the carrier\u2019s push for an additional 28 weekly flights in a decision that fuelled speculation about Qantas\u2019 influence in Canberra. The new services will be offered subject to final regulatory approval by the ACCC and other government bodies, meaning that if final approvals are not granted, customers who booked will be offered refunds or moved onto alternate services. ACCC deputy chair Mick Keogh said: Having this court-enforceable undertaking that protects customers was important to our decision to allow Virgin Australia and Qatar Airways to start selling tickets now. The proposed alliance is part of a broader move that will see Qatar Airways take a 25% minority ownership stake in Virgin Australia. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has issued a statement on the under-16 social media ban. As AAP reports, a spokesperson said that while it respected the decision by federal parliament, issues remained with how the ban would be enforced. We are concerned about the process which rushed the legislation through while failing to properly consider the evidence, what industry already does to ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the voices of young people. The task now turns to ensuring there is productive consultation on all rules associated with the bill to ensure a technically feasible outcome that does not place an onerous burden on parents and teens and a commitment that rules will be consistently applied across all social apps used by teens. Age-verification trials on how young people would be stopped from accessing social media are still ongoing. The Meta spokesman said an option would be age verification through operating systems or app stores. Birth rate fears after NSW caps nation-first IVF subsidy An Australian-first rebate aimed at making parenthood easier for thousands of couples will be limited within months, sparking fears the move will drive down already declining birth rates. As AAP reports, more than 14,000 women have been able to receive a $2,000 cash rebate for IVF treatment since it was introduced as part of the then-Coalition NSW government\u2019s women-focused budget in 2022. But the state government will apply an income test on applicants from 19 February, with applicants needing to show they receive the family tax benefit, hold a government health care card or have an annual household income of $116,000 or less. State opposition leader Mark Speakman said the income test equated to $58,000 per person \u2013 or about $25,000 less than the starting salary of a teacher \u2013 and was a \u201ccruel, distressing blow for the thousands of women and their partners who were relying on this subsidy to support their dreams of having a family\u201d. Labor said the Coalition allocated $24m over four years for the scheme, but that money had run out in less than two. Premier Chris Minns told reporters: We obviously want to help people, but the number of people that applied for the scheme was far beyond what the government could afford. I apologise for it, I know that a lot of families struggle, they want to have kids, they need help to do it [and] cost of living is obviously a big impact on family budgets. How does Australia\u2019s social media ban compare to laws in other countries? After passing both levels of parliament, the government has been touting its under-16s social media ban as \u201cworld-leading\u201d. But how does the ban actually compare to laws in other countries? You can have a read of this explainer below: \u2018Depends on context\u2019 whether certain pro-Palestine phrases antisemitic, Mark Scott says The University of Sydney\u2019s vice-chancellor, Mark Scott, says it \u201cdepends on the context\u201d whether pro-Palestine phrases like \u201cfrom the river to the sea\u201d are antisemitic. Scott is continuing to face questioning over a review into the university\u2019s policies and procedures, which includes a new \u201ccivility rule\u201d that would require speakers on campus to \u201cmake the meaning of contested words and phrases clear to the audience\u201d. The Nationals MP Henry Pike asked Scott at a parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism whether he considered terms used on his campus such as \u201cfrom the river to the sea\u201d and \u201cintifada\u201d to be antisemitic in any context. Scott said: There is a significant debate around some of these terms and what [the] Hodgkinson [review] says ... there is free speech and there are limits to free speech and those limits to free speech are imposed by the law. There isn\u2019t a jurisdiction in the country that has banned those phrases ... it depends on the context ... there are Jewish academics at our university who would say that there are not. There are others at our university who have experienced them who would say that they are. It depends on the context. Woolies denies shelves bare as strike enters second week Woolworths insists its shelves are not beginning to run bare as warehouse workers enter a second week of strike action. As AAP reports, up to 1,500 employees across a number of Woolworths distribution centres in Victoria and NSW walked off the job indefinitely on 21 November. They are fighting for a pay increase, along with an end to a performance framework the United Workers Union said was pushing staff to sacrifice safety standards in pursuit of faster work. Woolworths insisted all stores were still receiving regular stock deliveries, but some were getting their goods less frequently than previously scheduled. The union claimed the strike was already having a huge impact, with \u201cgaping holes\u201d on shelves normally containing household and frozen goods. National secretary Tim Kennedy said: We are seeing bare shelves across the eastern seaboard now. We warned that this would happen if five warehouses took strike action. Woolworths are squeezing shoppers at the register and workers on pay and conditions, while making ever-increasing profits \u2026 this is contributing to growing wealth inequality in Australia. A Woolworths spokeswoman said the company was working hard to sort out the pay dispute. Watch: the under-16s social media ban explained As expected, there is much talk today about the under-16s social media ban today, after it passed both levels of parliament. As our technology reporter Josh Taylor explains, there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t yet know about how it will work in practice. That includes which platforms will be affected and how those platforms will determine users are the age they say they are. Since the ban won\u2019t come into force for a year \u2013 after the next federal election \u2013 that will be the problem of whoever is the next communication minister. You can watch his explainer below for more. Sydney university to continue talks on campus protest policies after backlash The vice-chancellor of the University of Sydney, Mark Scott, says consultation will continue over the campuses\u2019 protest policies after human rights groups and some academics and students criticised them on free speech grounds. Speaking at a parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism, Scott was asked to reiterate that he had accepted all 15 recommendations of an independent review into the university\u2019s policies and procedures by Bruce Hodgkinson SC, which would require speakers on campus to \u201cmake the meaning of contested words and phrases clear to the audience\u201d and to maintain its strict ban on protests in buildings. It\u2019s only arrived this week ... there was a special meeting of senate, our fellows of senate have read the report, they have been briefed ... and they accepted the recommendations in principle. But they recognise significant work now has to be done. In a statement yesterday, the NSW Council for Civil Liberties said \u201curgent intervention\u201d by the state government was needed to direct management against implementing the proposed restrictions, which it alleged would \u201ceffectively ban\u201d basic forms of political expression. Scott told the inquiry that complaints about antisemitism had \u201csignificantly increased\u201d while a pro-Palestine encampment was operating and had since decreased markedly in semester two. The shadow communications minister, David Coleman, spoke with Sky News earlier this morning as the under-16s social media passed through both levels of parliament. He told the program that the \u201cbenefits far outweigh the risks\u201d of the policy. What other generation in history has grown up being exposed to as much damaging content as this generation? \u2026 [We can] divert our eyes from that and not talk about it, or we can stare it in the face, acknowledge it and do something about it. Asked about the potential social impacts of the bill for young people, he continued: I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve sort of come to a position where we should be saying, \u2018look, if a 10-year-old can\u2019t access Snapchat, that\u2019s unacceptable.\u2019 I just think that it doesn\u2019t make sense because we know that, overwhelmingly, it\u2019s a bad place for kids to be \u2026 If I am fortunate enough to become communications minister at the election, enforcing this law and ensuring it works as hard as it can to protect Australian kids will be our number one priority. Severe thunderstorms forecast across NSW and ACT today As AAP reports, Bureau of Meteorology senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury predicted severe thunderstorms and heavy rain across much of NSW and the ACT today. A cloud band will extend across eastern Australia, bringing humid conditions and scattered showers and thunderstorms. Severe storms are possible across Sydney once again on Friday, with the risk of flash flooding where storms bring heavy falls. In Queensland, the BoM forecast severe thunderstorms were likely in inland areas. Bridges inundated in Queensland flash floods Flash-flooding hit the isolated In Queensland mining town of Mt Isa after severe thunderstorms and heavy rainfall, with all but two of the local bridges inundated, AAP reports. Water rescue teams were required to help three vehicles out of floodwaters. Moderate or minor flood warnings were in place for several rivers in NSW and Queensland, while flood-watch warnings were issued for NSW\u2019s central-west and south-west catchments. Wild storms keep emergency workers busy on east coast amid flood warnings Moving away from politics for a moment: eastern parts of Australia have been battered by storms and further wild weather could be on the way. As AAP reports, emergency crews were busy in NSW after severe thunderstorms hit large areas of the state, including densely-populated parts of Sydney and the Illawarra. Fifty crews worked through the night in Appin, a small town south of Sydney, after the storms brought down trees and blocked the main access road in both directions. Access was restored about 2am. There were also 48 incidents in the central west of NSW, including the downing of several large trees in Wellington, where roads were closed and properties damaged. Also weighing in on the under-16s social media ban is Leo Puglisi, who founded the teenage-run 6 News when he was just 11. Now 17, and vocally against the ban, Puglisi has argued that it risks restricting the creativity of young people. Let\u2019s be clear: 6 News is not going away. Our team is made up of many young journalists \u2013 some still in high school, while others are preparing to enter university. Some of our journalists, aged 15 when this debate started, are now past the age limit and allowed to use social media. As we made clear in our submission to the inquiry on this legislation, we\u2019ve been built up by having 13-15-year-olds see 6 News online and then join the team to explore their own passions in journalism and media. We have said that this ban seriously risks restricting creativity from our young people, no matter what passion or future career they want to explore. 6 News has more than 40,000 followers on X (which will be impacted by the ban), and nearly 30,000 on YouTube. Puglisi and his team have covered elections, international conflict and interviewed everyone from Scott Morrison to Anthony Albanese. Crisafulli defends LNP\u2019s \u2018adult crime, adult time\u2019 legislation On the Queensland government\u2019s \u201cadult crime, adult time\u201d laws it is set to introduce, David Crisafulli stood by the policy \u2013 despite the human rights concerns that have been raised. As Andrew Messenger reports, the state government has acknowledged that the legislation will \u201cdirectly discriminate\u201d against children, by limiting their \u201cprotection from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\u201d. Crisafulli was asked if this sits well with him. He stood by the policy and said: If we were focused on one end of the spectrum, I would accept the criticism. But we\u2019re focused on an entire crime crisis. The laws were weakened a decade ago. It has done no favour for Queenslanders \u2013 who have become the victim capital of the country \u2013 or young offenders, who haven\u2019t had the consequences for actions or the structure to turn their life around. Queensland premier defends repealing path to treaty legislation Moving to Queensland politics for a moment: as Andrew Messenger reported yesterday, the soon-to-be-sacked chairperson of Queensland\u2019s truth-telling inquiry said he was given no notice of a decision to repeal the body\u2019s legislation. Josh Creamer has accused the Crisafulli government of setting relations with Indigenous people back \u201cfor a very long time\u201d as it repeals the state\u2019s historic pathway to treaty legislation. Queensland premier David Crisafulli spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier this morning and defended the move, saying: Twelve months ago we made a commitment that we would repeal the legislation. So I [don\u2019t think] anyone could say they\u2019re blindsided. Why ditch this on your first parliamentary sitting session without any consultation, though? Crisafulli said the inquiry was going to continue working unless the legislation was changed, so \u201cto have not done that would have seen the bills continue to wrack up\u201d. There is nothing that we will be doing that we have not said we were doing. We said we would repeal the act. We said that we would make sure every cent still remained available for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and we are fulfilling \u2026 what we said we would do before the election. The vice-chancellor of the University of Sydney, Mark Scott, has told a parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism on campuses his institution \u201cdid not get everything right\u201d during a pro-Palestine encampment and there were \u201cclearly differing views\u201d on its responses to certain events. What we have committed to do is to learn from these hugely challenging and complex events \u2013 and the experiences of other universities around the world \u2013 and to listen to those who would work with us to ensure our campuses are safe and welcoming for all. Scott reiterated his support for an independent review into the university\u2019s policies and procedures by Bruce Hodgkinson AM SC, released this week, requiring speakers to \u201cmake the meaning of contested words and phrases clear to the audience\u201d and to maintain its strict ban on protests in buildings. Human rights groups have warned the policy will have a dangerous chilling effect, with the NSW Council for Civil Liberties writing to the state government yesterday urging it to intervene to protect the right to freedom of expression. Scott told the inquiry the report provided a \u201cclear roadmap for ensuring a safe and welcoming campus for all students and staff, while at the same time safeguarding our commitment to free speech and academic freedom\u201d. We are determined to do whatever is necessary to achieve that balance. Sticking with the under-16 social media ban: independent senator Tammy Tyrrell has lashed the policy in a statement this morning, writing that the bill \u201cisn\u2019t worth the paper it\u2019s written on\u201d. The bill passed the Senate last night, with the support of Labor and the Coalition. The entire crossbench, as well as two Coalition senators, voted against it. It also passed the lower house this morning. In a statement, Tyrrell argued that the two major parties \u201cgave this social media ban policy as much thought as they probably give to what underwear they put on in the morning. Zero.\u201d The bill isn\u2019t worth the paper it\u2019s written on. It\u2019s not a policy, it\u2019s an idea for Labor and the Liberals to win votes at the election and not worry about the consequences of implementing their poorly thought-out ban. She said the debate around this bill, and the would-be mis- and disinformation bill, showed the importance of increased digital literacy education. We should be teaching kids in school how to navigate the online world, rather than taking it away from them altogether. As a parent, I tried to give my kids everything they needed to make informed decisions for themselves. Not decide things for them. That\u2019s the way we should be approaching this social media ban and better digital literacy education. Clare and Ley welcome social media ban On Sunrise earlier this morning, education minister Jason Clare and deputy opposition leader Sussan Ley both welcomed the passage of the under-16 social media ban legislation. Ley said the onus would be on social media platforms: Tech companies have to take reasonable steps. That\u2019s the language used in the legislation. Now they know how to do this. I don\u2019t want to see them being tricky, I don\u2019t want to see them trying to sidestep, I don\u2019t want to see them trying to be too cute about this \u2013 they know how to do this. This bill has significant fines if they do the wrong thing. We have an expectation they do the right thing by our kids. I\u2019m delighted that the laws are passing the parliament and that nearly everyone in the parliament has supported them. It\u2019s just too important not to. As Sarah Basford Canales reported overnight, it remains unclear how social media platforms will be able determine the age of users and if Australians will need to hand over identification details to access the sites. Labor senator Jenny McAllister said the changes wouldn\u2019t force Australians to use government ID. So how will this be enforced, if not for ID or facial recognition? Clare told the program that \u201cnone of this will be perfect\u201d \u2013 not answering directly. There\u2019s going to be cases where young people are still going to be on social media. What this is going to do is make sure that most young people aren\u2019t. End of an era for Shorten and Dutton\u2019s Today show slot Regular viewers of the Today show (or regular readers of this blog) may know that NDIS minister Bill Shorten and opposition leader Peter Dutton make a regular, Friday morning appearance on the show \u2013 discussing the week that was, and trading jibes. They usually appear on two separate screens, but today they stood side-by-side in one of parliament\u2019s many courtyards, discussing what went down in the Senate yesterday. Dutton likened the guillotine motion to a \u201cgoing out of business sale\u201d and said: It was like everything discounted and whatever it takes to clear the shelves \u2026 The Albanese government is sort of running on three flat tires at the moment, and they are limping to Christmas. They\u2019re just getting out of this parliament. They they spent a monster of taxpayers\u2019 money to get the Greens across the line in a pretty unholy alliance, and I think people see through it. After a bit of back-and-forth on the economy and energy, the pair hugged it out \u2013 as Shorten is retiring from politics next year and this marks their last cross together. Dutton joked: It\u2019s been a rough night when you\u2019re embracing Bill in the morning, that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. Speaking about behaviour in the Senate, Simon Birmingham said that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to behave like an idiot or be rude to one another or tear up the conventions \u2026 [because this] reflects poorly on this place and it\u2019s unnecessary\u201d. Asked who he was referencing, Birmingham took aim at some of the crossbench: We saw that from some of the crossbench, and they provoke one another too. It goes back to that tribalism \u2013 those far left, far right elements \u2013 and it\u2019s just so very, very unnecessary, attention-seeking behaviour, rather than productive behaviour to actually get things done. If there\u2019s a parting message in some ways to voters, it\u2019s look at Anthony Albanese and the Labor party, look at Peter Dutton and the Coalition \u2013 think about who you want to have govern the country. I\u2019ve seen lots of unpredictable, destructive behaviour that all too often comes from minor parties and crossbenchers. As Simon Birmingham announced his retirement in the Senate yesterday, he expressed concern \u201cthe world is headed into an era where populism trumps the policy\u201d. Speaking earlier this morning, he pointed to the US as an example of where this is happening and said: I think those who have sought to play politics, and it\u2019s happened on both the far left and the far right with issues like abortion, that is not the Australian way. I was very pleased to see Peter Dutton slap it down and be very clear about his view that they are state matters, and I think also show that he understands the respect that Australian women expect for their reproductive rights \u2013 and it\u2019s just not a debate that we want to have infiltrate our politics like it plays out in the US. The opposition leader in the Senate, Simon Birmingham, also spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier this morning. Yesterday afternoon, Birmingham announced he would not re-contest the next election and would resign from politics after nearly two decades. He told the program he felt a bit lighter today, having made the announcement, but \u201cit\u2019s not easy to walk away from the Australian parliament.\u201d Asked if his announcement was a concession he doesn\u2019t believe Peter Dutton will win next year, Birmingham said no \u2013 \u201cfar from it\u201d. Making this decision got harder and harder as the time got closer and closer, because I may well be walking away from the opportunity to be Australia\u2019s next foreign minister. I have decided there\u2019s something different I should do with my life at this stage, after nearly 18 years in the Senate \u2013 just as Bill Shorten is walking away at this election to do something different with his life. Birmingham said Dutton would provide \u201c a very strong choice [and] very different policy choices\u201d, pointing to nuclear. There will be clear choices on the table and I think those polls show a disappointment in the Albanese government that Australians feeling the cost-of-living pressures are clearly showing, and may well show them the way through to that election, and I wish Peter and the team every success. Watt says Greens and Coalition \u2018came to their senses\u2019 in backing legislation Murray Watt defended the \u201cguillotine\u201d motion in the Senate yesterday to pass a slew of legislation, and said it was \u201cno surprise that you do end up with a bit of a log jam at the end of the term\u201d. This is a larger number than usual, but I\u2019m really pleased that yesterday the Senate did work together, with the government, to pass a bunch of legislation. He was also asked about comments from Greens leader Adam Bandt that \u201cpressure works\u201d, after it negotiated a number of measures in exchange for supporting the government\u2019s guillotine. But Watt again labelled the party as \u201cblockers\u201d of legislation: They have clearly heard the message that the Australian people are sick of them blocking progressive reform, rather than working with the government to get it done. I think the Greens \u2013 and for that matter the opposition \u2013 who supported us on some other legislation recognised it wasn\u2019t going to be in their interests to go through the summer break, trying to explain to people why they stopped more housing being built, cost-of-living relief being provided, why they stopped online safety measures being taken. That\u2019s what this legislation was about and I think they came to their senses and realised they needed to get this done. Despite both houses of parliament having now wrapped up for the year, it\u2019s been a very busy morning in Canberra when it comes to political reaction. I\u2019ll circle back to a few breakfast interviews we missed \u2013 starting with Murray Watt on ABC News Breakfast. Asked if he thought the under-16 social media ban would work, the minister for employment and workplace relations said yes. And if social media companies \u2013 in particular X \u2013 would play ball, he also said yes. We have seen comments from Mr Musk and various other parties about this, but we did include very significant penalties of up to $50m if the social media companies don\u2019t play ball. I think they will take it seriously, but I think they\u2019ve got an interest in preserving their reputation and their social licence. As every day goes by, the proof becomes clearer about the link between social media and the kind of content that\u2019s appearing on it and the mental health challenges our kids face. Between those fines and social pressure, we will see social media companies play ball \u2013 and if they don\u2019t, then we have the ability to go after them. Press conference in Canberra concludes Anthony Albanese said his thoughts were with the deputy prime minister Richard Marles, who will farewell his mother in Melbourne today. Richard Marles is someone who is very well liked across the parliament and loved by his colleagues. He is such a great person, and his mother was clearly an extraordinary Australian as well \u2013 trailblazer in education \u2013 and our thoughts will be with him today. With that, the prime minister wrapped up the press conference. Jim Chalmers on changes to the Reserve Bank Overnight, the government agreed to support Greens amendments to retain the power to override Reserve Bank decisions on interest rates and for the RBA to direct the lending activities of banks. Speaking on this just now, treasurer, Jim Chalmers said: The passage of this legislation means that we can get on with strengthening and modernising the Reserve Bank \u2026 We will consult with the opposition in good faith, as we\u2019re obligated to do, to make sure that the people that we appoint to the new governance board and the new monetary policy board are first class and first rate \u2026 The timing of the passage of the Reserve Bank reforms was not in our hands. If it were up to us, we would have passed it a long time ago, and we would have already had the new arrangements in place. Chalmers said the government accommodated \u201cevery single one\u201d of the oppositions concerns and made changes to the legislation to accomodate this, but \u201cthey still said no, and that meant that we had to negotiate with the crossbench\u201d. That wasn\u2019t our first preference, but it was made necessary by the irresponsible behaviour of the Coalition. And so the mistake that we made for too long was to take Angus Taylor seriously on these matters when his colleagues don\u2019t. Albanese looks to crossbench to advance electoral reforms On the would-be electoral reforms, which were not successful, the prime minister said the government would \u201clook for other paths and roads to success\u201d. Anthony Albanese said he had indicated to the crossbench that \u201cit is not sustainable in a democracy to have individuals contributing tens of millions of dollars\u201d. That damages our democracy, because it takes away the principle that everyone gets an equal say in our democracy \u2026 People know that over the last couple of elections, there\u2019s been a couple of $100m dollars contributed by one individual, and that is not healthy for our democracy. So we\u2019ll engage constructively, and I\u2019ve already had some discussions this week with the crossbench, and we\u2019ll engage with the crossbench to see if we can progress reforms. The legislation faced criticism from the crossbench of attempting to \u201crig\u201d electoral rules in a \u201cmajor party stitch-up\u201d. PM says government \u2018inherited immigration system not fit for purpose\u2019 On migration, the prime minister said the government \u201cwants an inclusive Australia that stands up for that\u201d \u2013 but \u201cwe understand as well that our migration system needs to be robust and needs to not be manipulated\u201d. Anthony Albanese said the government \u201cinherited an immigration system that wasn\u2019t fit for purpose\u201d. On Peter Dutton\u2019s watch, there was a huge spike in the number of applications onshore, we had three reviews into the migration system, from the former head of prime minister and cabinet, from senior respected authorities in this area \u2013 all of them said that the immigration system that we inherited was a mess, so we have to clean up a whole range of issues. Asked about the third-country arrangement \u2013 and which countries would be paid to take non-citizens from Australia \u2013 the PM did not answer directly: We\u2019ll implement our legislation. Albanese says last remaining bills \u2018carried overwhelmingly\u2019 through lower house today Speaking on the sheer volume of legislation that was passed through the Senate last night, Anthony Albanese said some had \u201c2023\u201d attached to them \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s the hint for how long it has been around\u201d. There was legislation last night that has remained in the Senate for a long period of time to literally change the references to Queen Elizabeth \u2026 I would have thought that should have passed the Senate in a minute after it was introduced, but no \u2026 It\u2019s beyond my comprehension why that was still around and not just flowed through. [But] we got our legislation through. It was all good legislation that was supported by the Senate and in the house today. Most of the bills, I think there are about four or five divisions, but they carried overwhelmingly. PM on the under-16 social media ban Taking questions from reporters, Anthony Albanese is clearly framing the under-16 social media ban as an election pitch to parents. The prime minister said: This is something that tomorrow, on the sidelines of sporting events \u2013 whether it be netball or cricket season at the moment, or tennis or little athletics \u2013 mums and dads will be talking about this. And they\u2019ll be talking about it when they pick up their young ones from school this afternoon, and hopefully this morning, dropping them off as well. This has been an issue that has raised with me more, or at least as much, as any other issue by people when I\u2019m out and about, and what we\u2019ve done is world-leading\u2026 We don\u2019t argue that its implementation will be perfect, just like the alcohol ban for under 18 doesn\u2019t mean that someone under 18 never has access, but we know that it\u2019s the right thing to do. Chalmers says Coalition has \u2018vacated the field on economy\u2019 Also addressing the media is treasurer Jim Chalmers, who said there was still a lot to do, but: What we saw in the Senate last night was really the triumph of outcomes over politics, the triumph of outcomes and delivery and progress over the kind of petty, nasty, negative politics being played by our opponents. He argued that the Coalition had \u201ccompletely vacated the field on the economy\u201d, and took aim at them for not having \u201cany costed, credible or coherent economic policies\u201d at the end of the parliamentary term. The treasurer recognised the crossbench, saying: The best kind of economic reform is bipartisan, but when the Coalition has vacated the field, we have no choice but to make progress with the crossbench. I acknowledge them\u2026 Gallagher says number of bills passed not record but \u2018right up there\u2019 The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, also addressed the media in Canberra about the number of bills passed through the Senate. The PM made it clear that he wanted to see legislation get through the Senate, and we were able to do that \u2013 so I took those instructions seriously. We worked hard across the chamber, and got an extraordinary result. Gallagher said the Senate coud be a \u201cfrustrating chamber\u201d where it was \u201cdifficult to progress legislation, particularly when you\u2019ve got an opposition that doesn\u2019t want to see any reform passed\u201d. So working across the chamber, with the PM\u2019s leadership, we were able to convince the majority of the Senate that those 45 bills were important bills to get through \u2026 It was a big, big night. You don\u2019t often get a 37-page guillotine and about six hours of voting \u2026 At the end of the day, we passed 31 bills yesterday and 45 bills through the week, which I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite the record, but it\u2019s certainly right up there. The prime minister is speaking to reporters in Canberra after the government passed a slew of bills overnight and this morning. Gearing up for the election next year, Anthony Albanese told reporters: This week we continued to deliver our agenda, working hard to make Australians\u2019 lives better, holding supermarkets to account to get fairer prices at the checkout, 80,000 new homes for renters, helping 40,000 Australians to be able to buy a home\u2026 And today, as a direct result of our legislation \u2026 parents can have a different discussion with their young ones, a different discussion that will result in better outcomes and less harm for young Australians. Platforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them. We\u2019re making sure that mums and dads can have that different conversation today, and in future days. We\u2019ve got your back, is our message to Australian parents. Murray Watt on the Nature Positive legislation \u2013 what happened? As we\u2019ve reported, Anthony Albanese killed off a potential deal with the Greens to pass the government\u2019s \u201cnature positive\u201d legislation after an intervention by the Western Australia premier, Roger Cook. Watt said \u201cwe would certainly like to see this legislation passed \u2026 before the election\u201d \u2013 but host Patricia Karvelas asked if there was a deal with the Greens, why not pass it? The Greens, just as they did with the housing issue \u2026 have been attaching conditions to their support, which were unacceptable to us \u2026 Karvelas pointed out that there was an agreement in writing with the Greens \u2013 but Watt said he wasn\u2019t aware of this. My understanding is that there have been extensive negotiations with the Greens that have gone on for some time, and they simply weren\u2019t prepared to back in the legislation as it stood. And that\u2019s disappointing. Karvelas said there was also a deal in writing with David Pocock. Watt said he hadn\u2019t heard about this. This is the first time that\u2019s been brought to me, and I haven\u2019t seen the document that you\u2019re quoting from. We have made very clear that we would like to pass that piece of legislation, but that the Greens in particular, had conditions we were unwilling to agree to. Watt says he would discuss under-16 social media ban with Trump administration if it\u2019s a concern The minister for employment and workplace relations, Murray Watt, also spoke with ABC RN earlier about the under-16 social media ban. Would figures like Elon Musk \u2013 the owner of X, outspoken against the legislation \u2013 cause problems when it comes to working with the incoming Donald Trump administration? Watt responded: I think Elon Musk has already made clear what he thinks of our world-leading legislation, and I don\u2019t think any of us should be surprised that he has a different view to the Australian government on these matters, given he runs and owns a platform. But our focus has always been protecting Australian kids. Brought back to the point about Trump, Watt said: \u201cWe\u2019ll obviously talk to Donald Trump\u2019s administration if that\u2019s an issue that they want to talk to us about. We expect that there will be a whole range of issues to talk about with Donald Trump and his administration once he\u2019s inaugurated in January. Of course, there are concerns around trade issues and tariff issues as well. It\u2019s not unusual for us to have different issues with different partners around the world. And if this is something that the Trump administration\u2019s got a concern about, then we\u2019d be happy to talk with them about it. But as I say, we\u2019re not backing off from the work that we\u2019ve done to protect Australian kids and protect Australian families. Tink criticises would-be electoral reform that would have \u2018killed off community independent movement\u2019 Kylea Tink was also asked about the government\u2019s electoral reforms \u2013 which were not passed after a deal between the government and opposition hit a roadblock. The independent agreed she was breathing a sigh of relief, but argued this \u201cshould be very loud alarm for Australians in terms of the arrogance of the two party system and their attitudes around our democracy\u201d. The longer I sort of sat with it, it was pretty clear the intent of that legislation was to kill off the community independent movement. Now, at a time when one in three people at the last election voted for a major party \u2026 I think it sends a message, as I said about the arrogance of the two party system and its desire to protect itself. Here are the details on the would-be bill, which was fiercely criticised by the crossbench: Independent MP Kylea Tink has described the under-16 social media ban as \u201cheadline grabbing\u201d but not actually doing what it says it will. Speaking on ABC RN earlier this morning, she said: I think the most concerning thing about the legislation \u2026 [is that] it doesn\u2019t do what it says it\u2019s going to do with him. What we\u2019ve got is \u2013 I think you\u2019ve just described it beautifully \u2013 a piece of legislation that\u2019s grabbing headlines, not only here but right around the world. But will it make any child under 16 safer on social media today? No. And in fact, it will create a high degree of anxiety amongst young Australians who are using their social media platforms to feel like they\u2019re part of a community that may not be in their immediate circle\u2026 This place down here operates in a crazy way, and perhaps the most frustrating part of that crazy operation is when you see legislation come through this place that is about nothing more than trying to give people a sense that something\u2019s being done here \u2013 but really there are no tangible outcomes. Tink went on to describe the bill as \u201ca 1970 solution for a 2024 problem\u201d. Just jumping back to the House of Representatives, where the house has just adjourned for the year \u2013 after the rapid passage of all the amendments that came through from the Senate overnight. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, briefly spoke on indulgence, welcoming the passage of the under-16 social media ban in particular and saying: And on that note, Mr Speaker, I move that the house do now adjourn and wish everyone a very merry Christmas and a peaceful and joyous new year. The speaker, Milton Dick, then said the house would adjourn until Tuesday 4 September 2025 \u2013 but being the end of a (very, very) long week, he misspoke. The house will return on 4 February next year. Here is the legislation that passed through the lower house this morning, with amendments from the Senate: Commonwealth entities (payment surcharges) bill 2024 Treasury laws amendment (responsible buy now pay later and other measures) bill 2024 Crimes amendment (strengthening the criminal justice response to sexual violence) bill 2024 Family law amendment bill 2024 Future made in Australia bill 2024 Future made in Australia (omnibus amendments No. 1) bill 2024 Treasury laws amendment (Reserve Bank reforms) bill 2023 Privacy and other legislation amendment bill 2024 Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing amendment bill 2024 Migration amendment (removal and other measures) bill 2024 Online safety amendment (social media minimum age) bill 2024 Adam Bandt on Nature Positive \u2013 what happened? On the Nature Positive legislation \u2013 and Anthony Albanese\u2019s decision to kill off a potential deal with the Greens to pass it after intervention by the WA premier \u2013 Adam Bandt said it was \u201cbitterly disappointing.\u201d [Roger Cook] made it clear that the loggers and the miners didn\u2019t want Labor to protect environment and the forests, and Labor did what they were told, and it\u2019s bitterly disappointing. So the Greens had an agreement with environment minister Tanya Plibersek, and then with the PM \u2013 what happened, and did she know about the meeting? Bandt said: I think I\u2019ll let what those public statements \u2013 including from the Labor government over in Western Australia \u2013 speak for themselves. He went on to say that Sarah Hanson-Young \u201cworked very hard on this\u201d and the Greens made a number of compromises. I think the reasons the that we didn\u2019t get the protections passed aren\u2019t the fault of the Greens or the environment minister \u2026 It was like a mining tax campaign sped up. You had in the middle of the week, you had the big resource corporations saying on the front page of the paper, \u2018these laws can\u2019t go ahead\u2019. And then you had the West Australian Labor premiers delivering for those big resource corporations, and we\u2019ve managed to kill it. Bandt says Greens \u2018did push hard\u2019 on housing legislation, but \u2018for a reason\u2019 Adam Bandt also weighed in on whether that had been an impasse between the Greens and Labor over legislation in recent months, with the government routinely labelling them as \u201cblockers\u201d. The Greens leader said when it came to housing, \u201cwe\u2019ve been saying to the government, you\u2019ve got to take this seriously, and there\u2019s an opportunity in this Parliament to actually do something about it.\u201d We pushed the government hard on stage three tax cuts early in the [year], and they changed their mind on that \u2026 We were hoping that we might get the government over the line on things like rent caps and reforming some of those unfair tax concessions [to level] the playing field [for] first home buyers. And so yes, we did push hard \u2026 but we did it for a reason \u2026 We were going to the point where they were costing the [negative] gearing changes and actually looking at this and examining it, so we got pretty close. Bandt argued that as a result of this, \u201cthe debate has changed\u201d in the lead up to the next election and there is \u201can understanding that we\u2019re going to have to dig deep\u201d on housing. The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, believes a minority government is possible at the next election. Speaking with ABC RN earlier, he spoke about the negotiations the Greens made with Labor to pass its \u201cguillotine\u201d motion in the Senate yesterday \u2013 and what it got in return for this \u2013 and said: We\u2019ve pushed us as hard as we can, got what we could. And now for us, the attention turns to the election \u2013 keeping Peter Dutton out and taking some of these issues, like the housing and climate crisis, to what may well be a minority parliament at the next election. Bandt said Australia was in the situation where \u201cless than a third of the country votes for the government, more than a third of the country votes for the opposition and about a third of the country votes for someone else\u201d. [As] those trends continuing, I think that puts an obligation on all of us to work together. And I think we\u2019ve seen at the end of this parliament, that where there\u2019s goodwill and there can be constructive negotiations. We can get things done that actually make a difference to people\u2019s lives. Canavan says under-16 social media ban has caused new generation to become passionate about democracy Nationals senator Matt Canavan was loudly outspoken against the under-16 social media ban bill and voted against it \u2013 but as we know, the bill ultimately passed. In a late-night post to X after the legislation passed, he said there would be a \u201csilver lining\u201d from the \u201cshameful stitch-up in the Senate\u201d \u2013 that a \u201cwhole new generation of young Australians are now activated and passionate about their democracy.\u201d It has been great seeing people learn how the parliament works. And with that in mind, note that the social media bill is not yet law. Tomorrow morning it heads back to the House of Representatives because there were amendments passed in the Senate tonight. It then has to go to the governor general. But both these steps are almost certain to happen. Thanks again for all of your help and support. We got some amendments on digital ID so it was not for nothing and the fight continues. The Reserve Bank thinks the country\u2019s inflation rate is still some way off from easing to a \u201csustainable\u201d level within its target 2-3% range, governor Michele Bullock told a dinner in Sydney last night. With one more RBA board meeting in 2024 (on 9-10 December), Bullock underscored the reasons why the market gives just a 6% chance that the RBA will cut its cash rate at the gathering. By next May, though, investors are betting a 25 basis-point cut from 4.35% to 4.1% is all but a certainty. Bullock told the Committee for Economic Development of Australia event: As it currently stands, underlying inflation is still too high to be considering lowering the cash rate target in the near term. The strength of the jobs market has been one surprise and the reason why the RBA isn\u2019t in a hurry to reduce borrowing costs. \u201cAt present, we judge that conditions in the labour market remain tighter than what would be consistent with low and stable inflation,\u201d Bullock said, adding later that conditions in that market \u201cappear unusually tight, relative to those in other peer economies\u201d. During the question-and-answer session, the RBA governor said the September quarterly inflation figures were \u201cpositive\u201d but it would take more than \u201cone or two data points\u201d alone to determine it was the right time to start reducing interest rates. The December quarter inflation figures land on 29 January, with the first RBA board meeting of 2025 (on 17-18 February) looming as the possible last chance for an interest rate cut this side of the next federal election. But not all bills welcomed Continuing from our last post: not all of the bills have been warmly welcomed. The Digital Industry Group said \u201csignificant questions\u201d remained about the impacts of the under-16 social media ban on young people. Managing director Sunita Bose said it would work with the government \u201cas its implementation questions are explored\u201d. This law has passed despite advice from Australia\u2019s human rights commissioner, the children\u2019s commissioner, the privacy commissioner, 100 youth experts in an open letter to the prime minister and a coalition of mental health organisations. The consultation process must be robust in addressing their concerns\u2026 While there are technical and privacy questions, the most important questions are those relating to the safety of young people. The social media ban could push young people into darker, less safe corners of the knternet that do not have the safety guardrails that exist on mainstream platforms. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre labelled the migration bills which passed the Senate as \u201cdeplorable, political game-playing that causes devastating harm\u201d. CEO Kon Karapanagiotidis said: The Albanese government and the Coalition blatantly colluded in the ultimate betrayal of Australia\u2019s multicultural communities \u2026 our two major political parties sent a clear message that they are prepared to punish refugees, people seeking asylum and migrant communities by tearing families apart, jailing people unjustly, detaining them indefinitely and deporting them back to the very persecution and harm they fled\u2026 Our clear message to those political leaders today is: you are wrong and the fight is not over. Oxfam welcomes \u2018step forward for tax transparency\u2019 Organisations and groups have woken up to a slew of bills having passed the Senate, and welcomed different pieces of legislation they have advocated for. Oxfam Australia has welcomed the passing of legislation outlining country-by-country reporting rules of multi-national corporate tax and profit information as \u201ca significant step forward for tax transparency.\u201d Chief executive officer Lyn Morgain said: It\u2019s not just Australia that will benefit. Many multinational corporations that operate in Australia also operate in many other countries across the world. Australia\u2019s transparency will have ripple effects that benefit low-income countries who desperately need the tax revenue for basic services. Meanwhile, the Digital Industry Group (Digi) welcomed the privacy amendment bill as helping \u201clevel up children and young people\u2019s privacy on a wide range of services\u201d. Managing director Sunita Bose said: Digi fully supports the need to reform the Privacy Act to give Australians more choice, control and transparency over their personal information and to drive greater corporate accountability economy-wide. We\u2019re glad there\u2019s been progress towards the wider privacy reform efforts through the passage of this first privacy bill, and look forward to engaging in the next stages of the process. Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties \u2013 many thanks to Martin for kicking things off for us. After a huge night in the Senate, with 32 bills pushed through as part of the government\u2019s \u201cguillotine\u201d motion, the lower house has already kicked off for the day. Any bills with amendments in the Senate last night will now have to go back to the lower house, and passed. First on the agenda this morning is the commonwealth entities (payment surcharges) bill 2024. The whole Canberra team will be back with you today, bringing you the latest \u2013 Karen Middleton, Paul Karp, Josh Butler, Sarah Basford Canales and Mike Bowers. Hopefully a less chaotic day than yesterday, but it\u2019s only 7am, and after this week it seems anything can happen. Let\u2019s get into it. Under-16 social media ban, explained The federal government\u2019s social media ban for under-16s has been passed in the Senate. It is unclear how the new rules will be applied or enforced, and if the legislation will require all Australians to hand over more of their personal data. Read Josh Butler\u2019s explainer about where we are: Explainer: Six things we learned about the Australian government\u2019s climate policies The political classes may have been more focused on the passage or otherwise of legislation yesterday, but the huge dump of information about how the government is managing the climate crisis is arguably just as important. Our environment editor, Adam Morton, has been sifting through the data and comes up with six things you need to know about what is happening \u2013 from emissions on a downward trend (but not enough) to why the government needs to set even more ambitious targets. Political analysis from Paul Karp Despite the trade-offs, the marathon effort in the upper house has done a lot to cement Labor\u2019s first-term agenda, writes our chief political correspondent, Paul Karp. It came after a year of fighting between Labor and its progressive rivals, the Greens. But when push came to shove there was enough agreement on getting things done. He writes: This week Albanese and Labor have shown that they can deal for their legislative agenda. They are hoping that the 2025 election won\u2019t see them dealing for the continued life of their government. List of 32 bills that passed Senate overnight We should probably start with the real business of last night and the slew of bills passed by the Senate. You can read Sarah Basford Canales\u2019 account of how they got over the line here: And here\u2019s the list of 32 bills: Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing amendment bill 2024 Sydney airport demand management amendment bill 2024 Aged care (consequential and transitional provisions) bill 2024 Commonwealth entities (payment surcharges) bill 2024 Commonwealth entities (payment surcharges) tax (imposition) bill 2024 Commonwealth entities (payment surcharges) (consequential provisions and other matters) bill 2024 Treasury laws amendment (responsible buy now pay later and other measures) bill 2024 Capital works (build to rent misuse tax) bill 2024 Crimes amendment (strengthening the criminal justice response to sexual violence) ill 2024 Family law amendment bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (guarantee of origin) bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (guarantee of origin consequential amendments and transitional provisions) bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (guarantee of origin charges) bill 2024 Future Made in Australia bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (omnibus amendments No. 1) bill 2024 Universities accord (national student ombudsman) bill 2024 Treasury laws amendment (fairer for families and farmers and other measures) Bill 2024 Superannuation (objective) bill 2023 Treasury laws amendment (Reserve Bank reforms) bill 2023 Customs tariff amendment (incorporation of proposals and other measures) bill 2024 Communications legislation amendment (regional broadcasting continuity) bill 2024 Crown references amendment bill 2023 Customs amendment (ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade area second protocol implementation and other measures) bill 2024 Midwife professional indemnity (Commonwealth contribution) scheme amendment bill 2024 Treasury laws amendment (2024 tax and other measures No. 1) bill 2024 Privacy and other legislation amendment bill 2024 Surveillance legislation (confirmation of application) bill 2024 Treasury laws amendment (mergers and acquisitions reform) bill 2024 Migration amendment bill 2024 Migration amendment (removal and other measures) bill 2024 Migration amendment (prohibiting items in immigration detention facilities) bill 2024 Online safety amendment (social media minimum age) bill 2024 Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the top stories after an extremely busy night in Canberra before Emily Wind fires up for one last shift from the capital after a busy two weeks. It\u2019ll be the morning after the night before for senators after their marathon overnight sitting last night. More than 30 bills passed the upper house, including controversial migration laws that allow the government to pay third countries to take non-citizens and ban travellers from specified countries. The world\u2019s first attempt to ban young people from social media platforms went through as well to make a historic night. We have more details, analysis and reaction coming up. The government might be pleased with its night\u2019s work but it always comes at a cost. Our exclusive story this morning reveals that Tanya Plibersek struck a deal in writing with both the Greens and independent senator David Pocock on supporting her Nature Positive legislation before Anthony Albanese vetoed it hours later in a private meeting with Adam Bandt and Sarah Hanson-Young. Queensland\u2019s new LNP government has admitted that its signature youth crime legislation will \u201cdirectly discriminate\u201d against children by limiting their \u201cprotection from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\u201d. A veteran human rights lawyer in the state, Terry O\u2019Gorman, who famously took on Joh Bjelke-Petersen, is highly critical of the new laws and say they remind him of the infamous former premier.",

A reminder of this failure is illustrated in a new study which has found that reduced air pollution from net zero policies in the US could result in a health gain of between $65bn (\u00a351bn) and $128bn in 2035 alone. Dr Alex Barron, of Smith College, Massachusetts, who was part of the research team, said: \u201cA decarbonised society means cleaner air. At the same time, how many clean air benefits we realise and who benefits will depend on how policymakers shape this transition.\u201d In Europe, the mistaken notion that diesel and wood are relatively climate-friendly fuels has left people living with excessive traffic emissions and in air pollution hotspots from home wood burning. Six separate teams worked separately to model the economics of carbon dioxide and air pollution reduction for future US energy pathways.

Equally, it means accepting that legalising assisted dying may affect more than the individual choosing death \u2013 it could alter attitudes towards the lives of elderly, disabled and ill people too.

If that escalation seems far fetched, we need only look to where public opinion already is: a <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/50989-three-quarters-support-assisted-dying-law\">YouGov poll</a> last week found 55% say that assisted dying should be legal for patients with incurable conditions that are painful and/or debilitating but not terminal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/26/assisted-dying-labour-legacy-death-vote\">I have campaigned for assisted dying all my life.

No voter wants to hear that things will get better in a decade. And yet as MPs are given just over a fortnight to decide on one way to end terminally ill people\u2019s suffering, perhaps they should also pledge to spend years on others \u2013 namely, funding a comprehensive palliative care system, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/22/palliative-care-and-pain-management-are-key-to-assisted-dying-debate\">including specialist pain relief</a>, as well as greater access to social care and disability benefits.</p> <p>Whatever the result on Friday, each of us would surely be best served by finding common ground.

This week, one patron of Dignity in Dying, AC Grayling, argued for the right to help someone to die if they struggle with being \u201cwheelchair bound\u201d. If that escalation seems far fetched, we need only look to where public opinion already is: a YouGov poll last week found 55% say that assisted dying should be legal for patients with incurable conditions that are painful and/or debilitating but not terminal. Just as Westminster politics do not reward nuance, neither do they encourage long-term change. No voter wants to hear that things will get better in a decade. And yet as MPs are given just over a fortnight to decide on one way to end terminally ill people\u2019s suffering, perhaps they should also pledge to spend years on others \u2013 namely, funding a comprehensive palliative care system, including specialist pain relief, as well as greater access to social care and disability benefits. Whatever the result on Friday, each of us would surely be best served by finding common ground. The truth is, there are no goodies or baddies here. There are just human beings \u2013 some of them in pain, scared or angry \u2013 trying to do right by themselves, their loved ones and their community. Life is not easy. It is messy \u2013 a flawed and blind pursuit to do our best amid the darkness and the doubt. There is no reason we should expect matters of death to be any different.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Ali\u2019s report should be on the site in the next hour and we\u2019ll be back tonight for day three of this topsy-turvy match. Big first hour! 74th over: England 319-5 (Brook 132, Stokes 37) A sharp bouncer from Smith is pulled very awkwardly for a single by Stokes. If that ball is anything to go by, Brydon Carse will be an unwelcome handful in the third innings. That\u2019s the last incident of a thrilling day\u2019s cricket that produced 348 runs and seven wickets. England were in serious bother at 40 for 3 and 71 for 4, but Harry Brook and Ollie Pope rode their luck in a manic, match-changing partnership of 151 in just 31 overs. Brook was dropped four times during a sparkling unbeaten 132; Pope, who led the counter-attack, fell for 77 to an outrageous catch from Glenn Phillips. And Ben Stokes looked in preetty good order, making 37 not out in an unbroken partnership of 97 with Brook.tg 73rd over: England 317-5 (Brook 131, Stokes 36) A good ball from Phillips is inside-edged between his own legs and just wide of the stumps by Stokes. But for the most part England have played Phillips comfortably. It\u2019s a world away from their ordeal at the spinning fingers of Sajid Khan and Noman Ali in October. Time for one more over, two at a push. 72nd over: England 312-5 (Brook 128, Stokes 34) New Zealand will be happy to get off the field and start afresh in the morning. The second new ball is due after 80 overs so they\u2019ll still fancy their chances of keeping England below 400. 71st over: England 308-5 (Brook 126, Stokes 32) I think that\u2019s seven catches New Zealand have put down today: Duckett two, Brook four and now Stokes. It\u2019s almost unfathomable, especially as Glenn Phillips then took by far the toughest chance. 70th over: England 306-5 (Brook 125, Stokes 31) Brook drives Smith for three to take England past 300. Optimistic soul that I am, I didn\u2019t give them a prayer when they were 71 for 4 and the ball was talking like Brian Blessed. And now Stokes has been dropped! The ball after threading a gorgeous drive for four, one of the shots of the day, he had an off-balance swipe and was put down by Latham at short cover. It was a sharp, two-handed chance, but I reckon he\u2019d take that eight times out of 10. 69th over: England 298-5 (Brook 122, Stokes 26) Tom Latham is going to try to buy a wicket before the close. Glenn Phillips is coming on, and you have to think at least one of the England batters will go after him before the close. For now it\u2019s more of the same, a pair of singles and some studious forward defensives from Stokes. 68th over: England 296-5 (Brook 121, Stokes 25) 67th over: England 294-5 (Brook 120, Stokes 24) Brook averages 92 in away Tests, second only to Don Bradman of those who have batted at least five times overseas. That includes six of his seven Test centuries so far. Phillips saves three runs with a flying stop at backward point. England have scored so many runs behind square on the off side today; Stokes ads two more with a deft steer. England trail by 54. 66th over: England 287-5 (Brook 116, Stokes 21) Stokes is batting like Ben Foakes at No7 \u2013 but that\u2019s fine as he\u2019s with a free-flowing top-order batter. If he\u2019s left with Nos 10 and 11, Stokes\u2019 approach will change faster than you can say \u201csix more\u201d. Back where our feet are, Nathan Smith comes back for one more spell before ethe close. He jags one back to hit Brook in the ribs, another reminder that, even with the old ball, there is still a bit in this pitch. Stokes then top-edges a hook for four to move to 21 from 45 deliveries. New Zealand desperately need to take at least one wicket beofre the close; they have half an hour to do so. 65th over: England 279-5 (Brook 113, Stokes 16) I wonder which top-order batter has been dropped the most in a single innings. I think England dropped Adam Gilchrist four times, the same as Brook today, when he made 90 at Lord\u2019s in 2001. A few of those were sitters as well. 64th over: England 279-5 (Brook 113, Stokes 16) O\u2019Rourke cuts Brook in half with a beauty that cuts back off the seam. He looks horrible to face, especially when he gets the ball to follow the right-handers, and figures of 16-1-82-1 don\u2019t do justice to his performance today. The last four of those runs came from a Stokes slash that flew between slip and gully. Life moves pretty fast: 42 overs ago, England were 71 for 4 and in all sorts. 63rd over: England 274-5 (Brook 112, Stokes 12) Matt Henry returns with New Zealand in urgent need of a wicket or three. Brook gets more than halfway down the track before being sent back by Stokes and has to scramble to make his ground. The throw missed anyway and it\u2019s a maiden from Henry. Stokes, taking his own sweet time, has made 12 from 40 balls. Brook has 112 from 133. 62nd over: England 274-5 (Brook 112, Stokes 12) Has Brook been dropped again? He flicked at a legside delivery from O\u2019Rourke which was then dropped by Blundell and ran away for four. The umpire gave four leg-byes but Steve Harmison in the commentary box thinks Brook got a touch on it. Replays show he\u2019s right! Brook has been dropped for the fourth time. It looked a pretty straightforward chance for Blundell, although there\u2019s a chance it might have wobbled at the last. Even so, he should have caught it. A hugely frustrating over for New Zealand ends with Brook inside-edging just past the stumps and away for ofur. 61st over: England 262-5 (Brook 104, Stokes 12) That\u2019ll do! Harry Brook back cuts Southee for four to reach an exhilarating century: 123 balls, eight fours, two sixes. He\u2019s been dropped three times \u2013 three times! \u2013 but has also played some glorious strokes. Brook\u2019s celebration is modest: he raises both arms before pointing his bat skywards to salute his late grandmother Pauline. 60th over: England 255-5 (Brook 97, Stokes 12) I forgot to say that this is the first time Stokes has been down to bat No7 in a Test since the Marlon Samuels salute game in the Caribbean in 2015. He\u2019s come in at No7 on a number of occasions since but only ever because of a nightwatchman or a reshuffle. Harry Brook, a man who will surely never bat No7 in his Test career, takes a couple of singles to move closer to his seventh Test hundred. 59th over: England 251-5 (Brook 95, Stokes 10) Harry Brook, on 91, deliberately ramps Southee over the keeper\u2019s head for four. That\u2019s outrageous. He lost his balance and ended up lying his back, Rishabh Pant-style. The only difference is that Pant would have hit it for six. 58th over: England 243-5 (Brook 88, Stokes 9) Stokes cuts the new bowler O\u2019Rourke to the right of Phillips at gully. Phillips dives to save the boundary and flings the ball at the stumps in the same movement, forcing Stokes to scramble to make his ground. He\u2019s one of the all-time great fielders. The next ball is a nasty 89mph lifter that beats Stokes, who smiles at the inherent absurdity of nostalgia impossibility of playing a ball like that when you\u2019ve just come to the crease. This could be a fun contest because neither player will back down. Stokes swivel-pulls smoothly for four, his first boundary of the innings, then moves inside another sharp lifter. Time for drinks. England trail by 105 runs. 57th over: England 237-5 (Brook 87, Stokes 4) Stokes has started in a manner that suggests he means business. He\u2019s barely offering a stroke, and when he does it\u2019s usually a watertight forward defensive. Most of his best innings have started this way, most notably Headingley 2019 and Lord\u2019s 2023. We don\u2019t know whether Stokes is in sufficiently good nick to make runs but he looks in a good place mentally, with none of the cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof stuff we saw in Pakistan. He hasn\u2019t even thrown his bat at square leg for heaven\u2019s sake. 56th over: England 233-5 (Brook 86, Stokes 1) Short and wide from Smith, which allows Brook to slash a deliberate boundary over the slips. A reminder that he was dropped on 18, 41 and 70, a festival of buttered fingers that could cost New Zealand the game. 55th over: England 226-5 (Brook 79, Stokes 1) Stokes nails a nice drive off Southee that is stopped in the covers. Then he has a dangerous flirt outside off stump and is beaten. A maiden. 54th over: England 226-5 (Brook 79, Stokes 1) Stokes flicks Smith for a single to get off the mark from his eighth ball. This is an important series for him \u2013 he\u2019s down at No7, which makes sense but also feels unbecoming, and he needs runs after a pretty modest 2024. Stokes\u2019 away form is a particular concern given the focus on you know what. Since batting imperiously in South Africa just before Covid, Stokes averages 25 from 25 Tests away from home. 53rd over: England 222-5 (Brook 76, Stokes 0) New Zealand and England never let us down, do they? Every series they play is topsy-turvy, even the ones that end 3-0. We\u2019ve already had multiple momentum shifts in this game and Pope\u2019s wicket could be the catalyst for another. Glenn Phillips ends the partnership with a stunning catch! Pope slashed a back cut off the new bowler Southee, a shot he has played all day, but this time Phillips flew to his right and stretched to take a one-handed blinder. We\u2019ve seen Phillips do it several times but it still takes the breath away. With the possible exception of myself, I\u2019m not sure any other fielder in the world would have caught that. Pope goes for a fabulous counter-attacking 77 from 98 balls. 52nd over: England 222-4 (Brook 76, Pope 77) Brook takes a single off Smith to bring up a riotous 150 partnership in barely 30 overs. As well as substantially reducing the deficit, it has given England\u2019s lower middle order a great chance to punish a tiring New Zealand attack tonight. 51st over: England 219-4 (Brook 75, Pope 75) This is getting silly. New Zealand are normally so reliable in the field but today they\u2019ve put down five chances. Brook hoicked Phillips high towards deep midwicket, where Conway shelled an awkward runnings chance. 50th over: England 213-4 (Brook 70, Pope 74) The speed at which England score means games can change at dizzying speed, especially when they are relatively low-scoring. It\u2019s less then 30 overs since the dismissal of Ben Duckett put New Zealand in complete control; now they are arguably second favourites. They could do with a timeout, even a drinks break, to compose themselves and discuss bowling plans. That\u2019s not an option just yet so Nathan Smith returns to the attack. Brook charges a short ball, is hit in the gut and gets four leg-byes for King and country when the ball deflects past the diving Blundell. It was a no-ball as well. 49th over: England 206-4 (Brook 69, Pope 74) Latham stations himself at short mid-on and is almost in business when Pope jabs at Phillips with those familiar hard hands. The ball reaches Latham on the bounce. Pope continues to attack, thumping Phillips inside out through the covers for three. Brook works a single to bring up 2000 Test runs at the startling average of 58.82. This is his 36th innings, which puts him joint-eighth on the all-time list with Viv Richards and Arthur Morris among others. 48th over: England 200-4 (Brook 67, Pope 70) Pope drives O\u2019Rourke sweetly through mid-off for three; Brook pulls him brusquely through midwicket with the same result. New Zealand are under serious pressure for the first time in the field. England are only 148 runs behind, the ball is getting old and, crucially, are no longer riding their luck with the bat. 47th over: England 191-4 (Brook 63, Pope 66) Pope works Phillips for two to reach 3000 runs in Tests. His overall average is modest (34.49) but it\u2019s worth reiterating that he averages 38.62 since Ben Stokes took over as captain \u2013 and almost all of those runs have been made batting out of position. Goodness knows who bats No3 for England next summer. Shoaib Bashir? 46th over: England 186-4 (Brook 62, Pope 62) O\u2019Rourke reminds Pope what time it is with a couple of beautiful bouncers. Both zip past Pope\u2019s attempted uppercut, with the second one also putting him on his backside. The wicketkeeper Blundell did really well to save four byes. 45th over: England 186-4 (Brook 62, Pope 62) Phillips overpitches to Brook and is scrunched through extra cover for four. Beautifully timed. Batting looks more comfortable* than at any stage in the England innings, which presumably means Brook is about to slog one up in the air. * Less uncomfortable is probably a better way of phrasing it. 44th over: England 180-4 (Brook 56, Pope 61) O\u2019Rourke has a strangled LBW shout against Pope, who was saved by a big inside-edge. 43rd over: England 179-4 (Brook 56, Pope 61) Glenn Phillips continues after tea. He\u2019s a canny, brisk offspinner who took some absolutely crucial wickets in India and has a Test bowling average of 27. That average almost drops further when Brook plays and misses outside off. 42nd over: England 177-4 (Brook 55, Pope 61) O\u2019Rourke starts after tea to Pope, who rolls his wrists to collect a couple through midwicket. Brook then flashes lustily outside off stump and is beaten. Pope has had such an up and down year.These are his scores in Tests in 2024: 1, 196, 23, 23, 39, 3, 0, 0, 11, 19, 57, 121, 51, 10, 6, 6, 1, 17, 154, 7, 0, 29, 22, 3, 1, 61*. This will be an extended evening session, with 38 overs still to bowl. If England are still batting at the close they\u2019ll be close to parity, possibly even in the lead. Musical interlude 41st over: England 174-4 (Brook 54, Pope 59) Glenn Phillips, an occasional offspinner who shouldn\u2019t really be called an occasional offspinner because have you seen his recent record, is given the final over before tea. It\u2019s an uneventful affair, with Pope and Brook collecting three singles to complete a breathless session. England scored 129 in 26.3 overs for the loss of Ben Duckett. Brook and Pope needed plenty of luck \u2013 Brook was dropped twice \u2013 but they deserved plenty of it for having the courage and skill to counter-attack in bowler-friendly conditions. Most England teams of my lifetime would be 120 for 6 at tea, not 174 for 4. Pope was particularly good and looks more natural at No5 or 6. Over the course of this series he could become one of the few batters in Test history to earn a demotion through weight of runs. 40th over: England 171-4 (Brook 53, Pope 57) Pope turns O\u2019Rourke for a single to bring up a vital, potentially game-changing half-century from 59 balls. It\u2019s been streaky at times, sure, but it has also showcased some of Pope\u2019s best qualities. It\u2019s been a busy, selfless and relentlessly positive innings \u2013 and it continues with a deliberate uppercut for four later in the over. There were two men out behind square but he bisected them perfectly. A thump through extra cover for three brings up the hundred partnership from 112 balls. For an England fan, it\u2019s been the cricket-watching equivalent of a ride on the Big Dipper. 39th over: England 162-4 (Brook 52, Pope 49) Pope plays across the line at Henry and is hit on the flap of the pad. New Zealand plead unsuccessfully for LBW, then barely discuss a review when Rod Tucker turns them down. Too high? Yes, but not by much \u2013 it would have been umpire\u2019s call. Another turbulent over ends with Brook flashing an edge just short of gully. 38th over: England 158-4 (Brook 51, Pope 48) Will O\u2019Rourke replaces Smith and will have time for a couple of overs before tea. He has a bob each way, with two slips and two men out for the hook. Everything knows the short ball is coming \u2013 and when it does Brook whirls a pull to long leg for six to bring up his half-century. It\u2019s been a vital innings: 65 balls, five fours, two sixes. Oh and two dropped catches, which may come back to bite New Zealand somewhere intimate and painful. 37th over: England 151-4 (Brook 45, Pope 47) Pope overtakes Brook, who had an 18-runs start, by edging/steering Henry through the slips at catchable height for four. 36th over: England 146-4 (Brook 45, Pope 42) Pope jumps all over a short ball from Smith, pulling for four with a brusque authority. He gets another boundary later in the over, flicking wristily over the head of midwicket. There were a few shouts of 'catch!\u2019 but it cleared the fielder fairly comfortably. A quick single takes him to 42 from 47 balls; it\u2019s a typical Ollie Pope joyride, he\u2019s just doing it from a different position. England have belted 50 runs from the last nine overs. Brook was dropped in that time, and this certainly hasn\u2019t been a counter-attack for the ages, but they\u2019ve played with game-changing intent. It takes courage to do that in this situation, especially if you\u2019re also under pressure for your place like Pope. 35th over: England 135-4 (Brook 43, Pope 33) Henry replaces Southee, whose figures of 11-2-35-0 are a minor scandal. The \u20180\u2019 bit anyway. England continue to live liek they\u2019ll die tomorrow, with Pope picking up five runs of varying streakiness. Whatever the technical merit, it\u2019s great entertainment. New Zealand won\u2019t be worried yet, but they might be if these two are still in after tea. We\u2019ve got about 25 minutes of the afternoon session to play. 34th over: England 128-4 (Brook 43, Pope 26) Brook has been dropped again! He launched into a drive at Smith and snicked the ball towards Latham at first slip. Latham was beaten for pace and spilled a very sharp two-handed chance above his head. The ball looped up, a discombobulated Latham ran in the wrong direction and Southee at second slip couldn\u2019t reach the rebound. To complete the comedy, Latham\u2019s sunglasses fell off as he looked desperately for the ball. There\u2019s only one soundtrack for that replay. 33rd over: England 126-4 (Brook 41, Pope 26) 32nd over: England 122-4 (Brook 38, Pope 25) The impressive debutant Nathan Smith returns to the attack. Brook drives uppishly but well short of mid-off, then gets in a bit of a tangle as he keeps out a nipbacker. Brook has the last word, at least for this over, by steering classily through the slips for four. That brings up a white-knuckle fifty partnership from 64 balls. 31st over: England 116-4 (Brook 33, Pope 24) Pope, not for the first time in this innings, slashes a back cut in the air for four. Not even Glenn Phillips could catch that; he was beaten for pace at backward point and the ball flew to the boundary. There\u2019s never a dull moment when Pope is at the crease. He has vroomed and veered to 24 from 33 balls. 30th over: England 111-4 (Brook 32, Pope 20) A touch of class from Brook, who times Henry to the left of mid-on. It only brings a couple of runs but it was a lovely shot. 29th over: England 108-4 (Brook 30, Pope 19) Pope, who has started pretty well in a position that suits him far better than No3, drives Southee impatiently through extra cover two more. The positive spin for England is that New Zealand\u2019s seamers should start to tire soon, the ball is getting old and England have Test centurions at Nos 8 and 9. The negative spin is writ large on the scoreboard. Thanks Taha, morning everyone. This is fun, as sport tends to be when it\u2019s attack v attack. New Zealand are on top but England are trying to hit their way back into contention. 28th over: England 106-4 (Brook 30, Pope 17) Matt Henry returns and Harry Brook, out of nowhere, uses his wrists to whip the ball over fine leg all the way for six. A mad, brilliant shot. Pope drives nicely through mid-off for three and this pair are starting to settle, three figures up for England. And that\u2019ll be me. Time for Rob Smyth to have some fun. 27th over: England 96-4 (Brook 23, Pope 14) Brook gets the forward defence \u2013 head still, eyes down \u2013 out against Southee before pulling away for one. 26th over: England 95-4 (Brook 22, Pope 14) Pope cuts O\u2019Rourke over gully for four. And then comes another O\u2019Rourke lifter that Pope can\u2019t do anything about; it hits the shoulder of the bat and flies over the cordon, producing another boundary. The bounce from the six-foot-something man, at close to 90mph, is causing serious grief. 25th over: England 87-4 (Brook 22, Pope 6) Southee returns to the attack and Pope cuts away a wide one for four, enjoying a rare gift. 24th over: England 82-4 (Brook 22, Pope 1) Pope looks a touch awkward trying to fend off O\u2019Rourke, but gets off the mark with a dig into the leg side. Brook nearly brings Southee, at leg gully, into play with an aerial flick that runs away for four. 23rd over: England 77-4 (Brook 18, Pope 0) Beautifully strummed by Harry Brook as he drives Nathan Smith through the covers for four. Brook looks so assured \u2026 and then he\u2019s dropped at gully! It\u2019s his first loose stroke, a flash outside off that probably surprises Glenn Phillips, who can\u2019t hold on to give Smith a third wicket. 22nd over: England 71-4 (Brook 12, Pope 0) Ollie Pope arrives, in his new position at No 6 as a keeper-bat. O\u2019Rourke beats him with pace and bounce to thud the thigh pad. He\u2019s got a touch of Morne Morkel to him, this guy. He\u2019s going to take loads of Test wickets. A bouncer ends a fine over. It\u2019s been coming. O\u2019Rourke thuds the ball short and Duckett\u2019s pull finds the safe hands of Devon Conway at deep backward square. 21st over: England 71-3 (Brook 12, Duckett 46) Duckett has struggled for fluency since the break and nearly chips a return catch to Smith before edging a pull to the fine-leg boundary for four. He\u2019s living on the edge. Smith gets the ball to leap up at Brook and challenge the gloves. It remains a tough ask for the batters out there. 20th over: England 64-3 (Brook 12, Duckett 39) Duckett gets some luck, a wayward attempt at finding the leg side off O\u2019Rourke prompting an edge that flies over the cordon and to the boundary. The left-hander gets even looser, nearly dragging on to his stumps with a cross-bat hack. 19th over: England 59-3 (Brook 12, Duckett 34) Smith is nagging away from around the wicket against Duckett, threatening the stumps but also the outside edge with his wobbling seam. The quick has settled into a decent rhythm here. 18th over: England 58-3 (Brook 12, Duckett 33) Brook handles O\u2019Rourke\u2019s bounce again, punching off the back foot behind point for four. The bowler launches a strong retort later in the over, nearly inviting an outside edge in the channel outside off. For all his attacking strokes, Brook\u2019s forward defence is immaculate, played right under the eyes \u2013 he shows it off moments later. 17th over: England 54-4 (Brook 8, Duckett 33) Smith skips in, his no-ball problem solved with a bit of lunch, and concedes a single. 16th over: England 53-3 (Brook 7, Duckett 33) On comes the towering Will O\u2019Rourke, offering quite the contrast to Ben Duckett. Brook guides the ball nicely to the third-man rope for four, riding the bounce perfectly. With the final ball of the over, O\u2019Rourke gets the ball to leap off a length and surprise Brook, the edge taken but the ball not looping into a dangerous area. O\u2019Rourke, playing his eighth Test, is averaging less than 20. 15th over: England 45-3 (Brook 0, Duckett 32) Smith gets his first ball to climb on to the top of Brook\u2019s bat, the edge to the cordon keeping low. Duckett, at the other end, was excellent this morning, playing with restraint and still somehow getting to 32 off 40. And we\u2019re back: Nathan Smith has three legitimate balls left in his over. Harry Brook is in, and England could do with a special one from him: they trail by 303. Brendan Large offers this \u2013 can anyone answer it? \u201cThis might be world\u2019s stupidest question, but \u2026 with all the paint strewn around the field, why can\u2019t they mark the stumps on the crease so the batters don\u2019t have to use time every over/ball to ask the umpire where middle is?\u201d That\u2019ll be lunch and it\u2019s New Zealand\u2019s session after that over \u2013 which isn\u2019t done yet \u2013 from Nathan Smith. England lost Crawley quickly before Jacob Bethell helped out Ben Duckett with the rebuild in very tricky conditions. But then came Smith, who looks a real threat when he\u2019s got control of his front foot. Smith is still having a bit of trouble with his front foot, bowling consecutive no balls. But then he gets Joe Root for a duck! It\u2019s angled into the right-hander, who drags the ball on to his stumps with a prod off the back foot. What a start for Nathan Smith! Debutant gets debutant! Smith ends Bethell\u2019s innings with a corker, the wobble-seam ball from around the wicket finding the outside edge before Blundell holds on behind the stumps. There\u2019s a no-ball check \u2026 but Smith can celebrate. 14th over: England 43-1 (Bethell 10, Duckett 32) Henry continues and, after watching Bethell leave another one outside off, decides to go around the wicket. An inside-edge takes Bethell to double figures. 13th over: England 41-1 (Bethell 9, Duckett 31) Jacob Bethell isn\u2019t the only debutant in this match; Nathan Smith is going through the same nerves for New Zealand. He bowls a no-ball but looks sharp, bowling around the wicket to Bethell \u2026 who picks up his first four with a leg-side shovel, a good-looking stroke. A cut shot moves Bethell to nine \u2013 all of a sudden, he\u2019s racing. 12th over: England 31-1 (Bethell 1, Duckett 30) Bethell has to contend with another lbw shout, but he\u2019s safe from any real danger. The leaves continue from the newbie. 11th over: England 30-1 (Bethell 1, Duckett 29) Bethell\u2019s having to do his A-levels without any revision here, Southee and Henry seizing upon these conditions to make the ball dance. The 21-year-old is happy to leave outside off for now. He can\u2019t beat the field with his leg-side clip to end the over. 10th over: England 29-1 (Bethell 1, Duckett 28) Bethell finally has a Test run! With his 13th delivery he drops Henry into the leg side and scampers through for a single. Henry then finds Duckett\u2019s outside edge \u2026 and he\u2019s dropped by Tom Latham at second slip. The New Zealand captain had to get low but you\u2019d expect that to be snaffled up. Duckett responds with an off-side thrash for four. 9th over: England 23-1 (Bethell 0, Duckett 23) Southee opts for a change in angle, going around the wicket to Duckett \u2026 and the batter nearly drags the ball on to his stumps, chasing after an inswinger. Then comes the best shot of the innings, Duckett offering a straight bat to drive Southee through mid-off for four. 8th over: England 15-1 (Bethell 0, Duckett 15) Bethell, still on zilch, takes back the strike after one ball. New Zealand are doing everything to halt that first run, with Henry unleashing an unplayable delivery that nips away from the left-hander. The over ends with an on-drive \u2026 but Henry gets down to get a hand to it. No freebies in this game. 7th over: England 14-0 (Bethell 0, Duckett 14) Southee continues to extract plenty of swing before Duckett punches back, driving a wider delivery through the covers for four. And breathe. A swing-and-miss follows from Duckett. The senior batter keeps the strike for the next over after a quick single. 6th over: England 9-1 (Bethell 0, Duckett 9) Henry\u2019s wobbling seam sees the ball skip past Bethell\u2019s forward prod. The debutant has a fairly classical setup at the crease and swishes at the final ball of the over, with New Zealand appealing for a catch behind. They opt against the review \u2026 and the replays show they were right. Another maiden. 5th over: England 9-1 (Bethell 0, Duckett 9) Southee\u2019s inswinger to Duckett is trying its best to sneak through and rattle the stumps, but the opener is happy to go hard at the ball. Duckett tries repeatedly to beat the man at short mid-off but can\u2019t. Coldplay\u2019s Don\u2019t Panic rings around the ground. 4th over: England 9-0 (Bethell 0, Duckett 9) Bethell has to contend with a half-hearted lbw shout from his first ball faced. Welcome to Test cricket. Crawley\u2019s wait to free his arms continues \u2026 before Henry slaps his front pad with a nipbacker! The umpire takes his time before raising the finger. Crawley opts against the review and his troubles against New Zealand go on. Time for the new kid. 3rd over: England 9-0 (Crawley 0, Duckett 9) Duckett, already looking more comfortable than Crawley, tucks Southee into the leg side for a couple \u2026 before nearly poking an outside edge into the hands of Tom Blundell. Southee then squares up Duckett, but the edge doesn\u2019t produce any carry. It\u2019s tricky out there for the batters. 2nd over: England 5-0 (Crawley 0, Duckett 5) Matt Henry takes off from the other end, going close to yorker-length with his first ball, dug out by Ben Duckett. The southpaw finds four with the next delivery, driving an overpitched ball through mid-off. Henry eventually finds his length and a bit of nip, the ball zipping past Duckett\u2019s outside edge. 1st over: England 0-0 (Crawley 0, Duckett 0) Tim Southee opens up, sending down some banana outswing, his second a beaut that whispers sweet nothings into Crawley\u2019s outside edge. The veteran than shows off his wobble seam before another gorgeous outswinger nips past Crawley\u2019s tentative prod. A very decent first over from the New Zealand legend. Zak Crawley averages an ugly 11.13 after 15 Test innings against New Zealand. Yikes. But he\u2019ll still give it a whack. I\u2019m going to rely on some local expertise, with Paul Cockburn writing in just before the fall of the last wicket: Watching from Wellington (free to air in NZ). These are useful runs early doors on Day Two. Hagley is a lovely strip, but it doesn\u2019t tend to score big on the first knock. 280/290 is a decent first innings score. It\u2019s going to be fascinating when this next wicket falls... Carse sneaks the ball between Phillips\u2019 bat and pad but somehow misses the stumps, the ball beating Ollie Pope too to run away for four byes. The fun is over moments later, however, with a cracking Carse yorker rattling O\u2019Rourke\u2019s stumps. The quick finishes with a four-for, Phillips walks off with an unbeaten 58. 90th over: New Zealand 341-9 (Phillips 55, O\u2019Rourke 0) Phillips slaps Woakes off the back foot through the covers for four. England\u2019s attack leader hasn\u2019t looked himself this morning, though he nearly finds Phillips\u2019 outside edge with an outswinger. A hooping inswinger ends the over but can\u2019t dislodge the towering O\u2019Rourke. 89th over: New Zealand 335-9 (Phillips 50, O\u2019Rourke 0) Phillips makes room to thrash Carse through the off side, finds third man, and sprints back for two. It takes a cracking dive from Phillips to make his ground. A pull shot for one brings the No 7 a half-century, his fifth in Test cricket. O\u2019Rourke has to deal with the final two balls of the over, and does so. 88th over: New Zealand 332-9 (Phillips 47, O\u2019Rourke 0) Shot! Glenn Phillips unfurls the scoop to send Woakes over the keeper\u2019s head for four. Mark Beadle writes in: \u201cAre they trying to buy Woakes some confidence here, wouldn\u2019t England be better off with Atkinson in tandem with Carse? Or even Bashir going for a Michelle?\u201d I see your point but it makes sense to entrust Woakes with the new ball when that\u2019s his main skillset. He\u2019s not been at his best though. 87th over: New Zealand 327-9 (Phillips 43, O\u2019Rourke 0) Ooof. Phillips top-edges the ball from Carse on to his helmet, the lid partly coming off. Good to see he\u2019s OK, and he signals for a fresh helmet. Play resumes and Phillips is willing to have a swing at everything \u2026 he finds a bit of luck. He pokes the bat, edges to Root at slip, who can\u2019t hold on diving with one hand to his right. A tough chance. Damian Clarke has read my preamble and contributed this: Thoughts: Please let me sleep. Queries: Why does the abbreviation of refrigerator add an extra letter? Midnight snack suggestion: Toasted crumpets with criminal amounts of butter and strawberry jam. Fave Denzel film: Impossible question. Can I have all of them? If not, then the ones where he hurts a lot of people. I like it when he hurts people. General life wisdom: Never eat yellow snow. Whatever makes you happy: See question 1. 86th over: New Zealand 326-9 (Phillips 42, O\u2019Rourke 0) Phillips tries to hit Woakes back to Birmingham but misreads the slower ball, his swing of the bat only finding the Christchurch air. Ollie Popes collects well down the leg-side as Woakes temporarily loses control of his inswinger. Another leg-side take is required, but Pope can\u2019t hold on and they run through a leg bye. 85th over: New Zealand 325-9 (Phillips 42, O\u2019Rourke 0) Carse shows Will O\u2019Rourke his bouncer but also sends in some sixth-seventh-stump outswingers that are safely left alone. Well, that wasn\u2019t too hard. Brydon Carse thunders in, drops it short, and Southee toe-ends a pull shot into the deep where Gus Atkinson safely holds on. 84th over: New Zealand 325-8 (Phillips 42, Southee 15) And we\u2019re off, Phillips immediately up and running with a leg-side clip for one. Tim Southee is in a fun mood, skipping down the pitch to slap Woakes down the ground for four; never mind the new-ball swing. Southee dabs a gentle outswinger into the covers for one to end the over. Before we get going, I really do like Glenn Phillips at No 7 for New Zealand, in as a specialist gamechanger. Whacks it with the bat, is averaging less than 30 with his offies and is an insane fielder. He\u2019s out in the middle with Tim Southee, with Chris Woakes taking the ball. More from Ali\u2019s day one coverage. Kane\u2019s back. Tom V d Gucht writes in: \u201cThat\u2019s a great list of number 3 debutante and a real reminder of how fallible our memories are. I could have sworn that Trott batted at 3 in the 2009 Ashes when he replaced Bopara. I wonder who did in that match?\u201d It was Ian Bell! Trott came in at five, after Paul Collingwood. I\u2019d also like to share this, passed on by Tom Davies, another OBO colleague. A group are running a marathon in memory of their friend Josh Baker, the Worcestershire spinner who passed away this May. You can find out more here. We\u2019ll most likely see Jacob Bethell stroll out at No 3 later today. My colleague Rob Smyth passed on this very handy list of England men\u2019s Test debutants at No 3. There have been four this century, though Rehan Ahmed was in as a nightwatchman, while Jason Roy was meant to open against Ireland (Jack Leach did it instead, hitting 92). Owais Shah and Tom Westley were the other two, the former hitting 88 against India, the latter 59 against South Africa. Those were to remain their highest Test scores. Roy\u2019s best, a 78-ball 72, also came on debut. Ali Martin is our man on the ground, and here\u2019s his day one report. Great intro. Hello, fellow night owls (in the UK), and welcome to our coverage of the second day\u2019s play at the Hagley Oval. Christchurch looked a picture yesterday, and the game was pretty decent, too. New Zealand were 199 for three on a pitch that was green but hardly treacherous before England snapped back, Shoaib Bashir sneaking in an opening day four-for and Brydon Carse looking more and more like a very serious Test bowler. It ended 319 for eight, the visitors probably a touch happier. The morning should be fun, with Glenn Phillips (41*) and Tim Southee (more Test sixes than Virender Sehwag) out in the middle, up against the second new ball. Once that wraps up \u2013 something\u2019s gone horribly wrong with England if not \u2013 we could end up getting a glimpse of Jacob Bethell, the debutant in at No 3. Feel free to share your thoughts, queries, midnight snack suggestions, favourite Denzel film, general life wisdom, whatever makes you happy.",

Zoopla said sales were on course to hit 1.1 million during 2024 \u2013 10% higher than in 2023. The rise is mainly due to pent-up demand during the summer before the budget in October. An ageing population and an increase in the cost of running a home, forcing many families to downsize, and the trend for hybrid working would continue to affect moving decisions, said Zoopla. Rising incomes have also helped buyers cope with a significant increase in mortgage rates over the past two years, paving the way for continued modest growth in house prices. Stronger buyer demand would normally lead to a much larger increase in prices, but the supply of homes has surged in recent years, helped by former rental properties and second homes coming on to the market. Richard Donnell, Zoopla\u2019s executive director, said each estate agent had on average 34 unsold properties in their books compared with 28 before the pandemic in 2019. House prices in the Midlands, northern England, Scotland and Wales are likely to outperform the UK average next year, while home prices in southern England, where property affordability pressures are more acute, will lag behind, according to Zoopla\u2019s forecast. Donnell said: \u201cHigher income growth and lower mortgage rates have helped reset housing affordability faster than many expected over 2024. \u201cThis has supported an increase in the number of sales and house prices over the year which we expect to continue over 2025. \u201cFirst-time buyers will remain an important buyer group, but existing homeowners looking to move will need more support to help realise their ambitions, with more and more having to look further afield to find better value for money.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Germany is developing an app to help people locate the nearest bunker in the event of attack. Sweden is distributing a 32-page pamphlet titled If Crisis or War Comes. Half a million Finns have already downloaded an emergency preparedness guide. If the prospect of a broader conflict in Europe seems remote for many, some countries at least are taking it seriously \u2013 and, in the term used by Germany\u2019s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, taking steps to get populations kriegst\u00fcchtig: war-capable. Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has dramatically raised security tensions across the Baltic region, prompting Finland and Sweden to abandon decades of nonalignment and join Nato. Military capability, however, is not all: citizens have to be braced too. \u201cWe live in uncertain times. Armed conflicts are currently being waged in our corner of the world. Terrorism, cyber-attacks, and disinformation campaigns are being used to undermine and influence us,\u201d the Swedish pamphlet\u2019s prologue says. Also available in English, it adds that collective resilience is essential and if Sweden is attacked, \u201ceveryone must do their part to defend Sweden\u2019s independence \u2013 and our democracy \u2026 you are part of Sweden\u2019s overall emergency preparedness\u201d. Swedes have long been familiar with such public information pamphlets: the first was issued in the second world war. The latest advises on, among other topics, warning systems, air raid shelters, digital security and how to use the toilet if there is no water. It also recommends keeping a good supply of water at home (and checking annually to see if it is still safe); having plenty of blankets, warm clothes and alternative heating; getting a battery-powered radio; and storing plenty of energy-rich, quick-to-prepare food. Reaction among Swedish residents has been mixed. Johnny Chamoun, 36, a hairdresser in Solna, near Stockholm, said it was \u201cgood to be prepared\u201d. But, he said, while the brochure was a good idea, it had not been much of a talking point. \u201cIn the salon I\u2019ve not heard many people talk about it. Just one said they had got it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not stressing or anything.\u201d But Muna Ayan, a healthcare worker from Stockholm, was concerned by how unconcerned many Swedes were. Having experienced conflict firsthand in Somalia, Ayan said she was frightened. \u201cI am scared because I know what war means \u2013 I have survived war,\u201d she said, adding that she had stocked up on water, battery lights, candles and Vaseline. She was also trying to work out how to tell her five children without scaring them. For people from Somalia, Syria or Iraq, talk of conflict in Sweden was traumatic, she said. \u201cWe who have been in war, we are not well. We are very worried, because if there is war we know what will happen. In war we have lost relatives, some children will disappear.\u201d And Fatuma Mohamed, a health communicator in Stockholm, said many families in poorer areas did not have food for everyday life, let alone for stockpiling, while others were trying to find out where their local shelters were. She said she would like to see more information provided to people in person, rather than just in a brochure. Norway\u2019s directorate for civil protection, DSB, has distributed a similar booklet to the country\u2019s 2.6 million households. \u201cWe live in an increasingly turbulent world,\u201d it says, affected by climate change, digital threats and \u201cin the worst case, acts of war\u201d. The Norwegian pamphlet advises people, for example, to hold at least a week\u2019s worth of non-perishable food including \u201ccrispbreads, canned pulses and beans, canned sandwich spreads, energy bars, dried fruit, chocolate, honey, biscuits and nuts\u201d. Norway also advises residents to stock up on essential medicines \u2013 including iodine tablets, in case of a nuclear incident \u2013 and, like Sweden, recommends that people have several bank cards and keep a ready supply of cash at home. In Finland, an exhaustive online guide called Preparing for incidents and crises offers residents information and advice on anything from water outages to wildfires, the collapse of the internet or \u201clonger-term crises \u2026 such as military conflict\u201d. More practically, on a separate website, 72tuntia.fi, Finland \u2013 which shares an 830-mile (1,340km) border with Russia \u2013 asks its citizens bluntly: \u201cWould you survive 72 hours?\u201d in a range of crisis situations, inviting them to put both their skills and their supplies through a series of tests. The site has tips on strengthening psychological resilience \u201cto increase your ability to cope in difficult circumstances\u201d, improving personal cybersecurity and sheltering indoors (\u201cSeal doors and windows. Turn on the radio. Wait calmly for instructions.\u201d) Suvi Aksela of the women\u2019s national emergency preparedness association (Nasta), who is on the 72hours expert committee, said it had considered raising Finland\u2019s food storage recommendation to a full week of supplies, as Sweden and Norway had done.

Germany\u2019s focus, meanwhile, is on ramping up the number of its bunkers and protective shelters after an official estimate that the nation of 84 million has fewer than 600 public shelters, together capable of holding just 480,000 people. Many cold war shelters have been dismantled owing to the belief they would no longer be needed, but Berlin has now launched a national bunker plan under the Federal Office for Population Protection, including a geolocation phone app. Experts predict an attack by Russia may be a possibility within the next five years and the search is now on for any structure that could be used if such an event occurred, including metro stations and basements of public offices, schools and town halls. German households have been urged to adapt their own cellars, garages or store rooms, or excavate old bunkers, while housebuilders will be legally obliged to include safe shelters in new homes \u2013 as Poland has already done. The Frankfurter Allgemeiner newspaper this month revealed details of a 1,000-page army document aimed at German businesses \u2013 advising them, for example, to train extra lorry drivers \u2013 but containing civil preparedness recommendations for individuals. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 November 2024 to quote Boris Pistorius as using the term kriegst\u00fcchtig, rather than kriegsf\u00e4hig, and to better translate this as \u201cwar-capable\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>I have to be careful describing the film Nightbitch. Not&nbsp;because of spoilers, but because there is a very real danger I will walk through it frame by frame. And not because it\u2019s flawless in its depiction of motherhood in the early years \u2013 what it does to the self, to relationships, to the body, to one\u2019s orientation to the world. Rather, because I have never seen it told on screen, from the mother\u2019s point of view, with anything like this accuracy.</p> <p>\u201cBecoming a mother is such an overidealised moment in culture,\u201d says its director, Marielle Heller, words tumbling over those of her star, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/amy-adams\">Amy Adams</a>, when I meet them in London. \u201cAnd then when you go through it, you\u2019re like: \u2018What?! This is not what I expected.\u2019 And then you have a sense of failure, because you assume that everybody else is having the idealised version and that there\u2019s something off with you.\u201d</p> <p>Adams, who is more softly spoken and conciliatory, chimes in: \u201cI&nbsp;think every mother feels this way: why am I doing this so badly?\u201d Heller continues: \u201cWhy does everybody else seem to be doing it&nbsp;so well?\u201d Adams concludes: \u201cI think that contributes to the isolation, this feeling of not wanting to admit your struggles.\u201d</p> <p>Heller, 45, is recognisable from The Queen\u2019s Gambit, in which she played the heroine\u2019s adoptive mother and manager with a raw intelligence shining out of her eyes. She is better known as a director (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/06/the-diary-of-a-teenage-girl-review-coming-of-age-comedy\">The Diary of a Teenage Girl</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/30/can-you-ever-forgive-me-review-melissa-mccarthy-richard-e-grant\">Can You Forgive Me?</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/01/a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-review-tom-hanks-mr-rogers\">A Beautiful Day in&nbsp;the Neighbourhood</a>). </p> <p>Adams, 50, looks Hollywood perfect, as you would expect, unless you had seen Nightbitch, in which her transformation into a harried mother such as you might see at soft play is eerily convincing. I ask whether it was hard \u2013 after being exquisite on screen ever since her 1999 debut, Drop Dead Gorgeous, in which she embodied perfection (although it was in 2005, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/apr/14/5\">Junebug</a>, that the critics fell in love with her) \u2013 to swerve into frumpiness. She seems a bit surprised by the question. \u201cI really wanted to be present in the physical truth of the character. Even though she\u2019s being judgmental of herself at times, I didn\u2019t really judge her. It\u2019s more in the watching that I recognise the judgment I might have.\u201d</p> <p>Nightbitch is an adaptation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jul/04/nightbitch-by-rachel-yoder-review-very-wild-at-heart\">magic-realist novel by Rachel Yoder</a>. Adams\u2019s character, Mother, has given up her work as an artist to look after her baby full-time; he is about two and a half. Her husband, who continues to work, is a lovely guy \u2013 or rather you can catch the scent of the lovely guy he used to be. Now, he is the monster who thinks looking after a toddler is just like loafing about, with company, and doesn\u2019t understand why his wife can\u2019t just be happier, or at least buy milk.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Grateful is the thing we always want women to be. It\u2019s rare to actually feel it when you\u2019re in the middle of something challenging</p> <footer> <cite>Marielle Heller</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her maternal love commingled with feelings of unbearable monotony; her sense of having been exiled from the worlds of adult conversation, physical attractiveness, intellectual stimulation, creative spark and cast into a domestic prison where shapes mean more than words: it all gets way too much. Magic intervenes and she turns into a dog. If you love your children, but have ever been driven up the wall by your role in their creation, and you also love dogs, it might feel as though Heller has filched the keys to the vault of your psyche.</p> <p>In truth, it\u2019s obvious why this story doesn\u2019t get told more often: to complain about the maternal experience sounds a lot like you are not thankful enough for your precious offspring. Apart from anything else, you wouldn\u2019t want that for <em>them</em> \u2013 to have the one mother who wasn\u2019t grateful. Heller smiles wryly. \u201cGrateful is the thing we always want women to be,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare to actually feel it when you\u2019re in the middle of something challenging. Then there\u2019s the cycle of: I should be happier, I should be this. And you&nbsp;don\u2019t feel that.\u201d</p>    <p>We also don\u2019t talk about it because, as Heller says: \u201cYou\u2019re so sleep-deprived, it\u2019s a blur, those months right after giving birth. I remember thinking: if anyone knew how stupid I feel, how much I don\u2019t feel competent to even operate a car \u2026 It would be so bad for feminism if people knew how much I feel like my brain is not functioning.\u201d</p> <p>Alongside the emotional experience \u2013 its nuance and complication, the fact that it\u2019s no rose garden when you <em>were </em>promised one of those \u2013 the physical reality of making a person and bringing it forth, the ravages, are so unsparingly depicted in the film that, when I saw it, the audience divided along generational and gender lines. Every woman my age (51) was laughing out loud. Most of those who were younger or male were open-mouthed with disgust. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making the joke that this is a horror movie for men and a comedy for women,\u201d Heller says. \u201cThere is definitely a sense of: you can\u2019t say this out loud.\u201d</p> <p>Mother doesn\u2019t turn into a dog entirely by tactful CGI. It starts with hair in all the wrong places. \u201cThat\u2019s my own hair,\u201d Adams says. \u201cI grew it out for the film. I was like: \u2018Mari, you know, I can really grow whiskers. I can do this for you.\u2019\u201d The scene where she grows a tail is breathtaking: imagine how gruesomely&nbsp;compelling it is to squeeze a boil, but now imagine it&nbsp;huge, and then a thin, scraggy shaft of tail emerges. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this look that Amy gives at the end of that scene that\u2019s kind of like: \u2018Well, isn\u2019t this interesting?\u2019\u201d says Heller, affectionately. \u201cIt makes me giggle every time, because it\u2019s so not how you expect her to react. And we talked about that. All transformations have a bit of euphoria to them.\u201d</p> <p>Adams adds: \u201cI wanted to show this radical acceptance of change. Here we are. What next? Maybe I\u2019m&nbsp;just hairy now. Maybe I have a tail. I feel like that about ageing: oh, so that\u2019s where we\u2019re at this morning. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working with.\u201d</p> <p>There is no reason you would have seen a woman grow a tail in a film before. What is strange is how, as Heller\u2019s sister told her: \u201cI&nbsp;can\u2019t believe how good it feels to see menstrual blood that looks real in&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I was like: \u2018Oh, this is my second movie with period blood,\u2019\u201d says Heller. \u201cI never realised. Clearly, it\u2019s something I want us to show, because I want it to be normalised. I think I\u2019ve always felt that way: from the time I was going through puberty and getting my first period, my body is so weird and gross and interesting, and you never see it really reflected back in those terms. We\u2019re supposed to be perfect and we don\u2019t poop and we don\u2019t smell. I always wanted to&nbsp;see&nbsp;it grosser and realer.\u201d</p> <p>Next, we talk about incontinence. Even though it isn\u2019t news to me that women have this conversation after having children, I am tickled to be having it with Adams, whose daughter was born in 2010. (I remember going trampolining and a friend saying: \u201cI hope you\u2019ve got your tenners,\u201d and me saying: \u201cIt\u2019s really not that expensive,\u201d then realising midway through<em> </em>that she meant Tenas, the incontinence pads.) \u201cI would go to exercise classes and they\u2019d say: \u2018OK, now, jumping jacks,\u2019 and I\u2019d think: you\u2019re hilarious if you think that\u2019s happening,\u201d she says. This, for me, is the feminist frontier that menstruation was for Heller\u2019s sister: even as we talked for ages about peeing our pants, I was thinking: of course, I\u2019m never going to <em>write </em>that.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s something problematic in how we think it\u2019s not realistic for a man to take accountability and apologise</p> <footer> <cite>Marielle Heller</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When they were shooting the movie, Heller\u2019s daughter was exactly the same age as the child in it. When she was adapting the novel for the screen, she was pregnant and then had a newborn, which made it easier, she says \u2013 details would insistently suggest themselves. And working with small children isn\u2019t the recipe for disaster the patriarchy makes out. \u201cIt\u2019s a cliche of acting school that you prepare, you prepare, you prepare, and then you throw it away and you\u2019re spontaneous and present in the moment,\u201d says Heller. \u201cAnd you can say that\u2019s the goal, to be open to the magic that might happen in the moment. But, man, you stick a three-year-old in there \u2013 you can\u2019t be anything <em>but</em> in the moment, and present, and spontaneous. Because they\u2019re never going to do exactly what was planned.\u201d</p> <p>For Adams, recreating that mother-toddler dyad was almost like slipping into mime. \u201cI\u2019ve always approached my characters with physicality, but working with that little one, you had to be so physically present. It just changes the whole lumbering nature of your walk.\u201d</p> <p>Midway through the film \u2013 and I hope this isn\u2019t a spoiler but rather exactly what you would expect to happen when one character has become so alive with frustration that she is turned into a dog \u2013 the parents have such a catastrophic row that the relationship nearly falls apart. I put it to Heller and Adams that this segment feels idealised. \u201cWhat did you think was idealised \u2013 a man saying \u2018I was wrong\u2019?\u201d Heller asks. Well, yes, pretty much. I have never seen such a total rollover in the wild.</p>    <p>\u201cThis is becoming a bit of a crusade for me, to show men apologising in a movie.

      "bodyText": "I have to be careful describing the film Nightbitch. Not because of spoilers, but because there is a very real danger I will walk through it frame by frame. And not because it\u2019s flawless in its depiction of motherhood in the early years \u2013 what it does to the self, to relationships, to the body, to one\u2019s orientation to the world. Rather, because I have never seen it told on screen, from the mother\u2019s point of view, with anything like this accuracy. \u201cBecoming a mother is such an overidealised moment in culture,\u201d says its director, Marielle Heller, words tumbling over those of her star, Amy Adams, when I meet them in London. \u201cAnd then when you go through it, you\u2019re like: \u2018What?! This is not what I expected.\u2019 And then you have a sense of failure, because you assume that everybody else is having the idealised version and that there\u2019s something off with you.\u201d Adams, who is more softly spoken and conciliatory, chimes in: \u201cI think every mother feels this way: why am I doing this so badly?\u201d Heller continues: \u201cWhy does everybody else seem to be doing it so well?\u201d Adams concludes: \u201cI think that contributes to the isolation, this feeling of not wanting to admit your struggles.\u201d Heller, 45, is recognisable from The Queen\u2019s Gambit, in which she played the heroine\u2019s adoptive mother and manager with a raw intelligence shining out of her eyes. She is better known as a director (The Diary of a Teenage Girl, Can You Forgive Me?, A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood). Adams, 50, looks Hollywood perfect, as you would expect, unless you had seen Nightbitch, in which her transformation into a harried mother such as you might see at soft play is eerily convincing. I ask whether it was hard \u2013 after being exquisite on screen ever since her 1999 debut, Drop Dead Gorgeous, in which she embodied perfection (although it was in 2005, with Junebug, that the critics fell in love with her) \u2013 to swerve into frumpiness. She seems a bit surprised by the question. \u201cI really wanted to be present in the physical truth of the character. Even though she\u2019s being judgmental of herself at times, I didn\u2019t really judge her. It\u2019s more in the watching that I recognise the judgment I might have.\u201d Nightbitch is an adaptation of the magic-realist novel by Rachel Yoder. Adams\u2019s character, Mother, has given up her work as an artist to look after her baby full-time; he is about two and a half. Her husband, who continues to work, is a lovely guy \u2013 or rather you can catch the scent of the lovely guy he used to be. Now, he is the monster who thinks looking after a toddler is just like loafing about, with company, and doesn\u2019t understand why his wife can\u2019t just be happier, or at least buy milk. Her maternal love commingled with feelings of unbearable monotony; her sense of having been exiled from the worlds of adult conversation, physical attractiveness, intellectual stimulation, creative spark and cast into a domestic prison where shapes mean more than words: it all gets way too much. Magic intervenes and she turns into a dog. If you love your children, but have ever been driven up the wall by your role in their creation, and you also love dogs, it might feel as though Heller has filched the keys to the vault of your psyche. In truth, it\u2019s obvious why this story doesn\u2019t get told more often: to complain about the maternal experience sounds a lot like you are not thankful enough for your precious offspring. Apart from anything else, you wouldn\u2019t want that for them \u2013 to have the one mother who wasn\u2019t grateful. Heller smiles wryly. \u201cGrateful is the thing we always want women to be,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare to actually feel it when you\u2019re in the middle of something challenging. Then there\u2019s the cycle of: I should be happier, I should be this. And you don\u2019t feel that.\u201d We also don\u2019t talk about it because, as Heller says: \u201cYou\u2019re so sleep-deprived, it\u2019s a blur, those months right after giving birth. I remember thinking: if anyone knew how stupid I feel, how much I don\u2019t feel competent to even operate a car \u2026 It would be so bad for feminism if people knew how much I feel like my brain is not functioning.\u201d Alongside the emotional experience \u2013 its nuance and complication, the fact that it\u2019s no rose garden when you were promised one of those \u2013 the physical reality of making a person and bringing it forth, the ravages, are so unsparingly depicted in the film that, when I saw it, the audience divided along generational and gender lines. Every woman my age (51) was laughing out loud. Most of those who were younger or male were open-mouthed with disgust. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making the joke that this is a horror movie for men and a comedy for women,\u201d Heller says. \u201cThere is definitely a sense of: you can\u2019t say this out loud.\u201d Mother doesn\u2019t turn into a dog entirely by tactful CGI. It starts with hair in all the wrong places. \u201cThat\u2019s my own hair,\u201d Adams says. \u201cI grew it out for the film. I was like: \u2018Mari, you know, I can really grow whiskers. I can do this for you.\u2019\u201d The scene where she grows a tail is breathtaking: imagine how gruesomely compelling it is to squeeze a boil, but now imagine it huge, and then a thin, scraggy shaft of tail emerges. \u201cThere\u2019s this look that Amy gives at the end of that scene that\u2019s kind of like: \u2018Well, isn\u2019t this interesting?\u2019\u201d says Heller, affectionately. \u201cIt makes me giggle every time, because it\u2019s so not how you expect her to react. And we talked about that. All transformations have a bit of euphoria to them.\u201d Adams adds: \u201cI wanted to show this radical acceptance of change. Here we are. What next? Maybe I\u2019m just hairy now. Maybe I have a tail. I feel like that about ageing: oh, so that\u2019s where we\u2019re at this morning. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working with.\u201d There is no reason you would have seen a woman grow a tail in a film before. What is strange is how, as Heller\u2019s sister told her: \u201cI can\u2019t believe how good it feels to see menstrual blood that looks real in a movie.\u201d \u201cAnd I was like: \u2018Oh, this is my second movie with period blood,\u2019\u201d says Heller. \u201cI never realised. Clearly, it\u2019s something I want us to show, because I want it to be normalised. I think I\u2019ve always felt that way: from the time I was going through puberty and getting my first period, my body is so weird and gross and interesting, and you never see it really reflected back in those terms. We\u2019re supposed to be perfect and we don\u2019t poop and we don\u2019t smell. I always wanted to see it grosser and realer.\u201d Next, we talk about incontinence. Even though it isn\u2019t news to me that women have this conversation after having children, I am tickled to be having it with Adams, whose daughter was born in 2010. (I remember going trampolining and a friend saying: \u201cI hope you\u2019ve got your tenners,\u201d and me saying: \u201cIt\u2019s really not that expensive,\u201d then realising midway through that she meant Tenas, the incontinence pads.) \u201cI would go to exercise classes and they\u2019d say: \u2018OK, now, jumping jacks,\u2019 and I\u2019d think: you\u2019re hilarious if you think that\u2019s happening,\u201d she says. This, for me, is the feminist frontier that menstruation was for Heller\u2019s sister: even as we talked for ages about peeing our pants, I was thinking: of course, I\u2019m never going to write that. When they were shooting the movie, Heller\u2019s daughter was exactly the same age as the child in it. When she was adapting the novel for the screen, she was pregnant and then had a newborn, which made it easier, she says \u2013 details would insistently suggest themselves. And working with small children isn\u2019t the recipe for disaster the patriarchy makes out. \u201cIt\u2019s a cliche of acting school that you prepare, you prepare, you prepare, and then you throw it away and you\u2019re spontaneous and present in the moment,\u201d says Heller. \u201cAnd you can say that\u2019s the goal, to be open to the magic that might happen in the moment. But, man, you stick a three-year-old in there \u2013 you can\u2019t be anything but in the moment, and present, and spontaneous. Because they\u2019re never going to do exactly what was planned.\u201d For Adams, recreating that mother-toddler dyad was almost like slipping into mime. \u201cI\u2019ve always approached my characters with physicality, but working with that little one, you had to be so physically present. It just changes the whole lumbering nature of your walk.\u201d Midway through the film \u2013 and I hope this isn\u2019t a spoiler but rather exactly what you would expect to happen when one character has become so alive with frustration that she is turned into a dog \u2013 the parents have such a catastrophic row that the relationship nearly falls apart. I put it to Heller and Adams that this segment feels idealised. \u201cWhat did you think was idealised \u2013 a man saying \u2018I was wrong\u2019?\u201d Heller asks. Well, yes, pretty much. I have never seen such a total rollover in the wild. \u201cThis is becoming a bit of a crusade for me, to show men apologising in a movie. In every movie that I put it in, people say that it\u2019s idealised. Or people say we could cut it out, that the movie doesn\u2019t need it, that it\u2019s implicit. And people go: \u2018Well, that\u2019s not realistic.\u2019 There\u2019s something really problematic about the fact that we think it\u2019s not realistic for a man to take accountability and apologise.\u201d The funny thing is, amid all the excretions and the hair and the canine transformation, amid the ugliness of marital strife and domestic drudgery and the kaleidoscope of love, fear and shame, easily the most embarrassing bit of the movie is when Mother goes into the city to have dinner with her friends from the before-times and says something inane, in the \u201ccute thing my toddler said\u201d space. It\u2019s absolutely fingernails-down-a\u2011chalkboard cringe. Adams took that bit in her stride: \u201cI embarrass myself all the time, so I have a high threshold of embarrassment. I\u2019m constantly saying something totally ridiculous.\u201d Heller remembers meetings in Hollywood \u2013 to \u201csuddenly be in a room full of men and think: \u2018I only know how to talk to two-year-olds.\u2019\u201d This is the final explanation of why this story is so rarely told: having a baby is such a profound, mature and social experience \u2013 losing your self and your place in the world, forging a new self and finding a new place \u2013 but its language is baby talk and its materials are poster paints, if you are lucky (before that, nappies). It seems it was just waiting for two whip-smart and quite different imaginations \u2013 and a bit of magic realism. \u2022 Nightbitch is released in the UK on 6 December",

The private member\u2019s bill, brought by the Labour backbencher Kim Leadbeater, will be debated from 9.30am on Friday in the House of Commons with a vote expected at about 2.30pm. More than 160 MPs are hoping to speak in the five-hour debate in parliament where they will have a free vote on the bill, which provides assisted dying for those with a terminal illness and less than six months to live, subject to approval by two doctors and a high court judge. They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish \u2013 free from coercion or pressure \u2013 to end their life. With emotions running high on both sides, those running campaigns for and against assisted dying said it was very close to call. Assisted dying has not been voted on in the House of Commons for almost a decade. It last went before the Commons in 2015 and was rejected by MPs. There was also a bill proposed in the House of Lords in 2022, which reached a second reading in the chamber. Keir Starmer, who has been neutral on the bill, has said he will vote on Friday and campaigners are confident he will back it. Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, and Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, are expected to be among those voting in favour of the bill, while Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, have indicated they will vote against. In her final interview before the vote, Leadbeater urged her colleagues to support the principle of bodily autonomy. She said: \u201cI think we will look back in 10 years\u2019 time and think, \u2018why didn\u2019t this happen sooner?\u2019 I think then people will have to look back and think about how they voted.\u201d Leadbeater told the Guardian the fight for assisted dying was akin to the women\u2019s rights movement to allow a woman\u2019s right to choose to have an abortion \u2013 and that terminally ill people should be given similar rights over their bodies. She has promised MPs that detailed work will begin by civil servants and ministers on the potential impact of the bill saying there was \u201ctime to work on getting this right\u201d. The measures in the bill will have two years to be implemented. Government sources said that a minister would be put on the bill committee and amendments could be made \u2013 but it will remain a private member\u2019s bill and not become a government one.

The UN estimates a third or more of its aid entering Gaza is looted.</p> <p>One official said: \u201cIt is organised crime on a massive scale. They are taking supplies paid for by member states.

For fuel it is a mess, as it means we are more or less grounded until the situation is fixed,\u201d one said on Wednesday.</p> <p>Another said the convoy had been bringing in enough flour to run bakeries for 1.5 million people in central and southern Gaza for about seven days. After the attack, the World Food Programme (WFP) emptied its warehouses, distributing enough flour for two days, an official said. A small convoy last week managed to bring in enough for a further 72 hours.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hand to mouth. There\u2019s absolutely nothing in reserve.

The leading vehicles crossed an area of deserted wasteland where many ambushes have occurred, then turned north on Salahuddin Road, the main artery in Gaza.

Gangs have made huge sums in recent months through stealing and stockpiling aid. The price of basics in Gaza has soared as deliveries have declined sharply. Every truck looted on 17 November carried more than 400 desperately needed bags of wheat flour, each worth $100 on markets in Gaza.</p> <p>Efforts to set up alternative routes to avoid the stretches of road most vulnerable to looting have not been successful. The first convoys that tried to use a more direct route to Deir al-Balah from the newly opened Kissufim entry point was attacked on 13 November, with 14 out of 20 trucks looted. Four drivers were hospitalised, three with gunshot wounds.</p> <p>The main organiser of the looters has been named in internal UN notes seen by the Guardian as Yasser Abu Shabab, a well-known tribal leader and businessman.

This year Hamas set up \u201cpopular resistance committees\u201d made up of Hamas fighters, allied armed groups and local clans to enforce some kind of order in swaths of Gaza that are in effect ungoverned. A day after the convoy was attacked, the Hamas-run interior ministry said 20 people had been killed in an operation to reclaim the looted supplies and said the operation was the start of a broader campaign to tackle the problem. A Hamas official said the operation showed that the group continued to govern Gaza. \u201cHamas as a movement exists \u2026 Hamas as a government exists too, not as strong as it used to be, but it exists,\u201d he said. Over recent months a range of violent actors have emerged in Gaza, including community defence groups and militias linked to clans. Community leaders said local people had fought back against the looters on Saturday and managed to retrieve some of the stolen trucks, which were then returned to the WFP. Central Gaza has emerged as a centre of resistance to the armed gangs who operate farther south, with multiple reports of fatal armed clashes between community groups and families based there and the gangs who steal aid before it reaches other parts of the territory. Some such violence has led to vendettas and a series of murders. Field hospitals in central and southern Gaza have seen multiple cases of injuries sustained in what appear to be punishment attacks on looters by \u201cvigilantes\u201d, two aid officials in Gaza said.

Griffith, 46, will not be eligible for parole until 2049. Queensland district court judge Paul Smith imposed the maximum sentence and a special non-parole period of 27 years, after Griffith pleaded guilty to 307 sexual offences against children in his care in Brisbane and Italy between 2003 and 2022.

After discovering Griffith had uploaded images to a dark web paedophile forum, using the pseudonym \u201cZimble\u201d, detectives discovered catalogued files on his computer \u2013 including class photographs and enrolment details of children and videos of his abuse. The court heard that a pre-sentence report and a psychiatric report had found Griffith had a \u201cpaedophilic disorder\u201d but \u201cno other disorders or background factors which explained the offending\u201d. \u201cHe was assessed as having a high level of sexual deviance and is a high risk of reoffending,\u201d the director of public prosecutions, Todd Fuller KC, said. Those reports found Griffith \u201clacked empathy to the victims\u201d, engaged in \u201cminimisations and cognitive distortions\u201d and had attempted to justify his actions.

The ABC chair came armed with a customary erudite speech, replete with references to George Johnston\u2019s masterpiece My Brother Jack and warnings about objective truth from George Orwell. But a question from the ABC\u2019s Jane Norman about Rogan\u2019s influence sparked international headlines and responses from Rogan and his buddy Elon Musk. Williams started off well, saying he was the wrong person to comment and he wasn\u2019t a listener. But then he offered a view anyway. \u201cPeople like Mr Rogan prey on people\u2019s vulnerabilities: they prey on fear, they prey on anxiety, they prey on all of the elements that contribute to uncertainty in society,\u201d Williams told Norman. \u201cThey entrepreneur fantasy outcomes and conspiracy outcomes as being a normal part of social narrative \u2013 I personally find it deeply repulsive.\u201d Sign up to get Guardian Australia\u2019s weekly media diary as a newsletter Rogan responded on X: \u201cLOL WUT.\u201d Musk said: \u201cFrom the head of Australian government-funded media, their Pravda.\u201d The statements resulted in an inbox full of abusive emails and the ABC chair took to the airwaves again, telling ABC Radio Melbourne host Raf Epstein: \u201cWhat fascinates me is you say something negative about Joe Rogan, and I have been swarmed with the most unbelievably vicious responses. \u201cI got one this morning that said that I should \u2018stay in my lane and watch out\u2019.

Walkleys feeling the pinch News Corp Australia launched its own in-house awards 20 years ago in response to a widespread feeling inside Holt Street that the Walkley Awards favoured the ABC and the then Fairfax newspapers and failed to recognise good tabloid journalism. This antipathy towards the Walkleys has deepened, Weekly Beast has learned. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Australian arm has withdrawn its sponsorship dollars from the annual celebration of journalism for which it has been a major contributor for many years. While the ABC and the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age are gold sponsors, News Corp has dropped out. A News Corp spokesperson said: \u201cSome time ago, News Corp Australia completed a review of its corporate sponsorships and did not renew this partnership.\u201d The withdrawal of News Corp hit the Walkley Foundation hard, coming as it did at the same time as a major sponsorship deal with the fossil fuel company Ampol ended. Ampol\u2019s two-year platinum sponsorship, which sparked a protest from cartoonists and journalists, was worth several hundred thousand dollars. For the first time this year nominees did not receive free tickets to the awards, and had to stump up $250 each for a seat. While media companies in the main picked up the cost for their employees, some freelancers could not attend due to the cost. Apart from ideological reasons the withdrawal of News has almost certainly got something to do with the straitened times in media of course.

A week later News Corp\u2019s executive chair, Lachlan Murdoch, hosted an intimate dinner for the winners \u2013 a much cheaper option than flying all the interstate nominees and their partners to Sydney for an awards night. Other Costello in the spotlight On Monday A Current Affair reporter Seb Costello and a Channel Nine camera operator were doing what foot-in-the-door journalists are legendary for: chasing a target down the street. Seb\u2019s father, Peter Costello, was subjected to similar treatment by The Australian\u2019s tenacious Liam Mendes, which ended in the former treasurer\u2019s resignation. The ACA incident, which involved following the man into a women\u2019s toilet, has resulted in Costello and the camo being suspended while the matter is investigated internally. Victoria police told us: \u201cPolice attended an address on Collins Street on Monday, November 25. No offence was detected.

Signing off This weekend marks a goodbye-for-now for three legendary journalists. On Friday Richard Glover will host his final ABC Radio Drive program, with an episode of TGIF marking the end of his 26 years with the station. Also farewelling his newsroom after an incredible 31 years \u2013 and two Gold Walkeys \u2013 is the AFR\u2019s investigative reporter Neil Chenoweth. Last year Chenoweth and Edmund Tadros took home Gold after uncovering the PwC tax leak scandal. Chenoweth has also been dogged in his pursuit of News Corp\u2019s financial accounts over decades, attracting criticism from the Murdoch empire for his efforts. The Australian once accused him of having made a career out of \u201ctrading conspiratorial stories\u201d.

After 11 years, and almost 500 Media Watch episodes, the investigative journalist and author will walk away from the show. \u201cI\u2019ve lost the odd friendship and made a few new enemies, but I\u2019ve tried my best to keep the bastards honest, and I hope I\u2019ve earned some respect,\u201d Barry said.",

      "bodyText": "In a small city across the harbour from New Zealand\u2019s capital, an invisible villain is terrorising locals. It hovers thick and putrid, seeping through windows, tainting laundry and making people retch. \u201cThe stench\u201d, as locals call it, can be so odious, people have to dash between their car and house holding their breath, have stopped eating outside and are considering selling their homes to escape. \u201cIt\u2019s like a long-drop [toilet] that\u2019s not well ventilated,\u201d says Anthony Coomer who lives and works in the area. \u201cIt\u2019s like the worst baby\u2019s nappy you have ever smelt \u2026 and that\u2019s what it is like in your mouth.\u201d For years, Lower Hutt city residents and businesses have been living with the odour emanating from the Seaview wastewater treatment plant, which sits in a semi-industrial, semi-residential area along the northern shores of Wellington harbour. Most of the time it comes and goes \u2013 some days it is pungent, other days non-existent. But in recent months the smell has become stronger and more frequent following equipment breakdowns and a fire in the plant\u2019s dryer system. While local authorities say they are working to minimise the odour and reduce the risk of major stinks, it could take a few years before a reliable new system is installed. Outside Coomer\u2019s workplace \u2013 a motorsports manufacturing company 300 metres from the plant \u2013 the smell is thick and inescapable, even when inside. \u201cDo you remember the cartoons where the green smell would come along and whiff right up the nose? Coomer asks. \u201cWhen it\u2019s at its worst, you have to use your arms to cut through the air in front of you.\u201d Coomer is embarrassed when customers are besieged by the stench, and entertaining people at his home a kilometre away comes with risk. \u201cYou\u2019re having a barbecue with your family and then bang \u2013 you have to run inside and close all the doors \u2013 you can\u2019t taste your food, it\u2019s unreal.\u201d Danielle Wills, who lives roughly a kilometre from the plant and set up a community Facebook group called Stop the Stench, says the smell can be so strong \u201cyou\u2019re literally gagging.\u201d The stench can arrive a couple of times a week or daily, depending on what\u2019s happening at the plant and what the weather is doing, she says.

Meanwhile, they are making fixes to the current dryer but a reliable replacement \u2013 which will be custom built and cost $90m \u2013 could, in the worst-case scenario, take up to four years to install. McKibbin says that does not mean the community will have to endure the stench at its current level for four years, but until the new system is installed, there is a risk of further breakdowns and odours flaring up. The Lower Hutt City mayor Campbell Barry says water infrastructure across the wider Wellington region has long been troubled by decades of under-investment. While there was no \u201csilver bullet or quick fix\u201d to the plant\u2019s problems, the day-to-day operators are doing everything they can to mitigate potential odours, Barry says. Seaview\u2019s woes have drawn comparisons to a stench that plagued a suburb in Christchurch in 2022, after issues with a council-run composting plant. Barry says that situation was very different \u2013 there, it was a 24/7 problem \u2013 but he is open-minded to exploring what the Christchurch Council did to support its residents and businesses, which included one-off cash payments towards air purifiers.

      "bodyText": "Black Friday used to be an American thing. But, like Halloween before it, the phenomenon of a blockbuster end-of-November sales period has taken off outside the US. Across Australia, a wave of advertising has surged \u2013 promoting discounted appliances, electricity plans, clothes and just about anything else you could think of \u2013 reaching its climax this week. It is on track to eclipse the Boxing Day sales as Australia\u2019s biggest retail event within the next two years, especially as more people shop online, according to Robert Crawford, a professor of advertising at RMIT University. \u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019d have to say I don\u2019t see a sustainable way of doing this, because of the very nature of it being geared towards overconsumption,\u201d Crawford says. The Australian Retailers Association (ARA) expects a record $6.7bn to be spent from Friday to Monday \u2013 5.5% more than in the same period last year \u2013 based on analysis by market researcher Roy Morgan. While major retailers \u2013 and plenty of smaller labels \u2013 have heavily promoted their products for Black Friday, some brands marketed as ethically minded have chosen to entirely avoid taking part in the sales. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Adam Ferrier, a consumer psychologist and founder of the marketing agency Thinkerbell, says Black Friday has become popular in Australia because \u201ccultural moments become big when businesses can make money out of them\u201d. \u201cThe Black Friday sale does have utility on an individual level,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got your shit together and you decide to take advantage of it, you can genuinely buy something cheaper before prices go up for Christmas.\u201d But Ferrier says it \u201cdoes pose an issue in terms of overconsumption\u201d at a \u201ccollective level\u201d. Johanna Ryle-Howe says her Australian-made clothing label, Caves Collect, has never participated in Black Friday, as she believes the sales drive \u201crampant consumerism that can\u2019t be sustained by the planet\u201d. \u201c[Consumers] buy things they don\u2019t want or need, and brands build crazy profit margins into their pricing to accommodate for expected exponential sales during Black Friday,\u201d she says. \u201cSomeone is paying at the end of the day, whether it\u2019s the consumer, or the environment, or the people in the supply chain, or the shareholders of these companies.\u201d Sister Studios, which produces its clothes in Melbourne, has also opted out of the sales because of concerns about overconsumption. The label\u2019s co-founder Emma Cutri, says the high volume of advertising, especially targeted ads on social media, create a sense of urgency that encourages people to buy things they don\u2019t need. Cutri says she already has to charge more for clothes because of the higher cost of manufacturing clothes in Australia compared with overseas. \u201c[Bigger brands\u2019] pants probably cost $10 to make, so they can put them on sale for 50 bucks and it\u2019s still a bargain. Whereas for me to go on sale, I\u2019ll end up at a loss,\u201d she says. \u201cObviously I do go on sale because that\u2019s the nature of the beast, but the pressure of a Black Friday sale, I don\u2019t think it applies to an independent Melbourne label.\u201d However, the bamboo underwear label Boody, which has an ethical B-Corp certification, is running Black Friday sales. The company says it \u201cworks closely with a handful of manufacturers\u201d in China and Vietnam to produce its garments offshore. Boody\u2019s co-chief executive, Elliot Midalia, says the company used not to take part in Black Friday, which he previously regarded as a \u201cconsumerism, 1990s, Americana thing\u201d. \u201cIf I take a step back, Australia would wake up in late November to everyone in the US trampling each other to get into stores,\u201d he says. \u201cE-commerce broke that international barrier.\u201d After debating whether or not to join the sales this year, Midalia says they decided they needed to compete with other brands in order to offer consumers a cheaper way to buy a more ethical product. \u201cOur belief is access to a sustainable brand shouldn\u2019t be an issue,\u201d he says. Kristy Barber, who runs the Melbourne-made label Kuwaii, says her \u201cslow fashion\u201d business has grown to a size where it \u201chas to take the opportunity to take part\u201d in some kind of promotion at this time of year. So Barber offered 20% discounts last week. \u201cWe do want to allow people to buy into ethical fashion as well, so sales can be a way for customers to feel that it\u2019s more accessible and inclusive,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we have always tried to stand apart from the Black Friday event itself.\u201d The sales \u2013 and the associated packaging from the products sold \u2013 come after the federal government set targets of reducing total waste by 10% per person, achieving an 80% average recovery rate from all waste streams by 2030. Jeff Angel, the director of the Total Environment Centre, says virtually all of the estimated 150,000 tonnes of household soft plastics are going to landfill. Angel says the nation\u2019s environment ministers will meet on 10 December to consider further reforms. \u201cThey have three options,\u201d Angel says. \u201cOne is business as usual, a second one is just having some design targets for packaging and a third one is a full on reduce and responsibility scheme, which is obviously our preferred option.\u201d Angel argues Black Friday is \u201cjust another marketing and promotion activity\u201d that is generating waste. The retailers\u2019 association takes a different view, with its chief industry officer, Fleur Brown, saying the sales are an opportunity to \u201chave a bit of fun with the retail calendar\u201d, after consumers went through \u201csensory deprivation\u201d during the pandemic. \u201cFundamentally, Aussies do love their shopping,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Anthony Albanese has trumpeted the government\u2019s legislative success for making a \u201cdifference\u201d for Australians, but denied parliament\u2019s last-week bill rush means Labor is preparing the way for an early election. The Senate passed 31 pieces of legislation on Thursday evening \u2013 and a total of 45 this week \u2013 which the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, described as \u201cextraordinary\u201d, although not a record. After a late-night Senate sitting close to midnight approved 31 bills, the House of Representatives returned on Friday morning to finally approve 11 of those that required amendment including the Future Made in Australia package and the social media ban on under-16s. Albanese said that bill meant that \u201cplatforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re making sure that mums and dads can have that different conversation today, and in future days,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra. \u201cWe\u2019ve got your back, is our message to Australian parents.\u201d Albanese said the government knew \u201cthe real value of what happens in here is the difference that it makes to people\u2019s lives out there\u201d. He pointed to legislation \u201cholding supermarkets to account to get fairer prices at the checkout\u201d, and housing bills increasing supply of build to rent properties by 80,000 and helping 40,000 Australians buy a home through Labor\u2019s shared equity scheme. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email But the prime minister acknowledged that the government had \u201cmore work to do on cost of living\u201d. Despite Labor\u2019s legislative successes, enabled by a deal on 27 bills with the Greens and a further four passed with Coalition support, the government still has business unfinished on electoral and environmental laws. Albanese said that after consultations across the parliament Labor \u201cparticularly thought that the Coalition were going to support the agenda to take big money out of politics\u201d. The government\u2019s bill would cap receipt of donations at $20,000 and impose spending caps of $90m for federal campaigns and $800,000 for local electorate campaigns. Albanese said the bipartisan path of seeking Coalition support had \u201cbecome a cul-de-sac\u201d so Labor would now \u201clook for other paths and roads to success\u201d. The comments signal that the special minister of state, Don Farrell, now needs to win Greens and crossbench support for the reforms, despite their initial hostility that the bill entrenches the financial advantages of major parties. Despite Albanese nixing a deal between Tanya Plibersek and Sarah Hanson-Young on Nature Positive laws, the pledge to create an Environmental Protection Agency is still Labor policy and the bill remains on the Senate notice paper. The shadow environment minister, Jonno Duniam, accused the government of \u201cwalking both sides of the street\u201d. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to say their EPA is dead but the prime minister killed off a deal on it for the second time,\u201d he said in a statement. The comments indicate the electoral danger of the Coalition continuing to campaign against the reforms, especially in Western Australia, unless they are formally dropped, which will also be a consideration for Labor evaluating whether to retain its commitment to cut tax concessions on big super balances. Asked if he was clearing the decks for an early election, Albanese replied: \u201cNot at all. What we\u2019re doing is getting things done.\u201d Among the legislation passed on Thursday and Friday was a trio of migration bills allowing Australia to pay third countries to take non-citizens, expanding powers to prohibit items including phones in immigration detention, creating criminal penalties for not cooperating with deportation and the power to blacklist visa applications from designated countries. Asked how soon Australia could begin paying countries to take non-citizens and if he could guarantee deals would only be struck with signatories to the refugee convention, Albanese replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll implement our legislation.\u201d Albanese said he valued multiculturalism but his government had \u201cinherited an immigration system that wasn\u2019t fit for purpose\u201d. \u201cOn Peter Dutton\u2019s watch, there was a huge spike in the number of protection visa applications onshore,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had three reviews into the migration system \u2026 from senior respected authorities in this area \u2013 all of them said that the immigration system that we inherited was a mess, so we have to clean up a whole range of issues.\u201d",

The laws, which will come into effect from late 2025, will bar under-16s from being able to access social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit and X. Exemptions will apply for health and education services including YouTube, Messenger Kids, WhatsApp, Kids Helpline and Google Classroom. Here is what Australia, European countries and tech companies have been doing to regulate children\u2019s access to social media. Australia The new law forces tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta to TikTok to stop minors logging in or face fines of up to $49.5m. A trial of methods to enforce it will start in January, with the ban to take effect in a year. Tech\u2019s own regulation Social media platforms including TikTok, Facebook and Snapchat say people need to be at least 13 to sign up. Child protection advocates say control is insufficient, however, and official data in several European countries show huge numbers of children under 13 have social media accounts. The UK Britain has no current plans for Australia-style restrictions. But the digital minister, Peter Kyle, has said everything is on the table when it comes to keeping people safe online and has launched a study to explore the impact of smartphone and social media use specifically on children. He said regulator Ofcom must have regard to government priorities such as safety by design and transparency and accountability, as they enforce the Online Safety Act from next year. The act, which sets tougher standards for social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and TikTok \u2013 including on appropriate age restrictions \u2013 was passed in 2023 by the previous government. Norway The Norwegian government last month proposed raising the age at which children can consent to the terms required to use social media to 15 years from 13 years currently, although parents would still be permitted to sign off on their behalf if they are under the age limit. The centre-left government also said it had begun work on legislation to set an absolute legal minimum age limit for social media use, but it was not immediately clear when a law mandating this may reach parliament. Half of Norway\u2019s nine-year-olds use some form of social media, according to the government. EU legislation In the European Union, parental consent is required for the processing of personal data for children under the age of 16, though the bloc\u2019s 27 member states can lower that limit to 13. France In 2023, France passed a law requiring social platforms to obtain parental consent for minors under 15 to create accounts. However, local media say technical challenges mean it has not yet enforced. In April, a panel commissioned by the president, Emmanuel Macron, recommended stricter rules, including banning mobile phones for children under 11 and internet-enabled phones for those under 13. It is unclear when new legislation could be adopted and to what extent it would follow experts\u2019 recommendations. Germany Officially, minors between the ages of 13 and 16 are allowed to use social media in Germany only if their parents give consent. There are currently no plans to go further. However, child protection advocates say controls are insufficient and call for existing rules to be better implemented. Belgium In 2018, Belgium enacted a law requiring children to be at least 13 to create a social media account without parental permission. Netherlands The Netherlands doesn\u2019t have any laws regarding a minimum age for social media use, but the government banned mobile devices in classrooms from January 2024 to reduce distractions.

I\u2019m an undergraduate at one of the most competitive universities in the UK and received top grades throughout school to get in. Since going to university I\u2019ve kept busy and achieved a lot. I am president of a student society, do pro-bono tutoring and have done multiple internships and a part-time job alongside my degree, which I am averaging a first in. </strong><strong>I have a really strong network of friends and am in a healthy relationship with long-term partner and feel happier and more confident with myself than ever before. Since being at university I\u2019ve gained a bit of weight, exercising less intensively with other commitments taking over, as well as just getting a little bit older and becoming a woman rather than a girl. I\u2019m overweight on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/02/bmi-why-experts-are-calling-for-better-ways-of-assessing-health-than-a-body-mass-index\">BMI scale</a> but not by much and I attribute at least some of that to the muscle I\u2019ve put on from lifting weights twice a week.</strong></p> <p><strong>My parents have always valued eating well, exercising and \u201clooking\u201d healthy, and have had multiple conversations with me over the summer about my weight. </strong><strong> I shrugged it off for a while but have </strong><strong> started pushing back a bit on it and telling them how uncomfortable it makes me feel. I fear it never quite gets through to them. Is there any way to get them to stop for good?</strong></p> <p><em><strong>Eleanor says:</strong></em><strong> </strong>You could spend a bunch of time thinking through why your parents react this way. Is it a control thing? Do your parents see bodies as an extension of CVs? Maybe it\u2019s the thing where we use bodies as signs of status. Once that meant showing you didn\u2019t work in the sun; had soft hands; enough to eat. Now it\u2019s leanness or hardness as \u201cproof\u201d of self-discipline. Maybe it would be helpful to think through why thinness is a prize to them, and \u2013 separate question \u2013 why they think they get to expect you to deliver it.</p> <p>But ultimately your question is about getting them to stop doing this, no matter the explanation for why they do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/22/i-feel-guilt-and-frustration-at-not-having-found-my-thing-how-can-i-reconcile-this\">I want to find my \u2018thing\u2019. How can I work out what I want to do with my life? | Leading questions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You and your parents are at a transitional moment. You\u2019ve left home, you\u2019re a young adult. It can take a beat for parents to adapt to a new dynamic where they don\u2019t \u201cknow best\u201d or get automatic input into your life as they did when you were young. It can take a while for parents to internalise that now their views on your body, your choices, your life, are unsolicited advice \u2013 not directives or expert guidance the way they once were.</p> <p>Out of kindness for the fact that that can be a slow transition, I\u2019d explain once, properly, why you don\u2019t like this. Have phrases you prep in advance. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to lose weight, and it makes me feel scrutinised when you tell me to burn calories.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m healthy and active, and it\u2019s not fair that you think you get to tell me what to eat or how to look.\u201d If this has any hope of registering it has to be more than pushback here and there: you have to announce that you want more-than-usual attention to what you\u2019re saying, even ask them to say it back to you.</p> <p>It can help to have a label for the exact thing you don\u2019t want them to do. Sometimes people get confused (or feign confusion?) about what you\u2019re objecting to. \u201cAm I allowed to talk about exercise?\u201d \u201cCan I <em>mention</em> calories?\u201d Name the exact phenomenon you want to stop: remarks assuming you should lose weight. You can even give it a cute name. Call it \u201cbody bossing\u201d or something silly, so that when it happens again you can say, \u201cAht, no body bossing!\u201d</p> <p>After that it\u2019s just rule-enforcing. If you don\u2019t want people to do X, you have to make it too costly for them to keep doing X. This starts small: phrases you repeat somewhat antisocially any time it happens. \u201cI\u2019ve explained I don\u2019t want you telling me to lose weight. If you keep doing it, I\u2019m going to have to end the conversation when you do.\u201d It\u2019s often a matter of calmly repeating these cause-effect statements word for word.</p> <p>It can feel rotten to do this because it\u2019s so uncomfortably similar to how we deal with animals or toddlers. \u201cGood behaviour get reward\u201d is not a mode we much like to use for adults. The temptation to go back to explanation-mode is strong, and to some extent you can make the case in brief every time you say \u201cplease stop\u201d. But if explanation failed to change behaviour the first few times, the ninth or 10th isn\u2019t likely to work either. It feels bad to keep pleading for understanding. One solution is to bow out of the persuasion game: focus on asking for the change in behaviour, not on the plea to be recognised or understood.</p> <p>By the sounds of it it\u2019s an achievement that you have a healthy relationship to your body. You get to hold on to that even if they won\u2019t understand why.</p> <p><strong>*This question has been edited for length</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"form\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/js.php/leading_questions&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/leading_questions&quot; title=&quot;Online Form&quot;&gt;Online Form - Ethical dilemmas for Eleanor Gordon-Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "How do I get my parents to stop fixating on the fact I\u2019ve gained weight? I\u2019m an undergraduate at one of the most competitive universities in the UK and received top grades throughout school to get in. Since going to university I\u2019ve kept busy and achieved a lot. I am president of a student society, do pro-bono tutoring and have done multiple internships and a part-time job alongside my degree, which I am averaging a first in. I have a really strong network of friends and am in a healthy relationship with long-term partner and feel happier and more confident with myself than ever before. Since being at university I\u2019ve gained a bit of weight, exercising less intensively with other commitments taking over, as well as just getting a little bit older and becoming a woman rather than a girl. I\u2019m overweight on the BMI scale but not by much and I attribute at least some of that to the muscle I\u2019ve put on from lifting weights twice a week. My parents have always valued eating well, exercising and \u201clooking\u201d healthy, and have had multiple conversations with me over the summer about my weight. I shrugged it off for a while but have started pushing back a bit on it and telling them how uncomfortable it makes me feel. I fear it never quite gets through to them. Is there any way to get them to stop for good? Eleanor says: You could spend a bunch of time thinking through why your parents react this way. Is it a control thing? Do your parents see bodies as an extension of CVs? Maybe it\u2019s the thing where we use bodies as signs of status. Once that meant showing you didn\u2019t work in the sun; had soft hands; enough to eat. Now it\u2019s leanness or hardness as \u201cproof\u201d of self-discipline. Maybe it would be helpful to think through why thinness is a prize to them, and \u2013 separate question \u2013 why they think they get to expect you to deliver it. But ultimately your question is about getting them to stop doing this, no matter the explanation for why they do. You and your parents are at a transitional moment. You\u2019ve left home, you\u2019re a young adult. It can take a beat for parents to adapt to a new dynamic where they don\u2019t \u201cknow best\u201d or get automatic input into your life as they did when you were young. It can take a while for parents to internalise that now their views on your body, your choices, your life, are unsolicited advice \u2013 not directives or expert guidance the way they once were. Out of kindness for the fact that that can be a slow transition, I\u2019d explain once, properly, why you don\u2019t like this. Have phrases you prep in advance. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to lose weight, and it makes me feel scrutinised when you tell me to burn calories.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m healthy and active, and it\u2019s not fair that you think you get to tell me what to eat or how to look.\u201d If this has any hope of registering it has to be more than pushback here and there: you have to announce that you want more-than-usual attention to what you\u2019re saying, even ask them to say it back to you. It can help to have a label for the exact thing you don\u2019t want them to do. Sometimes people get confused (or feign confusion?) about what you\u2019re objecting to. \u201cAm I allowed to talk about exercise?\u201d \u201cCan I mention calories?\u201d Name the exact phenomenon you want to stop: remarks assuming you should lose weight. You can even give it a cute name. Call it \u201cbody bossing\u201d or something silly, so that when it happens again you can say, \u201cAht, no body bossing!\u201d After that it\u2019s just rule-enforcing. If you don\u2019t want people to do X, you have to make it too costly for them to keep doing X. This starts small: phrases you repeat somewhat antisocially any time it happens. \u201cI\u2019ve explained I don\u2019t want you telling me to lose weight. If you keep doing it, I\u2019m going to have to end the conversation when you do.\u201d It\u2019s often a matter of calmly repeating these cause-effect statements word for word. It can feel rotten to do this because it\u2019s so uncomfortably similar to how we deal with animals or toddlers. \u201cGood behaviour get reward\u201d is not a mode we much like to use for adults. The temptation to go back to explanation-mode is strong, and to some extent you can make the case in brief every time you say \u201cplease stop\u201d. But if explanation failed to change behaviour the first few times, the ninth or 10th isn\u2019t likely to work either. It feels bad to keep pleading for understanding. One solution is to bow out of the persuasion game: focus on asking for the change in behaviour, not on the plea to be recognised or understood. By the sounds of it it\u2019s an achievement that you have a healthy relationship to your body. You get to hold on to that even if they won\u2019t understand why. *This question has been edited for length",

      "body": "<h2>Veltman can lead Seagulls to second</h2> <p>Fabian H\u00fcrzeler singled out Jo\u00ebl Veltman as one of the Premier League\u2019s most underrated players as Brighton prepare to face the bottom side, Southampton, on Friday. \u201cHe knows what to do to win games,\u201d H\u00fcrzeler said of the Netherlands defender, who has started all but one of Brighton\u2019s league games so far. Veltman \u2013 who spent eight years at Ajax before moving to the Amex in 2020 for \u00a3900,000 \u2013 is 11 months older than his manager and his experience has proved invaluable to his side in the absence of the captain, Lewis Dunk, through injury. He is expected to return against Russell Martin\u2019s side as Brighton attempt to record a fourth clean sheet of the league season, not to mention take the opportunity to move into second place before the rest of the weekend\u2019s fixtures. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Brighton v Southampton, Friday 8pm (all times GMT)</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>A new Foxes era under Van Nistelrooy?</h2> <p>Unencumbered by any previous association with Nottingham Forest, Ruud van Nistelrooy would probably be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/ruud-van-nistelrooy-set-to-succeed-steve-cooper-as-leicester-manager\">a popular appointment at the King Power Stadium</a>, with all available evidence at the time of writing suggesting the Dutchman\u2019s first match in charge of Leicester could even be at the unlikely fortress that is the Gtech Community Stadium. During his spell as interim manager of Manchester United, Van Nistelrooy made no attempt to disguise his enthusiasm for the job and brings trophy-winning experience to Leicester having won the Dutch Cup in his sole season in charge of PSV Eindhoven. Tactically flexible with whatever players he has at his disposal, Van Nistelrooy\u2019s preferred style is to marry quick, attacking intent with defensive solidity and could quickly endear himself to a fanbase that took no time at all to tire of Steve Cooper\u2019s defensive approach. The approach he adopts against the side with the top flight\u2019s best home record will be intriguing. <strong>Barry Glendenning</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Brentford v Leicester, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Palace keen for returns to boost chances</h2> <p>While the performances have improved, Oliver Glasner will be concerned that the wins have yet to materialise for Crystal Palace. The Austrian will be hoping that Eberechi Eze can make his comeback against Newcastle after a hamstring injury that has sidelined him since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/aston-villa-crystal-palace-carabao-cup-match-report\">win over Aston Villa</a> in the EFL Cup last month, with Adam Wharton also closing in on a return for a tricky run of fixtures over the next few weeks that includes trips to Ipswich and Brighton, and home games against Manchester City and Arsenal. A repeat of April\u2019s 2-0 win over Newcastle at Selhurst Park courtesy of two goals from Jean-Philippe Mateta would settle the nerves in south London, with Isma\u00efla Sarr likely to start for a fourth successive match after his first Premier League goal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">against Villa last week</a>. <strong>EA</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Crystal Palace v Newcastle, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Old-school strikers at City Ground</h2> <p>Having suffered back-to-back losses for the first time this season, Nottingham Forest welcome Ipswich to the City Ground and will be hoping to rediscover the defensive mojo that served them so well before their recent reverses. After conceding only seven goals in their opening 10 matches of the campaign, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s side have shipped six in their past two and, in Liam Delap, Forest\u2019s central defensive duo of Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic will have to deal with quite the handful. Strong as a bull and a terrific ball-carrier who is as fast as he is fearless, the Ipswich striker\u2019s battle against one of the league\u2019s most impressive defensive partnerships this season ought to make for compelling viewing. In Chris Wood, Forest have a comparatively elderly bulldozer of their own and with both centre-forwards in form and responsible for half their sides\u2019 combined Premier League goal tally of 28, this could be a classic battle of the big men. <strong>BG</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Nottingham Forest v Ipswich, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Cunha gives improving Wolves bite</h2> <p>Wolves\u2019 top-flight matches have seen 48 goals this season, more than any other team, but more important for Gary O\u2019Neil his side have proved the entertainers in recent weeks. Wolves have scored six goals across their past two matches, Matheus Cunha contributing half of them, but in truth their ability to score was never the primary source of concern. Only Mohamed Salah, Erling Haaland, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka this season have been involved in more goals than Cunha, who has provided seven goals and three assists. Wolves have kept a sole clean sheet in the league and, out of necessity, their captain, Mario Lemina, dropped to centre-back in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">victory against Fulham</a> last time out. With Santiago Bueno and Craig Dawson returning to fitness before hosting Bournemouth, suddenly Wolves are looking up. Andoni Iraola knows all about that, having kicked off the month by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/bournemouth-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">beating Manchester City</a>. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Wolves v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Soler offers ray of light for West Ham</h2> <p>There was not unanimous agreement at West Ham over the decision to sign Carlos Soler on loan from Paris Saint-Germain last summer. Julen Lopetegui wanted the Spain midfielder but others were not as convinced. Some in the recruitment department had eyes on Chelsea\u2019s Carney Chukwuemeka. Yet Lopetegui got his way and the first sign that he might have made the right call came in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/newcastle-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">West Ham\u2019s win at Newcastle</a> on Monday. Soler had not looked up to the pace of the Premier League previously. He was taken off at half-time against Manchester United last month, but was impressive at St James\u2019 Park. Playing in a central role, Soler\u2019s quick thinking in possession made West Ham slicker on the ball. Lopetegui will hope that resurgence continues against Arsenal. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>West Ham v Arsenal, Saturday 5.30pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Rotation of egos a test for Maresca</h2> <p>It is a tricky balancing act for Enzo Maresca at Chelsea. Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez was out for a while, then in again. The midfielder has five assists in three games, cooling talk of a departure. For Maresca, though, it is not easy to keep every member of his squad happy. Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix looked miffed not to come off the bench against Arsenal early this month. The Portugal attacker made a surprise start <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">against Leicester last week</a>, with Pedro Neto unavailable, but what of Christopher Nkunku, Mykhailo Mudryk and Jadon Sancho? There have been noises in recent weeks about Nkunku getting frustrated over his lack of game time. Sancho, meanwhile, has not started in more than a month and Mudryk remains an enigma. Will there be opportunities against Aston Villa? Maresca has a lot of attacking options and things are going well at the moment, but managing the egos in his squad will challenge the Italian. <strong>JS</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Chelsea v Aston Villa, Sunday 1.30pm</em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Amorim hopes to flower goal desert</h2> <p>In this third game of a nascent Manchester United tenure, Ruben Amorim will hope to see firm signs of \u201cthe idea\u201d of playing he references taking hold in his players. Prime in this vision has to be creating more chances because United are arid when going forward, a desert before goal, Thursday night\u2019s 3-2 Europa League win against Bod\u00f8/Glimy notwithstanding. Sean Dyche sets his sides up pragmatically so Everton, only five points behind the hosts, will be an apt test of this. Dyche will plot to turn United over on their own patch, and with Old Trafford expectant that, finally, Amorim can be the man, this should be a riveting watch. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Manchester United v Everton, Sunday 1.30pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Forster\u2019s time to shine against Fulham</h2> <p>Tottenham have won six and lost five of their 12 Premier League matches this season, their only draw coming against Leicester in an opening game they might have lost but for two fine saves from Guglielmo Vicario. The Italian goalkeeper will be absent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/shock-for-tottenham-as-guglielmo-vicario-has-surgery-on-fractured-ankle\">for the foreseeable future</a>, his fractured ankle the large cloud that overshadowed Tottenham\u2019s fine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">win over Manchester City</a> last weekend. The job of deputising for Vicario will presumably fall to Fraser Forster, a state of affairs that has prompted much agonising over the 36-year-old\u2019s ability \u2013 or perceived lack thereof \u2013 to play a style of football where he is required to ping short passes to his defenders. Ange Postecoglou has dismissed any such concerns, telling reporters it is a skill more related to mindset than ability. No doubt aware of concerns over the drop-off in quality between himself and Vicario, now is the time for Tottenham\u2019s hulking backup goalkeeper to demonstrate he can also be mentally imposing. <strong>BG</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Tottenham v Fulham, Sunday 1.30pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Threat level highest for Guardiola</h2> <p>Arne Slot has brought the Midas touch to Liverpool but, of all the accomplishments in his remarkable start, none would surpass the likelihood of releasing Manchester City\u2019s four-year grip on the Premier League title on the first day of December. The prospect of going 11 points clear of the champions with an 18th win in 20 matches under Slot makes this a hugely anticipated and consequential moment for Liverpool. Yet the stakes are even higher for City. Five defeats in six games and a late collapse to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/manchester-city-feyenoord-champions-league-match-report\">draw against Slot\u2019s former club Feyenoord</a> have drained belief from Pep Guardiola\u2019s players. Without Rodri they appear as fragile as Liverpool were in the aftermath of losing Virgil van Dijk to a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury in 2020. Josko Gvardiol\u2019s error-strewn performances are an added problem for Guardiola, who must decide whether to risk playing the Croatian against Mohamed Salah. City\u2019s famed powers of recovery are merely an illusion at present. They must rediscover them at Anfield, where Guardiola has never won in front of a crowd. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Liverpool v Manchester City, Sunday 4pm</em></p></li> </ul>

      "bodyText": "Veltman can lead Seagulls to second Fabian H\u00fcrzeler singled out Jo\u00ebl Veltman as one of the Premier League\u2019s most underrated players as Brighton prepare to face the bottom side, Southampton, on Friday. \u201cHe knows what to do to win games,\u201d H\u00fcrzeler said of the Netherlands defender, who has started all but one of Brighton\u2019s league games so far. Veltman \u2013 who spent eight years at Ajax before moving to the Amex in 2020 for \u00a3900,000 \u2013 is 11 months older than his manager and his experience has proved invaluable to his side in the absence of the captain, Lewis Dunk, through injury. He is expected to return against Russell Martin\u2019s side as Brighton attempt to record a fourth clean sheet of the league season, not to mention take the opportunity to move into second place before the rest of the weekend\u2019s fixtures. Ed Aarons Brighton v Southampton, Friday 8pm (all times GMT) A new Foxes era under Van Nistelrooy? Unencumbered by any previous association with Nottingham Forest, Ruud van Nistelrooy would probably be a popular appointment at the King Power Stadium, with all available evidence at the time of writing suggesting the Dutchman\u2019s first match in charge of Leicester could even be at the unlikely fortress that is the Gtech Community Stadium. During his spell as interim manager of Manchester United, Van Nistelrooy made no attempt to disguise his enthusiasm for the job and brings trophy-winning experience to Leicester having won the Dutch Cup in his sole season in charge of PSV Eindhoven. Tactically flexible with whatever players he has at his disposal, Van Nistelrooy\u2019s preferred style is to marry quick, attacking intent with defensive solidity and could quickly endear himself to a fanbase that took no time at all to tire of Steve Cooper\u2019s defensive approach. The approach he adopts against the side with the top flight\u2019s best home record will be intriguing. Barry Glendenning Brentford v Leicester, Saturday 3pm Palace keen for returns to boost chances While the performances have improved, Oliver Glasner will be concerned that the wins have yet to materialise for Crystal Palace. The Austrian will be hoping that Eberechi Eze can make his comeback against Newcastle after a hamstring injury that has sidelined him since the win over Aston Villa in the EFL Cup last month, with Adam Wharton also closing in on a return for a tricky run of fixtures over the next few weeks that includes trips to Ipswich and Brighton, and home games against Manchester City and Arsenal. A repeat of April\u2019s 2-0 win over Newcastle at Selhurst Park courtesy of two goals from Jean-Philippe Mateta would settle the nerves in south London, with Isma\u00efla Sarr likely to start for a fourth successive match after his first Premier League goal, against Villa last week. EA Crystal Palace v Newcastle, Saturday 3pm Old-school strikers at City Ground Having suffered back-to-back losses for the first time this season, Nottingham Forest welcome Ipswich to the City Ground and will be hoping to rediscover the defensive mojo that served them so well before their recent reverses. After conceding only seven goals in their opening 10 matches of the campaign, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s side have shipped six in their past two and, in Liam Delap, Forest\u2019s central defensive duo of Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic will have to deal with quite the handful. Strong as a bull and a terrific ball-carrier who is as fast as he is fearless, the Ipswich striker\u2019s battle against one of the league\u2019s most impressive defensive partnerships this season ought to make for compelling viewing. In Chris Wood, Forest have a comparatively elderly bulldozer of their own and with both centre-forwards in form and responsible for half their sides\u2019 combined Premier League goal tally of 28, this could be a classic battle of the big men. BG Nottingham Forest v Ipswich, Saturday 3pm Cunha gives improving Wolves bite Wolves\u2019 top-flight matches have seen 48 goals this season, more than any other team, but more important for Gary O\u2019Neil his side have proved the entertainers in recent weeks. Wolves have scored six goals across their past two matches, Matheus Cunha contributing half of them, but in truth their ability to score was never the primary source of concern. Only Mohamed Salah, Erling Haaland, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka this season have been involved in more goals than Cunha, who has provided seven goals and three assists. Wolves have kept a sole clean sheet in the league and, out of necessity, their captain, Mario Lemina, dropped to centre-back in the victory against Fulham last time out. With Santiago Bueno and Craig Dawson returning to fitness before hosting Bournemouth, suddenly Wolves are looking up. Andoni Iraola knows all about that, having kicked off the month by beating Manchester City. Ben Fisher Wolves v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm Soler offers ray of light for West Ham There was not unanimous agreement at West Ham over the decision to sign Carlos Soler on loan from Paris Saint-Germain last summer. Julen Lopetegui wanted the Spain midfielder but others were not as convinced. Some in the recruitment department had eyes on Chelsea\u2019s Carney Chukwuemeka. Yet Lopetegui got his way and the first sign that he might have made the right call came in West Ham\u2019s win at Newcastle on Monday. Soler had not looked up to the pace of the Premier League previously. He was taken off at half-time against Manchester United last month, but was impressive at St James\u2019 Park. Playing in a central role, Soler\u2019s quick thinking in possession made West Ham slicker on the ball. Lopetegui will hope that resurgence continues against Arsenal. Jacob Steinberg West Ham v Arsenal, Saturday 5.30pm Rotation of egos a test for Maresca It is a tricky balancing act for Enzo Maresca at Chelsea. Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez was out for a while, then in again. The midfielder has five assists in three games, cooling talk of a departure. For Maresca, though, it is not easy to keep every member of his squad happy. Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix looked miffed not to come off the bench against Arsenal early this month. The Portugal attacker made a surprise start against Leicester last week, with Pedro Neto unavailable, but what of Christopher Nkunku, Mykhailo Mudryk and Jadon Sancho? There have been noises in recent weeks about Nkunku getting frustrated over his lack of game time. Sancho, meanwhile, has not started in more than a month and Mudryk remains an enigma. Will there be opportunities against Aston Villa? Maresca has a lot of attacking options and things are going well at the moment, but managing the egos in his squad will challenge the Italian. JS Chelsea v Aston Villa, Sunday 1.30pm Amorim hopes to flower goal desert In this third game of a nascent Manchester United tenure, Ruben Amorim will hope to see firm signs of \u201cthe idea\u201d of playing he references taking hold in his players. Prime in this vision has to be creating more chances because United are arid when going forward, a desert before goal, Thursday night\u2019s 3-2 Europa League win against Bod\u00f8/Glimy notwithstanding. Sean Dyche sets his sides up pragmatically so Everton, only five points behind the hosts, will be an apt test of this. Dyche will plot to turn United over on their own patch, and with Old Trafford expectant that, finally, Amorim can be the man, this should be a riveting watch. Jamie Jackson Manchester United v Everton, Sunday 1.30pm Forster\u2019s time to shine against Fulham Tottenham have won six and lost five of their 12 Premier League matches this season, their only draw coming against Leicester in an opening game they might have lost but for two fine saves from Guglielmo Vicario. The Italian goalkeeper will be absent for the foreseeable future, his fractured ankle the large cloud that overshadowed Tottenham\u2019s fine win over Manchester City last weekend. The job of deputising for Vicario will presumably fall to Fraser Forster, a state of affairs that has prompted much agonising over the 36-year-old\u2019s ability \u2013 or perceived lack thereof \u2013 to play a style of football where he is required to ping short passes to his defenders. Ange Postecoglou has dismissed any such concerns, telling reporters it is a skill more related to mindset than ability. No doubt aware of concerns over the drop-off in quality between himself and Vicario, now is the time for Tottenham\u2019s hulking backup goalkeeper to demonstrate he can also be mentally imposing. BG Tottenham v Fulham, Sunday 1.30pm Threat level highest for Guardiola Arne Slot has brought the Midas touch to Liverpool but, of all the accomplishments in his remarkable start, none would surpass the likelihood of releasing Manchester City\u2019s four-year grip on the Premier League title on the first day of December. The prospect of going 11 points clear of the champions with an 18th win in 20 matches under Slot makes this a hugely anticipated and consequential moment for Liverpool. Yet the stakes are even higher for City. Five defeats in six games and a late collapse to draw against Slot\u2019s former club Feyenoord have drained belief from Pep Guardiola\u2019s players. Without Rodri they appear as fragile as Liverpool were in the aftermath of losing Virgil van Dijk to a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury in 2020. Josko Gvardiol\u2019s error-strewn performances are an added problem for Guardiola, who must decide whether to risk playing the Croatian against Mohamed Salah. City\u2019s famed powers of recovery are merely an illusion at present. They must rediscover them at Anfield, where Guardiola has never won in front of a crowd.
