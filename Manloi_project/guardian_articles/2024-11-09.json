Either way seems to work, and Liverpool are in extremely good nick as they head into the international break. Aston Villa by contrast have now lost their last four matches in all competitions, and have only taken six points from their last 18 in the league. However they looked dangerous all night against a team who aren\u2019t giving up many goals this season, and will surely take succour from their performance. The international break may have come at the right time for a team beginning to find out how the addition of a Champions League workload can affect a Premier League campaign.</p>  <figure

      "bodyText": "Andy Hunter was at Anfield this evening. Here\u2019s his verdict. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night! Unai Emery, in a calm and philosophical mood, speaks to TNT. \u201cGood evening \u2026 I\u2019m happy how we responded \u2026 Liverpool in transition are a very good team \u2026 they dominated but didn\u2019t have a lot of clear chances to score \u2026 we had chances to score in the first half, and the second half \u2026 we played more or less the way I want \u2026 of course we can improve \u2026 the league is very tight \u2026 a lot of teams performing very well \u2026 we want to keep the level we had last year \u2026 we are under this level but I have confidence \u2026 the players are performing very well \u2026 we faced Tottenham and Liverpool away \u2026 all very difficult \u2026 we have to keep the same positive mentality \u2026 we keep going.\u201d A very relaxed and smiley Arne Slot talks to TNT. \u201cSalah has the best numbers of all of our attackers \u2026 all have great numbers but he stands out \u2026 let\u2019s not forget the defensive run Diaz made to ensure we kept a clean sheet \u2026 it wasn\u2019t easy \u2026 like most of our games \u2026 they were not as aggressive as we thought \u2026 we were patient \u2026 still sometimes not patient enough \u2026 in general we had control \u2026 it is not the first time Liverpool have scored from breaks like that \u2026 we have to switch the play more often than we did \u2026 in pressing we were outplayed too easily \u2026 we have to do this better \u2026 we are really happy that after a difficult period most of our players stayed fit \u2026 we have had some tough tests \u2026 I look after the international breaks and again they are tough! \u2026 so it is going to be a tough season in general \u2026 margins are small \u2026 now we have a bit of a margin, but I think Mikel [Arteta] said they have had many difficult away games already and had to play with ten men \u2026 we had difficult games too, but we have many challenges to come.\u201d Under Arne Slot, Liverpool had previously developed a habit of stuttering their way through first halves, then pressing on the accelerator after the break. Tonight the pattern was reversed, with his team playing with Klopp-esque intensity in the first, then taking things slow during the second. Either way seems to work, and Liverpool are in extremely good nick as they head into the international break. Aston Villa by contrast have now lost their last four matches in all competitions, and have only taken six points from their last 18 in the league. However they looked dangerous all night against a team who aren\u2019t giving up many goals this season, and will surely take succour from their performance. The international break may have come at the right time for a team beginning to find out how the addition of a Champions League workload can affect a Premier League campaign. Alexis Mac Allister speaks to TNT. \u201cA very big win against a very good team \u2026 we dominated \u2026 we played a very good game \u2026 the goals came in counters but overall the team played a very good game \u2026 we are happy with it \u2026 we know we are top but there are still a lot of games so we will take it step by step \u2026 we were watching the game \u2026 happy for Brighton \u2026 I have special feelings for them \u2026 very grateful \u2026 but we are not thinking about other teams, we are just focusing on ourselves \u2026 if you are five points ahead them it means something \u2026 but we have to go step by step \u2026 if you were to ask me before the season started, I wouldn\u2019t say we were candidates but now it looks like that \u2026 we are going to keep working and keep getting better \u2026 [Mohamed Salah] is so good and so important \u2026 for the team and the club \u2026 he is a legend here \u2026 you know he\u2019s going to deliver and get the numbers \u2026 we are happy he is playing for us.\u201d Liverpool go five points clear at the top of the Premier League. 90 min +3: Liverpool are seeing this out easily now. The same couldn\u2019t be said before Salah\u2019s clincher. Villa have pushed them hard. Liverpool stood firm. 90 min +2: A free kick for Villa out on the right. McGinn swings it to the far stick, where Kelleher claims and launches a quick counter. But the pinball game on the halfway line doesn\u2019t go in Salah\u2019s favour this time. 90 min +1: On TNT, Lucy Ward names Mohamed Salah as her player of the match. \u201cThe match-winner,\u201d she explains. \u201cThat\u2019s all there is to say.\u201d 90 min: There will be four additional minutes. 88 min: The Liverpool fans sing their new song about Arne Slot. All of them together are nearly as loud as Jurgen Klopp during his farewell do last season. 87 min: Maatsen dribbles hard down the left and reaches the byline, but his cutback isn\u2019t all that, and Konate is able to clear. Villa reminding Liverpool quickly that this game still isn\u2019t over quite yet. 86 min: Van Dijk helps Torres up. Endo comes on for Mac Allister. 85 min: There\u2019s a VAR check on a potential penalty at the other end, before the goal, but Torres ran into Gravenberch rather than the other way round. The goal stands! McGinn, Duran and Torres stroke passes down the left and win a throw. Villa have enjoyed 75 percent of possession during the last five minutes. They fling the ball into the mixer. Torres goes over, but Liverpool break upfield. Salah wins a 50-50 on the halfway line, makes it all the way down the inside-right channel and into the box, draws Martinez, and despite having Diaz free in the middle, gives the keeper eyes before flipping over him and in! 82 min: \u2026 then up the other end, Duran prepares to slam home a left-wing cross, forcing Van Dijk to hook behind for a corner. This one causes Liverpool trouble, Philogene nearly bundling home at the far stick, but the ball loops over the bar. Kelleher had it covered. Just. This game is really in the balance, with Villa giving Liverpool a serious workout. 81 min: \u2026 and Liverpool counter from a Villa corner again! The hosts flood upfield. Diaz shapes to shoot from the edge of the box only for Konsa to slide in and somehow hold off both Diaz and Szoboszlai! What a block! 80 min: Tielemans swings the corner into a crowded six-yard box. Kelleher comes to collect, but Konate eyebrows it away for another corner instead. Maatsen and McGinn play this one short, and earn another off Robertson. Maatsen to swing this one in long from the right. 79 min: Rogers works his way down the left to earn another Villa corner. Tielemans trots across to take. 78 min: From the resulting free kick, Villa nearly beat Liverpool at their own game, countering at speed, Philogene considering a shot from the edge of the box. Diaz nips back from a long way out to nick the ball away, just in time. The home fans applaud his efforts warmly. 77 min: Kamara is booked for grabbing a handful of Gravenberch\u2019s shirt. 75 min: Szoboszlai barrels down the right and looks for Gakpo at the far stick with a low cross. Konsa fresh-airs a clearance \u2013 or does he deliberately dummy? Either way, it flummoxes Gakpo, who is surprised into missing the ball himself. All very odd. A big chance, though. 74 min: \u2026 and here they come. Digne and Onana off, Maatsen and Kamara on. 73 min: It\u2019s all a bit scrappy. Villa prepare some more changes. 71 min: The free kick\u2019s hit long. Gakpo wafts the ball back into the mixer from the left, but that\u2019s easy pickings for Martinez. Liverpool soon come again at Villa, though, Gakpo this time looking far more threatening as he advances down the left wing. He cuts infield only to get his shot all wrong. Into the stand it disappears. 70 min: Another long Van Dijk pass, this time down the right, is brought down by Salah, who is then slammed to the ground by McGinn. A free kick that Szoboszlai will take, with pretty much everyone else in the Villa box. 68 min: Van Dijk rakes a long pass down the left flank for Diaz, who should break free into the box but takes a heavy touch and can only hook harmlessly into the centre from the byline. Easy for Villa to mop up. 66 min: Both teams make a double change. Liverpool replace Jones and Ayler Nunez with Gakpo and Szoboszlai, while Villa swap out Watkins and Bailey for Duran and Philogene. 64 min: Mac Allister swings the free kick long towards Diaz on the left-hand edge of the six-yard box. Diaz wins a header, though not in any meaningful way. Goal kick. 63 min: Liverpool pass and probe, hither and yon. Eventually Watkins clips Bradley out on the right. Free kick. 61 min: Liverpool launch a rare second-half attack. Salah and Diaz take turns to fail to get shots away. Nunez eventually has a dig, but his low swerving drive eventually goes straight into Martinez\u2019s arms. 60 min: Emery continues to go at the fourth official. He\u2019s not happy at all. You\u2019ve certainly seen penalties given for less. But nobody knows anything these days. 58 min: Digne delivers, Bradley clears. Tielemans complains about a Bradley tug on the shirt of Torres. VAR checks, but with the referee having previously waved play on, there\u2019s not enough in it to change the decision. Unai Emery certainly does not agree. He rants away on the touchline. 57 min: Anfield is significantly quieter as a result, and the anxiety is palpable when Bradley upends Watkins out on the Villa left. Free kick. Villa load the Liverpool box. 56 min: Some more slower Slot-style control. Liverpool have enjoyed 75 percent possession since the restart, though it\u2019s Villa who have looked more threatening on the whole. A work in progress, albeit one that could go five points clear this evening. 54 min: Salah\u2019s loose backpass nearly sets up Rogers and Watkins on the edge of the Liverpool box. Bradley comes across to snuff out the danger and hammer clear. This match is properly in the balance at the moment. 52 min: Liverpool have launched a couple of Kloppesque counters this evening. Now they revert to Slotball, patiently passing it around the middle to establish some control 50 min: So yeah, Darwin Nunez as free-jazz phenomenon, then. If anything\u2019s the soundtrack to his style of play, it\u2019s surely this from the Albert Ayler Trio\u2019s 1965 classic Spiritual Unity. Ayler \u201cbarges ferociously\u201d through the track, according to our man John Fordham, which sounds about right. 48 min: Diaz and Robertson combine down the left. Robertson whips in a cross. Nunez meets it, six yards out, and has to score, but blasts his header wide left. Big miss. 47 min: Konate stays down, holding his knee, but soon afterwards gets back to his feet, albeit gingerly. He and Liverpool, their lead somehow still intact for now, play on. 45 min 24 sec: Villa should be level. Digne pumps long down the left. Konate\u2019s header back out is weak, dropping to Rogers, who powers into the box, opens his body, and, like Nunez before him, slaps a shot wide right. Villa get the second half underway. They\u2019re kicking towards the Kop now. No changes, even though Digne had limped his way off the pitch at the end of the first half. Half-time reading. Ed Aarons gives his verdict on the latest shock to the champions\u2019 system. That\u2019s the end of an eventful half. Somewhere, in a parallel universe, four goals have been scored from Villa corners, two for Liverpool on the break by Nunez, two for Villa through flashing close-range headers from Onana and Carlos. But here we are. It\u2019s been an entertaining, open game. Expect more goals, and plenty of fun, in the second half. Saturday night\u2019s alright. 45 min +4: Liverpool stroke it around patiently at the back, before eventually breaking clear of the press and tearing off upfield. Salah slips Diaz into acres down the left. Diaz feeds Robertson on the overlap. Robertson crosses low, where Nunez and Jones wait to tap home \u2026 but Torres arrives just in time to hook away from danger. So close to a second! 45 min +3: Tielemans is booked for a cynical tug on an in-flight Jones. 45 min +2: \u2026 to be replaced by Villa\u2019s captain McGinn. 45 min +1: The board says three additional minutes; there will surely be more now, as Ramsey slowly limps off \u2026 45 min: Salah dribbles gracefully down the right and has a couple of chances to deliver a cross, but overthinks it, and eventually runs the ball out of play for a goal kick. Before the game can restart, Ramsey goes down holding his hamstring. 43 min: Nope. It\u2019s cut back to Gravenberch, who flays a shot into the Kop. Villa\u2019s corners delivering much more bang for your buck. 42 min: Salah takes a heavy touch in the Villa box, but Ramsey, attempting to snaffle the loose ball, has a clank of his own to concede a cheap corner. All the action has come, one way or another, from Villa corners so far. How about a Liverpool one? 41 min: Nunez cuts in from the left and lashes a low, hard drive straight at Martinez, who handles well. 40 min: Villa are giving Liverpool a good game here, and the home fans try to get their team going again. Anfield remains a cauldron of noise. \u201cIf David Coote is the most idiosyncratic Premier League referee, then he\u2019s a perfect match for Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s free-jazz interpretation of being a top-flight striker,\u201d argues Andy (not that one) Flintoff, not inaccurately. 38 min: \u2026 Carlos flashes another header goalwards from the same position as Onana before him. Kelleher makes a point-blank stop on his line, Gravenberch puts his body in the way to ensure the loose ball isn\u2019t forced home, then the ball\u2019s half cleared. It\u2019s then swung in deep from the right, and Digne can only ripple the side netting with Kelleher on walkabout. Three huge chances for Villa in not much more than 60 seconds. 37 min: Rogers forces another corner down the right. Digne takes. Onana rises at the near stick and eyebrows a powerful header goalwards. Kelleher tips over. Then from the next corner \u2026 36 min: Digne crosses dangerously from the left. Bailey nearly gets onto it at the far stick, but he\u2019s one yard short of connecting. Villa are creating chances. 34 min: Rogers is booked for a clumsy late slide on Van Dijk. It wasn\u2019t the best challenge, but it wasn\u2019t the worst either, so that seems about right. You can depend on David Coote! 33 min: Salah floats a cross-cum-shot in from the right, the result of another Villa giveaway. Martinez claims the ball and issues some beneficial advice to his team-mates in the animated style. 32 min: Another Villa corner \u2026 and it should be another Liverpool goal. The hosts tear clear again, and Nunez is sent through from the halfway line! He enters the box, opens his body, and with only Martinez to beat, lashes a wild shot high over the bar and wide right. K\u00e1ri Tulinius must be in heaven right now. 31 min: TNT Sport have just shown a replay of the goal which includes referee David Coote gesticulating in a way which suggests he doesn\u2019t think Bailey\u2019s challenge on Salah was even a foul. So there\u2019d have been no red had Nunez missed. You have to wonder about Coote sometimes. He\u2019s by some distance the most, eh, idiosyncratic official in the Premier League. 29 min: Salah rolls a pass across the face of the Villa box, teeing up an opportunity for Diaz, who is in fine goalscoring form after his midweek hat-trick against the champions of Germany \u2026 but this time takes a fresh-air swipe. Ah the vicissitudes of top-flight sport. 27 min: Nunez nearly doubles K\u00e1ri Tulinius\u2019s joy, but can\u2019t rise high enough to head home Salah\u2019s cross from the right. Had the ball been delivered a couple of inches lower, Nunez was surely bulging the net from six yards. 25 min: Watkins has a whack from the right-hand edge of the Liverpool D. He drags the shot harmlessly wide left. \u201cI\u2019m not a Liverpool fan, but the Premier League is more fun when Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez scores goals,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cIt\u2019s also fun when he inexplicably misses sitters, so I guess he just makes football more fun by existing.\u201d 24 min: Alexander-Arnold goes down, and can\u2019t continue. A tweaked hamstring maybe. Bradley comes on in his place. England squad re-jig coming up, you\u2019d have thought. 22 min: Watkins tries to respond quickly by taking on Konate down the left. He enters the box only to be shouldered powerfully off the ball. He swan-dives preposterously, looking for a penalty that\u2019s never going to be awarded. Indeed the referee awards a free kick against Watkins \u2026 but doesn\u2019t book him for simulation. That\u2019s all a bit weird. 21 min: Bailey is very fortunate that Nunez scored, because he was surely off otherwise. Tielemans\u2019 delivery is no good. Liverpool counter at speed, with nearly all of the Villa team stranded upfield in their box. Van Dijk launches down the right channel for Salah, who barrels clear. Bailey takes him down but the play is waved on, Nunez latching onto the loose ball, rounding Martinez on the right, and slamming into the net! What a finish that was. 19 min: Tielemans can\u2019t get a shot away from the edge of the Liverpool box, but the hosts are panicking a bit, and Konate needlessly shanks a simple clearance backwards and out for a corner. Tielemans to take. 17 min: Villa again with the slow restart, with Martinez cast as pantomime villain. They\u2019re getting under the skin of the home fans, which is surely a big part of it. This sort of thing doesn\u2019t always go well for Liverpool, as anyone old enough to remember the Gerrard slip game can attest. Jose and Chelsea did a proper number on Anfield that famous afternoon. 15 min: Konsa embarks on a dribbling odyssey down the right, and reaches the edge of the Liverpool box before running slap-bang into Robertson. Villa soon come again, Ramsey nearly making space to shoot on the left, Tielemans then crossing deep for Bailey to head over. Villa right in this now, after a slow start, and looking dangerous. 13 min: Those two Villa attacks have quietened the Liverpool crowd a bit. Task one completed by the visitors. 11 min: Villa show in attack for the first time. Watkins picks up possession on the left-hand corner of the Liverpool box, opens his body and curls a decent effort towards the top-right corner but over the bar. Kelleher had it covered. Villa soon come again, Ramsey advancing down the left channel. Digne makes a dummy run, which Alexander-Arnold follows. Suddenly there\u2019s a huge gap! Ramsey enters the box and shoots, but the ball\u2019s blocked the moment it leaves his boot, Gravenberch sliding across. That\u2019s fine last-ditch defending by the midfielder. 9 min: The corner comes in, and the whistle goes as a result of Liverpool\u2019s over-enthusiastic pushing and shoving. Then Martinez and Torres take an absurd amount of time over the restart. This is already getting old. At least they didn\u2019t somehow manage to concede a penalty this time. Mings on the bench, well out of harm\u2019s way. 8 min: Jones rolls down the right channel in the hope of releasing Mac Allister. Digne is forced to telescope a leg to divert out for the first corner of the game. Robertson to take. 7 min: Gravenberch spins Tielemans and is clipped for his trouble. Villa may already be approaching the point where the next one earns a booking. Liverpool get the ball rolling, Diaz juggling his way down the left and dinking infield, but his cross doesn\u2019t find Mac Allister, waiting six yards out to head home. 5 min: Alexander-Arnold slips Salah into space down the right. Salah drifts into the box, shapes to curl towards the top left, as he so often does, but instead switches and aims for the bottom right instead. Torres is wise to the grift and extends a leg to block. Great play all round. 4 min: Konsa takes an age over a throw. A bit early for this sort of carry-on. \u201cSending big hugs commiserations to Mary Waltz as the skies darken over there,\u201d begins Charles Antaki. \u201cNot that we\u2019re especially sunny over here, but at least we don\u2019t have the drumrolls and the frightening music on the soundtrack. May the MBM be a pleasant distraction. Also Everton, but one mustn\u2019t hope for too much.\u201d 3 min: Salah dinks the ball past Digne to advance down the right, and is tugged back. The referee shows no interest in giving a free kick. The former Everton full-back getting away with one there. 2 min: Liverpool on the front foot immediately. Salah floats a pass down the right for Nunez, who shields the ball before falling over in the box with Carlos behind him. There\u2019s minimal contact, and Nunez was looking for it, so the referee\u2019s not interested. A muted claim fizzles out quickly. Now back to that beautiful football noise \u2026 and it\u2019s Liverpool who get the ball rolling. They\u2019re kicking towards the Kop in this first half. Once the last strains of You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone disappear into the night sky, a lone bugler plays the Last Post, the night before Remembrance Sunday. Exquisitely played, met with perfect silence, then a warm ovation. The teams are out! Liverpool all red, Aston Villa all white. A bit like Real Madrid have come to town, three weeks early. A cracking few-pints-in atmosphere at Anfield, which reportedly rocked during the second half against Brighton last weekend. It\u2019s usually one louder when the lights are on. The Villa support making their fair contribution to the noise as well. Here\u2019s to everyone keeping it up. Pre-match postbag. \u201cI\u2019m one of many Liverpool fans who are growing to love Slot\u2019s mixture of confidence and clarity when dealing with the media. Latest example being your quote from him on facing teams who come with a specific plan. Klopp was refreshingly human when he arrived; Slot seems to have gone one further managing to be both reserved, warm, good humoured and illuminating (up to a point). Let\u2019s see if his demeanour survives when we inevitably hit a bump in the road, but for now I\u2019m enjoying it immensely\u201d \u2013 Tony Barr \u201cOne key to Liverpool\u2019s success is their masterful use of space in the midfield. Case in point: Mac Allister. No, not MacAllister. Mac. Space. Allister. Just enough room to slot the ball through and break the opponents\u2019 line\u201d \u2013 Peter Oh \u201cThe night time kick off is terrible for the last train back to Brum is at half nine. However, what better excuse to experience the delights of Bold Street, Matthew Street and Concert Square in what the locals call the greatest city in the world?\u201d \u2013 Bill Preston \u201cGreetings from Occupied Trump America. PL football and Guardian MBM are part of my anti-depressant regime to get through the next four years. It made another so-so Everton performance this morning seem OK. Liverpool-AV should be a banger\u201d \u2013 Mary Waltz Unai Emery speaks to TNT. \u201cWe are managing every player \u2026 we are confident with Ollie Watkins \u2026 even if he is not scoring he is successful in everything we need \u2026 he is very important not only for scoring goals but everything else as well \u2026 Jhon Duran is getting comfortable \u2026 hopefully we can use both \u2026 our support is fantastic \u2026 we are playing for them.\u201d Tonight\u2019s 5.30pm kick-off has just finished \u2026 and, now then, how about this for a result \u2026 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 2-1 Manchester City. That\u2019s the four-in-a-row champions\u2019 fourth defeat in a row in all competitions. City haven\u2019t been on such a miserable run since the spring of 2006, when Stuart Pearce was manager and Micah Richards was an 18-year-old prodigy just breaking through. That run eventually stretched to six defeats on the spin, and when they snapped that sorry sequence they went and lost their next four as well. Don\u2019t expect things to pan out like that again this time, even if their next three games are against Spurs, Feyenoord and \u2026 Liverpool, who now have a chance to stretch their lead at the top of the Premier League table to five points. Slot also goes some way to explaining why Liverpool have been slow starters in most matches this season, picking up speed significantly in the second half. \u201cThere are many things we can do better \u2026 the threshold is quite high for us \u2026 I see that certain things are done better by other teams than us \u2026 you wonder which ones? \u2026 that\u2019s what we talk about during the week \u2026 hopefully we keep improving \u2026 it\u2019s necessary in a difficult league like this \u2026 Xabi Alonso has played the same style for one, two years I think \u2026 he came here playing Boniface as a left winger \u2026 that is a compliment to our players \u2026 every team that comes here feels they need a special plan \u2026 the good thing for us is that\u2019s mostly the first time they play it, so you could argue it\u2019s not an advantage for them to do that \u2026 but they feel it\u2019s an advantage \u2026 in the first half we have to adjust a bit \u2026 then it\u2019s a disadvantage for us that we have only worked together for three or four months, because if you work with a team for three or four years, you\u2019ve faced every system \u2026 everyone just knows what to do \u2026 sometimes now we need half-time for that \u2026 but it\u2019s a matter of time before we\u2019re adjusting faster than that.\u201d Arne Slot speaks to TNT Sports. \u201cEveryone has mainly focused on our results, which have been good \u2026 you also enjoy your time if you work with people that you really like and the staff and everybody at Liverpool welcomed me and my staff a lot \u2026 if you then also have the results then you enjoy your time at the club \u2026 I expected Luis Diaz to do well but to do so well was even for me a bit of a surprise \u2026 if you have four attackers like we have, you are always a bit tempted, who should you play? \u2026 Cody has played so many games that we thought these three should be the best pick \u2026 we will know after the game if that was the right choice to make \u2026 in every decision a lot goes into it \u2026 confidence \u2026 how much they have played recently \u2026 this is now the second time Curtis has been lined up \u2026 Macca had some rest in the League Cup game \u2026 Szoboszlai would have been a good pick as well \u2026 ideally we will start the game like we end it \u2026 but that is easier said than done \u2026 our opponent is also really fresh when the game starts.\u201d Liverpool make two changes to their starting XI from the 4-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday. Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Andrew Robertson replace Cody Gakpo and Kostas Tsimikas. Aston Villa make four changes after their 1-0 defeat at Club Brugge on Wednesday. Pau Torres, Lucas Digne, Amadou Onana and Jacob Ramsey come in for Ian Maatsen, Boubacar Kamara, the unfortunate Tyrone Mings, and captain John McGinn. Liverpool: Kelleher, Alexander-Arnold, Konate, van Dijk, Robertson, Gravenberch, Mac Allister, Salah, Jones, Diaz, Nunez. Subs: Jaros, Gomez, Endo, Szoboszlai, Gakpo, Tsimikas, Quansah, Morton, Bradley. Aston Villa: Martinez, Konsa, Diego Carlos, Torres, Digne, Onana, Tielemans, Bailey, Rogers, Ramsey, Watkins. Subs: Olsen, Mings, McGinn, Duran, Buendia, Philogene-Bidace, Maatsen, Bogarde, Kamara. Referee: David Coote (Nottinghamshire) VAR: Paul Tierney (Lancashire) Liverpool, top of the table at home and in Europe, and with 14 wins from their first 16 games in all competitions this season, are on a roll. Aston Villa were going pretty well for a while back there too, until letting in a last-gasp equaliser at home to Bournemouth, since when they\u2019ve lost three on the bounce, albeit in three different competitions. But despite all that, Unai Emery\u2019s out-of-sorts side remain sixth in the Premier League, bang-slap in the thick of things, so tonight\u2019s showdown at Anfield still qualifies as a top-of-the-table clash. There are usually goals when these folk meet, too \u2013 recent 4-1 and 6-0 wins for Liverpool, a 5-0 and that 7-2 for Villa, a 3-3 draw last time out \u2013 and so while tonight\u2019s kick-off time is a tad weird, the anticipation levels are nevertheless bubbling up nicely. Can you feel it? To borrow a line from the Great Danish Songbook: Saturday night, the air is getting hot, dee dee na na na. Kick-off is at 8pm GMT. It\u2019s on!",

      "bodyText": "A 32-year-old man has been remanded in custody after allegations he murdered a teenager whose body was found in bushland in Sydney\u2019s south-west. Jacob Greig appeared before the Parramatta bail court on Sunday where he was formally refused bail. The 15-year-old\u2019s body was found in bushland in Wilton at about 7.25am on Saturday. Following a public appeal for information, Grieg was arrested after presenting himself at Narellan police station shortly after 4pm, New South Wales police said. He was charged with murder and is expected to next appear in court by audio-visual link on 8 January. Police will allege the man stabbed the teen during a physical altercation. Police believe roughly a dozen young campers may have gathered on Friday evening near the area where the body was found. Acting Supt Tim Calman said state crime officers were called to the location to help as there were \u201ca lot of moving parts\u201d. His family had been notified of his death, Calman said, and were being supported by police. \u201cWe put our thoughts out to the family,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be doing it tough this afternoon.\u201d Police are appealing for anyone with knowledge of the incident or dash cam or mobile footage to come forward, as well as anyone who might have been in the area since 6pm on Friday. Police on Saturday confirmed the boy was local to the Picton area. \u2013 with Australian Associated Press",

Bayala also said there could be further amendments to the criminal code \u201cto follow the vision and the guidelines given by the head of state, Capt Ibrahim Traor\u00e9\u201d, who seized power in a September 2022 coup. In May this year, Burkina Faso\u2019s military government announced it would extend junta rule for another five years despite Traor\u00e9, the country\u2019s ruler, pledging that he would restore the civilian government by 1 July. Instead, Traor\u00e9\u2019s government passed a bill that month that included plans to ban homosexuality. Amnesty International has found the use of the death penalty is rising in Africa, \u201crecorded executions more than tripled and recorded death sentences increased significantly by 66%\u201d, it said in October. Conversely, Amnesty said: \u201cTwenty-four countries across sub-Saharan Africa have abolished the death penalty for all crimes while two additional countries have abolished it for ordinary crimes only.\u201d \u201cKenya and Zimbabwe currently have bills tabled to abolish the death penalty for all crimes, while Gambia \u2026 has commenced a constitutional amendment process that will \u2026 effectively abolish the death penalty,\u201d it said.",

Occasionally clubs do enjoy a meteoric and unexpected rise \u2013 a Brighton, a Brentford, a Swansea \u2013 after which they will be praised for their far-sighted management, for having a philosophy or for being smarter than the system.

      "bodyText": "A fabulous end to the tournament, a gripping, toe-to-toe contest between two outstanding rising stars. Today the force was with Gauff, there will, I\u2019m sure, be many more skirmishes. A dream match for the WTA too, who took a big gamble bringing the tournament to Riyadh \u2013 sportswashing, money, et al. Tumani\u2019s match report will land shortly, but time for me to say goodbye. Thank you for your messages and have a lovely evening. And, sorry to be slow on these, hello Andrew Benton in Hong Kong. \u201dI imagine Zheng has the weight of a nation on her shoulders, if they\u2019re still awake. I agree with Becky Taylor - TMS could become Tennis Match Special for some of the top games, aside from Wimbledon.\u201d You heard it here first. The commentators are blown away by Gauff\u2019s athleticism and ability to just stay in the rallies. Those endless service games of Zheng\u2019s, as Gauff sprinted for every point, must have gnawed away at her inner confidence. So a root beer for Chris Lawrence from San Francisco who was \u201clooking for some good news coming out of the US this week.\u201d Confetti falls on the finallists like cherry blossom on an extremely windy day, they get bouquets too and pose for yet more photos. Gauff: \u201cFirstly I want to congratulate Qinwen on a sensational season and your team too who are very nice and its been a great competition. I want to thank the Saudi federation for putting on a great tournament, its my first time in Saudi Arabia, I\u2019ve had more fun than I imagined and thanks for coming to watch a women\u2019s tennis competition. I want to thank everyone who put this together and my team, its been a long season but I want to say thank you, its been so much fun, and my family, and the man above for allowing me to be here.\u201d Extremely eloquent 20 year old! Zheng:\u201cI wasnt to say thanks for everyone for coming tonight, thanks to the Saudi federation for a great tournament and all the staff who are working here, and thanks to my team who try to keep me healthy. Lastly I want to say congratulations to the Champion, I think you have a great future.\u201d The Billie-Jean King trophy sits looking beautiful while we get introduced to the dignitaries, the WTA president, the Saudi women\u2019s tennis president, the deputy minister (?) of sport, and the tournament director (all women). The umpire gets her prize, and Zheng Qinwen is presented with her runner\u2019s-up shield. Tim Henman: \u201cWhen you think about what Gauff has achieved in such a short space of time and how much she can improve on \u2013 it is incredible to think how she is going to get better\u201d. And the cameras swing around to Zheng who is sitting silently and alone while the music blares and everyone prepares for the ceremony. What a game, what a comeback! Gauff embraces her mum and her team, that Championship winning shot on the run resonant of her never-day-die attitude. Third set: Zheng 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (7-2) Gauff Despite Zheng taking the momentum into the tiebreak, a nerveless Gauff powers 6-0 up. Zheng serves big to haul a point onto the board, a second as Gauff hits long, but she can\u2019t drag them all back and Gauff is soon on her back rolling about in delight! She shakes hands with Zheng \u2013 then bounces for joy. The first American champion since Serena Williams ten years ago and the youngest in twenty years. Third set: Zheng 6-3, 4-6, 6-6 Gauff (*denotes next server) A tie-break is needed to sort this fabulous match out. Third set: Zheng* 6-3, 4-6, 6-6. Gauff (*denotes next server) An error-strewn first few points, and Zheng\u2019s forehand slides into the net to give Gauff two break, set and Championship points. A killer forehand pulls back one, a sprinting forehand another, a bold one another. Gauff flies wild and we go into the tiebreak! Third set: Zheng* 6-3, 4-6, 5-6. Gauff (*denotes next server) Zheng slots a volley away at the net to take the game to 30-30, and somehow gets a racket on a forehand which Gauff sends wide for break point. Gauff pulls back \u2013 these two are absolutely showing anyone who doubted women\u2019s sport what supreme athletes they are. Zheng hits long to give Gauff the advantage, and again \u2013 and Gauff noses in front. How the worm turns \u2013 Zheng now to serve to stay in the match. Third set: Zheng 6-3, 4-6, 5-5. Gauff* (*denotes next server) A coursing cross court forehand from Zheng wins the first point but Gauff comes back to win a scintillating rally. Zheng wobbles, to go 30-15 down, draws level with a peachy forehand, then loses the battle of the ground strokes to enable Gauff to break back for the second time in the set. An email! Hello Becky Taylor. \u201cThanks for the live blog. It\u2019s a shame the finals are even in Saudi Arabia but it sounds like it\u2019s a good match. \u201cI do wish, with all this wealth fund money sloshing around that someone would ask the tournament to organise proper radio coverage.\u201d Totally agree! Third set: Zheng* 6-3, 4-6, 5-4. Gauff (*denotes next server) Zheng\u2019s backhand advances, pounces. But Gauff isn\u2019t dead yet, a killer serve evens things at 30-30, then a lucky net cord falls in her favour. Wins the game when Zheng hits wide. Now Zheng gets the chance to serve for the Championship. Third set: Zheng 6-3, 4-6, 5-3 Gauff * (*denotes next server) Ooof, Gauff is furious with herself for fluffing a back hand at 15-15. A perfectly timed 12th ace of the tournament from Zheng, who has suddenly found back her mojo, takes her to 40-15, and then Gauff splats a forehand long to have to serve to stay in the match. Third set: Zheng* 6-3, 4-6, 4-3 Gauff (*denotes next server) A mighty cross court forehand, then a winning backhand, Zheng is suddenly fired up. She has three break points and grabs the first with both hands \u2013 closing out the game to 15. Third set: Zheng 6-3, 4-6, 3-3 Gauff* (*denotes next server) Zheng clinging onto her service games, unable to shut them down as Gauff has been. But a whippy forehand into the corner takes her to 30-0. Gauff pulls back to 30-30, but this time Zheng holds on. Third set: Zheng* 6-3, 4-6, 2-3 Gauff (*denotes next server) What a hold to love. Wow! Gauff takes the lead in the second set. Third set: Zheng 6-3, 4-6, 2-2 Gauff *(*denotes next server) An 187kph ace from Zheng takes the game to 40-15, Gauff draws back to 30-40 as has become the norm, and then to deuce. A wild forehand from Zheng hands Gauff advantage, and a sprint to the net on the right and a dive to the net on the left in an astonishing few seconds wins her the game. Third set: Zheng* 6-3, 4-6, 2-1 Gauff (*denotes next server) Some fabulous placement by Gauff takes her to 30-30, but she and Zheng take it in turns to go long. Zheng pulls back to deuce when she pounces on a Gauff drop shot. And wins advantage when Gauff fires one into the net. A well-timed ace pulls back to deuce. Exhausting, absorbing tennis. One, two deuces, until Gauff pulls out a on point serve to close down the game. Third set: Zheng 6-3, 4-6, 2-0 Gauff* (*denotes next server) The winter sun has long slipped away in Manchester, but it is bright under the lights at Riyadh. Zheng a bit wild with a couple of her shots, and then Gauff flies into a return which lands long. From 30-30, Gauff ges a break point when Zheng goes long. But then it is Gauff\u2019s turn as she hits long in a high-wire rally, the clock ticks over to 2 hours, and Zheng holds onto her serve. Third set: Zheng* 6-3, 4-6, 1-0 Gauff (*denotes next server) So we roll into a final set. Zheng wins the first point as Gauff hangs one wide \u2013 and it flies away to love forty with a pin-point forehand from Zheng. She has three break points, and loses all of them. But takes the game anyway as Gauff double faults. Second set: Zheng 6-3, 4-6 Gauff *(*denotes next server) Gauff slides and slips trying to return the first point. But Zheng slides behind the baseline on the second point. The two youngest players in the WTA finals producing scandalously good tennis here. A brilliant one-legged recovery shot from Gauff gets her back into the point \u2013 which she wins to sit on two set points. Zheng sends a backhand into the net and Gauff levels the match! Second set: Zheng* 6-3, 4-5 Gauff (*denotes next server) Gauff\u2019s response to going 0-15 down is an ace. A couple of mistakes by Zheng and Gauff has two set points. Zheng pulls one of them back with a steaming cross court backhand, the second with a forehand down the line to take the game to deuce. Powered by determination, she then breaks back. Second set: Zheng 6-3, 3-5 Gauff* (*denotes next server) A Zheng drop shot \u201cnot a safe choice here at altitude\u201d hits the net and bounces safely \u2013 she apologises. Then she throws in an ace, A rollicking rally follows \u2013 they\u2019re both so outrageously fit. A Zheng backhand flies wide and Gauff has another break point. When Zheng hits long, that\u2019s four games in a row for Gauff \u2013 who now serves for the set to level the match. Second set: Zheng* 6-3, 3-4 Gauff (*denotes next server) Gauff\u2019s nine points in a row ends when she hits out. But she powers on \u2013 an ace gives her game point and she moves ahead for the first time in the match. Three games in a row for Gauff and momentum changed! Second set: Zheng 6-3, 3-3 Gauff* (*denotes next server) Says Tim Henman on Gauff \u201cShe\u2019s just got to maintain the belief that she will have opportunities, this is going to be a mental battle as much as a physical one, to maintain belief that she will get her opportunity.\u201d A drop shot followed by a backhand pass puts her 15-0 up on the Gauff serve. A perfect return to 30-0, a backhand volley at the net to 40-0 and suddenly she\u2019s broken back! Second set: Zheng* 6-3, 3-2 Gauff (*denotes next server) In the swish of a curtain, and to the delight of the crowd, Gauff takes the game to love. Second set: Zheng 6-3, 3-1 Gauff* (*denotes next server) A fizzing backhand from Gauff off the Zheng second serve kisses the line. A double fault from Zheng \u2013 she has lost at least two points in every service game so far \u2013 but she pounces to win the game. Second set: Zheng* 6-3, 2-1 Gauff (*denotes next server) Late November 5th fireworks are going off somewhere outside my window, while Gauff is suddenly playing like a slightly wayward Catherine wheel \u2013 shots flying about. But a ferocious cross court back hand pulls her to 40-30 and an ace wins the game. Second set: Zheng 6-3, 2-0 Gauff* (*denotes next server) Pad, pad, pad, bounces Zheng with her ball as she prepares to serve, pad, pad, pad. Gauff\u2019s body language slumps but she pulls back to 30-40, and then Zheng wins with an ace \u2013 her first of the match. Second set: Zheng* 6-3, 1-0 Gauff (*denotes next server) Just the \u00a32.5 million for winning this game, remember. The players pause between sets, Gauff opens a box and picks out something that looks like a handful of nuts. She immediately goes 15-0 down on her serve, but pulls back when Zheng feathers into the net and is so furious she wangs her foot with her racket. But she pounces on a pie from Gauff, and from deuce, powers on, winning a break point \u2013 and breaking immediately in the second set. First set: Zheng 6-3 Gauff* (*denotes next server) Gauff examines her racket, but is quickly 30-0 down on the Zheng serve. Zheng is not happy as she returns one into the net, muttering as she goes to wipe her face and racket on a towel. She hits long and is suddenly 40-30 down. But Gauff\u2019s backhand goes out, and Zhang has suddenly whipped away the set. First set: Zheng* 5-3 Gauff (*denotes next server) New balls \u2013 and a wild shot from Gauff gives Zheng the first point . The pattern continues and Gauff goes 0-40 down, eventually losing the game with a double fault. From no-where, she\u2019s suddenly in trouble in the first set. First set: Zheng 4-3 Gauff* (*denotes next server) Seventeen unforced errors at the start of this game for Zheng \u2013 which is ten more than Gauff. Indeed, Zheng\u2019s average service games is lasting 6 mins 25 seconds, compared to 4 mins for Gauff. The lavender court continues to get a battering \u2013 and from 30-all, then deuce, Zheng takes the game. First set: Zheng* 3-3 Gauff (*denotes next server) We pause while the umpire ticks someone off for moving in the crowd. Apparently there have been 21,000 people in over the course of the tournament \u2013 a capacity (4,000) crowd today and yesterday so probably half full the rest of the time, guesses Jonathan Overend. A steaming backhand from Zheng passes a diving Gauff to take the game to 30-all, which seems to galvanise Zheng. She wins a first break point against the Gauff serve \u2013 but then hands Gauff the advantage with a steaming but over-hit cross court forehand. Gauff fluffs one close to the net but goes on to close the game. This is magical tennis. First set: Zheng 3-2 Gauff* (*denotes next server) A humdinger of a game bursting with huge shots and ferocious rallies. An inside out backhand wins Zheng the first point in her serve. Gauff is very quick, spanning the length of the base line like a woman in seven league boots. A inch-perfect forehand from Gauff, then Zheng hits long to give Gauff two break points. Zheng saves the game with a perfectly balanced cross court winner then a backhand down the line. Zheng saves a third break point, and Gauff is disgusted with herself after a limp forehand to give Zheng the advantage. But a cross-court forehand brings her back to deuce. Eventually though, Zheng wins out. They take a sit down. First set: Zheng 2*-2 Gauff (*denotes next server) Gauff is wearing a deeper purple, almost a royal purple, dress, and a matching headband. A double fault is followed up by two outrageous first serves. Zheng pulls back to deuce but brilliant defence from Gauff in a squeaky shoed rally gives her the advantage, and she soon pockets the game First set: Zheng 2-1 Gauff *(*denotes next server) Zheng hits a backhand into the net to make it 15-all, and Gauff battles back in a succession of power-hitting rallies, though ultimately nothing bears fruit. Pere Riba, Zheng\u2019s coach, sits watching with folded arms. First set: Zheng* 1-1 Gauff (*denotes next server) Wham-bam \u2013 Gauff wins the game in about 60 seconds with a steaming hold. First set: Zheng 1-0 Gauff * (*denotes next server) Here we go \u2013 Zheng, in purple pleated gym skirt and vest top to serve. The umpires quietens the crowd down. Gauff can\u2019t do anything with first two serves, but pulls back when Zheng hits long in two rallies \u2013 and again to bring things to deuce after a 17-hit rally. Gauff gets a precious break point, but Zheng saves the set with a drilled forehand and then a monster serve. Gauff is the youngest WTA Finals finalist since Caroline Wozniacki in 2010. Qinwen wins the toss and elects to serve. A huge crowd fill the arena and watches them warmup. Who is going to win? The TV experts are split 1-1. First Zheng Qinwen, then Coco Gauff, both hand in hand with a mascot. Gauff wearing headphones, Qinwen not. Both are in purple \u2013 unless that\u2019s the lights Lots of chat about Gauff\u2019s forehand. She changed her team, splitting with Brad Gilbert after the US Open, and joining forces with Matt Daly. Since then, she\u2019s been storming up the rankings \u2013 and the forehand has been one of the main talking points. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give too much of what\u2019s going on, but there are changes happening,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing with them since Beijing.\u201d Lots of flashing purple lights and heady drums in Riyadh, but Tim Henman is still in a smart jacket so no need to panic. I imagine the players will be out soon. This was Tumaini Carayol\u2019s take on the finals mid-week. Good afternoon! Welcome to the WTA final from Riyadh \u2013 a battle of the bright young things, between the USA\u2019s Coco Gauff (20), who is finishing the season with a bang, and the charismatic Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen (22) \u2013 whose record since an early defeat at Wimbledon has been astonishing, winning 31 of 36 matches, and picking up two titles plus that Paris triumph. She is playing in her first WTA final, the second Chinese player after Li Na. The WTA finals are the biggest tournament outside the slams, with mega bucks -12 million dollars \u2013 available courtesy of the Saudis and their attempts to buy up tennis alongside much of the rest of sport. This is the first time a women\u2019s tournament has been held in the Kingdom and it has gone ahead despite disquiet \u2013 with promises from both the WTA and Saudi Arabia that it will be a force for good. At the moment, the players are going along with it and happy with how things have gone \u2013 but Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova have called \u201ca step backwards\u201d for the game. Play starts at 4pm approx GMT.",

      "bodyText": "An email: \u201cJawing with an opposing player is one Hecke of a way to deflect scrutiny away from Pep and his players!\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cNever change, Mr. Guardiola!\u201d Premier League match report: Ed Aarons has filed his on-the-whistle musing from the south coast, where Manchester City have been consigned to their fourth consecutive defeat in three different competitions under Pep Guardiola. \u201cFirst, I\u2019m happy to be back,\u201d says the Brazilian who bagged Brighton\u2019s opener. \u201cI know I\u2019m an important player for the team so when we win like this against a big team it is good. Now we have time to breathe and win more games. On his goal: \u201cI had too many people there but I\u2019m always told to follow the action so I was there and I\u2019m happy to score. After two months out, I\u2019m very happy to be back. Last season we dropped too many points and the gaffer told us to believe in ourselves this season and we are doing well this season against the big teams.\u201d Jamie Redknapp: Working as a pundit on Sky Sports, the former Liverpool midfielder can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s just seen. \u201cThat is one of the worst halves of football I\u2019ve seen from a Pep Guardiola side,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were abject, they didn\u2019t defend, they didn\u2019t win individual battles and they didn\u2019t pass the ball forward at times. First half they were excellent but second half when Hurzeler made the subs, there was only one team that was going to win it.\u201d I would argue that\u2019s a little bit harsh but Brighton were more than worthy winners of this game despite having only a slightly higher xG: 2-26 to City\u2019s 2.16. CIty certainly seemed to run out of ideas the longer the second half went on. The Premier League table: Manchester City stay in second place, two points behind Liverpool having played one game more. Brighton surge up the table to fourth, level on points with third-placed Nottingham Forest, who have a game in hand over them. View the Premier League table Pep Guardiola: Doing the rounds of the post-match handshakes, the City manager stops to have a long and very animated chat with Brighton defender Jean Paul van Hecke. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any animosity between the duo, it\u2019s just Pep being Pep. Sound the crisis klaxon! Manchester City have been beaten again, with Brighton passing a stern test of their mettle by overturning a half-time deficit to win 2-1. Erling Haaland opened the scoring for Manchester City but Brighton substitutes Joao Pedro and Matt O\u2019Riley won the game for their side with two goals in the space of five minutes. 90+9 min: A De Bruyne cross to the far post is cleared, then Verbruggen plucks a return cross from Bernardo Silva from the air. Haaland and Van Hecke are both booked for a set-to. It\u2019s all over! 90+8 min: City\u2019s pressure is relentless but Matheus Nunes stretches to control a Bernardo Silva pass inside and gives away possession. 90+7 min: City try to break upfield but Bernardo Silva finds himself surrounded in midfield. He wins a free-kick but nothing comes of it. 90+5 min: It\u2019s heart-in-mouth time for Brighton\u2019s fans as Josko Gvardiol flings himself at a curled Kyle Walker cross into the Brighton box. He powers his bullet header wide of the right post. 90+4 min: If City go on to lose this game, Liverpool will be able to open a five-point gap on them with a win over Villa in tonight\u2019s 8pm game at Anfield. 90+3 min: Staring down the barrel of a fourth consecutive defeat in all competitions, City\u2019s players advance again. Brighton\u2019s defence is resolute and Estupinan sprints to put the ball out for a throw-in near the corner flag. 90+2 min: Phil Foden shoots narrowly wide of the far post with a low daisycutter from just inside the Brighton box. 90+1 min: We\u2019re into nine minutes of added time. Jakub Moder has replaced Kaoru Mitoma in the Brighton line-up. 89 min: De Bruyne shoots from 20 yards but his effort whistles a couple of feet high and wide of the far top corner. 88 min: Foden jinks in from the right but is closed down by Brajan Gruda. Moments later, Igor heads a Kevin De Bruyne cross from the byline clear. 86 min: Brighton are dominating possession in these closing stages, although there\u2019ll be a fair bit of added time, given the injury to Jack Hinshelwood, the substitutions and that lengthy break for the IT repairs on referee Sam Barrott\u2019s comms unit. 84 min: Hats off to Fabian Hurzeler, whose substitutions are paying handsome dividends. On the City bench, Pep Guardiola is slumped in his seat vigorously rubbing his face with his hands. Brighton lead! Matt O\u2019Riley is slipped in behind the City defence courtesy of a beautifully weighted Joao Pedro pass and confidently steers the ball past the onrushing Ederson. 82 min: Brighton\u2019s tails are up as they go in search of a second goal against opposition whose confidence has taken a knock in recent matches. 80 min: Another good scoring opportunity appeared to go a begging for Brighton, when Welbeck was unable to trouble Ederson after collecting a cross from Mitoma. However, with City unable to clear it, the ball broke kindly for Pedro, whose shot into the ground beat the City goalkeeper. It\u2019s no more than Brighton deserve. Brighton are level. Joao Pedro lashes home from seven yards out after the ball broke his way when a Danny Welbeck shot was blocked by a cluster of City defenders on the edge of the six-yard box. 77 min: Jamai Simpson-Pusey is booked for some indiscretion or other. Dissent, I think. 75 min: Baleba plays the ball out wide to Mitoma, who combines with Joao Pedro. O\u2019Riley gets on the ball and fizzes a cross into the City box and across the face of goal but is unable to pick out Welbeck. 74 min: Silva tries to pick out Phil Foden with a crossfield ball but Igor intercepts, heading it back to Bart Verbruggen. Another Man City substitution: Kevin De Bruyne is on for Savinho. 73 min: With the natives getting restless, play finally resumes with a City goal kick. 72 min: Man City substitution: Bernardo Silva comes on for Ilkay Gundogan. 70 min: There\u2019s another break in play so the referee can have some running repairs done on the battery pack powering his comms device. 69 min: Joao Pedro gets in behind Walker to latch on to a ball over the top from deep. His first touch is excellent and takes him closer to goal but he fires his low diagonal effort well wide of the far post. 68 min: A delightful Mitoma cross from the left somehow finds its way past three City defenders to land at the feet of Danny Welbeck about six yards out. He wasn\u2019t expecting the ball to come his way and can\u2019t sort his feet out in time to get a shot off. 66 min: Brighton double-substitution: Brajan Gruda and Joao Pedro on for Adingra and Rutter. 65 min: Rutter heads over the City bar from 10 yards after connecting with another excellent Estupinan cross from the left. 64 min: Correction, it was Savinho, not Nunes, who tried to score the most Mo Salah goal imaginable on that occasion. 62 min: Nunes gets the better of Adingra down the left but is unable to pull the ball into the path of Haaland. It\u2019s recycled and Nunes tries to curl a shot inside the far post after cutting inside from the right. Wide. 59 min: Adingra opts for a safety first approach as he puts a crossfield ball from Simpson-Pusey out of play for a throw-in deep in inside his own half under pressure from Nunes. It\u2019s nicely poised, this game. 57 min: Matt O\u2019Riley comes on for his long overdue Premier League debut, replacing the injured Jack Hinshelwood in Brighton\u2019s midfield. 56 min: Igor shins the ball over his own bar as he cuts out a Haaland cross that was heading straight for Savinho at the far post. Excellent defending \u2013 he could easily have scored an own-goal. 55 min: After dogged work on the edge of the Brighton penalty area by Rico Lewis, Gundogan tries to poke the ball past Verbruggen at his near post but the angle is far too tight. 53 min: There\u2019s a break in play as Hinshelwood receives treatment,. He really should have scored with that powerful header after connecting with Estupinan\u2019s cross from the left but sent his effort too near Ederson. 52 min: Ederson is forced into action again, clawing away a downward header from Hinshelwood from seven yards out. 51 min: Adingra sends a cross from the right to the far post, where Mitoma\u2019s weak header fails to trouble Ederson unduly. It\u2019s catching practice for the City goalkeeper. 48 min: Brighton advance with Welbeck on the ball and it\u2019s played wide to Mitoma, then back across to the other side of the pitch. Matheus Nunes bodychecks Adingra but his blatant foul goes unpunished by the referee, Sam Barrott. The denizens of the Amex Stadium boo disapprovingly and there\u2019s a short break in play while Adingra receives treatment. 46 min: Interviewed by Sky just before the restart, Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler said he has told his players to play with \u201cmore courage and intensity\u201d. He seemed to think they were paying their exalted visitors too much respect. 46 min: The only Premier League side not to have lost a game in which they\u2019ve conceded the first goal this season, Brighton get the second half started. Carlos Baleba is on in midfield for Brighton, with Yasin Ayari making way. The sides go off with City leading courtesy of Erling Haaland\u2019s determined strike off the underside of the bar after his initial effort was blocked by Verbruggen. Despite being dominated for the opening half-hour, Brighton have grown back into the game and Danny Welbeck was denied his first ever goal against Manchester City by an excellent Gvardiol block. 45+2 min: Estupinan runs on to a passs from Igor and has a cross put out for a Brighton corner. They won\u2019t get to take it as the flag had gone up for offside. It\u2019s half-time. 45+2 min: We\u2019re into two minutes of added time, which seems excessive as there have been no substitutions or injuries and the ball rarely seems to have been out of play. Never mind. 44 min: Igor bundles over Haaland in the centre-circle and is booked for dissent after complaining about being penalised. It\u2019s a cheap yellow. 42 min: Another rare chance goes to waste for Brighton after Mitoma gets the better of Walker and squares the ball. Neither Welbeck nor Rutter can get to it before its cleared. Brighton have upped their game considerably in the past 10 minutes are are very much back in this match. 40 min: City are awarded a throw-in halfway inside their own half, despite the ball not actually going out of play. Danny Welbeck voices his displeasure to no avail and play resumes. 38 min: Rico Lewis is booked for a foul on Welbeck and Brighton have a free-kick about 30 yards from the City goal. Welbeck, the Brighton skipper, sends the ball fizzing narrowly wide of the right post. 35 min: Brighton have their first chance of note, Gvardiol sliding to block Welbeck\u2019s shot after the striker had beaten Kovacic for pace and been slipped in by Mitoma. The ball actually hits Gvardiol\u2019s arm but as he was sliding but there\u2019s no way it was a handball, even in these strange times. 34 min: Ederson gets the ball launched upfield and sends it into the stand on the right of the pitch. That\u2019s a very rare miskick from him. 32 min: Manchester City corner. Gundogan\u2019s delivery towards the far post sails into the gloves of Bart Verbruggen. 29 min: Nunes plays the ball inside to Kovacic, who shapes to shoot from distance, thinks better of it and plays a low pass forward to Lewis. Moments later, the ball wends its way back to Kovacic and this time he has a pop, which Verbruggen saves. City are in a state of almost total dominance and Brighton are on the ropes. 27 min: Matheus Nunes is penalised for a blatant technical foul on Veltman but avoids a booking. 26 min: Another sweeping City move ends with Haaland forcing Verbruggen into a smart save at his near post with a powerfully struck right-footed effort. 25 min: That was a beautifully weighted pass from Kovacic but Haaland needed the strength of an ox and two bites of the cherry to hold off two Brighton defenders and beat Verbruggen. City lead. Kovacic plays Haaland in behind and his shot on goal is only half-blocked by Verbruggen but doesn\u2019t make it into the goal. Under pressure from Jean Paul van Hecke, Haaland scores at the second attempt, steamrollering his way past the prostrate keeper to prod the ball home off the underside of the bar. 22 min: A Rutter cross from the left is too close to the City goal and Ederson claims comfortably before Welbeck can do any damage. 21 min: Jahmai Simpson-Pusey is playing in the middle of a back three when City are in possession and the 18-year-old hasn\u2019t put a foot wrong thus far in his Premier League debut. 19 min: Yasin Ayari is is booked for dragging Phil Foden to the ground with both hands as the City man tried to escape upfield. He can have no complaints about that. 18 min: On the stretch trying to reach a cross from the left at the far post, Erling Haaland can only shin his effort high over the bar. City are getting on top. 17 min: Whatever about Mitoma v Walker, Estupinan v Savinho is already shaping up to be a very one-sided contest. As things stand, the Brazilian has the Brighton left-back on toast. 15 min: Bart Verbruggen gets down to deny Savinho with an outstretched leg as the City winger ran on to a Mateo Kovacic pass and bore down on his goal. Good save! 15 min: Mitoma tries to pick out a Georginio Rutter run in behind the City defence with a nicely weighted pass but the Frenchman is flagged for offside. 14 min: An attempted Savinho cross from the right towards the far post drifts just over the Brighton bar and lands on the roof of the net. 12 min: Veltman plays the ball in behind for Yasin Ayari to chase but City had pushed up. The Brighton midfielder is miles offside. 11 min: Past the 10-minute mark we go and we\u2019ve yet to see a shot from any player on either side. 9 min: Nunes tries to take on Veltman again but gets no change from the Brighton defender and is forced backwards. Moments later, Savinho takes on and beats Pervis Estupinan out by the right touchline and gets to the byline but is unable to pick out a teammate with his pull-back. 8 min: Mitoma puts Walker under pressure as he tries to clear from the City right-back area but the ball goes out for a throw-in off Brighton\u2019s Japanese winger. 7 min: Mateo Kovacic plays a ball over the top for Savinho to chase but puts far too much welly on his pass. Bart Verbruggen is quick out of his goal to claim the bouncing ball. 4 min: Danny Welbeck coughs up cheap possession to Walker in midfield and City advance upfield before giving the ball back to their hosts. 3 min: City ping the ball around at the back under a fairly energetic Brighton press. Kaoru Mitoma v Kyle Walker should prove one of this game\u2019s more intriguing battles. 2 min: Matheus Nunes gets the ball down to the byline for City but is prevented from crossing it by Joel Veltman. Brighton force the visitors backwards. 1 min: City get the ball rolling in their fourth consecutive match away from home, their players wearing maroon shirts, shorts and socks. Remembrance: The players gather around the centre-circle as their managers lay wreaths ahead of Remembrance Sunday. The Last Post is played by buglers from the Salvation Army. Not long now: The teams are in the tunnel, ready to be led out by match referee Sam Barrott. And out they go ... Today\u2019s Premier League results Brentford 3-2 Bournemouth Crystal Palace 0-2 Fulham West Ham 0-0 Everton Wolves 2-0 Southampton Brighton v Manchester City (5.30pm GMT) Liverpool v Aston Villa (8pm GMT) View the Premier League table Those teams: Brighton make one change to the side that lost against Liverpool last weekend, with Simon Adingra coming in for Ferdi Kadoiglu, who is ruled out of today\u2019s matchday squad along with Carlos Baleba and Lewis Dunk. Matt O\u2019Riley and Joao Pedro are back from injured and numbered among the home side\u2019s substitutes. Pep Guardiola makes two changes to the team who lost to Sporting CP in midweek. Kyle Walker is in for Manuel Akanji, who went into the game carrying an injury and is only on the bench today. Teenage centre-back Jahmai Simpson-Pusey makes his Premier League debut, having started the game against Sporting. Bernardo Silva is on the bench today, along with Kevin De Bruyne and Nathan Ake, while Ilkay Gundogan starts. Tonight\u2019s match officials Referee: Sam Barrott. Assistants: Lee Betts and Steve Meredith. Fourth official: Andy Davies. VAR: Jarred Gillett. Assistant VAR: Stuart Burt. Brighton: Verbruggen; Veltman, Van Hecke, Julio, Estupinan; Hinshelwood, Ayari, Rutter; Adingra, Welbeck, Mitoma Subs: Steele, Gruda, Pedro, Enciso, Moder, Baleba, Wieffer, Ferguson, O\u2019Riley Manchester City: Ederson; Walker, Simpson-Pusey, Gvardiol, Lewis; Kovacic, Gundogan, Nunes; Savinho, Haaland, Foden Subs: Ortega, Ake, De Bruyne, Bernardo, Akanji, Wright, O\u2019Reilly, McAtee, Wilson-Esbrand Early team news Without Adam Webster, Solly March, James Milner, Brighton are also sweating over the fitness of Yasin Ayari, Lewis Dunk and Yankuba Minteh, but could include Joao Pedro and Matt O\u2019Riley in today\u2019s matchday squad after their respective spells on the sidelines. With their Ballon d\u2019Or winner Rodri out for the season and Oscar Bobb still recovering from a fractured leg, Pep Guardiola has other injury concerns to contend with as Jack Grealish, John Stones and Ruben Dias could all miss this evening\u2019s game. In better news for the champions, Kevin De Bruyne has been included in their past two matchday squads and got back on the grass for a few minutes during City\u2019s midweek Champions League defeat at the hands of Sporting. Manchester City travel to the south coast on the back of three consecutive defeats in three different competitions, the first time Pep Guardiola\u2019s side has lost back-to-back-to-back games since 2018. They face a Brighton side who have lost consecutive games against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup and Premier League but Fabian Hurzeler wiull be confident his team can compete against champions who are shipping goals and looking uncharacteristically vulnerable. Kick-off at the Amex Stadium is at 5.30pm but we\u2019ll have team news and build-up in the meantime.",

      "bodyText": "A employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has been fired from her job and is being investigated because she told a disaster relief team she was directing in Florida after Hurricane Milton to avoid homes displaying election campaign signs supporting Donald Trump, conduct that the agency head on Saturday called \u201creprehensible\u201d. Deanne Criswell, the administrator of the federal agency, posted on X: \u201cMore than 22,000 Fema employees every day adhere to Fema\u2019s core values and are dedicated to helping people before, during and after disasters, often sacrificing time with their own families to help disaster survivors.\u201d She continued: \u201cRecently, a Fema employee departed from these values to advise her survivor assistance team not go to homes with yard signs supporting President-elect Trump. This is a clear violation of Fema\u2019s core values and principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation.\u201d Hurricane Milton roared across the Gulf of Mexico and hit Florida last month, crossing the state before reaching the Atlantic Ocean, just two weeks after Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida and then curved inland on a lethal path through Georgia and the Carolinas before dissipating in Tennessee. It killed 35 people. The Fema employee has not yet been officially identified, but Criswell said of the actions: \u201cThis was reprehensible. I want to be clear to all of my employees and the American people, this type of behavior and action will not be tolerated at Fema and we will hold people accountable if they violate these standards of conduct.\u201d The agency has said it understood the conduct to be an isolated incident. The Daily Wire was the first to report on the actions of the employee, a supervisor, which it said it uncovered from internal correspondence. The employee reportedly sent a message to workers who were going door to door in Lake Placid, Florida, to plan federal assistance, telling them to \u201cavoid homes advertising Trump\u201d. Creswell further posted on Saturday: \u201cWe take our mission to help everyone before, during and after disasters seriously. This employee has been terminated and we have referred the matter to the Office of Special Counsel. I will continue to do everything I can to make sure this never happens again.\u201d During the aftermath of the highly destructive Hurricane Helene, which affected 10 states and killed more than 230 people, Trump went campaigning in North Carolina and accused the Biden administration of holding aid back from Republican-voting areas, even though the government and prominent Republican leaders on the ground disputed that. But after the report of the Fema employee emerged, Florida\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, posted on X: \u201cThe blatant weaponization of government by partisan activists in the federal bureaucracy is yet another reason why the Biden-Harris administration is in its final days.\u201d He said he was launching his own investigation into what happened.",

How O\u2019Riley enjoyed his moment that allowed the home supporters to serenade the beleaguered City manager with chants of \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning\u201d as they closed in on a memorable victory.</p> \n<p>Guardiola had promised that his side would learn from their lapses against Sporting in midweek and he sprang a surprise by retaining teenager Jahmai Simpson-Pusey in an untried central defensive partnership alongside Josko Gvardiol. Everything appeared to be going well until Jo\u00e3o Pedro came off the bench with 25 minutes to play and, along with H\u00fcrzeler\u2019s other substitutes, proceeded to change the game.</p> \n<p>The Brighton manager had described his first meeting with the reigning Premier League champions as an opportunity for his side to challenge the establishment and he was proud of the way they responded to being forced to chase shadows in the first 45 minutes.</p> \n<p>The introduction of Carlos Baleba for the second half changed the game as City retreated deeper and deeper and Guardiola must have feared the worst. He left the pitch embroiled in an exchange of words with Jan Paul van Hecke after the Brighton defender had clashed with Haaland in stoppage time as City desperately chased an equaliser.</p> \n<p>The visitors had dominated the early proceedings as the dangerous Savinho repeatedly found space in behind Pervis Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n. Bart Verbruggen spread himself wide to prevent him from opening the scoring after a burst into the box before Haaland was uncharacteristically wayward from a Phil Foden free-kick as he only succeeded in clearing the ball away from danger. But City looked far more like their usual selves and it seemed like only a matter of time until they would score.</p> \n<p>The goal promptly arrived after 23 minutes when a lovely shimmy from Mateo Kovacic gave him space in midfield to play the perfect through ball for Haaland, who rammed home from close range after Verbruggen had made the initial save. The Brighton goalkeeper was fortunate that the Norwegian\u2019s next effort after he was set up by Foden came off his heel and rebounded off the post before Haaland headed over the resulting corner.</p> \n<p>Brighton\u2019s only sight of goal had been a snapshot from Kaoru Mitoma that went harmlessly wide and they had no answer as City enjoyed more than 70% of possession. Kovacic was next to force Verbruggen into action from distance but the hosts could well have had a penalty when Gvardiol\u2019s hand blocked Danny Welbeck\u2019s shot on the ground after Walker had misjudged a bouncing ball. The Brighton forward was not happy and could only direct a free-kick just wide of Ederson\u2019s post after Rico Lewis was cautioned for scything him down.</p> \n<p>H\u00fcrzeler said in a television interview at half-time that his side had to show more courage and they came flying out of the blocks. Mitoma could only direct a soft header on target from Georgino Rutter\u2019s cross before Jack Hinshelwood should have done better from Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s cross at the end of a flowing move that was started by Mitoma.</p> \n<p>Suddenly City looked jittery but they responded by going on the attack again. Haaland almost turned provider for Savinho if it hadn\u2019t been for a desperate clearance from Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n at the back post. Rutter\u2019s last involvement was to head over the crossbar from another dangerous ball into City\u2019s area as H\u00fcrzeler threw on Jo\u00e3o Pedro and Brajan Gruda and went into all-out attack mode. But the Brazilian fluffed his lines when he was played through on goal and could not force Ederson into another save.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Kevin De Bruyne was introduced for his first league appearance since mid-September as City attempted to regain control but Guardiola\u2019s anxiety only grew with each Brighton attack. He was right to look concerned as they made an awful mess of clearing Mitoma\u2019s cross and Jo\u00e3o Pedro pounced on the loose ball to equalise. There was no doubting the quality of the winning goal when a one-two between Welbeck and Jo\u00e3o Pedro allowed O\u2019Riley to steal the headlines.</p> \n<p>Gvardiol came closest to rescuing a point for City in nine minutes of stoppage time but there was to prove no way back as City and Guardiola were left to contemplate the unthinkable.</p>",

How O\u2019Riley enjoyed his moment that allowed the home supporters to serenade the beleaguered City manager with chants of \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning\u201d as they closed in on a memorable victory. Guardiola had promised that his side would learn from their lapses against Sporting in midweek and he sprang a surprise by retaining teenager Jahmai Simpson-Pusey in an untried central defensive partnership alongside Josko Gvardiol. Everything appeared to be going well until Jo\u00e3o Pedro came off the bench with 25 minutes to play and, along with H\u00fcrzeler\u2019s other substitutes, proceeded to change the game. The Brighton manager had described his first meeting with the reigning Premier League champions as an opportunity for his side to challenge the establishment and he was proud of the way they responded to being forced to chase shadows in the first 45 minutes. The introduction of Carlos Baleba for the second half changed the game as City retreated deeper and deeper and Guardiola must have feared the worst. He left the pitch embroiled in an exchange of words with Jan Paul van Hecke after the Brighton defender had clashed with Haaland in stoppage time as City desperately chased an equaliser. The visitors had dominated the early proceedings as the dangerous Savinho repeatedly found space in behind Pervis Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n. Bart Verbruggen spread himself wide to prevent him from opening the scoring after a burst into the box before Haaland was uncharacteristically wayward from a Phil Foden free-kick as he only succeeded in clearing the ball away from danger. But City looked far more like their usual selves and it seemed like only a matter of time until they would score. The goal promptly arrived after 23 minutes when a lovely shimmy from Mateo Kovacic gave him space in midfield to play the perfect through ball for Haaland, who rammed home from close range after Verbruggen had made the initial save. The Brighton goalkeeper was fortunate that the Norwegian\u2019s next effort after he was set up by Foden came off his heel and rebounded off the post before Haaland headed over the resulting corner. Brighton\u2019s only sight of goal had been a snapshot from Kaoru Mitoma that went harmlessly wide and they had no answer as City enjoyed more than 70% of possession. Kovacic was next to force Verbruggen into action from distance but the hosts could well have had a penalty when Gvardiol\u2019s hand blocked Danny Welbeck\u2019s shot on the ground after Walker had misjudged a bouncing ball. The Brighton forward was not happy and could only direct a free-kick just wide of Ederson\u2019s post after Rico Lewis was cautioned for scything him down. H\u00fcrzeler said in a television interview at half-time that his side had to show more courage and they came flying out of the blocks. Mitoma could only direct a soft header on target from Georgino Rutter\u2019s cross before Jack Hinshelwood should have done better from Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s cross at the end of a flowing move that was started by Mitoma. Suddenly City looked jittery but they responded by going on the attack again. Haaland almost turned provider for Savinho if it hadn\u2019t been for a desperate clearance from Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n at the back post. Rutter\u2019s last involvement was to head over the crossbar from another dangerous ball into City\u2019s area as H\u00fcrzeler threw on Jo\u00e3o Pedro and Brajan Gruda and went into all-out attack mode. But the Brazilian fluffed his lines when he was played through on goal and could not force Ederson into another save. Kevin De Bruyne was introduced for his first league appearance since mid-September as City attempted to regain control but Guardiola\u2019s anxiety only grew with each Brighton attack. He was right to look concerned as they made an awful mess of clearing Mitoma\u2019s cross and Jo\u00e3o Pedro pounced on the loose ball to equalise. There was no doubting the quality of the winning goal when a one-two between Welbeck and Jo\u00e3o Pedro allowed O\u2019Riley to steal the headlines. Gvardiol came closest to rescuing a point for City in nine minutes of stoppage time but there was to prove no way back as City and Guardiola were left to contemplate the unthinkable.",

So the stark choice would be: side with the EU or sacrifice our agriculture.\u201d On Ukraine, Darroch points out that if Trump backs a peace deal that looks like defeat for Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with Russia keeping territory it has captured and Ukraine having to promise never to join Nato, the UK would again be forced to choose between the EU or Washington. \u201cSo another difficult decision for the prime minister: try to rally Europe to reject US ideas and increase support for Ukraine, or pack up our tents, accept defeat and go home?\u201d Trump\u2019s dramatic triumph has prompted intense debate in Westminster about the best way for Keir Starmer\u2019s administration to respond to such an unpredictable figure in the White House. Former UK ambassador to Paris and the country\u2019s first national security adviser Peter Ricketts said that Starmer should avoid appearing \u201ctoo needy\u201d or being too keen to schmooze him. \u201cI think I would say make your contact with Trump count rather than just trying to be first to get through the White House door, which has rather been the tendency of some of your predecessors. The danger of that is that you expose yourself to embarrassment when he does something you profoundly disagree with.\u201d Also writing in today\u2019s Observer Peter Hyman, who has advised both Tony Blair and Keir Starmer, said Labour needed to learn lessons about why Americans voted for Trump because it could fall victim to a similar phenomenon in the UK. Too many people, he writes, regarded Trump supporters as members of the \u201cdeluded masses\u201d who were too stupid to see he was a monster, while in fact many had good reasons to vote for him. \u201cThe truth is the Democrats lost people \u2013 head and heart. They failed at being good technocrats (the head) with high inflation and open borders. And failed at telling a story in which struggling working families could feel seen and heard (the heart). \u201cThis is now the challenge for the Democrats in the US fighting to win back power, and Labour in the UK trying to make a success of their victory. \u201cTrump\u2019s win could be a moment, like Thatcher\u2019s victory in 1979 where the old rules of politics are turned on their head and where the building blocks of a new progressive project need to be rebuilt brick by brick from first principles.\u201d",

Scientists have warned that his policies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/trump-climate-change-environment-threat\">would put paid to hopes of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels</a>, regarded as the threshold of safety.</p> <p>Governments are now scrambling to save vital alliances that were led by the outgoing US president, Joe Biden, who made the climate a top priority of his term. At Cop29, governments are supposed to agree ways to bring global financial muscle to bear on the climate crisis. Though a team from the Biden White House will still attend, the inevitability that Trump will withdraw US support means other countries have to redraw their expectations, given the prospective absence of \u2013 and perhaps future hostility from \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest economy.</p>    <p>The summit, taking place in Azerbaijan\u2019s capital, Baku, over the next fortnight, has been hit by a flurry of late cancellations. The president of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will not attend, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will stay in Berlin following the break-up of his governing coalition. Emmanuel Macron, president of France, is also occupied by a domestic political crisis.</p> <p>Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, will be at the talks, with the leaders of about 100 countries, mostly from the developing world, which is struggling with the increasing economic impacts of climate-driven disaster.</p> <p>Keir Starmer, who will spend nearly two days at the talks, is one of the few remaining leaders of the world\u2019s biggest industrialised economies who will attend. He is expected to announce tough new targets for the UK to cut greenhouse gases, and a commitment to fulfil a pledge of \u00a311.6bn in climate finance to poor countries, made under the Conservatives but left hanging in the balance by Rishi Sunak.</p> <p>Miliband, who will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/15/ed-miliband-lead-uk-negotiations-cop29-climate-summit\">take personal charge </a>rather than leaving the negotiating to junior ministers and civil servants as the previous government did, made clear that Britain would step into the leadership vacuum. \u201cWe will be going to Cop with the power of our example to call for others to do their fair share because climate breakdown knows no borders. The UK will step up and lead \u2013 to protect our people, and play our part in securing a future for our planet,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Adair Turner, former chair of the UK\u2019s Committee on Climate Change, now chair of the Energy Transitions Commission thinktank, warned that despite \u201chappy talk\u201d from some governments and civil society groups seeking to minimise the impact, the shadow of Trump would weigh heavily. \u201cThere is a tendency by some people to try to keep their spirits up by whistling in the dark. But this [Trump\u2019s election] is bad, let\u2019s be clear. We will not get further US action beyond the Inflation Reduction Act [under which hundreds of billions of dollars were supposed to be spent on clean energy] and we needed that.\u201d</p> <p>Poor countries are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/08/cop29-climate-talks-what-would-a-good-outcome-look-like\">hoping for a settlement in Baku that will deliver at least $1tn a year by 2035 </a>for them to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with increasingly extreme weather. Developed-country governments are only likely to agree that a much smaller sum, which could be significantly less than $400m in the absence of the US, should come from public sources, such as overseas aid budgets, the World Bank and other publicly owned finance institutions.</p> <p>They also want large emerging economies, such as China, and petrostates such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, to contribute to the funds.</p> <p>Several studies have shown that taxing fossil fuels could provide all of the finance needed, but moves to do so would face fierce objections from petrostates. Some countries are also arguing strongly for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/28/brazil-radical-plan-tax-global-super-rich-tackle-climate-crisis\">small tax on billionaires</a>, who have seen their wealth boosted to record levels since the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Levies on high-carbon activities such as flying and shipping are also<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/17/rich-countries-must-urgently-help-poor-nations-hit-by-climate-crisis-says-v20\"> possible means of raising cash</a>. There are likely to be disagreements over how much of the $1tn demanded should come from the private sector, and what safeguards can be put in place to ensure that poor countries get access to the money they need without being pushed further into debt.</p> <p>David Hillman, director of the group Stamp Out Poverty, part of the Make Polluters Pay coalition, said: \u201cThe UK government must not use Trump\u2019s election as a justification not to step up at Cop with the scale of ambition on finance required to meet the size of the challenge that confronts us, similarly to how uncertainty around Brexit was once engineered by some countries to halt important progress on taxing the banks.\u201d</p>",

He pledged that the UK would lead efforts at Cop29 to secure the global agreement needed to stave off the worst impacts of climate breakdown, in talks that have been thrown into turmoil by the re-election of Donald Trump as US president. \u201cThe only way to keep the British people secure today is by making Britain a clean-energy superpower, and the only way we protect future generations is by working with other countries to deliver climate action,\u201d Miliband told the Observer. \u201cThis government is committed to accelerating climate action precisely because it is by doing this that we protect our country, with energy security, lower bills, and good jobs.\u201d Trump, who has repeatedly dismissed climate science as a \u201choax\u201d, has vowed to withdraw the US again from the Paris climate agreement, as he did late in his last presidency. Scientists have warned that his policies would put paid to hopes of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, regarded as the threshold of safety. Governments are now scrambling to save vital alliances that were led by the outgoing US president, Joe Biden, who made the climate a top priority of his term. At Cop29, governments are supposed to agree ways to bring global financial muscle to bear on the climate crisis. Though a team from the Biden White House will still attend, the inevitability that Trump will withdraw US support means other countries have to redraw their expectations, given the prospective absence of \u2013 and perhaps future hostility from \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest economy. The summit, taking place in Azerbaijan\u2019s capital, Baku, over the next fortnight, has been hit by a flurry of late cancellations. The president of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will not attend, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will stay in Berlin following the break-up of his governing coalition. Emmanuel Macron, president of France, is also occupied by a domestic political crisis. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, will be at the talks, with the leaders of about 100 countries, mostly from the developing world, which is struggling with the increasing economic impacts of climate-driven disaster. Keir Starmer, who will spend nearly two days at the talks, is one of the few remaining leaders of the world\u2019s biggest industrialised economies who will attend. He is expected to announce tough new targets for the UK to cut greenhouse gases, and a commitment to fulfil a pledge of \u00a311.6bn in climate finance to poor countries, made under the Conservatives but left hanging in the balance by Rishi Sunak. Miliband, who will take personal charge rather than leaving the negotiating to junior ministers and civil servants as the previous government did, made clear that Britain would step into the leadership vacuum. \u201cWe will be going to Cop with the power of our example to call for others to do their fair share because climate breakdown knows no borders. The UK will step up and lead \u2013 to protect our people, and play our part in securing a future for our planet,\u201d he said. Adair Turner, former chair of the UK\u2019s Committee on Climate Change, now chair of the Energy Transitions Commission thinktank, warned that despite \u201chappy talk\u201d from some governments and civil society groups seeking to minimise the impact, the shadow of Trump would weigh heavily. \u201cThere is a tendency by some people to try to keep their spirits up by whistling in the dark. But this [Trump\u2019s election] is bad, let\u2019s be clear. We will not get further US action beyond the Inflation Reduction Act [under which hundreds of billions of dollars were supposed to be spent on clean energy] and we needed that.\u201d Poor countries are hoping for a settlement in Baku that will deliver at least $1tn a year by 2035 for them to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with increasingly extreme weather. Developed-country governments are only likely to agree that a much smaller sum, which could be significantly less than $400m in the absence of the US, should come from public sources, such as overseas aid budgets, the World Bank and other publicly owned finance institutions. They also want large emerging economies, such as China, and petrostates such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, to contribute to the funds. Several studies have shown that taxing fossil fuels could provide all of the finance needed, but moves to do so would face fierce objections from petrostates. Some countries are also arguing strongly for a small tax on billionaires, who have seen their wealth boosted to record levels since the Covid-19 pandemic. Levies on high-carbon activities such as flying and shipping are also possible means of raising cash. There are likely to be disagreements over how much of the $1tn demanded should come from the private sector, and what safeguards can be put in place to ensure that poor countries get access to the money they need without being pushed further into debt. David Hillman, director of the group Stamp Out Poverty, part of the Make Polluters Pay coalition, said: \u201cThe UK government must not use Trump\u2019s election as a justification not to step up at Cop with the scale of ambition on finance required to meet the size of the challenge that confronts us, similarly to how uncertainty around Brexit was once engineered by some countries to halt important progress on taxing the banks.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Wednesday 9 November 2016: a misty, drizzly day in Washington DC, an overwhelmingly Democrat city in trauma after the shock victory of Donald Trump in the election the previous day. A Washington rarity, a declared Trump supporter, was among a group of guests for lunch in the residence that day. I took him aside and asked whether Trump would be as radical and disruptive as the giants of American political journalism were predicting. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said: \u201cI know the guy. All that red meat was just for the campaign. I expect him to govern as a mainstream Republican.\u201d</p> <p>Fast forward to London, Wednesday 6 November 2024. I\u2019m speaking at a business dinner about the election outcome and what will come next. I mention Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/15/trump-tariffs-price-hikes-warnings\">commitment to levy 20% tariffs</a> on all imports into America. One participant says he has just spoken to a friend in Arizona who knows Trump personally. This friend has said: \u201cIt\u2019s not about instant action. Trump will use the tariffs as a threat, to persuade countries to act to get trade flows into balance.\u201d Another participant says: \u201cTrump has won his second term now. So he doesn\u2019t need to fight any more. Surely he\u2019ll calm down and focus on his legacy?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/09/we-will-fight-trumps-plans-to-slap-tariffs-on-the-uk-rachel-reeves\">We will fight Trump\u2019s plans to slap tariffs on the UK \u2013 Rachel Reeves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are a hundred questions to ask about this election. Why were the polls so wrong, again? Why was Joe Biden ever allowed to run, and wreck the field for others, when he was so transparently past it? Why did Kamala Harris do so catastrophically badly among Hispanic and African-American men: is it really just because she is a woman? And what does it say about western democracies that the most important election of all has been won by a man for whom the truth is a distant land, seldom visited? But the most immediate question for the UK is \u2013 how should the government prepare for Trump 2.0?</p> <p>Trump is profoundly unpredictable. He thrives in, indeed deliberately creates, chaos and disorder. It is impossible to be sure about how he will behave, what tone he will strike, when back in the Oval Office. But those predictions around that London dinner table of a new, mellow Trump backing away from his campaign rhetoric strike me as a triumph of hope over experience: the lesson of his first term is that he mostly does what he says he is going to do.</p> <p>The British government has made an intelligent start, thanks in part to some brilliant work by the Washington embassy: the phone call after the assassination attempt, the dinner in Trump Tower. But Trump expects people to pay court to him; rewards don\u2019t generally follow. So the groundwork, though necessary, guarantees nothing. Challenging times lie ahead, especially on climate change, tariffs and Ukraine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sucking up is seen as weakness; straight talking may initially prompt a sharp response, but ultimately wins some respect</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On climate change, Trump will take America out of the Paris deal, and step up exploitation of oil and gas. The world is already disastrously behind the curve on reaching net zero by 2050: US withdrawal from Paris will make this worse. Though it won\u2019t undo all the damage, the partial remedy here is to work with individual US states, notably environmentally aware California.</p> <p>On tariffs I expect the exact opposite of a mere threat. I think Trump will impose tariffs on all US imports immediately and say: \u201cIf you want them lifted, offer me something to rebalance trade\u201d. The EU will almost certainly retaliate; and the UK will face a difficult decision. Do we match EU retaliatory tariffs? Or do we seek a bilateral deal, like a free trade agreement? I think an FTA would be on offer from Trump, as in 2017: but the top US demand, as was the case then, would be unrestricted access to the UK market for the low-cost products of the US agricultural sector, hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken included. So the stark choice would be: side with the EU or sacrifice our&nbsp;agriculture?</p> <p>On <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/ukraine-trump-victory\">Ukraine</a>, to the extent there is a Trump plan, it seems to involve a ceasefire, creation of a demilitarised zone between the two frontlines, and the opening of negotiations on a permanent peace deal. But JD Vance has suggested that Russia might keep the territory it has captured, and Ukraine might have to promise never to join Nato. In short, it would look like a defeat. I cannot see Zelensky accepting it, and I would expect him to appeal to Europe to backfill for American weapons subsequently denied. So another difficult decision for the prime minister: try to rally Europe to reject US ideas and increase support for Ukraine, or pack up our tents, accept defeat and go home?</p> <p>Three points leap out of this bleak analysis. First, the Democratic party is continuing to misread the American electorate. The biggest issue in this election was always going to be \u201cthe economy, stupid\u201d, after the ravages of inflation over the past four years. Yet they never had a coherent, convincing plan, and Harris was never able to escape from the shadow of the Biden record. Instead they led with issues like reproductive rights, seemingly oblivious to the damage this was doing to their standing in the once-loyally Democratic but also socially conservative Hispanic community, which in the event went massively for Trump: 14 points up on his 2020 result. There are lessons here for centrist parties across Europe: focus on the concerns of the broad mass of the electorate, not the issues that energise your base: in short, stop talking to yourself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/07/why-donald-trumps-return-is-a-disaster-for-europe\">Why Donald Trump\u2019s return is a disaster for Europe | Paul Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, we are likely to shortly face some pivotal decisions about whether we side with Europe or an isolationist and protectionist US. And on these two issues our beliefs and values point towards Europe. In this context, the government\u2019s painfully slow and minimalist approach towards the UK/EU reset isn\u2019t good&nbsp;enough. We need the UK/EU security pact soon, so that we have the structures and processes in place with which to manage the issues coming down the road. And we need stronger bilateral partnerships with France and Germany, notwithstanding the current political mess in the latter.</p> <p>And third, the government needs to brace itself for the inevitable storms ahead.

      "bodyText": "Wednesday 9 November 2016: a misty, drizzly day in Washington DC, an overwhelmingly Democrat city in trauma after the shock victory of Donald Trump in the election the previous day. A Washington rarity, a declared Trump supporter, was among a group of guests for lunch in the residence that day. I took him aside and asked whether Trump would be as radical and disruptive as the giants of American political journalism were predicting. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said: \u201cI know the guy. All that red meat was just for the campaign. I expect him to govern as a mainstream Republican.\u201d Fast forward to London, Wednesday 6 November 2024. I\u2019m speaking at a business dinner about the election outcome and what will come next. I mention Trump\u2019s commitment to levy 20% tariffs on all imports into America. One participant says he has just spoken to a friend in Arizona who knows Trump personally. This friend has said: \u201cIt\u2019s not about instant action. Trump will use the tariffs as a threat, to persuade countries to act to get trade flows into balance.\u201d Another participant says: \u201cTrump has won his second term now. So he doesn\u2019t need to fight any more. Surely he\u2019ll calm down and focus on his legacy?\u201d There are a hundred questions to ask about this election. Why were the polls so wrong, again? Why was Joe Biden ever allowed to run, and wreck the field for others, when he was so transparently past it? Why did Kamala Harris do so catastrophically badly among Hispanic and African-American men: is it really just because she is a woman? And what does it say about western democracies that the most important election of all has been won by a man for whom the truth is a distant land, seldom visited? But the most immediate question for the UK is \u2013 how should the government prepare for Trump 2.0? Trump is profoundly unpredictable. He thrives in, indeed deliberately creates, chaos and disorder. It is impossible to be sure about how he will behave, what tone he will strike, when back in the Oval Office. But those predictions around that London dinner table of a new, mellow Trump backing away from his campaign rhetoric strike me as a triumph of hope over experience: the lesson of his first term is that he mostly does what he says he is going to do. The British government has made an intelligent start, thanks in part to some brilliant work by the Washington embassy: the phone call after the assassination attempt, the dinner in Trump Tower. But Trump expects people to pay court to him; rewards don\u2019t generally follow. So the groundwork, though necessary, guarantees nothing. Challenging times lie ahead, especially on climate change, tariffs and Ukraine. On climate change, Trump will take America out of the Paris deal, and step up exploitation of oil and gas. The world is already disastrously behind the curve on reaching net zero by 2050: US withdrawal from Paris will make this worse. Though it won\u2019t undo all the damage, the partial remedy here is to work with individual US states, notably environmentally aware California. On tariffs I expect the exact opposite of a mere threat. I think Trump will impose tariffs on all US imports immediately and say: \u201cIf you want them lifted, offer me something to rebalance trade\u201d. The EU will almost certainly retaliate; and the UK will face a difficult decision. Do we match EU retaliatory tariffs? Or do we seek a bilateral deal, like a free trade agreement? I think an FTA would be on offer from Trump, as in 2017: but the top US demand, as was the case then, would be unrestricted access to the UK market for the low-cost products of the US agricultural sector, hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken included. So the stark choice would be: side with the EU or sacrifice our agriculture? On Ukraine, to the extent there is a Trump plan, it seems to involve a ceasefire, creation of a demilitarised zone between the two frontlines, and the opening of negotiations on a permanent peace deal. But JD Vance has suggested that Russia might keep the territory it has captured, and Ukraine might have to promise never to join Nato. In short, it would look like a defeat. I cannot see Zelensky accepting it, and I would expect him to appeal to Europe to backfill for American weapons subsequently denied. So another difficult decision for the prime minister: try to rally Europe to reject US ideas and increase support for Ukraine, or pack up our tents, accept defeat and go home? Three points leap out of this bleak analysis. First, the Democratic party is continuing to misread the American electorate. The biggest issue in this election was always going to be \u201cthe economy, stupid\u201d, after the ravages of inflation over the past four years. Yet they never had a coherent, convincing plan, and Harris was never able to escape from the shadow of the Biden record. Instead they led with issues like reproductive rights, seemingly oblivious to the damage this was doing to their standing in the once-loyally Democratic but also socially conservative Hispanic community, which in the event went massively for Trump: 14 points up on his 2020 result. There are lessons here for centrist parties across Europe: focus on the concerns of the broad mass of the electorate, not the issues that energise your base: in short, stop talking to yourself. Second, we are likely to shortly face some pivotal decisions about whether we side with Europe or an isolationist and protectionist US. And on these two issues our beliefs and values point towards Europe. In this context, the government\u2019s painfully slow and minimalist approach towards the UK/EU reset isn\u2019t good enough. We need the UK/EU security pact soon, so that we have the structures and processes in place with which to manage the issues coming down the road. And we need stronger bilateral partnerships with France and Germany, notwithstanding the current political mess in the latter. And third, the government needs to brace itself for the inevitable storms ahead. Back in November 2017, out of a clear blue Washington sky, Trump retweeted some Islamophobic videos by a far-right group called Britain First, ambushing Theresa May on an African tour. Pressed by the British media to comment, she said that the president \u201chad been wrong to do this\u201d. Trump initially responded angrily, saying May should concentrate on fighting \u201cradical Islamic terror\u201d in Britain, but he later, in an interview with Piers Morgan, retracted and half apologised. And though they were never soulmates, in subsequent encounters there was an undercurrent of respect from Trump. The lesson: sucking up is seen as weakness, straight talking may initially prompt a sharp response, but ultimately wins some respect. In which context, the storm clouds are already gathering on one headline issue. Since his election success, Trump has reaffirmed his intention, as his first priority, to deport 10 million illegal migrants. Imagine how this is going to look: the midnight knocks on doors, the children torn from schools, the deportation camps, the legal challenges, the fraught negotiations with the countries to which they will be returned. The 2018 \u201cchildren in cages\u201d story went global: this will be bigger. And imagine the interventions in prime minister\u2019s questions, not from Kemi Badenoch, but from Keir Starmer\u2019s own backbenchers: does the prime minister condemn these inhuman policies?

She\u2019s looking for bargains during the cost-of-living crisis. \u201cEverything seems to be going up,\u201d the 45-year-old says. \u201cYou have to save where you can.\u201d The carer from Glebe is willing to compromise regarding name brands \u2013 especially given the Reject Shop often changes its product lines. Irwin tends to do the rest of her shopping at Aldi. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk out of Coles with a small basket for anything less than $30,\u201d she says. In the latest Guardian Australia purchasing test, we bought four types of cleaning products from five shops. The categories were: Jif or equivalent cream cleaner and Windex or equivalent glass cleaner, dishwashing liquid and laundry powder. The Sydney stores visited were: Coles, Woolworths, Aldi, Bunnings and the Reject Shop. The test was conducted amid growing public scrutiny of Coles and Woolworths\u2019 pricing strategies and skyrocketing profits. It followed similar purchasing tests focused on fruit and vegetables, meat and fish and dry goods. Guardian Australia visited all of the shops on the same day. Aldi provided the best value across the board, with buyers able to purchase the cheapest versions of the four target products in standard sizes. Jif equivalent was 40% cheaper than at Coles and Woolworths, and the Aldi window cleaner was a quarter of the cost of Windex at the big two supermarkets. The findings were consistent with Choice research that suggested Aldi typically cost 25% less than Coles and Woolworths. Bunnings and the Reject Shop undercut the major supermarkets when it came to the Jif and Windex brands. Windex was a third cheaper at the Reject Shop and nearly 60% cheaper when bought in bulk at Bunnings. Coles, Woolworths and Aldi were the same price for their respective home-brand laundry powder and dishwashing liquid \u2013 with all three selling laundry powder for $1.25/kg and dishwashing liquid for $1.40/L. Purchasing premium name-brand cleaning products in bulk from Bunnings was cheaper by the litre or kilogram than at the major supermarkets \u2013 if you can afford the upfront cost and have the space to store 5L dishwashing liquid bottles and 6kg laundry powder boxes, for example. Coles and Woolworths charged $5.33 a litre for Palmolive ultra-strength dishwashing liquid while at Bunnings a 5L bottle was $4.40/L. At Bunnings, a 6kg box of Omo Active Clean was $7.66/kg while at Coles and Woolworths 2L of the same laundry powder cost $14/kg. Cuddly fabric softener at Bunnings was half the supermarket price \u2013 5L was $10 compared with both Coles and Woolworths which charged $4/L. Bunnings doesn\u2019t, however, stock the cheaper home-brand dishwashing and laundry products. At the Reject Shop, customer Reshma Ravichander is impressed by the bargains in her basket. The 31-year-old chef has found cleaning products much cheaper than the nearby supermarket. She is visiting Sydney from a tiny town in the Northern Territory where the only shop sells a small range of basics at eye-watering mark-ups. \u201cEverything\u2019s cheaper here. A tub of Vanish stain remover is $6.50 \u2013 it\u2019s $23 where I live,\u201d Ravichander says as she picks a bottle of Ajax from The Reject Shop in Glebe, where well-known household brands are sold for below-average prices. \u201cIt\u2019s the same product, you get a good selection and you save more than at Coles and Woolworths.\u201d Aris Veros, 50, a property manager from Sydney\u2019s inner west, agrees.

Both Scoop and The Source sell laundry liquid, fabric softener, floor cleaner and bathroom cleaner by the 100ml \u2013 allowing customers to fill bottles and tubs from home. Not all cleaning products are created equally, of course, and cost is not always linked to effectiveness. Consumer watchdog Choice runs tests across hundreds of household brands. Its top-rated laundry powder, Omo Ultimate, costs $16/kg. However, Choice\u2019s director of reviews and testing, Matthew Steen, says spending a lot of money on cleaning products isn\u2019t necessary. \u201cIf you have really dirty clothing, yes, I think it\u2019s worthwhile saving up towards a more expensive detergent that will perform better,\u201d he says. But for less dirt-prone people \u2013 office workers and those without children \u2013 cheap will often cheerfully do the job. At times, the less expensive product is better, he says. Choice\u2019s dishwashing liquids test ranked Aldi\u2019s Tandil Ultra Power Soak \u2013 which costs a quarter of other high-scoring products \u2013 in first place. Aldi\u2019s Laundrite laundry powder scored only seven percentage points less than the winning Omo Ultimate, despite costing one-tenth as much per wash. Steen suggests buying a product you trust when it is on special \u2013 or not at all. \u201cThe marketers have had a field day,\u201d he says of the various products being sold when often one will do multiple jobs.

Robins and swallows, wrens and the gang-gang. They have a unique sound.\u201d</p>    <p>Gang-gang cockatoos are listed as endangered under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act due to habitat loss in the cool alpine forests they call home.</p> <h2>Rewilding rural Victoria</h2> <p>A similar project is under way at Tillabudgery, a property in the hamlet of Woodfield, near Bonnie Doon, owned by Kirsten Hutchison and her sister Neridda. They inherited the land after their father\u2019s death four years ago and have been continuing his conservation efforts with help from the Victorian government\u2019s BushBank program. The scheme is funding 20,000ha of native forest replanting across the state through partnerships with private landowners.</p> <p>Hutchison says their aim is to provide foraging habitats for the native wildlife, including gang-gangs, through restoring 43ha of native forest.</p> <p>The site is steep and challenging to work on but they have managed to plant thousands of trees and to control weeds, rabbits and sambar deer.</p> <p>\u201cIt is gang-gang cockatoo country,\u201d Hutchison says. \u201cWe sometimes see or hear them during the warmer months when they return to the higher, wetter forests.\u201d</p>    <p>Conservation was their father\u2019s passion. \u201cWe always grew up with a strong sense of moral social conscience when it came to the environment,\u201d Hutchison says. \u201cIt is our hope that our restoration project will help provide more foraging habitat and help buffer the adjacent Maintongoon bushland reserve to reduce any edge effects for [the gang-gang].\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEdge effects\u201d are the intrusion of invasive plants and animals into native vegetation through adjacent cleared farmland.</p>    <p>Sean Dooley, the public affairs manager of Birdlife, an Australian non-profit organisation, says gang-gang cockatoos were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/01/gang-gang-cockatoo-to-become-threatened-species-after-large-drop-in-bird-numbers\">first listed as endangered</a> in 2022.</p> <p>\u201cMany people attribute this uplisting of threatened status to the impacts of the black summer bushfires, however, the declines in population were happening well before this,\u201d Dooley says.</p> <p>The most reliable surveys of the species show population <a href=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species/pubs/768-conservation-advice-02032022.pdf\">declines of as much as 69% between 1999 and 2019</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe black summer bushfires were another hammer blow with somewhere between 28 to 36% of their habitat burnt, and an <a href=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species/pubs/768-conservation-advice-02032022.pdf\">estimated 10% of the population killed in the fires</a>,\u201d Dooley says.</p>    <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/book/7905/\">Action Plan for Australian Birds 2020</a>, habitat loss, particularly nesting hollows, due to land-clearing and continuing native forest logging is the main threat to the bird.</p> <p>Hutchison says she and her sister are also working with the conservation organisation Trust for Nature to permanently protect the property in a conservation covenant, ensuring it remains a long-term habitat for the cockatoos.</p> <p>\u201cDad spent most of his time on the property and really threw himself into planting trees on the land,\u201d she says. \u201cWe thought we would fulfil Dad\u2019s dream and legacy, transform his property and leave something for the future.\u201d</p> <p>At Karlindy, Kruen has a similar plan: \u201cThe aim is to bring it as close as I can to what it was 200 years ago.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/14/sign-up-for-rural-network-guardian-australia-email-newsletter-about-regional-affairs?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter</a></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Three and a half years ago, Karst Kreun bought 60 hectares (150 acres) of land by Mount Buller in memory of his late wife, Lindy. Located in Mansfield in Victoria\u2019s north-east, the property, named \u201cKarlindy\u201d after his wife, had been used for generations for intense farming and seed production. \u201cIt had 11 mature trees on it,\u201d Kreun says. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Kruen has planted 13,500 native trees and shrubs so far and is aiming for 90,000 by the time he is finished. \u201cI\u2019ve always been keen on conservation and I thought this was a good project to work on,\u201d he says of his mission to attract more birds and wildlife. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter \u201cThey come for miles. Robins and swallows, wrens and the gang-gang. They have a unique sound.\u201d Gang-gang cockatoos are listed as endangered under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act due to habitat loss in the cool alpine forests they call home. Rewilding rural Victoria A similar project is under way at Tillabudgery, a property in the hamlet of Woodfield, near Bonnie Doon, owned by Kirsten Hutchison and her sister Neridda. They inherited the land after their father\u2019s death four years ago and have been continuing his conservation efforts with help from the Victorian government\u2019s BushBank program. The scheme is funding 20,000ha of native forest replanting across the state through partnerships with private landowners. Hutchison says their aim is to provide foraging habitats for the native wildlife, including gang-gangs, through restoring 43ha of native forest. The site is steep and challenging to work on but they have managed to plant thousands of trees and to control weeds, rabbits and sambar deer. \u201cIt is gang-gang cockatoo country,\u201d Hutchison says. \u201cWe sometimes see or hear them during the warmer months when they return to the higher, wetter forests.\u201d Conservation was their father\u2019s passion. \u201cWe always grew up with a strong sense of moral social conscience when it came to the environment,\u201d Hutchison says. \u201cIt is our hope that our restoration project will help provide more foraging habitat and help buffer the adjacent Maintongoon bushland reserve to reduce any edge effects for [the gang-gang].\u201d \u201cEdge effects\u201d are the intrusion of invasive plants and animals into native vegetation through adjacent cleared farmland. Sean Dooley, the public affairs manager of Birdlife, an Australian non-profit organisation, says gang-gang cockatoos were first listed as endangered in 2022. \u201cMany people attribute this uplisting of threatened status to the impacts of the black summer bushfires, however, the declines in population were happening well before this,\u201d Dooley says. The most reliable surveys of the species show population declines of as much as 69% between 1999 and 2019. \u201cThe black summer bushfires were another hammer blow with somewhere between 28 to 36% of their habitat burnt, and an estimated 10% of the population killed in the fires,\u201d Dooley says. According to the Action Plan for Australian Birds 2020, habitat loss, particularly nesting hollows, due to land-clearing and continuing native forest logging is the main threat to the bird. Hutchison says she and her sister are also working with the conservation organisation Trust for Nature to permanently protect the property in a conservation covenant, ensuring it remains a long-term habitat for the cockatoos. \u201cDad spent most of his time on the property and really threw himself into planting trees on the land,\u201d she says. \u201cWe thought we would fulfil Dad\u2019s dream and legacy, transform his property and leave something for the future.\u201d At Karlindy, Kruen has a similar plan: \u201cThe aim is to bring it as close as I can to what it was 200 years ago.\u201d Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter",

Since then, I honestly can\u2019t think of anyone I feel competitive with in that way. I feel pretty content.</p> <p><strong>What do you do when you can\u2019t get to sleep? I need to tell you that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/24/carrie-brownstein-sleater-kinney-australia-new-zealand-tour-interview\">when we did this with Carrie Brownstein from Sleater-Kinney</a>, she said she listens to your podcasts to go to sleep because you have a soothing, mellifluous voice.</strong></p> <p>Oh my God! I loved her audiobook so I could definitely reciprocate. I thought her voice was fantastic!</p> <p>But lately I listen to podcasts that have nothing to do with my work. Like the BBC show In Our Time, which is really interesting but not in a way that\u2019s going to wake you up. And an unbelievably good podcast called Fall of Civilizations. This guy takes a different civilization and talks about why it fell apart and what it would have been like to live through the death of ancient Egypt or Roman Britain.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a party trick?</strong></p> <p>Quite often I tell the story about how I was nearly killed on a Concorde flight sitting next to Keith Richards. I guess that\u2019s my party trick.</p> <p><strong>WHAT?</strong></p> <p>[Laughs] Shall I tell you that story? This is like my top-shelf anecdote.</p> <p>It\u2019s about 1996. I\u2019m invited to a party at Paisley Park where Prince is going to be performing his new record, and they\u2019re going to fly me on Concorde.</p> <p>I\u2019ll skip <a href=\"https://x.com/jonronson/status/1472196435525447688?lang=en\">some of the details</a>. But I sit down next to Keith Richards. I\u2019m thinking, I\u2019m going to have to spend the next four hours pretending I don\u2019t know I\u2019m sitting next to Keith Richards. But Keith Richards immediately hooks me in the ribs and starts saying things like [Keith Richards voice]: \u201cI\u2019ve done everything, man!\u201d I swear to God, he said that.</p> <p>The plane takes off, and it reaches Mach 2 \u2013 you can feel it when it beats the sound barrier, and there\u2019s a little ripple of applause. But then the plane starts to slow down, and the captain comes on the tannoy and says: \u201cYou may have noticed that CHHK-\u201d and the tannoy is not working! \u201c- hydraulic fuel, CHHHK.\u201d</p> <p>The person in front of me, who was the head of Capital Records in London, said, \u201cApparently the last time this happened, they gave everybody \u00a3500 Marks &amp; Spencers vouchers!\u201d And people were like, \u201cOoh, did you hear that? We could get some vouchers!\u201d</p> <p>So the captain comes out of the cockpit and starts addressing people four by four, because the tannoy isn\u2019t working. He gets to me and Keith Richards and says, \u201cWe\u2019ve lost all of our hydraulic fuel, we\u2019re going to turn back to Heathrow, we may or may not make it.\u201d The guy in front was whispering: <em>\u201cThe vouchers! Ask him about the vouchers!\u201d</em></p> <p>Keith Richards was like: \u201cI don\u2019t care. But I tell you who is going to be really pissed off? Mick \u2013 he\u2019s down at the front.\u201d So Mick Jagger comes over and they\u2019re going, \u201cFucking hell, we\u2019re never going to get to the party now\u201d \u2013 and he and Keith Richards are standing there having this big conversation right in front of me while the plane is leaking hydraulic fuel. And I\u2019m thinking, if this plane crashes, all the headlines are going to be: \u201cMick Jagger, Keith Richards, Liam Neeson and 97 others \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>We get back to Heathrow. We get on another Concorde. We go to New York. At Prince\u2019s house, this journalist says to me, \u201cI heard that you were in an incident on Concorde, sitting next to Keith Richards. Were you scared?\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah, I was a little bit scared.\u201d And he said, \u201cWas Keith Richards scared?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, Keith Richards didn\u2019t seem that scared.\u201d</p> <p>The next day, my wife phones me up and says, \u201cHave you seen the papers?\u201d She read out a page from the Sun and it was like: \u201c\u2018I was terrified!\u2019 said passenger Ronson, \u2018but not Keith. Keith just knocked back another Jack Daniels.\u2019\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://fane.com.au/show/jon-ronsons-psychopath-night-2024/\">Jon Ronson is speaking</a> in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra and Wellington, 20-26 November.</em></p></li> </ul>",

I loved her audiobook so I could definitely reciprocate. I thought her voice was fantastic! But lately I listen to podcasts that have nothing to do with my work. Like the BBC show In Our Time, which is really interesting but not in a way that\u2019s going to wake you up. And an unbelievably good podcast called Fall of Civilizations. This guy takes a different civilization and talks about why it fell apart and what it would have been like to live through the death of ancient Egypt or Roman Britain. Do you have a party trick? Quite often I tell the story about how I was nearly killed on a Concorde flight sitting next to Keith Richards. I guess that\u2019s my party trick. WHAT? [Laughs] Shall I tell you that story? This is like my top-shelf anecdote. It\u2019s about 1996. I\u2019m invited to a party at Paisley Park where Prince is going to be performing his new record, and they\u2019re going to fly me on Concorde. I\u2019ll skip some of the details. But I sit down next to Keith Richards. I\u2019m thinking, I\u2019m going to have to spend the next four hours pretending I don\u2019t know I\u2019m sitting next to Keith Richards. But Keith Richards immediately hooks me in the ribs and starts saying things like [Keith Richards voice]: \u201cI\u2019ve done everything, man!\u201d I swear to God, he said that. The plane takes off, and it reaches Mach 2 \u2013 you can feel it when it beats the sound barrier, and there\u2019s a little ripple of applause. But then the plane starts to slow down, and the captain comes on the tannoy and says: \u201cYou may have noticed that CHHK-\u201d and the tannoy is not working! \u201c- hydraulic fuel, CHHHK.\u201d The person in front of me, who was the head of Capital Records in London, said, \u201cApparently the last time this happened, they gave everybody \u00a3500 Marks &amp; Spencers vouchers!\u201d And people were like, \u201cOoh, did you hear that? We could get some vouchers!\u201d So the captain comes out of the cockpit and starts addressing people four by four, because the tannoy isn\u2019t working. He gets to me and Keith Richards and says, \u201cWe\u2019ve lost all of our hydraulic fuel, we\u2019re going to turn back to Heathrow, we may or may not make it.\u201d The guy in front was whispering: \u201cThe vouchers! Ask him about the vouchers!\u201d Keith Richards was like: \u201cI don\u2019t care. But I tell you who is going to be really pissed off? Mick \u2013 he\u2019s down at the front.\u201d So Mick Jagger comes over and they\u2019re going, \u201cFucking hell, we\u2019re never going to get to the party now\u201d \u2013 and he and Keith Richards are standing there having this big conversation right in front of me while the plane is leaking hydraulic fuel. And I\u2019m thinking, if this plane crashes, all the headlines are going to be: \u201cMick Jagger, Keith Richards, Liam Neeson and 97 others \u2026 \u201d We get back to Heathrow. We get on another Concorde. We go to New York. At Prince\u2019s house, this journalist says to me, \u201cI heard that you were in an incident on Concorde, sitting next to Keith Richards. Were you scared?\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah, I was a little bit scared.\u201d And he said, \u201cWas Keith Richards scared?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, Keith Richards didn\u2019t seem that scared.\u201d The next day, my wife phones me up and says, \u201cHave you seen the papers?\u201d She read out a page from the Sun and it was like: \u201c\u2018I was terrified!\u2019 said passenger Ronson, \u2018but not Keith. Keith just knocked back another Jack Daniels.\u2019\u201d Jon Ronson is speaking in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra and Wellington, 20-26 November.",

It was not the first time she\u2019d faced assumptions about her and her baby\u2019s health based on her body size alone. Ahlia has had three healthy pregnancies with normal blood pressure and glucose levels, no pre-existing conditions and a nutritious diet \u2013 yet she has consistently come up against weight stigma. At her GP appointment after she became pregnant with her second child, she expressed an interest in a water birth. \u201cThe GP just laughed in my face and told me that would never happen.\u201d Health guidelines for a water birth mention \u201cexcessive\u201d weight as a risk only because of the need to ensure a woman in labour can be moved out of the water in an emergency. Ahlia worked on a care plan with her midwife, including safety planning for her partner to be able to lift her out if needed, which was signed off by the consultant doctor. But when she arrived at the hospital in labour and asked for the bath to be put on, Ahlia says the midwife on duty looked at her and said they would have to \u201cjust see about that\u201d. This delay initiating Ahlia\u2019s labour plan led to what she describes as \u201ca bit of a traumatic birth\u201d.

Weight stigma is already more prevalent towards women. Women during preconception, pregnancy and postpartum are particularly vulnerable \u2013 and weight stigma has been shown to have negative health outcomes for mother and child. But a study published in the journal Health Psychology Review earlier this year proposes a new model for reducing weight stigma around pregnancy. Dr Briony Hill and PhD candidate Haimanot Hailu, from Monash University\u2019s School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, led the study. Hill says society\u2019s punishing beauty and behaviour standards for women extend directly to this form of \u201cmum shaming\u201d \u2013 \u201cblaming mothers for their weight and their body size, thinking that it\u2019s making them better by shaming them\u201d. \u201cIn reality, we are not 100% individually responsible for our weight, our body size, our body shape, because it\u2019s mostly genetically determined,\u201d Hill says. \u201cEliminating weight stigma is about looking at the person as a whole, rather than just making assumptions about them purely based on their looks or their body size.\u201d The authors noted stigmatisation begins with labelling women at a higher risk of infertility or pregnancy-related complications due to their body size. Negative impacts of weight stigma around pregnancy include avoiding engaging with healthcare, psychological stress, reduced motivation to engage in healthy behaviours and disordered eating \u2013 which themselves can contribute towards maternal obesity. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Other examples discussed in the study were societal expectations around \u201cideal\u201d weight before becoming pregnant, negative remarks about gestational weight gain, and pressure to \u201cbounce back\u201d to pre-pregnancy body weight. Dr Gillian Gibson, the president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (Ranzcog), says while there are pregnancy risks associated with both a low or high BMI, \u201cRanzcog acknowledges the importance of providing all women with care that is free of stigma and prejudice/discrimination\u201d. \u201cAn assessment of a woman\u2019s overall health and wellbeing, including factors such as weight, is more complex than determination by a single indicator such as BMI,\u201d Gibson says. While healthcare is one of the biggest areas where weight stigma presents, Hill says clinicians\u2019 behaviours stem from societal norms \u2013 which are the root cause that need to be tackled. Beyond increasing public awareness about obesity factors, the study\u2019s model proposes several interventions. These include tackling the normalising of weight stigma such as \u201cover-medicalisation of obesity\u201d, as well as equipping professionals to improve communication skills around the issue, and ultimately targeting structural stigma through strategies such as inclusive healthcare policies. Dr Fiona Willer, the vice-president of Dieticians Australia and lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology, praises the Monash researchers\u2019 model for addressing of the broad scope of precursors to weight stigma for this demographic in particular. She says the study addressed the prejudicial and stereotypical ideas health professionals hold: \u201cThat is how they end up delivering the care that they deliver, that\u2019s subpar for large-bodied women.\u201d \u201cI do agree with [the study\u2019s] position that in trying to \u2018help\u2019, there are all of these unintended consequences, and it\u2019s actually those consequences that we need to pay very close attention to if we\u2019re wanting to do care better,\u201d Willer says. Willer says campaigns that simply say \u201cstigma is bad\u201d can have the opposite effect, opening the door to further stigmatising attitudes and beliefs. \u201cThe kind of intervention that is effective for reducing stigma is making visibility of the people who have got these stigmatised characteristics, making those people much more visible in positions of power, making decisions, fully integrated into the system.\u201d *First name only used for privacy reasons.",

This is an outburst of antisemitism that I hope to never see again.\u201d The Dutch prime minister announced he had cancelled his trip to the Cop29 climate summit due to the events. \u201cI will not be going to Azerbaijan next week for the UN Climate Conference COP29. Due to the major social impact of the events of last Thursday night in Amsterdam, I will remain in the Netherlands,\u201d Dick Schoof said on X on Saturday. The Dutch climate minister, Sophie Hermans, will still attend the 11-22 November environment meeting while a climate envoy will replace Schoof, the premier added, saying Thursday night\u2019s violence in Amsterdam would be discussed at Monday\u2019s cabinet meeting. Antisemitic incidents have increased in the Netherlands since Israel launched its latest attack on Gaza in response to Hamas\u2019s surprise attack on 7 October. Several Jewish organisations and schools have reported threats and hate mail. Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office described a \u201cplanned antisemitic attack against Israeli citizens\u201d and asked that protection for the Dutch Jewish community increased. He even compared the incident to Kristallnacht, or the \u201cNight of Broken Glass,\u201d a Nazi terror campaign perpetrated on Germany\u2019s Jewish population in 1938 in which an estimated 91 Jews were murdered. \u201cTomorrow, 86 years ago, was Kristallnacht \u2013 an attack on Jews, whatever Jews they are, on European soil. It\u2019s back now \u2013 yesterday, we celebrated it on the streets of Amsterdam.\u201d The Amsterdam police chief, Peter Holla, said there had been \u201cincidents on both sides\u201d. A video on social media showed Maccabi fans setting off flares and chanting, \u201cOl\u00e9, ol\u00e9, let the IDF win, we will fuck the Arabs.\u201d The police chief said a large crowd of Maccabi fans then gathered on Dam Square on Thursday lunchtime, where there were \u201cfights on both sides\u201d. On Wednesday night, Maccabi fans stole a Palestinian flag from a building in the city centre and shouted, \u201cfuck you, Palestine\u201d. Holla said Maccabi supporters then vandalised a taxi. The US president, Joe Biden, condemned the attacks on Thursday as \u201cdespicable\u201d and said they \u201cecho dark moments in history when Jews were persecuted\u201d. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, was shocked by the violence in Amsterdam, a UN spokesperson said.",

      "body": "<p>Sir David Hare has charted the forces and habits shaping British life for more than half a century, on stage and on screen. His work for cinema stretches from the 1985 film of his play <em>Plenty</em>, starring Meryl Streep, to his screenplays for <em>Damage</em>, <em>The Hours</em> and 2016\u2019s <em>Denial</em>. And his string of theatrical \u201cstate of the nation\u201d accounts of political and moral dilemmas, with hits such as <em>Pravda</em>, starring Anthony Hopkins, <em>The Absence of War</em>, starring John Thaw, and <em>Amy\u2019s View</em>, with Judi Dench, have regularly set the cultural agenda.</p> <p>But now, at 77, Hare has revealed he is to seriously step up his work rate because he fears that, for him, it is already \u201cfive minutes to midnight\u201d and so he has limited scope remaining to tell important stories.</p> <p>The leading playwright and Bafta-winning director now has three new dramas in production and plans for more. \u201cI have written three new plays that are going to be on in different places and I have done that partly because of my sense that I don\u2019t have much time. I am trying to write a lot of stuff while I can,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Among the new work is a play, <em>Grace Pervades</em>, about the Victorian actor Henry Irving, played by Ralph Fiennes, alongside other projects on issues that may include the migrant crisis and the gangs that profit from it and a possible look at the Westminster gamesmanship he believes now dominates party politics.</p>    <p>Hare said he is still repeatedly drawn to stories about Britain, rather than America. He is worried, he added, about the growing distrust of experts, whether doctors, scientists, academics or engineers.</p> <p>It is a topic close to his heart, as he releases in November a podcast version of his acclaimed one-man play, <em>Beat the Devil</em>, the work that told of his personal struggle both to understand and to survive the first wave of the Covid epidemic.</p> <p>Hare said he suspects the new podcast, available on Audible, might deliver a cathartic jolt, taking listeners back to a painful period which damaged families and altered Britain politically for ever by undermining trust in government and highlighting the underfunding of the National Health Service and the care system. \u201cThere is a movement out there today that pretends the lockdowns were not necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want people to remember how incredibly dangerous the illness was for some people at that early stage and that it was science and medicine that got us out, by solving something that had initially bewildered and confounded them all. The myth is that we didn\u2019t need saving and that a first natural cull of the weakest would have been fine. People can express that opinion, but it is wrong. It was science and medicine that came to our rescue, just as it is always learning that has eased human suffering over the decades.\u201d</p> <p>Incensed by Kemi Badenoch\u2019s recent suggestion that the seriousness of the \u201cpartygate\u201d incident was overblown, Hare argues it was \u201cone of those massive political moments that resulted in a huge loss of trust in all politicians, sadly\u201d. He remains convinced that \u201cthe fact that No 10 had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/gray-report-criticises-boris-johnson-team-excessive-alcohol-culture\">installed a wine fridge</a> and had wine Fridays, while the rest of us were trying to stick to the rules, was very damaging\u201d.</p>    <p>\u201c<em>Beat the Devil</em> came out of a three-minute interview I gave on BBC Radio 4\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme when they asked me to describe the illness. I wanted to make the point that at first the scientists and doctors did not really know what it was or how to treat it. There was a feeling of slight hysteria and ignorance, with physical signals doctors had depended on for centuries no longer applying.</p> <p>\u201cWe now know that most people died when the virus got to their lungs and gave them pneumonia. Luckily, I was instinctively flooding my body with water, and I think that helped me recover.\u201d</p> <p>The stage premiere of <em>Beat the Devil</em>, with Fiennes in the role of the playwright, reopened at London\u2019s Bridge Theatre after lockdown for a limited, socially-distanced audience. It recounted how Hare had fallen ill on the March day that Boris Johnson\u2019s government first limited social interactions.</p> <p>It recalls Hare\u2019s perplexing symptoms and the delirium that mixed his nightmares with the political mis-steps he was witnessing. The <em>Observer</em>\u2019s critic Susannah Clapp <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/sep/06/beat-the-devil-david-hare-ralph-fieness-bridge-review-sleepless-the-musical-kimberley-walsh-jay-mcguinness\">praised Nicholas Hytner\u2019s original production</a> for shining a light on a regime \u201ctoo late locking down, slow to supply PPE and shuffling people from hospital to care home\u201d.</p> <p>A year ago in New York, Hare performed the monologue at the Public Theater and he now does the same for the podcast, hoping to express \u201cthe rage and urgency I felt during this harrowing time\u201d.</p> <p>Hare has previously performed his own works, <em>Via Dolorosa</em> and <em>Wall</em>, both about the conflict between Palestine and Israel. He believes, he said, that he has also managed to write works that tackle three key events in British history. First, his verbatim play <em>Stuff Happens</em>, on the diplomatic lead-up to the Iraq war, then <em>The Power of Yes</em>, about the 2008 financial crisis, and finally, Covid in <em>Beat the Devil</em>.</p> <p>\u201cLooking back, now I think I was right to chose these as the significant issues,\u201d he said.</p>",

It was science and medicine that came to our rescue, just as it is always learning that has eased human suffering over the decades.\u201d Incensed by Kemi Badenoch\u2019s recent suggestion that the seriousness of the \u201cpartygate\u201d incident was overblown, Hare argues it was \u201cone of those massive political moments that resulted in a huge loss of trust in all politicians, sadly\u201d. He remains convinced that \u201cthe fact that No 10 had installed a wine fridge and had wine Fridays, while the rest of us were trying to stick to the rules, was very damaging\u201d. \u201cBeat the Devil came out of a three-minute interview I gave on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme when they asked me to describe the illness. I wanted to make the point that at first the scientists and doctors did not really know what it was or how to treat it. There was a feeling of slight hysteria and ignorance, with physical signals doctors had depended on for centuries no longer applying. \u201cWe now know that most people died when the virus got to their lungs and gave them pneumonia. Luckily, I was instinctively flooding my body with water, and I think that helped me recover.\u201d The stage premiere of Beat the Devil, with Fiennes in the role of the playwright, reopened at London\u2019s Bridge Theatre after lockdown for a limited, socially-distanced audience. It recounted how Hare had fallen ill on the March day that Boris Johnson\u2019s government first limited social interactions. It recalls Hare\u2019s perplexing symptoms and the delirium that mixed his nightmares with the political mis-steps he was witnessing. The Observer\u2019s critic Susannah Clapp praised Nicholas Hytner\u2019s original production for shining a light on a regime \u201ctoo late locking down, slow to supply PPE and shuffling people from hospital to care home\u201d. A year ago in New York, Hare performed the monologue at the Public Theater and he now does the same for the podcast, hoping to express \u201cthe rage and urgency I felt during this harrowing time\u201d. Hare has previously performed his own works, Via Dolorosa and Wall, both about the conflict between Palestine and Israel. He believes, he said, that he has also managed to write works that tackle three key events in British history. First, his verbatim play Stuff Happens, on the diplomatic lead-up to the Iraq war, then The Power of Yes, about the 2008 financial crisis, and finally, Covid in Beat the Devil. \u201cLooking back, now I think I was right to chose these as the significant issues,\u201d he said.",

Gulf state that allowing the militant Islamist group to have a base there is no longer acceptable.</p> <p>Qatar, a key US partner in the Middle East, has hosted the political office of Hamas for more than a decade and allowed many senior leaders of the organisation to live there.</p> <p>The request was reported by Reuters late on Friday but has yet to be officially confirmed.</p> <p>\u201cAfter rejecting repeated proposals to release hostages, [Hamas] leaders should no longer be welcome in the capitals of any American partner. We made that clear to Qatar following Hamas\u2019s rejection weeks ago of another hostage release proposal,\u201d the senior official told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</p> <p>Critics of the US request say it will hinder engagement with elements of Hamas potentially more inclined to compromise, and could boost the influence of more hostile states, such as Iran, over the group.</p> <p>Hamas still holds about 100 hostages seized during its surprise attack into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a> last October. Multiple rounds of negotiations aimed at securing an end to the 13 month-long war in Gaza have failed.</p> <p>The small but influential Gulf state has been a key intermediary in the talks to broker a ceasefire and is likely to comply with the US request, analysts said. The US official told Reuters that Qatar, which is designated as a major non-Nato ally by Washington, passed on the demand to Hamas leaders about 10 days ago.</p> <p>Hamas leaders have been preparing for many months to leave Qatar, with Turkey and Iraq suggested as possible alternatives. The group recently opened a political office in Baghdad.</p> <p>Hamas officials denied Qatar has told the organisation to leave and there has been no reaction from Qatar\u2019s foreign ministry to the reports.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/09/hamas-may-have-to-quit-political-base-in-qatar-after-us-demand\">Hamas may have to quit political base in Qatar after US \u2018demand\u2019</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-672f4f678f088b29b8c42754\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-09T12:04:10.112Z\">12.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Israeli </strong>air strikes on the <strong>Lebanese</strong> coastal city of <strong>Tyre</strong> have now killed seven people.</p> <p>Reuters reported that Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said the death toll has risen from three to seven after the attack on Friday.</p> <p>Another 46 people are injured, it added.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-672f487b8f08a089b90bb8e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-09T11:35:22.711Z\">11.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Lebanon </strong>has fired five rockets at <strong>Israel</strong>, with the munitions either being intercepted or falling into open areas, Israel has said.</p> <p>The Israeli air force posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that sirens were sounded in Western and Upper Galilee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IAFsite/status/1855203890142105861\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"iw\" dir=\"rtl\">\u05d1\u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05da \u05dc\u05d4\u05ea\u05e8\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05d4\u05d5\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05e9\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea 12:42-12:43 \u05d1\u05de\u05e8\u05d7\u05d1 \u05d4\u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05df, \u05d6\u05d5\u05d4\u05d5 \u05db\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d9\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05d7\u05e6\u05d5, \u05d7\u05dc\u05e7\u05dd \u05d9\u05d5\u05e8\u05d8\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d4\u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e4\u05dc\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e9\u05d8\u05d7 \u05e4\u05ea\u05d5\u05d7.</p>&mdash; Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IAFsite/status/1855203890142105861?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 9, 2024</a></blockquote>   </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-672f3ee48f088b29b8c42714\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-09T10:55:01.227Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More than 43,000 <strong>Palestinians</strong> have been killed since the start of the conflict last year, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said.</p> <p>In its latest update, it said 43,552 have been killed with 102,765 others injured, since Hamas\u2019 terror attack on Israel on 7 October last year, which saw Israel retaliate, pledging to eliminate the terror group.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-672f326a8f08a089b90bb850\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-09T10:14:04.967Z\">10.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Dutch</strong> government is investigating if it missed possible warning signs from <strong>Israel</strong> in the events leading up to this week\u2019s violence between football fans in <strong>Amsterdam</strong>, justice minister David van Weel said in a letter to parliament.</p> <p>\u201cAn investigation is still being conducted on possible warning signs from Israel\u201d, Van Weel said in his letter late on Friday evening.</p> <p>At least five people were injured during the assaults on Thursday night and treated in hospital.

      "bodyText": "Six people have died in an Israeli attack in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City on Saturday morning. Al Jazeera reported that two families were killed in the attack on the Fahd al-Sabah school. Israeli airstrikes attacked a Hezbollah headquarters in Lebanon\u2019s capital Beirut overnight. The Israeli Defence Force (IDF) has said it also struck a weapons production site and other areas used by the terror group. Lebanon fired five rockets at Israel, leading to sirens being sounded in Western and Upper Galilee. The munitions either being intercepted or falling into open areas. Seven people have now been killed following Israeli air strikes on the Lebanese coastal city of Tyre. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said the death toll had risen from three after the attack on Friday, in which 46 people were injured. Qatar has withdrawn as a key mediator for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal due to refusal by both Israel and Hamas to negotiate. A diplomatic source told AFP on Saturday that both sides have been informed that the Gulf state won\u2019t mediate \u201cas long as there is a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith\u201d. Hamas may be forced to close its offices in Qatar. The US has told the tiny Gulf state that it is no longer acceptable to allow the Islamist group to have a base there. Dutch prosecutors expect to make more arrests in connection with the clashes involving Israeli football fans in Amsterdam on Thursday night. Clashes after a Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv led to police detaining 62 people. Dutch prime minister Dick Schoof has canceled a trip to United Nations climate talks next week to deal with the fallout. Schoof will miss the COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan as investigations continue into whether warning signs were missed. There is a \u201cstrong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas\u201d of the northern Gaza Strip, a committee of global food security experts has warned. Israel has denied the claim made by the independent Famine Review Committee (FRC), arguing that it has relied on unreliable data. There are \u2018severe cases of food insecurity, illness, and thirst\u2019 in Gaza, a partner of ActionAid has warned. A committee of global food security experts has warned that there is a \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d of imminent famine in areas of the northern Gaza Strip. The independent Famine Review Committee (FRC) has said that immediate action within days is \u201crequired from all actors who are directly taking part in the conflict\u201d. Amjad Al-Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network (PNGO) \u2013 a partner of ActionAid\u2019s in Gaza \u2013 described the situation as \u201cvery critical\u201d. We are passing through the worst time in this war. We are suffering from severe food insecurity. The majority of the people cannot find food, whether in the market or from the small amounts of humanitarian aid which have been permitted to enter the Gaza Strip in different areas. Supplies for the bakeries have become very limited, so some bakeries closed their doors and they cannot produce more bread. Community kitchens have stopped cooking hot meals for the families who have become dependent on them. 300,000 people are dependent on these meals. This will lead to famine and, for sure, severe food insecurity for women and children. Israel has said these reports are overstated, with its military claiming that the FRC has relied on unreliable data. There is a \u201cstrong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas\u201d of the northern Gaza Strip, a committee of global food security experts has warned, as Israel claims to be pursuing a military offensive against Palestinian militant group Hamas in the area. \u201cImmediate action, within days not weeks, is required from all actors who are directly taking part in the conflict, or have influence on its conduct, to avert and alleviate this catastrophic situation,\u201d the independent Famine Review Committee (FRC) said in a rare alert. The warning comes just days ahead of a US deadline for Israel to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which the UN said almost a year ago had been made \u201cuninhabitable\u201d by Israeli attacks, or face potential restrictions on US military aid. A Maersk container ship has been denied entry to the Spanish port of Algeciras amid claims it was transporting arms to Israel. The Danish shipping company denied the accusation on Saturday, telling AFP in a statement: \u201cThe cargo to be trans-shipped through the port does not include any military weapons or ammunition.\u201d Spanish government officials said earlier this week that the vessel \u201cwill not stop in Spain\u201d, according to media reports. Spain, which is urging European allies to recognise a Palestinian state, has refused docking to ships transporting arms to Israel. \u201cTo gain clarity for future operations, we have consulted the Spanish authorities to understand why entry was denied for cargo no different than previous shipments that have routinely been trans-shipped through this port without incident,\u201d Maersk said. \u201cSpain \u2026 is now rejecting vessels that carry anything military related going to, or from, Israel, notwithstanding such cargo being legal.\u201d The ship was diverted to Tangier and is now en route to Oman, according to the VesselFinder site. Dutch prosecutors expect to make more arrests in connection with what authorities called \u201chateful antisemitic violence\u201d against Israeli football fans. Clashes which took place on Thursday after a Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv led to police detaining 62 people in Amsterdam. According to prosecutors 40 suspects have been given fines for disturbing public order. In light of the clashes the decision was taken to ban demonstrations for three days from Friday. Amsterdam\u2019s police chief, Peter Holla, said there had been \u201cincidents on both sides\u201d starting on Wednesday night. A plane chartered by the Israeli government to bring supporters home landed on Friday at Israel\u2019s Ben Gurion airport. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof has canceled a trip to United Nations climate talks next week to deal with the fallout. Reuters reported that Schoof will miss the COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan as his government investigates if warning signs were missed. Israeli attacks have killed at least 3,136 people and injured 13,979 in Lebanon, the news agency Reuters has reported. The Lebanese health ministry said in a statement that 19 fatalities were reported on Friday. On Saturday evening several areas in Lebanon have come under Israeli attack. The Jerusalem Post has reported that the IDF is attacking Tyre, Baalbek, and southern Lebanon after rocket alert sirens were heard throughout Israel\u2019s north earlier in the day. Safety guidelines to residents of northern Israel have eased, the military has said. Israeli military said on Saturday that safety guidelines for residents of northern Israel had been eased to \u201cfull activity\u201d from \u201cpartial activity\u201d. The news agency Reuters has reported that gatherings are now restricted to a maximum of 2,000 people. Several areas in Lebanon have come under Israeli attack on Saturday evening, according to reports. The IDF is attacking Tyre, Baalbek, and southern Lebanon, the Jerusalem Post reported, after rocket alert sirens were heard throughout Israel\u2019s north earlier in the day. Several rockets were reportedly seen crossing from Lebanon and falling into open areas. A senior Hamas official told AFP on Saturday that the militant group had received no indication from Qatar that it should leave the country, where its political office has been based for years. It comes as Qatar reportedly said it was withdrawing from its role mediating talks between Israel and Hamas to bring the conflict to an end. They also said the office was \u201cno longer\u201d serving its purpose. \u201cWe have nothing to confirm or deny regarding what was published by an unidentified diplomatic source and we have not received any request to leave Qatar,\u201d the official said from Doha, after a diplomatic source told AFP. Qatar, with the United Sates and Egypt, has been engaged in months of fruitless negotiations for a truce with hostage and prisoner releases. The informed source said Qatar had already \u201cnotified both sides, Israel and Hamas as well as the US administration\u201d of its decision. \u201cThe Qataris conveyed to the US administration that they would be ready to re-engage in mediation when both sides \u2026 demonstrate a sincere willingness to return to the negotiating table\u201d, the source added. Qatar has withdrawn as a key mediator for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, and warned Hamas that its Doha office \u201cno longer serves its purpose\u201d, a diplomatic source told AFP on Saturday. \u201cThe Qataris informed both the Israelis and Hamas that as long as there is a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith, they cannot continue to mediate. As a consequence, the Hamas political office no longer serves its purpose,\u201d the source said on condition of anonymity. It comes as the US told the gulf state that allowing the militant Islamist group to have a base there is no longer acceptable. Qatar has been home to a Hamas political office for more than a decade. Senior leaders of the terror group have also lived there. The news agency Reuters has spoken to the family of a Palestinian child who was killed by an Israeli airstrike on Gaza on Friday. A Gaza family sat weeping on Saturday over children killed by an Israeli strike as they were getting ready to play soccer, amid an intensified bombardment that Palestinian health authorities said has killed 44 people over the past 24 hours. The strike was in Mawasi, a southern coastal area where hundreds of thousands of people have sought shelter after Israel\u2019s military told them to leave other areas it was bombing in its war against Hamas. \u201cThe rocket struck them. There were no wanted or targeted people there and there was nobody else in the street. Just the children who were killed yesterday,\u201d said Mohammed Zanoun, a relative of the dead children. Palestinian health authorities say Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 43,500 people, with another 10,000 believed to be dead and uncounted under the rubble. Israel launched its offensive in response to the attack on Oct. 7 2023, when Hamas gunmen stormed border defences and rampaged through Israeli communities killing 1,200 people and seizing about 250 as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.# The conflict has expanded, with Israel also fighting the Iran-backed Hezbollah group in Lebanon. An Israeli strike on Tyre in southern Lebanon killed at least seven people on Saturday, Lebanese health authorities said. The U.N. Human Rights Office said on Friday that nearly 70% of fatalities it had verified in Gaza were women and children. Israel\u2019s diplomatic mission in Geneva, where the office is based, said it categorically rejected the report, saying it did not accurately reflect realities on the ground. Israel has said reports warning of a potential famine in Gaza are overstated, with its military saying the independent Famine Review Committee (FRC) was relying on unreliable data. \u201cUnfortunately, the researchers continue to rely on partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests,\u201d the military said in a statement, Reuters reports. The FRC said on Friday in a rare alert that there was a strong likelihood of imminent famine in parts of north Gaza with immediate action required from the warring parties to ease a catastrophic situation. Israel\u2019s military said it had increased aid efforts including opening an additional crossing on Friday. In the last two months, 39,000 trucks carrying more than 840,000 tons of food have entered Gaza, it said, and meetings were taking place daily with the U.N. which had 700 trucks of aid awaiting pickup and distribution. With some critics decrying a starvation tactic in north Gaza, Israel\u2019s main ally the U.S. has set a deadline within days for it to improve the humanitarian situation or face potential restrictions on military cooperation. More on the Israeli airstrikes on the Lebanese city of Tyre, where the country\u2019s health ministry has said two children are among the seven killed on Friday. Agence France Presse (AFP) reports that rescuers still searching for missing people under the rubble. \u201cIsraeli enemy strikes on the city of Tyre killed seven people including two girls, and injured 46 others,\u201d the ministry said, adding that body parts had been found and will be \u201cidentified with DNA testing\u201d. It added that rubble was being cleared after the strikes as part of efforts to locate people who are unaccounted for. The ministry had on Friday reported a toll of three killed and 30 injured in the strikes. AFP photos showed rescuers carrying bodies on stretchers amid the wreckage in Tyre, as rubble and twisted metal were strewn across the street. Earlier on Saturday, Lebanon\u2019s official National News Agency had said that the deadly strikes targeted three buildings in the coastal city, causing \u201cmassive damage to dozens of homes\u201d. The NNA also said \u201cenemy fighter jets\u201d destroyed two heritage houses in the southern city of Nabatiyeh. Israel intensified its air campaign on Lebanon in September and later sent in troops after a year of cross-border clashes. Here\u2019s some photographs from Israel, Gaza and Lebanon on Saturday. Hamas may be forced to close its offices in Qatar, after the US told the tiny Gulf state that allowing the militant Islamist group to have a base there is no longer acceptable. Qatar, a key US partner in the Middle East, has hosted the political office of Hamas for more than a decade and allowed many senior leaders of the organisation to live there. The request was reported by Reuters late on Friday but has yet to be officially confirmed. \u201cAfter rejecting repeated proposals to release hostages, [Hamas] leaders should no longer be welcome in the capitals of any American partner. We made that clear to Qatar following Hamas\u2019s rejection weeks ago of another hostage release proposal,\u201d the senior official told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Critics of the US request say it will hinder engagement with elements of Hamas potentially more inclined to compromise, and could boost the influence of more hostile states, such as Iran, over the group. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages seized during its surprise attack into Israel last October. Multiple rounds of negotiations aimed at securing an end to the 13 month-long war in Gaza have failed. The small but influential Gulf state has been a key intermediary in the talks to broker a ceasefire and is likely to comply with the US request, analysts said. The US official told Reuters that Qatar, which is designated as a major non-Nato ally by Washington, passed on the demand to Hamas leaders about 10 days ago. Hamas leaders have been preparing for many months to leave Qatar, with Turkey and Iraq suggested as possible alternatives. The group recently opened a political office in Baghdad. Hamas officials denied Qatar has told the organisation to leave and there has been no reaction from Qatar\u2019s foreign ministry to the reports. Israeli air strikes on the Lebanese coastal city of Tyre have now killed seven people. Reuters reported that Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said the death toll has risen from three to seven after the attack on Friday. Another 46 people are injured, it added. Lebanon has fired five rockets at Israel, with the munitions either being intercepted or falling into open areas, Israel has said. The Israeli air force posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that sirens were sounded in Western and Upper Galilee. More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the conflict last year, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said. In its latest update, it said 43,552 have been killed with 102,765 others injured, since Hamas\u2019 terror attack on Israel on 7 October last year, which saw Israel retaliate, pledging to eliminate the terror group. The Dutch government is investigating if it missed possible warning signs from Israel in the events leading up to this week\u2019s violence between football fans in Amsterdam, justice minister David van Weel said in a letter to parliament. \u201cAn investigation is still being conducted on possible warning signs from Israel\u201d, Van Weel said in his letter late on Friday evening. At least five people were injured during the assaults on Thursday night and treated in hospital. All were released later on Friday, Reuters reports. The incident concerned fans of the visiting Israeli Maccabi Tel Aviv men\u2019s team for a match against the Dutch side Ajax. Amsterdam police have made more than 60 arrests after what authorities called \u201chateful antisemitic violence\u201d against Israeli football fans. Police on Saturday said four people remained in custody of the 63 people initially detained. \u201cThe Public Prosecution Service has stated that it aims to apply fast-track justice as much as possible\u201d, Van Weel said, adding that it is \u201cthe absolute priority\u201d to identify every suspect. He said the investigation would also examine whether the assaults were organised, with an antisemitic motive. Political leaders have already denounced the attacks as antisemitic. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said on Friday he was \u201chorrified by the anti-Semitic attacks on Israeli citizens\u201d and had assured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone that \u201cthe perpetrators will be identified and prosecuted\u201d. Videos on social media on what happened showed riot police in action, with some attackers shouting anti-Israeli slurs. Footage also showed Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters chanting anti-Arab slogans before Thursday evening\u2019s match. Amsterdam banned demonstrations through the weekend and gave police emergency stop-and-search powers in response to the unrest. Antisemitic incidents have surged in the Netherlands since Israel launched its assault on the Palestinian enclave of Gaza after the attacks on Israel by Hamas militants in October last year, with many Jewish organisations and schools reporting threats and hate mail. Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi has warned the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, where Israel is battling Iran-backed groups, could spill over beyond the Middle East. According to Agence France Presse (AFP) in a speech on Saturday that aired on Iranian state TV, Araghchi said: \u201cThe world should know that in case of the expansion of war, its harmful effects will not be limited only to the West Asia region; insecurity and instability can spread to other regions, even far away.\u201d A Palestinian man has been killed and two others wounded by Israeli forces in the West Bank, the Palestinian news agency WAFA has reported. It said Israeli forces, as well as bulldozers, surrounded a house in the town of Al-Aqaba. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, a man in his 50s was wounded by gunfire to the chest and is in a critical condition. A 49-year-old Palestinian was hurt after being beaten by the soldiers. The director of the Palestine Prisoner Society in the West Bank town of Tubas, Kamal Bani Odeh, told the Red Crescent that two Palestinians were detained by the IDF during the operation. More on the Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon\u2019s capital Beirut overnight. The Israeli Defence Force (IDF) has said it attacked a Hezbollah headquarters, a weapons production site and other areas used by the terror group. An update on the earlier attack on a school in Gaza City, as six people are now reported to have died in the Israeli attack on Saturday morning. Al Jazeera reports two families \u2013 a total of six people \u2013 have been killed in the attack on the Fahd al-Sabah school sheltering displaced Palestinians in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City. An Israeli air strike on alleged military installations in rural Syria has killed one person and injured six soldiers, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, reported the strikes had targeted military installations in the Saraqib area of Idlib. The war monitor also said members of the Iranian revolutionary guards and pro-Tehran factions were based in the area. They include the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group. Meanwhile eight soldiers have been injured in a separate Israeli air strike on a in countryside near Aleppo, the Observatory reported. Syrian state media reported the strikes in the early hours of Saturday morning had caused damage and injured personnel in the area. \u201cAt around 00:45 after midnight, the Israeli army launched an air aggression from the direction of southeast Aleppo, targeting a number of sites in the countryside of Aleppo and Idlib,\u201d the official SANA news agency said. The report added that the attack had \u201cresulted in the injury of a number of soldiers and some material losses\u201d, without providing further details. Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria, mainly targeting army positions and Iran-backed fighters including from Hezbollah. The Israeli military has intensified its strikes on Syria since it launched its war on Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the conflicts in the Middle East. At least 14 people were killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza late on Friday and early on Saturday, the Palestinian news agency Wafa has reported. The dead included nine who were killed when Israeli fighter jets bombed tents housing displaced people in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. Al Jazeera reported that women and children were among the dead and that the tents were in the al-Mawasi area, which Israel has designated a \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d although it has repeatedly attacked it. Another five were killed and others wounded when Israeli forces targeted a school housing displaced people in Gaza City. Al Jazeera reported that two journalist siblings, Ahmad Abu Sakhil and Zahra Abu Sakhil, were among the dead together with their father, Muhammad. Israel has repeatedly been accused of targeting journalists in its military campaign \u2013 an unprecedented number have died in the conflict \u2013 which it denies. Al Jazeera reported that a \u201cdensely populated house\u201d was also hit in Beit Lahiya with at least one dead and others injured. Lebanese state media said Israeli air strikes also hit Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs on Friday, while at at least three people were killed and 30 others wounded on Friday in Israeli strikes on the southern city of Tyre. More on that soonest. In other developments: There is a \u201cstrong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas\u201d of the northern Gaza Strip, a committee of global food security experts warned on Friday, as Israel claims to be pursuing a military offensive against Palestinian militant group Hamas in the area. \u201cImmediate action, within days not weeks, is required from all actors who are directly taking part in the conflict, or have influence on its conduct, to avert and alleviate this catastrophic situation,\u201d the independent Famine Review Committee (FRC) said in a rare alert. The FRC said it could be \u201cassumed that starvation, malnutrition, and excess mortality due to malnutrition and disease, are rapidly increasing\u201d in north Gaza. \u201cFamine thresholds may have already been crossed or else will be in the near future,\u201d the global hunger monitor said. Nearly 70% of the people killed in the war in Gaza are women and children, according to a UN analysis of verified deaths that highlights the heavy civilian toll of the conflict. In a new report, the most detailed analysis of its kind yet, the UN human rights office said it had verified 8,119 of those killed during the first six months of the war in Gaza. Of the fatalities, 3,588 were children and 2,036 were women. The youngest victim was a one-day-old boy and the oldest was a 97-year-old woman. The UN\u2019s peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon said on Friday that the Israeli military\u2019s \u201cdeliberate and direct destruction\u201d of its property was a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d of international law. Since Israel launched a ground campaign across the border against Hezbollah fighters at the end of September, Unifil has accused the Israel Defense Forces on several occasions of deliberately attacking its bases, including by shooting at peacekeepers and destroying watchtowers, which Israel denies. In its latest accusation, Unifil said the IDF used excavators and a bulldozer to destroy part of a fence and concrete structure at a UN peacekeeping position in southern Lebanon on Thursday. Peacekeepers had also observed Israeli troops this week removing a barrel that marks blue line, it said. Benjamin Netanyahu has appointed a hardline supporter of the war in Gaza and longtime backer of settlements in the West Bank as his ambassador to the US as Israel prepares for the incoming administration of Donald Trump. Yechiel Leiter, an American-born rightwing publicist and former government aide who immigrated to Israel four decades ago, was announced as Israel\u2019s next ambassador to Washington on Friday. Amsterdam police have made more than 60 arrests after what authorities called \u201chateful antisemitic violence\u201d against Israeli football fans. A plane carrying football supporters brought home from the Dutch capital by the Israeli government landed on Friday at Israel\u2019s Ben Gurion airport after the clashes on Thursday, which took place after a Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Amsterdam\u2019s police chief, Peter Holla, said there had been \u201cincidents on both sides\u201d, starting on Wednesday night when Maccabi fans tore down a Palestinian flag from the facade of a building in the city centre and shouted \u201cfuck you Palestine\u201d. A social media video verified by Reuters showed Maccabi fans setting off flares and chanting \u201cOl\u00e9, ol\u00e9, let the IDF win, we will fuck the Arabs\u201d, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",

Kate brings a wealth of experience with the party over many years and she is perfectly suited to lead our fantastic staff team at this crucial time. \u201cThe general election result showed that Scottish Labour can deliver change for Scotland and I\u2019d like to again place on record my thanks and gratitude to John-Paul McHugh for the work he carried out as general secretary to deliver that. \u201cNow we have gotten rid of one failing government, our focus is on the 2026 Scottish parliament election.\u201d \u201cKate\u2019s appointment demonstrates that we are getting election-ready.\u201d Watson said: \u201cIt is fantastic to take on this new role at such a pivotal time for our party and our country. \u201cI am excited to continue working to build on the strong legacy left behind by John-Paul McHugh and take our party into the 2026 election.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Qatari government has informed the US and Israel it will stop mediation efforts to halt the conflict in Gaza because it no longer thinks the parties are negotiating in good faith. The Gulf state has concluded that talks have become a political football, and its efforts to facilitate them were generating criticism towards it, according to a diplomatic source briefed on the situation. \u201cAs long as there is a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith, they cannot continue to mediate,\u201d the source said. Qatar\u2019s move is the latest major blow to a faltering effort to end fighting in Gaza which has not produced significant results since a temporary ceasefire and hostage release deal nearly a year ago. But with a new US administration taking power in just over two months, the Qataris have also made clear to US contacts that they would be willing to resume mediation if both sides showed a \u201csincere willingness\u201d to reach a deal. Qatar informed Israel, Hamas officials, the US and Egypt of the decision after a US delegation including the CIA director, Bill Burns, visited Doha for inconclusive meetings in late October. Its government had concluded that the warring parties were focused on \u201cpolitical optics\u201d rather than genuine security concerns, the diplomatic source said, and had tried to undermine the process \u201cby backing out from some of the commitments\u201d. This is the second time that Qatar has warned publicly that it is not prepared to play host to dead-end talks indefinitely. In a statement released on Saturday afternoon, Qatar said that widespread media reporting of a planned closure of the Hamas political office in Doha were wrong. The office was a useful channel of communication between \u201cconcerned parties\u201d, Qatar said. In April Doha had briefly asked Hamas commanders to leave the country, after the prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, announced Qatar was going to review its mediation role. They headed to Turkey but within weeks Israel and the US government had asked Qatar to bring them back in order to intensify negotiations. The Qataris are trusted by senior figures on both sides and have a long track record in mediation. The Hamas office in Doha was opened in 2012, at the request of the Obama administration. For over a decade it has provided a key channel of communication to the group, including during talks last year to agree a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of evermore than 100 hostages. However, since that agreement in November 2023, talks aimed at reaching a second deal have repeatedly collapsed, and Qatar has come under increasing criticism in Israel and from parts of the US political establishment for hosting Hamas. A group of Republican US senators on Friday asked Washington to seek the extradition of Hamas officials in Qatar and freeze their assets. These attacks, on an initiative launched at the US\u2019s request, rankled in Doha and contributed to Qatar\u2019s decision to distance itself from Hamas and peace talks. \u201cQatar also advised the US administration and both parties that it would not accept being subjected to political exploitation aimed at gaining political leverage at Qatar\u2019s expense while misleading public perception,\u201d the source said. US officials have briefed American media outlets that Washington had requested the closure of the Hamas office, but the Biden administration has not commented publicly. The Qataris told Washington that they would be willing to pick up their mediation role again \u201cwhen both sides reach an impasse and demonstrate a sincere willingness to return to the negotiating table with the objective of putting an end to the war and the suffering of civilians\u201d. Qatar is a close US ally, hosts a major military base, and its diplomats had a good relationship with Donald Trump during his first presidential term. The state also hosted a political office for the Taliban, then an insurgent movement, and facilitated talks with Trump\u2019s administration on a deal to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. Hamas leaders have been preparing for many months to leave Doha, and Turkey and Iraq have been suggested as possible alternatives. The group recently opened a political office in Baghdad. Western and regional politicians and diplomats who favour allowing Hamas to stay in Qatar warned that if it is pushed out, it will hinder engagement with Hamas figures potentially more inclined to compromise, and could allow more hostile states such as Iran to boost their hold over the group.

The likelier scenario is that Fern\u00e1ndez, the \u00a3106.8m Thursday-night footballer, will be on the bench when Chelsea host Arsenal on Sunday. He has, after all, not started the past three league games and it is surely not a coincidence that Maresca\u2019s side have had more balance with Rom\u00e9o Lavia partnering Mois\u00e9s Caicedo in central midfield.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/08/enzo-maresca-confident-chelsea-going-in-the-right-direction-for-arsenal-clash\">Enzo Maresca confident Chelsea \u2018going in the right direction\u2019 for Arsenal clash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The main issue for Fern\u00e1ndez since his arrival from Benfica in January 2023 has been physicality. The passing ability is obvious but is he robust enough for the Premier League? Mauricio Pochettino, Maresca\u2019s predecessor, had his doubts. Chelsea struggled to make the partnership between Caicedo and Fern\u00e1ndez work last season.</p> <p>Restricting Caicedo to the role of Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s bodyguard was wasteful. For all the hype, the latter\u2019s creative output has not been high enough to justify building the midfield around him. Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s return of seven goals since joining Chelsea is poor, he does not have an assist in the league this season and the wider metrics are not positive: the 23-year-old is not creating big chances, his tackle success rate is 39% and his passing output has declined.</p> <p>Caicedo, though, is excelling in almost every department and is one of the best midfielders in England. No midfielder has made or competed more tackles than the Ecuador international this season. He ranks third for interceptions, second for duels won and sixth for possession regained in the middle third of the pitch.</p> <p>Yet the former Brighton midfielder is no mere destroyer. Although he is adept at breaking up play, Caicedo also deserves respect for his prowess on the ball. Only four midfielders have completed more successful passes this season and Manchester United saw the 23-year-old\u2019s quality when he drilled in a cracking equaliser from the edge of the area at Old Trafford last Sunday.</p> <p>It was a goal that showed why Chelsea broke the bank for Caicedo in August 2023, even though they knew they were overpaying by at least \u00a310m. A record \u00a3115m fee, which is offset by the club handing the player a long and incentivised deal, no longer draws external derision. Caicedo is stomping over opposition midfields and he is opening up defences with perceptive through balls, assists for Nicolas Jackson against Liverpool and West Ham showcasing his passing range.</p>    <p>Now the challenge is to overpower and outclass Arsenal, who failed with a \u00a370m bid for Caicedo in January 2023. It helps that Lavia, who missed almost all of last season through injury, is establishing himself as a key player for Maresca. The former Southampton midfielder, who joined Chelsea at the same as Caicedo, provides stability. So smooth on the ball, Lavia holds his position, resists the press, distributes beautifully and liberates Caicedo. \u201cIt is a matter of balance,\u201d Maresca says. \u201cRomeo and Moi give us physicality and strength in the middle.\u201d</p> <p>That will be pivotal against Arsenal, one of the most imposing teams around. Mikel Arteta missed out on Caicedo, but he has Declan Rice and Mikel Merino. Rice was once a target for Chelsea, who wanted him back after letting him go at the age of 14, and the England midfielder has been excellent since joining Arsenal for \u00a3105m last year.</p> <p>He hurt Chelsea last season, scoring a stunner at Stamford Bridge and outdoing Caicedo and Fern\u00e1ndez in a 5-0 win for Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in April. This time, though, the battle should be tighter. Rice missed Arsenal\u2019s defeat by Inter on Wednesday with a toe injury and it will not be easy for the 25-year-old to play through the pain barrier.</p> <p>Chelsea have progressed a lot in a short space of time. They opened the season with Caicedo, Fern\u00e1ndez and Lavia starting in midfield, with Cole Palmer shunted to the right wing, but Maresca has succeeded by altering his approach. Fern\u00e1ndez, quite simply, has never done enough to justify playing as the most advanced midfielder. Maresca soon restored Palmer to the No 10 spot and Lavia, who sat out a few games through injury, has not needed long to take one of the deeper spots away from Fern\u00e1ndez.</p> <p>It is a conundrum for Chelsea given they paid so much for Fern\u00e1ndez. In time they may be forced to cut their losses on him. They are already thinking about where Andrey Santos will fit in when the 20-year-old Brazilian returns from his increasingly impressive loan at Strasbourg.</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez will be squeezed out if he is not careful. The thought occurs that Maresca would have found more use in Conor Gallagher, who was sold to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid last summer. Then again, Maresca favours control and he has it in Caicedo and Lavia. They both had slow starts to their Chelsea careers, but the future will look even brighter if they outwit Arsenal.</p>",

Rice missed Arsenal\u2019s defeat by Inter on Wednesday with a toe injury and it will not be easy for the 25-year-old to play through the pain barrier. Chelsea have progressed a lot in a short space of time. They opened the season with Caicedo, Fern\u00e1ndez and Lavia starting in midfield, with Cole Palmer shunted to the right wing, but Maresca has succeeded by altering his approach. Fern\u00e1ndez, quite simply, has never done enough to justify playing as the most advanced midfielder. Maresca soon restored Palmer to the No 10 spot and Lavia, who sat out a few games through injury, has not needed long to take one of the deeper spots away from Fern\u00e1ndez. It is a conundrum for Chelsea given they paid so much for Fern\u00e1ndez. In time they may be forced to cut their losses on him. They are already thinking about where Andrey Santos will fit in when the 20-year-old Brazilian returns from his increasingly impressive loan at Strasbourg. Fern\u00e1ndez will be squeezed out if he is not careful. The thought occurs that Maresca would have found more use in Conor Gallagher, who was sold to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid last summer. Then again, Maresca favours control and he has it in Caicedo and Lavia. They both had slow starts to their Chelsea careers, but the future will look even brighter if they outwit Arsenal.",

      "body": "<p>Sigrid Rausing, 62, is a publisher and former editor of <em>Granta</em> magazine. When her best friend, the acclaimed Swedish writer Johanna Ekstr\u00f6m, became terminally ill with cancer, Rausing promised to complete her last book. She edited the 13 handwritten notebooks, adding her own commentary. <em>And the Walls Became the World All Around</em> (Granta), which Rausing has now translated into English, is a brave and beautiful memoir of Ekstr\u00f6m\u2019s final two years, and a moving meditation on grief and friendship. It was a bestseller in Sweden, where it was first published&nbsp;last year. Ekstr\u00f6m died in 2022, aged 51.</p> <p><strong>Did you have any reservations about agreeing to finish Ekstr\u00f6m\u2019s work?</strong><br>I was in Stockholm helping to look after Johanna in the last few weeks of her life, and I didn\u2019t know she was working on this book. She told me about the notebooks and asked me to finish it \u2013 and of course I said yes. These promises, they are not like anything else. They are like a vow. A binding obligation.</p> <p><strong>How did the book evolve?</strong><br>What started out as a writer\u2019s notebook gradually turned into a text on loss: first of all, of an important relationship \u2013 Johanna was very much in love with a man who had entered into deep depression \u2013 [then] her elderly mother was dying, and it was the pandemic. She also noted the first signs of her illness, visual disturbances and physical symptoms she thought of as psychosomatic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was very compelling to submit myself to somebody else\u2019s voice in such a disciplined way</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Ekstr\u00f6m died of an eye melanoma. One </strong><strong>poignant, almost prophetic, aspect of the notebooks is the number of visual metaphors, even before her diagnosis.</strong><br>Yes.

Was working on it consoling as well as painful?</strong><br>To have the discipline of working while I was really grieving, to be able to stay with Johanna\u2019s voice for that long, was wonderful and, yes, consoling.</p> <p><strong>What was Ekstr\u00f6m\u2019s background?</strong><br>She was very much in, and of, the Stockholm cultural sphere. Her mother was a writer. Her father was a writer and an editor, the head of Swedish PEN and eventually the head of the Swedish Nobel committee for literature. That was the environment she grew up in and, to a great degree, remained in.</p> <p><strong>She published 13 books in different genres. Yet</strong><strong> this is the first to be translated into English. Why do you think this was?</strong><br>She started out as a poet with a debut collection when she was just 20. But she is most famous for her memoirs of growing up in that environment: <em>Om </em><em>man h\u00e5ller sig I solen</em> (2012) and <em>Meningarna</em> (2020), which roughly translate as \u201cIf You Stay in the Sun\u201d and \u201cThe Sentences\u201d. The first one is a brilliant account of quite a troubled childhood, and the second is a book-length essay about her mother. The only reason they haven\u2019t been translated is because they are so culturally specific, whereas this book, which addresses broader questions of illness and loss, is much more universal.</p>    <p><strong>Despite the humour and joyfulness, the notebooks are also full of sadness, even before the diagnosis. </strong><strong>Ekstr\u00f6m spent many years in therapy and writes of feelings of hopelessness. Was this always something she struggled with?</strong><br>I think those feelings of desolation that she writes about in these notebooks had always been with her, but they haven\u2019t always been part of her writing. They didn\u2019t have&nbsp;much to do with her illness, which she faced with great resolution. She was both extremely imaginative and absolutely realistic. So she was bleakly realistic about her illness.</p> <p><strong>How did you feel when you finished the book?</strong><br>It felt very blank. When you\u2019re working on a text there\u2019s always a sense of loss when it\u2019s done.

She is gone now.</p> <p><strong>What are your views on the proposed assisted dying bill?</strong><br>I\u2019m wholly in favour of a change in the law on the grounds of self-determination, the right to make decisions about our own bodies.

      "body": "<p>How can anyone vote for someone so\u2026 fill in the blank\u2026 racist, sexist, unconstitutional, hateful, unhinged? This is the question asked frequently in the UK and here in the States, where I have spent the past three weeks trying to understand the Trump phenomenon.</p> <p>Behind the question is an implied superiority; that we, the clever people, have identified the monster that is Donald Trump, but the deluded masses are too stupid to see it. But what I have found at the Trump rallies I\u2019ve been to is not stupidity, but frustration, pain and a longing for respect.</p> <p>Tucker Carlson at Madison Square Garden captured this sentiment with his usual swagger. \u201cThey tell you, the people who can actually change a flat tyre, who pay your taxes and work 40 hours a week, that you are somehow immoral. We have a message for them: you are not better than us, you are not smarter than us.\u201d</p> <p>To dismiss this as the politics of grievance is to dismiss what it feels like to be disrespected, to feel \u201ca&nbsp;stranger in your own land\u201d. To feel as though the college-educated are looking down at the non-college-educated.</p> <p>Even now, after his overwhelming victory, many still fume that Trump has returned to power on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/22/trump-vance-create-fake-stories-lies-election\">back of a pack of lies</a>, sometimes very big lies (like he won the 2020 election). And of course that\u2019s part of the story. But his supporters have some justification for believing that his win has in fact been forged from a powerful truth. The economy is not being run in their interests, government is not working for them, and mainstream political parties have not been up to the job in recent&nbsp;years.</p> <p>This is what appealed to so many people including lifelong Democrats such as Bill, who was the first person I chatted to at a rally in Latrobe, just outside Pittsburgh. \u201cI was a Democrat all my life, a local organiser. I was invited to a fundraiser, bought a new suit to look smart, turned up and listened to all the speeches. By the end of the evening, there had been a programme aimed at everyone \u2013 those on benefits, single mothers, new immigrants \u2013 but nothing of any kind at me, a dad of two children, trying to pay the mortgage, working hard to get on. I realised the Democrats were no longer for me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What motivated so many of them was a lack of order and control in their lives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yes, there was a cultish feel to the mass of red Maga hats and rhythmic chants of USA, USA, and yes, a full buffet of conspiracy theories was often on the menu. But what motivated so many of them was a lack of order and control in their lives. If you don\u2019t know who is coming across the border, you feel uneasy and at risk. If you can\u2019t predict how much your groceries will cost week to week, you feel the pressure.</p> <p>And to solve this? You need a disruptor. Someone who doesn\u2019t go along with the stale, failed, norms of political discourse, someone from outside politics who can hack through the undergrowth even if in doing so he might offend. If Trump was polite, generous, restrained and conciliatory, his supporters would find it impossible to believe he would give the system the good shake they believe it needs.</p> <p>So, Trump\u2019s appeal is there in plain sight. It is not an aberration. It is not inexplicable. And now we know for certain, it\u2019s not going away. The truth is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/us-election-briefing-democrats-pick-through-defeat-with-blame-falling-on-biden-and-economy\">Democrats lost people</a> \u2013 head and heart. They failed at being good technocrats (the head) with high inflation and open borders. And failed at telling a story in which struggling working families could feel seen and heard (the heart).</p> <p>This is now the challenge for the Democrats in the US fighting to win back power, and Labour in the UK trying to make a success of their victory. Trump\u2019s win could be a moment, like Margaret Thatcher\u2019s victory in 1979, where the old rules of politics are turned on their head and where the buildings blocks of a new progressive project need to be rebuilt from first principles.</p> <p>The outlines of what needs to happen will emerge. A project that is squarely back on the side of working people. Where we do the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d to get better and bolder policies on the cost of living, making work pay, securing our borders, providing for the aspirations of those who don\u2019t go to&nbsp;university.</p> <p>Where we understand that the way we govern is not working for too many people and needs to change fundamentally if we are to rebuild trust. Where we get to grips with a diffuse and polarised media and communicate far more cleverly. And where we tell a story about the common good, of belonging and respect, that is sufficiently hard-headed to bring people&nbsp;together.</p> <p>Trump won because he was the better candidate with a better message. I believe both his policies and approach will not in the end work, and will probably do a lot of damage on the way. But to millions, whether we admit it or not, he offered real hope \u2013 of greater prosperity, more security and fewer wars. Many looked to him as a protector \u2013 from a world of change and from patronising elites.</p> <p>We now have a choice: rage at Trump supporters \u2013 or curiosity. We can spend the coming months in fruitless intellectual contortions about whether he meets the criteria for being a fascist, or we can properly&nbsp;understand what has just happened and get to work deepening, widening and improving a new progressive agenda with the vim and vitality to mount a serious fightback.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Hyman is a former adviser to Keir Starmer and Tony Blair, currently working on a project to rebuild trust in politics and tackle far-right populism</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "bodyText": "How can anyone vote for someone so\u2026 fill in the blank\u2026 racist, sexist, unconstitutional, hateful, unhinged? This is the question asked frequently in the UK and here in the States, where I have spent the past three weeks trying to understand the Trump phenomenon. Behind the question is an implied superiority; that we, the clever people, have identified the monster that is Donald Trump, but the deluded masses are too stupid to see it. But what I have found at the Trump rallies I\u2019ve been to is not stupidity, but frustration, pain and a longing for respect. Tucker Carlson at Madison Square Garden captured this sentiment with his usual swagger. \u201cThey tell you, the people who can actually change a flat tyre, who pay your taxes and work 40 hours a week, that you are somehow immoral. We have a message for them: you are not better than us, you are not smarter than us.\u201d To dismiss this as the politics of grievance is to dismiss what it feels like to be disrespected, to feel \u201ca stranger in your own land\u201d. To feel as though the college-educated are looking down at the non-college-educated. Even now, after his overwhelming victory, many still fume that Trump has returned to power on the back of a pack of lies, sometimes very big lies (like he won the 2020 election). And of course that\u2019s part of the story. But his supporters have some justification for believing that his win has in fact been forged from a powerful truth. The economy is not being run in their interests, government is not working for them, and mainstream political parties have not been up to the job in recent years. This is what appealed to so many people including lifelong Democrats such as Bill, who was the first person I chatted to at a rally in Latrobe, just outside Pittsburgh. \u201cI was a Democrat all my life, a local organiser. I was invited to a fundraiser, bought a new suit to look smart, turned up and listened to all the speeches. By the end of the evening, there had been a programme aimed at everyone \u2013 those on benefits, single mothers, new immigrants \u2013 but nothing of any kind at me, a dad of two children, trying to pay the mortgage, working hard to get on. I realised the Democrats were no longer for me.\u201d Yes, there was a cultish feel to the mass of red Maga hats and rhythmic chants of USA, USA, and yes, a full buffet of conspiracy theories was often on the menu. But what motivated so many of them was a lack of order and control in their lives. If you don\u2019t know who is coming across the border, you feel uneasy and at risk. If you can\u2019t predict how much your groceries will cost week to week, you feel the pressure. And to solve this? You need a disruptor. Someone who doesn\u2019t go along with the stale, failed, norms of political discourse, someone from outside politics who can hack through the undergrowth even if in doing so he might offend. If Trump was polite, generous, restrained and conciliatory, his supporters would find it impossible to believe he would give the system the good shake they believe it needs. So, Trump\u2019s appeal is there in plain sight. It is not an aberration. It is not inexplicable. And now we know for certain, it\u2019s not going away. The truth is the Democrats lost people \u2013 head and heart. They failed at being good technocrats (the head) with high inflation and open borders. And failed at telling a story in which struggling working families could feel seen and heard (the heart). This is now the challenge for the Democrats in the US fighting to win back power, and Labour in the UK trying to make a success of their victory. Trump\u2019s win could be a moment, like Margaret Thatcher\u2019s victory in 1979, where the old rules of politics are turned on their head and where the buildings blocks of a new progressive project need to be rebuilt from first principles. The outlines of what needs to happen will emerge. A project that is squarely back on the side of working people. Where we do the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d to get better and bolder policies on the cost of living, making work pay, securing our borders, providing for the aspirations of those who don\u2019t go to university. Where we understand that the way we govern is not working for too many people and needs to change fundamentally if we are to rebuild trust. Where we get to grips with a diffuse and polarised media and communicate far more cleverly. And where we tell a story about the common good, of belonging and respect, that is sufficiently hard-headed to bring people together. Trump won because he was the better candidate with a better message. I believe both his policies and approach will not in the end work, and will probably do a lot of damage on the way. But to millions, whether we admit it or not, he offered real hope \u2013 of greater prosperity, more security and fewer wars. Many looked to him as a protector \u2013 from a world of change and from patronising elites. We now have a choice: rage at Trump supporters \u2013 or curiosity. We can spend the coming months in fruitless intellectual contortions about whether he meets the criteria for being a fascist, or we can properly understand what has just happened and get to work deepening, widening and improving a new progressive agenda with the vim and vitality to mount a serious fightback. \u2022 Peter Hyman is a former adviser to Keir Starmer and Tony Blair, currently working on a project to rebuild trust in politics and tackle far-right populism Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Not an afternoon to remember. <strong>5/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Ollie Lawrence</strong> Saw more of the ball in opening 10 minutes than he did across 80 last week. Did not do a great deal with it though. <strong>6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Henry Slade</strong> Moved inside one this week and though England claimed it was largely cosmetic he struggled to make much of an impression. <strong>6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Tommy Freeman</strong> Hasn\u2019t really been his autumn so far. Does what you\u2019d expect of him, chasing kicks, claiming high balls but no x-factor. <strong>6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Marcus Smith</strong> Where would England be without him? Glorious grubber in buildup to Cunningham-South try and continued in that vein. At the heart of everything. <strong>9/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Ben Spencer</strong> Same problems around the ruck as last week early on before settling into box-kicking stride in second half. Occasionally kicked too long. <strong>7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Ellis Genge</strong> Made a few dents with the ball in hand during England\u2019s early flurry and got the better of Tupou at scrum-time. <strong>8/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Jamie George</strong> Ran a fine lineout but seemed powerless to stop Australia fighting their way back in first half. Made way with half an hour to go. <strong>6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Will Stuart</strong> Another decent shift. Maybe he feels scorned after missing out on an enhanced contract but has been a good autumn so far for him. <strong>7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Maro Itoje</strong> Did not have everything his way but when he assumed the captaincy things improved for England. <strong>8/10</strong></p> <p><strong>George Martin</strong> Another who is not quite making the kind of impact we know he can. Went off gingerly midway through second half. <strong>6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Chandler Cunningham-South</strong> Two first-half tries, demonstrating both his pace and power. Rapidly becoming a fan favourite at Twickenham. <strong>8/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Tom Curry</strong> Suffered a nasty-looking head injury after colliding with Valentini and made way. Was missed and could well be ruled out against South Africa. <strong>5/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Ben Earl</strong> Not hitting the heights he did earlier in the year and outshone by teammates and opponents in the back-row. <strong>5/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Replacements</strong> Luke Cowan-Dickie (for George 51) Brought some oomph <strong>7</strong>; Fin Baxter (for Genge 62) Struggled again <strong>5</strong>; Dan Cole (for Stuart 69) <strong>5</strong>; Nick Isiekwe (for Martin 60) Couldn\u2019t get up to speed <strong>5</strong>; Alex Dombrandt (for Curry 23) Mixed bag <strong>6</strong>; Harry Randall (for Spencer 62) Better than last week <strong>6</strong>; George Ford (for Furbank 62) Couldn\u2019t calm things down <strong>6</strong>; Ollie Sleightholme (for Feyi-Waboso 51) Fine finishes <strong>8</strong>.</p>    <h2>Australia</h2> <p><strong>Tom Wright</strong> Such a counterattacking threat, slipping his way through England\u2019s defence at will, and had the pace to score Australia\u2019s opening try. <strong>9/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Andrew Kellaway</strong> The former Northampton winger gave a penalty away but chased hard. Kept going and eventually got his reward. <strong>7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii</strong> Showed his aerial ability with his very first touch and why he commands so many column inches with his basketball pass to Wright. <strong>9/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Len Ikitau</strong> Suaalii may have commanded attention but Ikitau was just as impressive, particularly with the stunning pass to put Jorgensen away. <strong>8/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Dylan Pietsch</strong> A busy winger, always looking to get involved but could do with an extra yard of pace to get away when he finds space. Early withdrawal. <strong>6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Noah Lolesio</strong> Kicked superbly from the tee and provided a calming presence at fly-half. Outshone by Smith but no shame in that. <strong>7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Jake Gordon</strong> Covered in claret and the Wallabies looked more threatening when McDermott came on. Needs to up his speed of pass. <strong>6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Angus Bell</strong> Bulldozing carry to sit Curry down and repeatedly got Australia over the gainline. Among the outstanding forwards on show. <strong>9/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Matt Faessler</strong> One or two lineout wobbles but on the whole a solid hour before he was replaced. Got through plenty of work. <strong>6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Taniela Tupou</strong> Struggled at scrum-time and twice penalised in the first half.

Is an all-action lock, covering so much ground for the Wallabies. <strong>8/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Rob Valentini</strong> Some thunderous carries which helped drag Australia into half-time lead.

      "bodyText": "England George Furbank On the periphery of things but Australia take a lot of credit for that. Hasn\u2019t showcased what he can do in attack in either match yet. 5/10 Immanuel Feyi-Waboso Excelled last week but in the wars this week, going off for an HIA and then permanently after Williams\u2019 try. Not an afternoon to remember. 5/10 Ollie Lawrence Saw more of the ball in opening 10 minutes than he did across 80 last week. Did not do a great deal with it though. 6/10 Henry Slade Moved inside one this week and though England claimed it was largely cosmetic he struggled to make much of an impression. 6/10 Tommy Freeman Hasn\u2019t really been his autumn so far. Does what you\u2019d expect of him, chasing kicks, claiming high balls but no x-factor. 6/10 Marcus Smith Where would England be without him? Glorious grubber in buildup to Cunningham-South try and continued in that vein. At the heart of everything. 9/10 Ben Spencer Same problems around the ruck as last week early on before settling into box-kicking stride in second half. Occasionally kicked too long. 7/10 Ellis Genge Made a few dents with the ball in hand during England\u2019s early flurry and got the better of Tupou at scrum-time. 8/10 Jamie George Ran a fine lineout but seemed powerless to stop Australia fighting their way back in first half. Made way with half an hour to go. 6/10 Will Stuart Another decent shift. Maybe he feels scorned after missing out on an enhanced contract but has been a good autumn so far for him. 7/10 Maro Itoje Did not have everything his way but when he assumed the captaincy things improved for England. 8/10 George Martin Another who is not quite making the kind of impact we know he can. Went off gingerly midway through second half. 6/10 Chandler Cunningham-South Two first-half tries, demonstrating both his pace and power. Rapidly becoming a fan favourite at Twickenham. 8/10 Tom Curry Suffered a nasty-looking head injury after colliding with Valentini and made way. Was missed and could well be ruled out against South Africa. 5/10 Ben Earl Not hitting the heights he did earlier in the year and outshone by teammates and opponents in the back-row. 5/10 Replacements Luke Cowan-Dickie (for George 51) Brought some oomph 7; Fin Baxter (for Genge 62) Struggled again 5; Dan Cole (for Stuart 69) 5; Nick Isiekwe (for Martin 60) Couldn\u2019t get up to speed 5; Alex Dombrandt (for Curry 23) Mixed bag 6; Harry Randall (for Spencer 62) Better than last week 6; George Ford (for Furbank 62) Couldn\u2019t calm things down 6; Ollie Sleightholme (for Feyi-Waboso 51) Fine finishes 8. Australia Tom Wright Such a counterattacking threat, slipping his way through England\u2019s defence at will, and had the pace to score Australia\u2019s opening try. 9/10 Andrew Kellaway The former Northampton winger gave a penalty away but chased hard. Kept going and eventually got his reward. 7/10 Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii Showed his aerial ability with his very first touch and why he commands so many column inches with his basketball pass to Wright. 9/10 Len Ikitau Suaalii may have commanded attention but Ikitau was just as impressive, particularly with the stunning pass to put Jorgensen away. 8/10 Dylan Pietsch A busy winger, always looking to get involved but could do with an extra yard of pace to get away when he finds space. Early withdrawal. 6/10 Noah Lolesio Kicked superbly from the tee and provided a calming presence at fly-half. Outshone by Smith but no shame in that. 7/10 Jake Gordon Covered in claret and the Wallabies looked more threatening when McDermott came on. Needs to up his speed of pass. 6/10 Angus Bell Bulldozing carry to sit Curry down and repeatedly got Australia over the gainline. Among the outstanding forwards on show. 9/10 Matt Faessler One or two lineout wobbles but on the whole a solid hour before he was replaced. Got through plenty of work. 6/10 Taniela Tupou Struggled at scrum-time and twice penalised in the first half. Carries hard but not the explosive impact his nickname of Tongan Thor suggests. 6/10 Nick Frost Picked for his lineout prowess which was not flawless. Not as energetic or as physical as Williams. 7/10 Jeremy Williams Did so well to get the ball down in the left-hand corner. Is an all-action lock, covering so much ground for the Wallabies. 8/10 Rob Valentini Some thunderous carries which helped drag Australia into half-time lead. When he hits, he hits hard. 8/10 Fraser McReight Not quite as much of an impact as his fellow back-rowers but no complaint. Dug deep for 80 minutes. 7/10 Harry Wilson A captain\u2019s innings from the cricket obsessive. Great support line to score Australia\u2019s second try and did not stop going all afternoon. 9/10 Replacements Brandon Paenga-Amosa (for Faessler 60) Dynamic 7; James Slipper (for Bell 71) N/A; Allan Alaalatoa (for Tupou 45) An improvement 7; Lukhan Salakaia-Loto (for Williams 60) Added some clout 8; Tate McDermott (for Gordon 64) Livewire 8; Ben Donaldson (for Lolesio 71) 8; Max Jorgensen (for Pietsch 48) What a finish. 8.",

Elsewhere, struggling Hibs \u2013 bottom of the table with just one win in 11 games \u2013 are at home to St. Mirren, Motherwell play St. Johnstone and Jimmy Thelin\u2019s <s>Barcelona</s> Aberdeen face Dundee in the teatime kick off. </p> </blockquote> <p>Thanks as always Simon.

Something\u2019s gotta give there. <strong>Crystal Palace</strong> v <strong>Fulham</strong> is a case of a London club being safely in mid-table and it perhaps not being the club you expected, even if Marco Silva continues to show what a fine manager he is.

      "bodyText": "I will leave you with the match report from Brentford 3-2 Bournemouth, which was undoubtedly the Premier League\u2019s game of the day. It\u2019s been a fun old afternoon, with the exception of West Ham 0-0 Everton \u2013 but that\u2019s football for ya. Attention will now turn to Manchester City\u2019s visit to Brighton and the Saturday night late action of Liverpool v Aston Villa. The fun never stops. Thanks for joining me today. It\u2019s Harry Wilson\u2019s world right now and we\u2019re all just living in it. Taha Hashim was at Selhurst Park to watch in-form Fulham win again. Goal of the day: Jonathan Wilson saw the thrills and spills at the London Stadium. Alright then, maybe just the spills. Decent finish in the rugger, if that\u2019s your bag. The match reports from our writers around the country are now rolling in. Will Unwin witnessed that rarest of beasts: a Wolves league win in 2024. Goodness me that was breathless stuff. The highlights at the end there included late drama at Hibernian, who thought they\u2019d scored two goals deep in added time, only for the second to be chalked off by VAR. Northampton nicked a totally undeserved point at Birmingham City at the death while West Ham were denied by a late sensational Jordan Pickford stop. Aaaaand breathe. Dundee United 3-0 Ross County Hibs 1-2 St Mirren Motherwell 2-0 St Johnstone Wimbledon 0-1 Grimsby Barrow 1-1 Colchester Cheltenham 1-1 Bromley Chesterfield 0-3 Accrington Doncaster 0-1 Notts County Fleetwood 1-0 Bradford Gillingham 1-0 Port Vale MK Dons 3-1 Swindon Tranmere 2-1 Newport Walsall 1-1 Crewe Birmingham 1-1 Northampton Bristol R 1-1 Lincoln Crawley 2-2 Huddersfield Exeter 1-0 Charlton L Orient 3-0 Blackpool Peterborough 6-1 Cambridge Stevenage 1-1 Reading Stockport 5-0 Bolton Wigan 0-1 Wycombe Derby 1-1 Plymouth Leeds 2-0 QPR Norwich 0-2 Bristol C Portsmouth 3-1 Preston Sunderland 2-2 Coventry Brentford 3-2 Bournemouth Crystal Palace 0-2 Fulham West Ham 0-0 Everton Wolves 2-0 Southampton The full-time whistles are starting to sound so I\u2019ll run through the scores on the doors in the next few posts. Brace yourselves. Harry Wilson brace AGAIN is it? It looks like he\u2019s just made it 3-0 to Fulham at Palace, but VAR might ruin the fun for the new super-duper-sub. Yep, the VAR computer has indeed said no. Leeds wrap it up against QPR \u2013 finally. Joel Piroe makes it 2-0 in stoppage time after a lot of bluster. Simon McMahon in Scotland says: Dundee United have looked like a different team in the second half \u2013 one that can actually play football \u2013 and deservedly now lead 2-0 thanks to goals from Luca Stephenson and Sam Dalby. Bog standard celebration, but I\u2019ll take them. *Make that 3-0 through Owen Stirton. A week in the life of Stockport County: Tuesday: 5-0 home defeat by Wycombe Saturday: Leading 5-0 at home to Bolton. Consign West Ham v Everton to the rubbish bin and let it never be seen again. It might not even make the last slot on Match of the Day, in truth. Portsmouth have had a right day of it. Colby Bishop is back on the pitch for them after successful heart surgery \u2013 a great story, that \u2013 but that story has just got better, as the Pompey forward slots away a penalty kick against Preston. Lap it up, Colby. 3-1. Sunderland 2-2 Coventry: Maybe Cov don\u2019t need Mark Robins after all! Few saw this fightback from the Sky Blues coming but it\u2019s been completed by Jack Rudoni, to leave the Stadium of Light utterly stunned. Move over Jhon Duran, Harry Wilson is the Premier League\u2019s new super-sub! Give him a start, Marco, you know you want to. What a week the Welshman has had. League One: Harvey Knibbs has helped Reading level up at Stevenage while Leyton Orient are storming to victory over Blackpool. They\u2019re 3-0 up and cruising. Southampton are huffing and puffing in search of a route back into this game against Wolves and, while it\u2019s been nervy for the home side at times, their lack of penetration and precision in the final third is undermining Russell Martin\u2019s team. Red card: It goes from bad to worse for Palace, who have been outplayed by Fulham today. Daichi Kamada, who has been poor in general, is shown a straight red for a dreadful tackle. I\u2019m very happy to publicise this email from Kevin Wilson as it makes a salient point: Looking at that Brighton tweet with their line-up, presumably this is listed in order of player number. Am I wrong to find that incredibly annoying? List them in formation order! Summerville hits the post for West Ham! That was the chance to turnaround their fortunes this afternoon, but it\u2019s passed them by. The anguish goes on for Lopetegui. Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1 has taken a couple of knocks today and found himself on the deck a fair bit. This latest one looks a bit nasty and the medical staff have taken their time to sort out the Wolves goalkeeper. Bundesliga: Borussia Dortmund have been beaten at Mainz and Leverkusen held at Bochum. So it\u2019s a good day for Vincent Kompany and Bayern Munich, who saw out a nervy 1-0 win at St Pauli, with Jamal Musiala netting the game\u2019s only goal. Barry Glendenning is your man for this evening\u2019s south coast doozy. League One: Last time I checked, it was Crawley 1-0 Huddersfield \u2026 it\u2019s now Crawley 2-2 Huddersfield with the latest goal coming from Herbie Kane. It\u2019s a good day if your surname is Bogle. Omar has just scored for Crewe to take the lead at Walsall, with Jayden having drilled Leeds ahead at Elland Road. Everton have threatened through Jesper Lindstr\u00f8m but a goal doesn\u2019t appear to be forthcoming at the London Stadium. Oooh Sunderland have been pegged back by Coventry\u2019s Haji Wright. A twist in the tale at the SoL? Leeds are still in a precarious position against QPR, just 1-0 up. My mistake earlier on saying it was 2-0. League One: Stockport are having heaps of fun against Bolton, 4-0 now. Birmingham have finally broken through against Northampton via marquee summer signing Jay Stansfield. It\u2019s hotting up atop the third tier. Someone call Simon McMahon \u2013 Dundee United are in front against Ross County! Team news has rolled in for the 5.30pm kick off: Yoane Wissa is released through 1v1 and dinks it past Kepa in the Bournemouth goal. A fine finish. Hands up if you left him on your FPL bench? Just me? Gah. League One: Peterborough have five now against Cambridge and Stockport have raced to a 3-0 lead over Bolton. Goals, goals, goals. Matheus Cunha could drag Wolves to survival all by himself, you know. This is certainly a precious, precious goal for Gary O\u2019Neil\u2019s side. What a ripper of a strike into the corner. The former Atletico forward has been excellent this afternoon. Smith Rowe at the double is he? There\u2019s a VAR check for offside on this one \u2026 Fulham think they\u2019ve clinched a 2-0 lead at Selhurst Park. They haven\u2019t. After an infuriatingly long check, the goal is chalked out. Just 80 seconds between those two goals at the Gtech. Brentford\u2019s home games have provided some serious entertainment this season, although whether Thomas Frank will have truly enjoyed them is a different matter. Like a basketball match! It\u2019s taken Brentford no time at all to respond, Mikkel Damsgaard doing the business for the hosts. Heck of a game. Kluivert strikes for the visitors not long into the second half, turning home after a fine delivery from out wide. Bournemouth have again played really nicely. Second halves get under way around the country and it\u2019s a dream start for the home side at Edgeley Park, Kyle Wooton makes it 2-0 for Stockport against Bolton. Can West Ham muster something \u2013 anything \u2013 after the break? The signs for Julen Lopetegui are not good. ESR = VG. Half-time means celebrations chat can continue and Tom Hopkins adds some thoughts: It\u2019s taking the shirt off and throwing it to one side for me. Whether you think it\u2019s a stupid rule or not, it\u2019s been an automatic yellow for donkey\u2019s years. Just do something else. If it\u2019s really the case that players so completely lose the run of themselves in the moment that they can\u2019t help it, how are non-celebrations against former clubs a thing? Yeah, less of the non-celebration. Let\u2019s have more players going full Adebayor. Dundee United 0-0 Ross County Hibs 0-2 St Mirren Motherwell 2-0 St Johnstone Wimbledon 0-1 Grimsby Barrow 1-0 Colchester Cheltenham 0-0 Bromley Chesterfield 0-1 Accrington Doncaster 0-1 Notts County Fleetwood 1-0 Braford Gillingham 0-0 Port Vale MK Dons 1-1 Swindon Tranmere 1-0 Newport Walsall 0-0 Crewe Birmingham 0-0 Northampton Bristol R 1-0 Lincoln Crawley 1-0 Huddersfield Exeter 0-0 Charlton L Orient 1-0 Blackpool Peterborough 4-0 Cambridge Stevenage 1-0 Reading Stockport 1-0 Bolton Wigan 0-1 Wycombe Derby 1-1 Plymouth Leeds 1-0 QPR Norwich 0-1 Bristol C Portsmouth 2-0 Preston Sunderland 2-0 Coventry Brentford 1-1 Bournemouth Crystal Palace 0-1 Fulham West Ham 0-0 Everton Wolves 1-0 Southampton Palace switch off just before half-time, Lacroix conceding possession sloppily and Smith Rowe\u2019s shot squirms past Dean Henderson. A big moment to break the deadlock in that London derby. Goals are flying in now especially in the Championship and League One. While I wait for the half-time scores to roll in, here\u2019s your roundup of the second tier action so far today. Important news from Charlie Pite on email: Watching Orient vs Blackpool and thought you might like to know Sonny Perkins has just celebrated scoring the opener with a knee slide, albeit quite a cautious one. Wayne Rooney\u2019s Plymouth are level at Wayne Rooney\u2019s former side Derby. So much for that impenetrable Rams\u2019 home record and insurmountable Argyle away struggle. Keep your celebration icks coming in. This one is from Justin Madson: One celebration I\u2019d be okay never seeing again is putting the ball under the shirt and sucking the thumb. Just.... why? As an expectant father myself, I semi-endorse this message, Jason. Choose one or the other. Doing them both simultaneously doesn\u2019t make sense. Bankers for your Saturday afternoon acca* as follows: Peterborough 3-0 Cambridge Leeds 2-0 QPR Sunderland 2-0 Coventry *Obviously one of these games will now finish 3-3. More tetchy rumblings from supporters in Wolverhampton. Southampton are knocking on that door ahead of the half-time whistle, with new England callup Harwood-Bellis flashing a header wide from a Saints corner. Championship: Lowly Portsmouth have a precious lead at home to Preston courtesy of Josh Murphy, while Sunderland have doubled their lead over Coventry through an absolute wordly by Dennis Cirkin. The Stadium of Light is absolutely bouncing! It\u2019s early days, but will anyone catch the Black Cats this season? Talking of games lacking in excitement or eventfulness \u2026 Crystal Palace v Fulham is still locked at 0-0 with both defences in charge as it stands. All the reports coming from West Ham v Everton centre on how lifeless and lacklustre it\u2019s been so far. Seems to be no danger of an opening for either team in east London. Another celebrations-related email, this time from Ken Coogan who joins me in raging against modern cellies. The knee-slide brings out the rage in me I\u2019m afraid to say. More and more, I find myself going back to watching YouTube clips of goals (mostly by Liverpool) from the 1980s, to marvel at such straight-ahead, no-nonsense goal celebrations. Most of which were signed off by a handshake. Not a single knee slide in sight. BRING BACK THE HANDSHAKE. League One: Will Collar has scored for Stockport to take the lead against Bolton in that all-Greater Manchester clash. Stevenage lead Reading 1-0 against the run of play. Incidentally, Will Collar uses the same barber as me. Big W. Southampton are enjoying a heck of a lot of possession at Wolves and the home fans at Molineux, typically rather restless, are becoming \u2026 restless. Even though that Saints leveller was ruled out, the momentum seems to be withe the away team. A long throw-in finds its way to Yoane Wissa, who fires Brentford level at the back post! You just knew there\u2019d be goals in this game didn\u2019t you? Let\u2019s check in at the London Stadium \u2026 oh. Carl Jenkinson \u2026 from one of the bright young things in the Arsenal academy to being sent off for League Two Bromley inside 25 minutes at Cheltenham. Gah. Re: celebrations, David Mooney thinks he knows why we don\u2019t see too many knee slides nowadays. It\u2019s such a dumb way to pick up a serious injury. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if managers are banning their players from doing it. But I\u2019m pretty old school about this sort of thing \u2014 for me you can\u2019t beat the Alan Shearer hand-in-the-air celebration. Not sure about this gif, chaps. Championship: Sunderland are leading against managerless Coventry \u2013 oh for a Mark Robins figure in the dugout \u2013 with Wilson Isidor volleying home a sumptuous opener. Bristol City and Leeds have also taken the lead against Norwich and QPR respectively. Marcos Senesi has just missed a huge chance for the Cherries, but it won\u2019t matter too much as Evanlison has just put the visitors ahead. They\u2019ve dominated the early stages at the Gtech. League One: Wycombe are absolutely flying right now. They weren\u2019t even in the playoff places during the October international break, but they\u2019re top now and ahead today at Wigan. That\u2019s two games on the bounce that Wolves have got the rub of the green re: a contentious VAR decision. I\u2019m sure Gary O\u2019Neil will be thankful and appreciative. Bang, bang, two goals already at Molineux? Southampton think they\u2019ve levelled up through Ryan Manning, but VAR are going to check for a foul. There\u2019s no such thing given and it\u2019s a proper good strike from the left wing-back. Oh, hang on \u2026 they are looking at it. The referee has gone to the screen \u2013 and it\u2019s been chalked off after all! Wowsers, that\u2019s a tough call on Russell Martin\u2019s side. Championship: Derby are good are home and Plymouth are woeful on the road so it should surprise nobody that the Rams have gone ahead inside 10 minutes at Pride Park, via Jerry Yates. Is it just me or is every goal celebration these days either a faux-modest shrug of the shoulders or the mime of an archer\u2019s arrow? Is the knee slide going out of the modern game? Are Real Madrid back? Well if beating Osasuna 4-0, with Vin\u00edcius scoring a hat-trick and Jude Bellingham getting back on the scoresheet means that you\u2019re \u2018back\u2019 \u2013 then yes, I guess so. The Ian Holloway effect is real. It has taken Swindon even less time to score at MK Dons, going 1-0 up inside the first minute via Harry Smith. Erm, why haven\u2019t Brentford score yet? This is ridiculously poor from them. A dream start for Wolves in their must-win game against fellow struggles. Superb stuff, a flowing move finished off by Pablo Sarabia. Gary O\u2019Neil will be chuffed. Talk about flying out of the blocks. Is that a collective \u2018peeeeeeepp\u2019 I can hear? Yes, I believe it is. We\u2019re off. Down in League Two, good ol\u2019 Ollie is preparing for his first league game in charge of Swindon. He\u2019s two from two in the cup competitions so far and has already shaken up the League Two press conference scene, naturally. Here\u2019s another good footballing read for you to enjoy with a coffee before this afternoon\u2019s games get under way. It\u2019s objectionable when two teams play in reverse colours (blue and white v white and blue) like this, but that\u2019s not the most heinous crime on the teamsheet. Our resident Fitba correspondent Simon McMahon gets in touch with a nice preview of this afternoon\u2019s action north of the border: Afternoon Dominic. Dundee United, still fourth in the table despite picking up only a single point from their last three games, welcome Ross County to Tannadice today. United, with manager Jim Goodwin having signed a new deal this week, will be looking for all three points against the Dingwall side who sit ninth, but are only four points worse off. Elsewhere, struggling Hibs \u2013 bottom of the table with just one win in 11 games \u2013 are at home to St. Mirren, Motherwell play St. Johnstone and Jimmy Thelin\u2019s Barcelona Aberdeen face Dundee in the teatime kick off. Thanks as always Simon. Celtic and Rangers are both in action on Sunday. Full time in the early kick-offs around the country. Here are those scores, starting with the trio of Championship fixtures: Cardiff 1-3 Blackburn Middlesbrough 5-1 Luton Stoke 1-1 Millwall And now League One: Burton 2-0 Shrewsbury Wrexham 1-0 Mansfield League Two: Harrogate 1-2 Morecambe Salford 0-1 Carlisle Game over. Lewis Baker with a bolt from the blue for Blackburn on the break. 3-1 and that will sink the home side. Cardiff 1-2 Blackburn: This cracking game is now getting the cracking finale it deserves, with Cardiff now piling on the pressure in search of an equaliser. John Eustace is wearing a worried look on the touchline as his team try to keep out the baying Bluebirds. Five minutes to go plus addeds. Here\u2019s our big preview of the weekend\u2019s Premier League action, as usual. Elsewhere in the Championship, Middlesbrough are running riot at home to Luton \u2013 it\u2019s 4-1 to the hosts at the Riverside \u2013 while Ben Gibson has levelled up for Stoke at home to Millwall. One-each in the Potteries. Now the team news is taken care of (it comes earlier these days), I can focus on Cardiff v Blackburn. It\u2019s been a very watchable game so far with the visitors scoring two slick goals through Andi Weimann before Cardiff \u2013 full of effort and bluster but lacking a little in quality \u2013 pulled one back via a David Turnbull penalty rebound. Game on with 15 minutes remaining. Wolves (3-4-3): S\u00e1; Bueno, Dawson, T.Gomes; Semedo, J.Gomes, Lemina, A\u00eft-Nouri; Sarabia, Strand Larsen, Cunha. Southampton (3-5-2): Ramsdale; Harwood-Bellis, Bednarek, Stephens; Walker-Peters, Downes, Lallana, Fernandes, Manning; Archer, Armstrong. West Ham (4-3-3): Fabianski; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Emerson; Soucek, Rodr\u00edguez, Paquet\u00e1; Bowen, Antonio, Summerville. Everton (4-2-3-1): Pickford; Young, Tarkowski, Branthwaite, Mykolenko; Mangala, Gueye; Ndiaye, Doucour\u00e9, Lindstr\u00f8m; Calvert-Lewin. Crystal Palace (3-4-3): Henderson; Clyne, Lacroix, Gu\u00e9hi; Mu\u00f1oz, Chalobah, Devenny, Mitchell; Sarr, Kamada, Mateta. Fulham (4-2-3-1): Leno; Tete, Andersen, Bassey, Robinson; Berge, Pereira; Nelson, Smith Rowe, Iwobi; Jim\u00e9nez. Brentford (4-2-3-1): Flekken; Van den Berg, Collins, Pinnock, Janelt; N\u00f8rgaard, Jensen; Mbeumo, Damsgaard, Lewis-Potter; Wissa. Bournemouth (4-3-3): Kepa; Smith, Zabarnyi, Senesi, Kerkez; Cook, Christie, Adams; Semenyo, Evanlison, Kluivert. Good afternoon, and welcome to a 3pm (GMT) Saturday featuring the squeezed middle of the Premier League, though West Ham and Everton both teeter at the bottom. Brentford have a fantastic home record, while being the worst away side, but are at home to Bournemouth, recent conquerors of Manchester City AND Arsenal. Something\u2019s gotta give there. Crystal Palace v Fulham is a case of a London club being safely in mid-table and it perhaps not being the club you expected, even if Marco Silva continues to show what a fine manager he is. Palace are improving but still not out of trouble. And as for Wolves v Southampton, this is this week\u2019s six-pointer. Saints won last week, and Russell Martin can all but finish off his old pal Gary O\u2019Neil if his team follow that up. All that, plus the latest and greatest from the EFL and Europe, with second tier promotion frontrunners Sunderland and Leeds among those in action. We\u2019ll also run through the latest from the 12.30pm kick-offs, which are nearing their denouement. Join me.",

It was a particularly tough result for Marcus Smith who had a hand or foot in the first four of his side\u2019s five tries. </p> <p>England have now lost six of their past eight Tests, with the world champions, South Africa, bearing down on them like a menacing juggernaut and the optimism of the summer tour has drained away.</p> <p>Steve Borthwick will wince when he rewatches the final minutes. After Itoje had plunged over to draw England level and Smith\u2019s conversion made it 37-35 it seemed England had wriggled free from 28-18 down. Up went the restart and as Itoje came down the ball was dislodged forwards. The visitors, alert all day, applied crucial scrum pressure, another knock-on from Dan Cole further prolonged English agony and, finally, the ball was fizzed left for Jorgensen, born in Sheffield, to apply the steely blade.</p> <p>Give these young Wallabies quick ball and, on this evidence, next year\u2019s British &amp; Irish Lions tour may yet be closer than some anticipate. The new bolter from rugby league, Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, looks a rare prospect already and will be even better once he has had more time to adjust to his surroundings. The captain, Harry Wilson, led by energetic example and the fly-half, Noah Lolesio, kicked almost everything.</p> <p>What a triumph it was, too, for Joe Schmidt who loaded his bench in expectation of a tight finish and had his strategy pay dividends. It was a far cry from the implosion at last year\u2019s World Cup under a certain other high-profile coach. Maybe appointing a wily Kiwi to revitalise Australia was not such a bad decision after all.</p> <p>This was some contest, either way. Ridley Scott\u2019s <em>Gladiator</em> sequel is out next week but for no-holds-barred action it is hard to beat an international rugby stadium on a big match day. Hopefully, the Rugby Football Union will soon see fit to give visiting anthems more respect than playing a muted version over the public address before inviting a professional singer to belt out God Save the King.</p> <p>There was nothing wrong with England\u2019s opening salvo once the formalities had concluded. With barely four minutes gone Cunningham-South was diving over for his first try in the right corner, Smith\u2019s initial little chip over the top having scattered the defensive line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/archive-zip/giv-4559uemy08qyk4wf/\" > <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/archive-zip/giv-4559uemy08qyk4wf/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Cunningham-South bagged his second inside 13 minutes, with Smith\u2019s knifing break the catalyst on this occasion. England really do have some talented players when they let them off the leash. </p> <p>It seemed impossible England could be caught, unless you had watched their past few games. A golden Wallaby day felt even more improbable when a Smith penalty extended the margin to 12. </p> <p>The turning point? Maybe it was the moment the contest screeched to a grinding halt when Tom Curry was knocked out in the act of tackling Rob Valetini and had to leave the field after 23 minutes. It was the latest heavy blow for the Sale flanker, who will surely be unable to feature against the Springboks next Saturday.</p>    <p>Australia were re-energised and struck back almost immediately, a lovely onward flick from Suaalii giving Tom Wright oodles of time and space to finish. Lolesio slid over a super touchline conversion and, against the odds, the visitors were briefly back within five points.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/09/england-37-42-australia-autumn-nations-series-player-ratings\">England 37-42 Australia: Autumn Nations Series player ratings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Suaalii, though, is still learning aspects of his union trade and a spot of unnecessary misadventure in his own 22 led to a knock-on and a scrum penalty for England, which Smith duly punished. Australia were still buzzing around persistently in attack and a darting Tate McDermott, on for a bloodied Jake Gordon, put Wilson over for a well-taken score.</p> <p>The crowd went even quieter when Australia stormed back upfield and forced a panicked defence to concede an offside penalty Lolesio never looked like missing. With the scoreboard 20-18 in the visitors\u2019 favour, it was a completely different&nbsp;ball game.</p> <p>Twenty points was the most the Wallabies have scored in a first half against their old rivals in London. And they were not finished, an acrobatic score in the left corner from lock Jeremy Williams offering further encouragement. </p> <p>England did respond positively through Sleightholme but an overly intricate midfield move broke down to yield a soft try for Andrew Kellaway and, when his big moment came, Jorgensen also had more than enough pace to burn off the cover for a spectacular debut score. What a finish, what a game.</p>",

The visitors, alert all day, applied crucial scrum pressure, another knock-on from Dan Cole further prolonged English agony and, finally, the ball was fizzed left for Jorgensen, born in Sheffield, to apply the steely blade. Give these young Wallabies quick ball and, on this evidence, next year\u2019s British &amp; Irish Lions tour may yet be closer than some anticipate. The new bolter from rugby league, Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, looks a rare prospect already and will be even better once he has had more time to adjust to his surroundings. The captain, Harry Wilson, led by energetic example and the fly-half, Noah Lolesio, kicked almost everything. What a triumph it was, too, for Joe Schmidt who loaded his bench in expectation of a tight finish and had his strategy pay dividends. It was a far cry from the implosion at last year\u2019s World Cup under a certain other high-profile coach. Maybe appointing a wily Kiwi to revitalise Australia was not such a bad decision after all. This was some contest, either way. Ridley Scott\u2019s Gladiator sequel is out next week but for no-holds-barred action it is hard to beat an international rugby stadium on a big match day. Hopefully, the Rugby Football Union will soon see fit to give visiting anthems more respect than playing a muted version over the public address before inviting a professional singer to belt out God Save the King. There was nothing wrong with England\u2019s opening salvo once the formalities had concluded. With barely four minutes gone Cunningham-South was diving over for his first try in the right corner, Smith\u2019s initial little chip over the top having scattered the defensive line. Cunningham-South bagged his second inside 13 minutes, with Smith\u2019s knifing break the catalyst on this occasion. England really do have some talented players when they let them off the leash. It seemed impossible England could be caught, unless you had watched their past few games. A golden Wallaby day felt even more improbable when a Smith penalty extended the margin to 12. The turning point? Maybe it was the moment the contest screeched to a grinding halt when Tom Curry was knocked out in the act of tackling Rob Valetini and had to leave the field after 23 minutes. It was the latest heavy blow for the Sale flanker, who will surely be unable to feature against the Springboks next Saturday. Australia were re-energised and struck back almost immediately, a lovely onward flick from Suaalii giving Tom Wright oodles of time and space to finish. Lolesio slid over a super touchline conversion and, against the odds, the visitors were briefly back within five points. Suaalii, though, is still learning aspects of his union trade and a spot of unnecessary misadventure in his own 22 led to a knock-on and a scrum penalty for England, which Smith duly punished. Australia were still buzzing around persistently in attack and a darting Tate McDermott, on for a bloodied Jake Gordon, put Wilson over for a well-taken score. The crowd went even quieter when Australia stormed back upfield and forced a panicked defence to concede an offside penalty Lolesio never looked like missing. With the scoreboard 20-18 in the visitors\u2019 favour, it was a completely different ball game. Twenty points was the most the Wallabies have scored in a first half against their old rivals in London. And they were not finished, an acrobatic score in the left corner from lock Jeremy Williams offering further encouragement. England did respond positively through Sleightholme but an overly intricate midfield move broke down to yield a soft try for Andrew Kellaway and, when his big moment came, Jorgensen also had more than enough pace to burn off the cover for a spectacular debut score. What a finish, what a game.",

Good players \u2013 Bowen, Lucas Paquet\u00e1 and Mohammed Kudus \u2013 are out of sorts. Lopetegui has convinced nobody he is the man to lead the club into a bright post-Moyes future. Discipline has become a major problem, with Kudus banned for five games after his antics towards the end of the defeat to Tottenham, while Edson \u00c1lvarez picked up a stupid second yellow at Nottingham Forest, before offering an apt visual metaphor for West Ham\u2019s season by losing his way to the tunnel. Occasionally Summerville, one of the summer signings who has shown occasional flickers of promise, would go on a little run, his whirring legs a pleasing distraction from the general drabness, although his most decisive contribution was probably his charge back to block after Idrissa Gueye had released Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9. Had there been slightly more pace on the pass, or had Doucour\u00e9 been prepared to take on the shot first time, he might not have had the opportunity. \u201cIt was a good point, a good clean sheet, a solid performance,\u201d said Sean Dyche, \u201cbut we couldn\u2019t really find that bit of edge, that bit of devil, that bit of quality in the final third.\u201d Only in the final minutes before the break did anybody look like scoring, Pickford denying first Bowen and then Michail Antonio. That was the prelude for a more open second half, but the bar was low. A point apiece may end up being very useful in dragging both clubs towards mid-table but the idea that 60,000 willingly turned up to watch is, frankly, mind-boggling.",

As with Brexit, another yob\u2019s job, the morning-after feeling of failure is acute. </p> <p>It would be comforting to think, when contemplating the \u201ctrump of doomsday\u201d (to quote AE Housman\u2019s poem, <em>A Shropshire Lad</em>), that Trump&nbsp;#2 will not be as bad as advertised. An unconvincing political firewall is already under construction as \u201chearty congratulations\u201d and similarly disingenuous, upbeat messages are dispatched across a widening Atlantic by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/06/keir-starmer-congratulates-donald-trump-election-victory\">Keir Starmer</a> and worried EU leaders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>His criminal contempt for laws, domestic and international, will be emulated globally</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It would be nice to feel something positive might emerge from Trump\u2019s plans to scrap multilateralism, rebuild Fortress America with tariff walls, go ape drilling for oil and gas, appease thuggish dictators and extend government controls into private lives. It would be good to believe that in victory, he will show magnanimity. Dream on. All the signs are that Trump\u2019s second coming will be more wantonly, recklessly, lawlessly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-election-11-issues-threat\">destructive than&nbsp;ever</a>.</p> <p>Measured in conventional geopolitical terms, gifting Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin a strategic triumph by imposing a \u201cpeace\u201d settlement on Ukraine, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/ukraine-trump-victory\">as Trump proposes</a>, would undoubtedly set a dire precedent. In such a scenario, brute force prevails, the UN charter is shredded, national borders are changed by diktat. Neighbours such as Georgia, Moldova, Estonia, even Poland and Finland, will wonder: who\u2019s next? So, too, will a stricken Nato.</p> <p>Yet the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2024-02/two-year-update-protection-civilians-impact-hostilities-civilians-24.pdf\">impact of Ukraine\u2019s betrayal</a> at a human, emotional level could be potentially more devastating still. What to say to the families of 30,000 dead Ukrainian soldiers? How to explain their cruel abandonment to millions of pro-western civilians? And who in the world, in Taiwan and elsewhere, would any longer feel they could trust Washington\u2019s word?</p> <p>Or take the Middle East. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his gang of religious zealots, bigots and fruit-cases will seek to exploit Trump\u2019s anti-Palestinian bias. They are pushing to annex much of the West Bank and Gaza and seize control of a chunk of south Lebanon. If backed by the US, such a policy guarantees perpetual Middle East warfare. </p> <p>But beyond that extremist agenda lies a benighted hinterland full of human pain and suffering. The death toll in Gaza since 7 October 2023 now exceeds 43,000. Casualties are rising rapidly in Lebanon, too. Of 100,000 injured in Gaza, <a href=\"https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-235-gaza-strip\">many are children</a>, many severely traumatised, many orphaned. When they grow up, assuming they survive, how will they feel? Hatred for Israel and America hardly begins to cover it. As in Ukraine, Trump\u2019s plans will not advance \u201cpeace\u201d. Instead he will set timebombs ticking for the next big war, maybe with Iran.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s demonisation of migrants as pariahs and criminals, regardless of status, appealed to voters\u2019 worst instincts. It sent pernicious, potent subliminal racist messages. The hostile feelings subsequently stirred up among the resident population, ranging from violent rage to normalised discriminatory attitudes, may now persist and intensify.</p> <p>Yet that suits Trump. It will help him pursue his <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/06/trump-deportation-immigration/76088969007/\">promised mass deportations</a> of up to 11 million \u201cillegals\u201d by corralling families in huge detention centres, effectively concentration camps. If such people are depicted as a threat and as lesser human beings, it\u2019s easier to abuse and mistreat them. And if he does it, so will others.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s broad disrespect for human rights, especially women\u2019s and trans rights; his disdain for democratic checks and balances; his unilateral trashing of alliances and treaties (be it Nato or the Paris climate agreement); and his criminal contempt for laws, domestic and international, are behaviours that will be emulated globally. Rightwing populists in Latin America, Europe and the UK lap it up. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/far-right-figures-celebrate-trump-win-bolsonaro-milei-meloni-salvini\">Would-be copycats abound</a>.</p> <p>Trump, meanwhile, fully reciprocates the fury felt by opponents at home and abroad. Touchy-feely, not so much; but Mr Angry? Yes. Desire for personal retribution and revenge obsesses him. And this is the crux. Trump is propelled by passion, not policy. For him, politics is primarily about emotional responses. He\u2019s not rational, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/02/donald-trump-is-a-superspreader-for-a-craziness-that-has-split-america-in-two\">as discussed here last week</a>. He\u2019s impulsive, instinctive, visceral. It\u2019s about gut and whim \u201cd\u2019you feel&nbsp;me?\u201d.</p> <p>To make America great again, Trump is preparing to re-make the world in his vile image, by disrespecting, demoting and diminishing democratic allies (like Britain) and sucking up to the like-minded authoritarian leaders he is most comfortable with. If it makes him feel good, then to hell with everyone and everything.</p> <p>Coming very soon to a cinema near you: <em>Trump #2: How the West Was Lost.</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Tisdall is the Observer\u2019s Foreign Affairs Commentator</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It would be comforting to think, when contemplating the \u201ctrump of doomsday\u201d (to quote AE Housman\u2019s poem, A Shropshire Lad), that Trump #2 will not be as bad as advertised. An unconvincing political firewall is already under construction as \u201chearty congratulations\u201d and similarly disingenuous, upbeat messages are dispatched across a widening Atlantic by Keir Starmer and worried EU leaders. It would be nice to feel something positive might emerge from Trump\u2019s plans to scrap multilateralism, rebuild Fortress America with tariff walls, go ape drilling for oil and gas, appease thuggish dictators and extend government controls into private lives. It would be good to believe that in victory, he will show magnanimity. Dream on. All the signs are that Trump\u2019s second coming will be more wantonly, recklessly, lawlessly destructive than ever. Measured in conventional geopolitical terms, gifting Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin a strategic triumph by imposing a \u201cpeace\u201d settlement on Ukraine, as Trump proposes, would undoubtedly set a dire precedent. In such a scenario, brute force prevails, the UN charter is shredded, national borders are changed by diktat. Neighbours such as Georgia, Moldova, Estonia, even Poland and Finland, will wonder: who\u2019s next? So, too, will a stricken Nato. Yet the impact of Ukraine\u2019s betrayal at a human, emotional level could be potentially more devastating still. What to say to the families of 30,000 dead Ukrainian soldiers? How to explain their cruel abandonment to millions of pro-western civilians? And who in the world, in Taiwan and elsewhere, would any longer feel they could trust Washington\u2019s word? Or take the Middle East. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his gang of religious zealots, bigots and fruit-cases will seek to exploit Trump\u2019s anti-Palestinian bias. They are pushing to annex much of the West Bank and Gaza and seize control of a chunk of south Lebanon. If backed by the US, such a policy guarantees perpetual Middle East warfare. But beyond that extremist agenda lies a benighted hinterland full of human pain and suffering. The death toll in Gaza since 7 October 2023 now exceeds 43,000. Casualties are rising rapidly in Lebanon, too. Of 100,000 injured in Gaza, many are children, many severely traumatised, many orphaned. When they grow up, assuming they survive, how will they feel? Hatred for Israel and America hardly begins to cover it. As in Ukraine, Trump\u2019s plans will not advance \u201cpeace\u201d. Instead he will set timebombs ticking for the next big war, maybe with Iran. Trump\u2019s demonisation of migrants as pariahs and criminals, regardless of status, appealed to voters\u2019 worst instincts. It sent pernicious, potent subliminal racist messages. The hostile feelings subsequently stirred up among the resident population, ranging from violent rage to normalised discriminatory attitudes, may now persist and intensify. Yet that suits Trump. It will help him pursue his promised mass deportations of up to 11 million \u201cillegals\u201d by corralling families in huge detention centres, effectively concentration camps. If such people are depicted as a threat and as lesser human beings, it\u2019s easier to abuse and mistreat them. And if he does it, so will others. Trump\u2019s broad disrespect for human rights, especially women\u2019s and trans rights; his disdain for democratic checks and balances; his unilateral trashing of alliances and treaties (be it Nato or the Paris climate agreement); and his criminal contempt for laws, domestic and international, are behaviours that will be emulated globally. Rightwing populists in Latin America, Europe and the UK lap it up. Would-be copycats abound. Trump, meanwhile, fully reciprocates the fury felt by opponents at home and abroad. Touchy-feely, not so much; but Mr Angry? Yes. Desire for personal retribution and revenge obsesses him. And this is the crux. Trump is propelled by passion, not policy. For him, politics is primarily about emotional responses. He\u2019s not rational, as discussed here last week. He\u2019s impulsive, instinctive, visceral. It\u2019s about gut and whim \u201cd\u2019you feel me?\u201d. To make America great again, Trump is preparing to re-make the world in his vile image, by disrespecting, demoting and diminishing democratic allies (like Britain) and sucking up to the like-minded authoritarian leaders he is most comfortable with. If it makes him feel good, then to hell with everyone and everything.

On Boxing Day 2022, on a holiday in Rome, while sitting at a table, Kureishi passed out unexpectedly and fell. He woke up, he writes, \u201cin a pool of blood, my head in a grotesquely twisted position\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/12/hanif-kureishi-on-his-accident-i-believed-i-was-dying-that-i-had-three-breaths-left-it-seemed-like-a-miserable-and-ignoble-way-to-go\">Convinced he was about to die</a>, he saw \u201ca scooped, semicircular object with talons attached scuttling towards me\u201d.

Unable to walk or use his hands, to sit up unaided or \u201cvacate his bowels\u201d, as the nurses have it, he is entirely reliant on others. He\u2019s acute on the simultaneous power and helplessness of his new dependent state, how he has to \u201cseduce\u201d his friends and family into helping him with the simplest of tasks: sending a text, drinking a cappuccino.</p> <p>Where once he would take his cup of coffee up the stairs to his office, pick up one of his beloved pens to write on a nice thick piece of paper (he describes all this beautifully), now he has to dictate his words to his partner or one of his sons.

One of which was <strong><a href=\"https://www.hidden20.org/podcast\">The Hidden 20%</a></strong>, winner of best interview podcast. Hosted by entrepreneur Ben Branson, the show concentrates on the 20% of people who are neurodivergent (Branson himself was diagnosed with autism and ADHD as an adult). Interviewees range from the humongously famous (Kit \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Harington) to the not at all (the most recent interviewee, Abigail Agyei-Jones, is an ex-civil servant turned adviser for inclusion). In all cases, Branson is thoroughly positive and pleasant, without pushing the ever-tricky idea of neurodivergence being a superpower.</p>    <p>On occasion, though, like many modern interviewers, he strays into simple sympathising. No one is listening to <em>The Hidden 20%</em> for <em>Today</em>-style confrontation, but too much gentleness can lead into generalisation rather than the specifics that come with probing more deeply. Jon Ronson, Louis Theroux and Annie Macmanus are all able to ask tricky questions without being mean. Still, the recent show with comedian Marcus Brigstocke, who <a href=\"https://www.hidden20.org/podcast/marcus-brigstocke\">talked about his dyslexia and addictions</a>, was excellent, as was the one with <a href=\"https://www.hidden20.org/podcast/dr-rayyan-zafar\">Dr Rayyan Zafar</a>, which discussed how different drugs, including psychedelics, can have an effect on someone with ADHD.</p>    <p>And I don\u2019t want to have a go at Branson, because even someone as experienced as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/15/i-throw-everything-at-it-davina-mccall-on-harnessing-her-feelgood-factor\">Davina McCall</a> can end up oversympathising. Her new podcast, <strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/begin-again-with-davina-mccall/id1773104705\">Begin Again</a></strong> \u2013 about women in midlife \u2013 opened with an almost unctuous interview with Fearne Cotton, both women cooing over each other\u2019s strength and general fabulousness. Ugh. But over the next two episodes, McCall is much better; particularlywhen she talks to relationship coach Paul C Brunson (he\u2019s on <em>Married at First Sight</em>), who is genuinely interesting, if prescriptive, about how long-term relationships can work (he insists that you should both be working through relationship-improving books together \u2013 yes, he is American).</p> <p>Which brings me to <strong><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/4rOoJ6Egrf8K2IrywzwOMk\">Joe Rogan</a></strong>, the biggest podcaster in the world. His demographic, broadly, is youngish men, and he interviewed Donald Trump and Elon Musk a few days before the US election. Rogan asked Kamala Harris for an interview too, but she declined, saying she didn\u2019t have the time. His podcasts are about three hours long. Middle-aged women like to be busy and productive. Was Harris wrong? You have to wonder.</p>    <p>I listened to both the Trump and the Musk interviews. I couldn\u2019t get through the whole of Trump\u2019s but I listened long enough to know that the Rogan interview was better than nearly every one I\u2019ve heard with the orange man-baby, simply because Trump sounded relaxed.

It\u2019s also comforting to have someone read you a story aloud. With this in mind, why not listen to Art Malik reading Hanif Kureishi\u2019s new book, Shattered, on Radio 4? The funny, engaging, super-sharp Kureishi is known for his fiction, plays and screenplays (The Buddha of Suburbia, My Beautiful Laundrette, The Mother), but he\u2019s also the author of devastating nonfiction, and Shattered is very definitely written from life. On Boxing Day 2022, on a holiday in Rome, while sitting at a table, Kureishi passed out unexpectedly and fell. He woke up, he writes, \u201cin a pool of blood, my head in a grotesquely twisted position\u201d. Convinced he was about to die, he saw \u201ca scooped, semicircular object with talons attached scuttling towards me\u201d. It was his hand. He\u2019d somehow both stretched and banged his neck, with the result that he became instantly paralysed, unable to control his limbs. Kureishi\u2019s brain was unaffected, and he uses his clear, clever mind to describe his new life. Unable to walk or use his hands, to sit up unaided or \u201cvacate his bowels\u201d, as the nurses have it, he is entirely reliant on others. He\u2019s acute on the simultaneous power and helplessness of his new dependent state, how he has to \u201cseduce\u201d his friends and family into helping him with the simplest of tasks: sending a text, drinking a cappuccino. Where once he would take his cup of coffee up the stairs to his office, pick up one of his beloved pens to write on a nice thick piece of paper (he describes all this beautifully), now he has to dictate his words to his partner or one of his sons. They laboriously type them into their phone, or laptop. A new form of writing. People appear in Kureishi\u2019s life \u2013 fellow patients Miss S and \u201cthe Maestro\u201d in Italy, John in the UK \u2013 and then depart, as he is shunted between institutions, eventually returning to his own house, now adapted so that he can live there (with care workers).

The contested primary for the seat sprang from Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected in 2018 for the Democrats, switched to become an independent and then announced she wasn\u2019t seeking re-election this year.

Kolodin, a Republican, is considering a proposal that would require early ballots to be returned in advance of election day, giving time for election officials to go through the process of verification.

In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president\">announcing his first campaign for president in 2015</a>, Trump called Mexicans rapists and criminals.</p> <p>He demeaned a female TV moderator, Megyn Kelly, at his first Republican candidates\u2019 debate, saying she had \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/aug/08/donald-trump-menstruation-fox-news-megyn-kelly-audio\">blood coming out of her wherever</a>\u201d and later <a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/629553612839124992\">implied she was a \u201cbimbo\u201d</a>. He also called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/27/donald-trump-deport-11-million-migrants-is-that-even-possible\">migrants to be deported en masse</a> and for Muslims to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\">banned from entering the US</a>.</p> <p>No serious presidential candidate had ever talked this way, and for several months, mainstream Republicans regarded his approach as electoral suicide. Even once it became apparent Trump might win the party nomination, they still feared his candidacy would go down in flames because swing voters in the presidential election would \u201cflock away from him in droves\u201d, as party stalwart Henry Barbour put it.</p> <p>Then Trump won \u2013 and American politics has not been the same since.</p> <p>The <em>country</em> has not been the same since. It\u2019s true, the US has never been quite the shining beacon of its own imagination.</p> <p>On the international stage, it has frequently been belligerent, bullying, chaotic, dysfunctional and indifferent to the suffering of people in faraway nations \u2013 traits that bear some passing similarity to Trump\u2019s leadership style.</p> <p>But it has also, for more than a century, been the standard-bearer of a certain lofty vision, a driver of strategic alliances between similarly advanced democratic nations intent on extending their economic, military and cultural footprint across continents.</p> <p>After one Trump presidency and on the eve of another, it is now clear that a once mighty global superpower is allowing its gaze to turn inward, to feed off resentment more than idealism, to think smaller.</p> <p>Public sentiment \u2013 not just the political class \u2013 feels threatened by the flow of migrants once regarded as the country\u2019s lifeblood. Global trade, once an article of faith for free marketeers and architects of the postwar Pax Americana, is now a cancer eating away at US prosperity \u2013 its own foreign invasion.</p> <p>Military alliances and foreign policy no longer command the cross-party consensus of the cold war era, when politics could be relied upon to \u201cstop at the water\u2019s edge\u201d, in the famous formulation of the Truman-era senator Arthur Vandenberg.</p> <p>Now the politics don\u2019t stop at all, for any reason. And alliances are for chumps.</p>    <p>Last week\u2019s election was a contest between a unifying, consensus vision laid out by Kamala Harris \u2013 and by that Republican autopsy document of the pre-Trump era \u2013 and Trump\u2019s altogether darker, us-versus-them, zero-sum vision of a world where nobody can win without someone else becoming a loser and payback is a dish best served piping hot. The contest could have gone either way \u2013 there has been much talk of a different outcome with a different Democratic candidate, or with a different process for selecting her.</p> <p>Still, the fact that the zero-sum vision proved so seductive says something powerful about the collapse of American ideals, and the pessimism and anger that has overtaken large swaths of the country.</p> <p>In 2016 and 2020, that anger was largely confined to the white working-class staring down a bleak future without the manufacturing jobs that once sustained them.</p> <p>Now it has spread to groups once disgusted by Trump, or whom Trump has openly disparaged \u2013 Latinos, young voters, Black men. Kelly, the TV personality memorably insulted by Trump during his first campaign, stumped for him in Pennsylvania in the closing days of the campaign. Even undocumented migrants, ostensibly facing mass deportation once the new administration takes office, have been<a href=\"https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/elections/state/2024/11/07/austin-latino-immigrant-men-donald-trump-2024-united-states-presidential-election-appeal-economy/76092640007/\"> voicing cautious support</a> for Trump because they believe his economic policies will improve their prospects, risks and all.</p> <p>At first glance, this is a baffling state of affairs. How could so many Americans vote against their own self-interest, when it is plain \u2013 both from past experience and from the stated intentions of Trump and his allies \u2013 that the chief beneficiaries of the incoming administration are likely to be the billionaire class? When the depressed, disaffected communities of the rust belt can expect little if any of the relief Trump has been promising but failing to deliver for years?</p>    <p>The answer has a lot to do with the zero-sum mentality that Trump has sold so successfully.</p> <p>People across the country have lost all faith in the American dream: the notion that hard work and a desire for self-improvement are all it takes to climb up the social ladder, to own a home, to lay the foundations for the success of your children and grandchildren.</p> <p>They have lost their faith because the dream simply does not correspond to their lived experience.</p> <p>As in Britain and other post-industrial societies, too many lives are a constant struggle to get by month to month, with no end in sight to the bills and day-to-day living expenses and crippling levels of personal debt. </p> <p>The majority of jobs in the US now require some qualification beyond high school, but college is dizzyingly expensive and dropout rates are high enough to deter many people from even starting. Medical debt in a country without a national health service is rampant. Home ownership is simply out of reach.</p> <p>When people think of prosperity and success, what many of them see is an exclusive club of Americans, recipients of generations of wealth who live in increasingly expensive big cities, who have the financial flexibility to get through college, find a high-paying job and come up with a down payment on a house.</p> <p>The fix is in, as Trump likes to say. The game is rigged, and if you\u2019re not a member of the club at birth, your chances of being admitted are slim to none.</p> <p>Under such circumstances, the Democrats\u2019 promise of consensus leadership rings largely hollow. The consensus arguably broke a long time ago, when the bursting of the housing bubble of the early 00s left many would-be homeowners crippled by debt and led to the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression.</p> <p>It broke all over again during the Covid pandemic, when the economy ground to halt, unemployment rocketed and prices of everyday goods spun alarmingly out of control. Democrats have controlled the White House for 12 of the past 16 years, yet their idea of consensus has failed to reach much beyond the big-city limits.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/09/president-trump-election-maga\">Trump\u2019s \u2018golden age of America\u2019 could be an unrestrained imperial presidency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More appealing by far to those on the outside looking in are Trump\u2019s promises of retribution, of tearing down the entire system and starting again.</p> <p>Those promises may also prove to be hollow over time, but to people only intermittently focused on politics as they struggle to put food on the table for their families, they feel at least fleetingly empowering. In a zero-sum world, blaming migrants for the country\u2019s woes feels like its own kind of victory. It means some other group is at the bottom of the social heap for a change.</p> <p>Overlaid on this grim picture is the slow implosion of the two main political parties. The coalitions held together by Republicans and Democrats were always complicated affairs: an awkward marriage of big business and Christian fundamentalism on the right; a patchwork of union workers, racial minorities, intellectuals and, for a long time, old-guard southern segregationists on the left.</p> <p>Now, though, what is most apparent is not their intricacy but their weakness. The Republican party was as powerless to stop Trump\u2019s hostile takeover in 2016 as the Democrats were to hold on to their bedrock of support in the \u201cblue wall\u201d states in the upper midwest \u2013 Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.</p> <p>What drives American politics now is, rather, the unfettered power of money, much of it managed by groups outside party control who do not have to declare their funding sources and can make or break candidates depending on their willingness to follow a preordained set of policy prescriptions.</p>    <p>The sway of special interest groups is a longstanding problem in American politics; think of the pharmaceutical industry lobbying to keep drug prices higher than in any other western country, or the American Israel Public Affairs Committee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/22/aipac-pro-israel-lobby-group-us-elections\">spending tens of millions</a> to keep critics of the Israeli government out of Congress.</p> <p>But it has grown exponentially worse since the supreme court\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/21/citizens-united-supreme-court-ruling\">2010 Citizens United decision</a>, which has fuelled an unprecedented growth in \u201cdark money\u201d \u2013 untraceable lobbying funds that far outstrip anything candidates are able to raise on their own behalf and tilt the political playing field accordingly.</p> <p>This, too, has given an edge to a demagogue such as Trump, whose vulgarity and bluster serve as useful distractions from a corporate-friendly policy agenda driven largely by tax cuts, deregulation and the dismantling of what Trump\u2019s former political consigliere Steve Bannon calls the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/03/steve-bannon-trump-maga-2024-election\">administrative state</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The Democrats, meanwhile, can talk all they want about serving the interests of all Americans, but they too rely on dark money representing the interests of Wall Street, big tech companies and more, and are all but doomed to come off as hypocritical and insincere as a result.</p> <p>Two generations ago, the avatars of the civil rights movement were under no illusions about the brutal nature of the forces driving US society \u2013 \u201cthe same old stupid plan / Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak\u201d, as Langston Hughes wrote in his famous poem Let America Be America Again.</p> <p>The hope then was this was at least a correctable problem, that the oppressed could push back against their oppressors and create a fairer, more just world.</p> <p>What nobody then envisaged was that the oppressed themselves \u2013 the working class, disaffected young Black and Latino men, even undocumented manual labourers \u2013 would one day support the rise of an autocratic government willing to overthrow every sacred tenet of American public life, and even the constitution itself, with its promise of creating \u201ca more perfect union\u201d.</p> <p>Yet here we are. In January 2021, at Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/22/how-amanda-gorman-became-the-voice-of-a-new-american-era\">young poet Amanda Gorman</a> invoked the spirit of the civil rights era in describing \u201ca nation that isn\u2019t broken but simply unfinished\u201d.</p> <p>It now appears that her faith was misplaced. The US we thought we knew is broken indeed, and may well be finished.</p>",

Military alliances and foreign policy no longer command the cross-party consensus of the cold war era, when politics could be relied upon to \u201cstop at the water\u2019s edge\u201d, in the famous formulation of the Truman-era senator Arthur Vandenberg. Now the politics don\u2019t stop at all, for any reason. And alliances are for chumps. Last week\u2019s election was a contest between a unifying, consensus vision laid out by Kamala Harris \u2013 and by that Republican autopsy document of the pre-Trump era \u2013 and Trump\u2019s altogether darker, us-versus-them, zero-sum vision of a world where nobody can win without someone else becoming a loser and payback is a dish best served piping hot. The contest could have gone either way \u2013 there has been much talk of a different outcome with a different Democratic candidate, or with a different process for selecting her. Still, the fact that the zero-sum vision proved so seductive says something powerful about the collapse of American ideals, and the pessimism and anger that has overtaken large swaths of the country. In 2016 and 2020, that anger was largely confined to the white working-class staring down a bleak future without the manufacturing jobs that once sustained them. Now it has spread to groups once disgusted by Trump, or whom Trump has openly disparaged \u2013 Latinos, young voters, Black men. Kelly, the TV personality memorably insulted by Trump during his first campaign, stumped for him in Pennsylvania in the closing days of the campaign. Even undocumented migrants, ostensibly facing mass deportation once the new administration takes office, have been voicing cautious support for Trump because they believe his economic policies will improve their prospects, risks and all. At first glance, this is a baffling state of affairs. How could so many Americans vote against their own self-interest, when it is plain \u2013 both from past experience and from the stated intentions of Trump and his allies \u2013 that the chief beneficiaries of the incoming administration are likely to be the billionaire class? When the depressed, disaffected communities of the rust belt can expect little if any of the relief Trump has been promising but failing to deliver for years? The answer has a lot to do with the zero-sum mentality that Trump has sold so successfully. People across the country have lost all faith in the American dream: the notion that hard work and a desire for self-improvement are all it takes to climb up the social ladder, to own a home, to lay the foundations for the success of your children and grandchildren. They have lost their faith because the dream simply does not correspond to their lived experience. As in Britain and other post-industrial societies, too many lives are a constant struggle to get by month to month, with no end in sight to the bills and day-to-day living expenses and crippling levels of personal debt. The majority of jobs in the US now require some qualification beyond high school, but college is dizzyingly expensive and dropout rates are high enough to deter many people from even starting. Medical debt in a country without a national health service is rampant. Home ownership is simply out of reach. When people think of prosperity and success, what many of them see is an exclusive club of Americans, recipients of generations of wealth who live in increasingly expensive big cities, who have the financial flexibility to get through college, find a high-paying job and come up with a down payment on a house. The fix is in, as Trump likes to say. The game is rigged, and if you\u2019re not a member of the club at birth, your chances of being admitted are slim to none. Under such circumstances, the Democrats\u2019 promise of consensus leadership rings largely hollow. The consensus arguably broke a long time ago, when the bursting of the housing bubble of the early 00s left many would-be homeowners crippled by debt and led to the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression. It broke all over again during the Covid pandemic, when the economy ground to halt, unemployment rocketed and prices of everyday goods spun alarmingly out of control. Democrats have controlled the White House for 12 of the past 16 years, yet their idea of consensus has failed to reach much beyond the big-city limits. More appealing by far to those on the outside looking in are Trump\u2019s promises of retribution, of tearing down the entire system and starting again. Those promises may also prove to be hollow over time, but to people only intermittently focused on politics as they struggle to put food on the table for their families, they feel at least fleetingly empowering. In a zero-sum world, blaming migrants for the country\u2019s woes feels like its own kind of victory. It means some other group is at the bottom of the social heap for a change. Overlaid on this grim picture is the slow implosion of the two main political parties. The coalitions held together by Republicans and Democrats were always complicated affairs: an awkward marriage of big business and Christian fundamentalism on the right; a patchwork of union workers, racial minorities, intellectuals and, for a long time, old-guard southern segregationists on the left. Now, though, what is most apparent is not their intricacy but their weakness. The Republican party was as powerless to stop Trump\u2019s hostile takeover in 2016 as the Democrats were to hold on to their bedrock of support in the \u201cblue wall\u201d states in the upper midwest \u2013 Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. What drives American politics now is, rather, the unfettered power of money, much of it managed by groups outside party control who do not have to declare their funding sources and can make or break candidates depending on their willingness to follow a preordained set of policy prescriptions. The sway of special interest groups is a longstanding problem in American politics; think of the pharmaceutical industry lobbying to keep drug prices higher than in any other western country, or the American Israel Public Affairs Committee spending tens of millions to keep critics of the Israeli government out of Congress. But it has grown exponentially worse since the supreme court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision, which has fuelled an unprecedented growth in \u201cdark money\u201d \u2013 untraceable lobbying funds that far outstrip anything candidates are able to raise on their own behalf and tilt the political playing field accordingly. This, too, has given an edge to a demagogue such as Trump, whose vulgarity and bluster serve as useful distractions from a corporate-friendly policy agenda driven largely by tax cuts, deregulation and the dismantling of what Trump\u2019s former political consigliere Steve Bannon calls the \u201cadministrative state\u201d. The Democrats, meanwhile, can talk all they want about serving the interests of all Americans, but they too rely on dark money representing the interests of Wall Street, big tech companies and more, and are all but doomed to come off as hypocritical and insincere as a result. Two generations ago, the avatars of the civil rights movement were under no illusions about the brutal nature of the forces driving US society \u2013 \u201cthe same old stupid plan / Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak\u201d, as Langston Hughes wrote in his famous poem Let America Be America Again. The hope then was this was at least a correctable problem, that the oppressed could push back against their oppressors and create a fairer, more just world. What nobody then envisaged was that the oppressed themselves \u2013 the working class, disaffected young Black and Latino men, even undocumented manual labourers \u2013 would one day support the rise of an autocratic government willing to overthrow every sacred tenet of American public life, and even the constitution itself, with its promise of creating \u201ca more perfect union\u201d. Yet here we are. In January 2021, at Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration, the young poet Amanda Gorman invoked the spirit of the civil rights era in describing \u201ca nation that isn\u2019t broken but simply unfinished\u201d. It now appears that her faith was misplaced. The US we thought we knew is broken indeed, and may well be finished.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has won his sixth battleground state of the 2024 election, flipping the state for the Republicans early on Saturday, by beating Kamala Harris in Nevada. Trump won by 51% of the vote to the Democrat\u2019s 47%, the first time the GOP has won the state in the presidential vote since the 2004 election won by George W Bush. But Democrats took a crumb of comfort from the fact that Democratic US Senator Jacky Rosen won re-election in Nevada, which was also called early on Saturday. The president-elect has 301 electoral college votes so far, well beyond the 270 point he surpassed early on Wednesday to take the White House, over Democratic rival Kamala Harris, and the Republican has now won six of the seven battleground states. On Saturday, morning only Arizona remained to be called. The Associated Press declared Trump the winner in Nevada after concluding there were not enough uncounted ballots in the state\u2019s strongest Democratic areas to overcome the former president\u2019s 46,000-vote lead over the Democratic nominee. The AP, which also called the Senate seat for the first-term Democrat, only declares a winner once it can determine that a trailing candidate can\u2019t close the gap and overtake the vote leader. Rosen\u2019s defeat of a Trump-endorsed challenger gave some comfort to her party, although the Democrats have already lost their thin majority in the US Senate, while keeping hope alive that they can take a majority in the House. Rosen\u2019s race was tighter than the one for the White House, and she held off Republican challenger Sam Brown with 48% of the votes cast to his 46%. Read more of the Guardian\u2019s 2024 US election coverage Trump wins the presidency \u2013 how did it happen? With Trump re-elected, this is what\u2019s at stake Abortion ballot measure results by state Rosen, a former Las Vegas-area synagogue president and computer programmer, ran ads touting herself as an independent who doesn\u2019t listen to \u201cparty leaders\u201d. \u201cThank you, Nevada! I\u2019m honored and grateful to continue serving as your United States Senator,\u201d Rosen posted on the social media platform X. Rosen had been polling ahead of Brown throughout the campaign, though the race tightened as election day approached. Rosen ran an energetic campaign, focusing on hyper-local issues in a state where more than a third of voters identify as non-partisan and attacking her opponent\u2019s shifting stance on abortion rights. Rosen was hand-picked to run for Congress and then the Senate \u2013 seemingly out of nowhere \u2013 by Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate leader from Nevada who helped reshape the state\u2019s politics over his long political career. In 2018 \u2013 after serving just two years in Congress \u2013 she unseated the Republican senator Dean Heller with a five-point margin. A former member of Nevada\u2019s Culinary Workers Union, she maintained the support of the state\u2019s politically powerful unions this time around as well, with the culinary union knocking on nearly 1m doors on behalf of her campaign. In her closing message to voters, Rosen focused on abortion rights, positioning herself as a champion of reproductive freedoms, and pointed to her opponent\u2019s waffling on the issue and refusal to voice support for the ballot measure. Though abortion remains legal in Nevada, a ballot proposal to enshrine the right in the constitution was deeply popular. Meanwhile, Brown, a military veteran and Purple Heart recipient, was slow to gain traction and define his platform in the lead-up to the election. Having moved to Reno from Dallas in 2018, Brown had struggled to shake his reputation as a Nevada newcomer. In the weeks before election day, several rural Republican officials endorsed Rosen, praising her as a political consensus-builder who had brought a wealth of federal funding and resources to the state. At a debate last month, she told supporters she was \u201cproud to be one of the most bipartisan, effective and independent senators\u201d. Most polls showed Rosen ahead of Brown for weeks before the election, and she maintained a three-to-one fundraising and spending advantage over her opponent. But the race tightened significantly before election day. Brown was boosted by a Pac linked to the Republican Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, which spent $6m on last-minute ads appealing to Maga voters: \u201cPresident Trump and Nevada need Sam Brown in the Senate.\u201d Brown appeared alongside Trump during the president\u2019s several visits to the state and had closely aligned himself with the former president\u2019s policy platforms.

      "body": "<p>There is something about an island that stirs the imagination. Or, in any case, it seems to stir mine.</p> <p>A few years ago, on a trip to the C\u00f4te de Granit Rose in Brittany, I walked along seaweed-strewn sands towards one of the many tidal islands dotted along that coastline. As I approached I noticed that on the nearest island, there was a tiny house \u2013 a single cottage, all alone \u2013 and I felt a familiar prickle running up my spine, the shrinking of the scalp that tells me to pay attention, that there\u2019s <em>something</em> here: the beginning of a story.</p> <p>My new novel is set on a tidal island. This fictional island of Eris, located somewhere off the west coast of Scotland, also boasts a single house: mine is inhabited by Vanessa, an artist who has fled life in England in search of the space and silence to live as she pleases, unfettered by the constraints of marriage, family or society.</p> <p>Vanessa came to life for me that day I saw the island in Brittany: although I knew I wanted to write about an artist, the particulars of her character were shaped by the landscape she chose to live in. When I looked at that little house on the tidal island in Brittany, what interested me was the sort of person who might choose to live there, at the mercy of the weather and the tide.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That\u2019s the attraction of an island \u2013 it\u2019s hard to get to. Hard to leave. That\u2019s the point of them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On my birthday this year, I went to the Isle of Lewis \u2013 a flying visit that very nearly didn\u2019t happen.<strong> </strong>The weather was poor the morning I flew, a blanket of low cloud hanging over the islands and, after 10 minutes of circling and one abortive attempt at landing, the pilot announced he would be diverting to Inverness. The disappointment was still settling when the clouds broke, offering a tantalising glimpse of green, and through that slender window we descended to Stornoway.</p> <p>That\u2019s the attraction of an island \u2013 it\u2019s hard to get to. Hard to leave. That\u2019s the <em>point</em> of them \u2013 or at least it feels that way to me. And it certainly seems to be the case for writers and artists in search of a space to create. When George Orwell went to Jura in the 1940s, he chose to venture to \u2013 in his words \u2013 \u201can extremely un-get-atable place\u201d. Barnhill, the house in which he wrote <em>1984</em>, sits at the very northern end of the island, reachable from the mainland only by taking two ferries, driving for 40 miles and then walking a further four along a dirt track.

Every summer, for a period of 18 years, Jansson travelled by boat to Klovharun, an island on the Finnish archipelago, \u201ca rock in the middle of nowhere\u201d in the words of her niece. Jansson would leave for the island as soon as the ice broke in April and would remain there, without running water or electricity, often for months.</p> <p>In an age of convenience and connection, it seems almost unthinkable to venture so far \u2013 I\u2019d balk at having to catch and gut fish for supper \u2013 but there is something irresistible in the idea of living in a place so unwatched and unjudged, utterly disconnected, where one might live free from even the possibility of trivial distractions.</p> <p>Reading about the lives of artists as I researched my book, it occurred to me that the urge to flee seemed particularly prevalent among women. Not uniquely to islands, but to remote places: Winifred Nicholson\u2019s creative practice flourished on her visits to Skye and South Uist, Agnes Martin and Georgia O\u2019Keeffe found themselves in New Mexico, the Scottish painter Joan Eardley produced her best work in the tiny fishing village of Catterline.</p> <p>Listening to<strong> </strong>Katy Hessel\u2019s Great Women Artists podcast, I was struck by Deborah Levy\u2019s comments about Leonora Carrington, who left her home and family for London, then Paris, then Madrid and finally Mexico, where she settled and lived for most of her life. Speaking about Carrington\u2019s glorious, dreamlike <em>Self-Portrait</em>, in which the artist is portrayed sitting in a chair, a hyena at her side, while outside the window a white horse runs across a field, Levy says: \u201cThat white horse galloping outside the window is deeply felt. That\u2019s what she wants. She wants to be that horse\u2026 What do you have to do to become an artist, especially of her generation? You have to <em>bolt</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Times have changed. Women no longer need to travel to the ends of the earth to make art, but then the pull of, say, the New Mexican desert was never just its isolation. Isolation may not even have been the main attraction, though it was certainly part of it. \u201cAs soon as I saw it,\u201d O\u2019Keeffe said of New Mexico, \u201cthat was my country. I\u2019d never seen anything like it before, but it fitted to me exactly\u2026 The sky is different, the wind is different. I shouldn\u2019t say too much about it, because other people may be interested, and I don\u2019t want them to be interested.\u201d</p> <p>When I travel to islands and when I conjure them in my imagination, I think part of what I\u2019m doing is searching for a place of belonging. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/apr/16/judith-schalansky-atlas-remote-islands\">Judith Schalansky, author of the marvellous </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/apr/16/judith-schalansky-atlas-remote-islands\">Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands</a></em>, writes: \u201cI had to make my discoveries in the library, driven by the desire to find\u2026 my own island: one that I would take possession of, not with the fervour of colonialism, but through yearning for it.\u201d</p> <p>An island offers seclusion and the illusion of possession. It offers a kind of containment, too, the possibility of an entire ecosystem existing on one small piece of land, a place over which a single person, even a lone female, might have dominion.</p> <p>It\u2019s a fantasy, of course. The remote islands that Schalansky writes about in hers are not idylls but \u201cunsettling, barren places whose riches lay in the multitude of terrible events that had befallen them\u201d. Fictional islands are rarely better, from Amity to my own Eris, they tend to be beautiful places where awful things befall inhabitants and visitors alike.</p> <p>My own fictional artist is enchanted and inspired by her island and the solitude it offers her: Vanessa paints day and night, she creates an extraordinary body of work, but her untethering comes at a price.

Cues are missed, so when visitors come calling, motives are misunderstood, you miss what they really want from you. Acts of devotion seem suffocating, aggression is rendered innocuous.</p> <p>On my birthday trip to Lewis, I walked along the crumbling cliffs above Mangersta beach, clinging in places to the sheep fence for fear of disappearing over the edge. I marched into gale force winds across the glorious expanse of Uig Sands and, a little further along the coast, swam in the ice blue sea at Reef Beach. In defiance of the season, the white sands and rolling dunes were almost deserted. Around dusk on my last evening, I walked along a lonely road that winds, aimlessly \u2013 or so it seemed \u2013 across the headland above the farm where I was staying. The landscape up there is treeless and bleak, a plateau of boulder and peat bog that extends for miles before falling abruptly away into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The urge to flee seemed particularly prevalent among women</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You can see for miles, and in all the time I was walking, I saw no one.

My mind started to turn, as it seems to do when I find myself in lonely places, to murder. I started to think about what I would do if something happened, if someone were to emerge (unlikely, I know, out of the peat bog) and attack me. I would run, I thought. Pick up a big rock. Fight. Lose, probably. I told an interviewer once that I needed fear to write: at the time I was thinking about the fears that had driven me (of failure, debt, disappointing expectations), but now I think it perhaps runs a little deeper than that \u2013 that being afraid stirs my imagination and that as much as I long for solitude, as much as I dream about the perfect lonely house on a remote island, I know that if I lived in one, I\u2019d spend my nights listening for the creak on the stair; I\u2019d never sleep. I suppose I\u2019d just have to get up and write. The Blue Hour by Paula Hawkins is published by Transworld at \u00a322. Buy a copy for \u00a318.70 from guardianbookshop.com",

      "body": "<p>My eye was caught by a striking photograph in the most recent edition of Charles Arthur\u2019s Substack newsletter <a href=\"https://socialwarming.substack.com/p/how-ai-slop-undermines-our-understanding\">Social Warming</a>. It shows a narrow street in the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/why-were-the-floods-in-spain-so-bad-a-visual-guide\">\u201crain bomb\u201d that devastated the region</a> of Valencia in Spain. A year\u2019s worth of rain fell in a single day, and in some towns more than 490 litres a square metre fell in eight hours. Water is very heavy, so if there\u2019s a gradient it will flow downhill with the kind of force that can pick up a heavy SUV and toss it around like a toy. And if it channels down a narrow urban street, it will throw parked cars around like King Kong in a bad mood.</p> <p>The photograph in Arthur\u2019s article showed what had happened in a particular street. Taken with a telephoto lens from an upper storey of a building, it showed a chaotic and almost surreal scene: about 70 vehicles of all sizes jumbled up and scattered at crazy angles along the length of the street.</p> <p>It was an astonishing image which really stopped me in my tracks. Not surprisingly, it also went viral on social media. And then came the reaction: \u201cAI image, fake news.\u201d The photograph was so vivid, so uncannily sharp and unreal, that it looked to viewers like something that they could have faked themselves using Midjourney or Dall-E or a host of other generative AI tools.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t fake, as Arthur established in a nice piece of detective work \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/people/Pub-Darkness-Sedav%C3%AD/100063667835260/?sk=about\">tracking down a bar in the picture</a> using Facebook, finding the street in Apple Maps and even \u201cwalking\u201d down it using Street View. \u201cIt\u2019s not obvious why these people thought that photo in particular wasn\u2019t real\u201d, he writes. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s something about the sheen of the cars and the peculiar roundedness of the shapes, and maybe the lack of obvious damage\u201d. Or is it that the proliferation of AI-generated fakes is already making people increasingly predisposed not to believe things that are real?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It makes sense, in a way: Meta\u2019s profits depend on keeping users of their platforms \u2018engaged\u2019. If AI slop helps to achieve that, what\u2019s the problem?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My hunch is that it\u2019s the latter, because social media are being overrun by what has come to be known as \u201cAI slop\u201d \u2013 images and text created using generative AI tools. (Amazon\u2019s Kindle store is <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/03/13/1237888126/growing-number-ai-scam-books-amazon\">having similar problems</a> with AI-generated \u201cbooks\u201d, but that\u2019s a different story.)</p> <p>You\u2019d have thought that the social media companies would be bothered by this tsunami of crap on their platforms. Think again. According to <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/zuckerberg-the-ai-slop-will-continue-until-morale-improves/\">Jason Koebler of the tech news website 404 Media</a>, in a recent quarterly earnings call that was overwhelmingly about AI, Meta\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said that new, AI-generated feeds were likely to come to Facebook and other Meta platforms. Zuckerberg said he was excited by the \u201copportunity for AI to help people create content that just makes people\u2019s feed experiences better\u201d.</p> <p>Warming to his theme, Zuck continued: \u201cI think we\u2019re going to add a whole new category of content, which is AI-generated or AI-summarised content or kind of existing content pulled together by AI in some way. And I think that that\u2019s going to be just very exciting for Facebook and Instagram and maybe Threads or other kind of feed experiences over time.\u201d</p> <p>Which makes perfect sense, in a way: Meta\u2019s profits depend on keeping users of its platforms \u201cengaged\u201d \u2013 that is, spending as much time as possible on them \u2013 and if AI slop helps to achieve that goal, what\u2019s the problem?</p> <p>On the supply side, it turns out that AI-generated stuff is also profitable for those who create it. Koebler has spent a year exploring this dark underbelly of social media. In India, he ran into Gyan Abhishek, an analyst who studies online virality. Abhishek showed him a startling image being used to generate revenue \u2013 a picture of a skeletal elderly man hunched over while being eaten by hundreds of bugs.</p> <p>\u201cThe Indian audience is very emotional,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/\">Abhishek explained</a>. \u201cAfter seeing photos like this, they \u2018like\u2019, \u2018comment\u2019 and share them. So you too should create a page like this, upload photos and make money through performance bonus.\u201d He also claims that creators of viral images can earn $100 for 1,000 \u201clikes\u201d, which sounds like money for jam, at least to this columnist.</p> <p>So what we have here is a nice positive feedback loop in which creators of AI slop profit from feeding the engagement algorithms of social media platforms, which in turn profit from the increasing \u201cengagement\u201d that viral images attract. The trouble with positive feedback loops, though, is that they give rise to runaway growth, and to the question of what happens to social media when they become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/11/users-advertisers-we-are-all-trapped-in-the-enshittification-of-the-internet\">terminally enshittified</a> as a result.

A year\u2019s worth of rain fell in a single day, and in some towns more than 490 litres a square metre fell in eight hours. Water is very heavy, so if there\u2019s a gradient it will flow downhill with the kind of force that can pick up a heavy SUV and toss it around like a toy. And if it channels down a narrow urban street, it will throw parked cars around like King Kong in a bad mood. The photograph in Arthur\u2019s article showed what had happened in a particular street. Taken with a telephoto lens from an upper storey of a building, it showed a chaotic and almost surreal scene: about 70 vehicles of all sizes jumbled up and scattered at crazy angles along the length of the street. It was an astonishing image which really stopped me in my tracks. Not surprisingly, it also went viral on social media. And then came the reaction: \u201cAI image, fake news.\u201d The photograph was so vivid, so uncannily sharp and unreal, that it looked to viewers like something that they could have faked themselves using Midjourney or Dall-E or a host of other generative AI tools. But it wasn\u2019t fake, as Arthur established in a nice piece of detective work \u2013 tracking down a bar in the picture using Facebook, finding the street in Apple Maps and even \u201cwalking\u201d down it using Street View. \u201cIt\u2019s not obvious why these people thought that photo in particular wasn\u2019t real\u201d, he writes. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s something about the sheen of the cars and the peculiar roundedness of the shapes, and maybe the lack of obvious damage\u201d. Or is it that the proliferation of AI-generated fakes is already making people increasingly predisposed not to believe things that are real? My hunch is that it\u2019s the latter, because social media are being overrun by what has come to be known as \u201cAI slop\u201d \u2013 images and text created using generative AI tools. (Amazon\u2019s Kindle store is having similar problems with AI-generated \u201cbooks\u201d, but that\u2019s a different story.) You\u2019d have thought that the social media companies would be bothered by this tsunami of crap on their platforms. Think again. According to Jason Koebler of the tech news website 404 Media, in a recent quarterly earnings call that was overwhelmingly about AI, Meta\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said that new, AI-generated feeds were likely to come to Facebook and other Meta platforms. Zuckerberg said he was excited by the \u201copportunity for AI to help people create content that just makes people\u2019s feed experiences better\u201d. Warming to his theme, Zuck continued: \u201cI think we\u2019re going to add a whole new category of content, which is AI-generated or AI-summarised content or kind of existing content pulled together by AI in some way. And I think that that\u2019s going to be just very exciting for Facebook and Instagram and maybe Threads or other kind of feed experiences over time.\u201d Which makes perfect sense, in a way: Meta\u2019s profits depend on keeping users of its platforms \u201cengaged\u201d \u2013 that is, spending as much time as possible on them \u2013 and if AI slop helps to achieve that goal, what\u2019s the problem? On the supply side, it turns out that AI-generated stuff is also profitable for those who create it. Koebler has spent a year exploring this dark underbelly of social media. In India, he ran into Gyan Abhishek, an analyst who studies online virality. Abhishek showed him a startling image being used to generate revenue \u2013 a picture of a skeletal elderly man hunched over while being eaten by hundreds of bugs. \u201cThe Indian audience is very emotional,\u201d Abhishek explained. \u201cAfter seeing photos like this, they \u2018like\u2019, \u2018comment\u2019 and share them. So you too should create a page like this, upload photos and make money through performance bonus.\u201d He also claims that creators of viral images can earn $100 for 1,000 \u201clikes\u201d, which sounds like money for jam, at least to this columnist. So what we have here is a nice positive feedback loop in which creators of AI slop profit from feeding the engagement algorithms of social media platforms, which in turn profit from the increasing \u201cengagement\u201d that viral images attract. The trouble with positive feedback loops, though, is that they give rise to runaway growth, and to the question of what happens to social media when they become terminally enshittified as a result. Which is where Meta and co are headed. What I\u2019ve been reading How fragile is autocracy?

It\u2019s a staggering shift for a multicultural, heavily Democratic city, given the divisive and racist nature of Trump\u2019s campaign.</p> <p>But it shouldn\u2019t have come as a huge surprise to Democrats, said Lawrence Levy, former chief political columnist for Newsday and executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University.</p> <p>\u201cSomething started happening in 2021,\u201d Levy said. \u201cThis did not come out of the blue.\u201d</p> <p>That year, New York City politics started seeing some reactions to \u201cpost-pandemic pain\u201d, Levy said, as some voters from demographics including the white, Latino and Asian communities shifted away from Democrats in local elections. In the 2022 midterm elections, New York City retained its Democratic members of the House of Representatives, but some suburban voters to the north and east of the city elected Republicans.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>This was also a referendum on the Democratic leadership in New York City</p> <footer> <cite>Mona Kleinberg of Queens College</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe question is: what does this all mean?\u201d Levy said.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re at an inflection point where once the echo of pandemic pain finally fades, we\u2019ll either go back to where we were \u2013 which is that New York City is reliably blue and that the surrounding suburbs will go back to being purple to light-blue places.</p> <p>\u201cOr it\u2019s the bigger pendulum that: \u2018OK, Democrats had their run for 30 years, and now the pendulum is going to swing back the other way.\u201d</p> <p>While New York City has reliably voted for Democratic presidents, two out of its last four mayors were elected as Republicans \u2013 although they weren\u2019t the blood-and-thunder candidates who have come to dominate the modern GOP.</p> <p>Mona Kleinberg, a professor of political science at the City University of New York, Queens College, said it was unclear yet whether the swing towards Trump was a result of people who voted for Biden casting their ballot for Trump, or those voters not voting at all \u2013 just as nationwide, Harris received fewer votes than Biden.</p> <p>In terms of why Harris underperformed compared with Biden, Kleinberg said New Yorkers were not immune to two of the key issues that motivated people around the country: the economy and inflation.</p> <p>\u201cIn New York, the economy was huge, because New York is an unaffordable city. Rents have gone up so much after Covid, and then you have a candidate who promises to, essentially, bring inflation down even more, who promises to bring rents down,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cNew Yorkers are not universally affluent, and so they care about those issues.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s presidential win was ultimately determined by voters in swing states, but a shift towards the Republican was seen across the country \u2013 even in the deeply Democratic stronghold of New York City. While Kamala Harris won New York by a handy margin, with 68% of the vote to Trump\u2019s 30%, that was a marked drop from Joe Biden\u2019s performance in the city in 2020; that year, Biden won New York by a 53-point margin. \u201cAlmost no place has seen a bigger increase in Trump support than the five boroughs [of New York City],\u201d Nate Silver, the renowned political pollster, wrote on Thursday. One of those boroughs, Staten Island, has been in bed with Trump since the beginning \u2013 the president-elect carried the majority-white area in 2016 and 2020 \u2013 but the shifts elsewhere are more surprising. The Bronx, which has a large Latino population, saw the largest swing towards Trump in the state: Joe Biden won 83% of the vote there in 2020, compared with Trump\u2019s 16%. This time round, Harris won by 73% to Trump\u2019s 27%. In 2016, Trump won just 21.8% of the vote in Queens, his home borough, but this week 38% of voters there cast their ballot for the former and now future president. In fact, every single county in the New York City metropolitan area swung towards Trump compared with four years ago, Gothamist reported. It\u2019s a staggering shift for a multicultural, heavily Democratic city, given the divisive and racist nature of Trump\u2019s campaign. But it shouldn\u2019t have come as a huge surprise to Democrats, said Lawrence Levy, former chief political columnist for Newsday and executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University. \u201cSomething started happening in 2021,\u201d Levy said. \u201cThis did not come out of the blue.\u201d That year, New York City politics started seeing some reactions to \u201cpost-pandemic pain\u201d, Levy said, as some voters from demographics including the white, Latino and Asian communities shifted away from Democrats in local elections. In the 2022 midterm elections, New York City retained its Democratic members of the House of Representatives, but some suburban voters to the north and east of the city elected Republicans. \u201cThe question is: what does this all mean?\u201d Levy said. \u201cI think we\u2019re at an inflection point where once the echo of pandemic pain finally fades, we\u2019ll either go back to where we were \u2013 which is that New York City is reliably blue and that the surrounding suburbs will go back to being purple to light-blue places. \u201cOr it\u2019s the bigger pendulum that: \u2018OK, Democrats had their run for 30 years, and now the pendulum is going to swing back the other way.\u201d While New York City has reliably voted for Democratic presidents, two out of its last four mayors were elected as Republicans \u2013 although they weren\u2019t the blood-and-thunder candidates who have come to dominate the modern GOP. Mona Kleinberg, a professor of political science at the City University of New York, Queens College, said it was unclear yet whether the swing towards Trump was a result of people who voted for Biden casting their ballot for Trump, or those voters not voting at all \u2013 just as nationwide, Harris received fewer votes than Biden. In terms of why Harris underperformed compared with Biden, Kleinberg said New Yorkers were not immune to two of the key issues that motivated people around the country: the economy and inflation. \u201cIn New York, the economy was huge, because New York is an unaffordable city. Rents have gone up so much after Covid, and then you have a candidate who promises to, essentially, bring inflation down even more, who promises to bring rents down,\u201d she said. \u201cNew Yorkers are not universally affluent, and so they care about those issues. So I think with inflation, or the economy more broadly, Donald Trump had a better message on that.\u201d Despite New York being one of the most diverse cities in the US, immigration also played a part, Kleinberg said. The city has received about 200,000 new immigrants in the past two years, as states including Texas have sought to create chaos by sending tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants on buses to New York. Eric Adams, the Democratic mayor of New York \u2013 whose popularityplummeted after he was charged with taking bribes and foreign campaign contributions and appears to have been trying to cozy up to Trump in recent days \u2013 handled the immigrant situation badly, Kleinberg said, which could have further turned voters away from the party. A scheme where immigrant families were given prepaid debit cards became a particular focus for conservative critics, and may have played into ideas that Democrats are out of touch. \u201cIf you feel like every time you\u2019re going grocery shopping, you\u2019re broke afterwards, and then you know that there are asylum seekers in your city who are getting debit cards with a certain kind of allowance to live, that breeds resentment. And if you don\u2019t have a message that explains this to people, then they are just angry,\u201d Kleinberg said. \u201cSo I think you know this was a referendum not just on Biden\u2019s legacy, or the Biden-Harris administration, but this was also a referendum on the Democratic leadership in New York City.\u201d National and local issues both played a part in the swing, then \u2013 although something more fundamental may also have played a part. \u201cObviously, Trump was running on an anti-immigrant message and, of course, Kamala Harris was the actual embodiment of an immigrant \u2013 she\u2019s the daughter of a south Asian mother and a Jamaican father,\u201d Kleinberg said. \u201cAnd again: the fact that she is a woman, and a woman of color. There\u2019s a lot of unconscious biases that introduce in people\u2019s perceptions of her capabilities. And I think that is part of this whole cocktail of reasons for why people migrated towards the right.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 November 2024 to correct an earlier version that inaccurately stated Kamala Harris\u2019s mother is south-east Asian. She is south Asian.",

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump has won, and most shockingly, he won the popular vote. Unlike in 2016, which could be explained as a rejection of Hillary Clinton concentrated in the crucial midwestern states, this year he won convincingly. He has increased his share of the vote, as a percentage of the overall national popular vote, in each of the three elections he has run in.</p> <p>Who voted for Trump and why? Many analysts of all political stripes have ready-made explanations for what happened, explanations that usually conveniently reflect the exact beliefs of the analyst. Unfortunately for them, the most common narratives do not stand up to scrutiny. The election results have blown a hole in the worldview of both the center and the left.</p> <p>One explanation for Trump\u2019s victory is an across-the-board collapse in turnout and increased apathy caused by an unpopular presidency, an uninspiring president and an ideologically spent brand of liberalism. There is some merit to this, but on closer inspection, it\u2019s not why Kamala Harris lost.</p> <p>First, it\u2019s important to note that counting votes in the United States takes a very long time. By the time it\u2019s all said and done, it\u2019s quite likely Trump received more votes in 2024 than he did in the record turnout 2020 election, probably millions more votes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2024/nov/09/white-noise-why-hatred-of-donald-trump-fuels-his-success-as-much-as-his-supporters-love\">White noise: why hatred of Donald Trump fuels his success as much as his supporters\u2019 love | Ed Coper</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second flaw in this idea is that the turnout change wasn\u2019t uniform, nor was the change in voting behavior. In most swing states, turnout was actually <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/06/voter-turnout-2024-by-state/\">up from 2020</a>, setting records. In the states that decided the election, Democrats got their base voters to the polls and had the electorate they needed to win (and even did win in many cases in the Senate and down the rest of the ballot). The problem was Harris lost on persuasion: many voters who chose Joe Biden four years ago and even voted for other Democrats this year chose Donald Trump. Even then, where Harris campaigned on the airwaves and on the ground, <a href=\"https://x.com/Redistrict/status/1854613790345904302\">she held up better than</a> she did <a href=\"https://x.com/otis_reid/status/1854293814002831723\">nationwide</a>.</p> <p>However, problems with persuasion weren\u2019t the only issue: Democratic turnout did, in fact, collapse in the less competitive states, especially in blue states. This is a unique shift in voting behavior nationally and can\u2019t be explained obviously by most existing theories of the electorate.</p> <p>Another explanation is that Democrats have become the party of college-educated voters exclusively, and shed working-class voters, especially working-class voters of color. There is some truth to this, especially over the long term. But this explanation is also flawed. Trump did better consistently with every demographic almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/06/the-key-swings-that-handed-trump-the-white-house-a-visual-analysis\">everywhere in the country</a>, including college-educated white people and women. While these numbers were more pronounced with young voters, Latinos and men, it was only <a href=\"https://x.com/thomasjwood/status/1854133719201956123\">slight</a>. Most highly educated areas that had swung consistently against Republicans in 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2022 moved back <a href=\"https://x.com/umichvoter/status/1854175670282170472\">toward Trump</a> this year. His victory was not with any one demographic. It was total.</p> <p>As with any massive election loss, recriminations have been swift, and factions inside the Democratic party are jockeying to make their narrative about the election the conventional wisdom that shapes the future of the party, while Republicans are claiming a sweeping call to reshape society in a darker, more authoritarian way. However, conventional ideological explanations also don\u2019t stand up to scrutiny.</p> <p>One of the most common centrist takes has been: Democrats have become too progressive and \u201cwoke\u201d on social issues and obsessed with identity politics, and Democratic staffers and consultants live in a bubble and speak in alienating ways that have made them seem radical and off-putting to the median voter. The solution is a relentless focus on bread-and-butter issues and moderating, mostly ignoring culture war issues, besides abortion, and aggressively playing up moderate and bipartisan bona fides.</p> <p>It seems quite likely this narrative will win out among Democrats. It has already been expressed by <a href=\"https://x.com/RobertJimison/status/1854521717114142905\">elected officials</a> and influential <a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1854334397157384421\">Democratic pundits</a>. The key problem with this narrative is that while it may have had merit in 2020 or 2022, Democrats already actually did this. The Democratic party has, over the last few years, aggressively purged \u201cwoke\u201d-sounding language from their messaging and policies from their agenda. The Harris campaign was almost monomaniacally focused on projecting moderation and bipartisanship and on basic, kitchen-table economic issues. They relentlessly hunted the median voter with targeted messaging. They ran the campaign the popularists wanted, and lost.</p> <p>This theory is also belied by the fact that the most well-known progressive and radical politicians mostly did better than Harris. Rashida Tlaib performed <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2024/11/06/dearborn-michigan-rashida-tlaib-kamala-harris-gaza/\">significantly better</a>, and while this was most pronounced with Arab and Muslim voters who rejected Harris over her stance on Israel and Gaza, it was even true in <a href=\"https://x.com/adnan_barazi/status/1854219160558948625\">white working-class</a> communities. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also won <a href=\"https://x.com/demsocsean/status/1854580422228738086\">more votes</a> than Harris. Understanding why thousands of people might vote for Trump <em>and</em> an avowed democratic socialist and vocal supporter of \u201cwoke\u201d causes like trans rights is a key to understanding the election.</p> <p>Progressives see the flaws with the centrist analysis and also have an explanation, typified by Bernie Sanders: Democrats lost by <a href=\"https://x.com/BernieSanders/status/1854271157135941698\">abandoning</a> the working class and unions. Like the centrist narrative, it is an outdated explanation that was once true and may be true on a generational scale but is inadequate to capture what happened in this specific election fully. While Democrats have, over the last 50 years, shifted away from unions and redistributive politics, allowing inequality to grow, and this is the correct explanation for Clinton\u2019s loss in 2016, it doesn\u2019t quite fit here.</p> <p>Joe Biden actually did <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2020/09/04/joe-biden-shifting-center\">shift</a> to the left on economic issues after winning the primary in 2020, largely due to the mass movement that formed around the Sanders campaign. And while, in the past, this may have been lip service, the Biden administration, for all its shortcomings, did follow through in real, measurable ways. Income inequality, the central theme of the progressive movement in the 2010s, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/29/low-income-wages-employment-00097135\">decreased</a> under Biden. The poorest workers were better off. Biden also pursued aggressive <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/bidens-nlrb-restoring-rights/\">pro-labor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2024/10/02/biden-ftc-antitrust-regulation-consumers-tech-pharma\">pro-consumer</a> policy through the executive branch. Biden was the first president to walk a picket line, and put political capital on the line to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-business-united-states-government-and-politics-retirees-09d93d2af8cc68de47eccda4a9ef0250\">bail out</a> union pension funds.</p> <p>For many years, it was easy to explain why workers would leave the Democrats: they were making less money and losing rights. But, while the Biden administration should have been far more assertive in redistribution and class-war policy on ideological and moral grounds, it doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny that workers moved right because of an ideologically neoliberal or austerity-focused policy. Though Democrats have mostly abandoned class as a mode of communication, and struggled to name an enemy and construct a compelling economic narrative, the material explanation for Harris losing votes among the working class and union members doesn\u2019t hold as it may have in the past.</p> <p>The right has its own explanation, seeing a sweeping mandate for the culture war. But Republican candidates who made their campaigns into referenda on culture war issues have uniformly lost or underperformed, in <a href=\"https://www.ettingermentum.news/p/the-modern-electoral-history-of-transphobia\">the past</a>, and also this year. Trump is the only candidate who ran aggressively on the persecution of trans people, for example, and also did better than the partisan baseline.</p> <p>And the idea that this is why voters flocked to Trump is just not compelling. <a href=\"https://www.ettingermentum.news/p/the-modern-electoral-history-of-transphobia\">Fifty-four percent</a> of voters thought Trump was \u201ctoo extreme\u201d, 65% were pro-choice and, even on immigration, 56% of voters supported a pathway to citizenship rather than mass deportations. Millions of voters voted for Trump at the top of the ticket and <a href=\"https://x.com/maxtmcc/status/1854378439442415852\">Democrats</a> down-ballot to check his unpopular agenda. It would be a mistake to think Trump has a mandate to remake society in a hard-right, socially conservative image.</p> <p>So why did people vote for Trump? Most voters still actively dislike him personally (<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/exit-polls\">53%</a> of voters had an unfavorable opinion of him) and most of his policies. The obvious explanation is that people trust him more to handle the economy. Although voters didn\u2019t like his presidency, they felt like they were better off four years ago. This is true, but also so obviously true as to be facile. More interesting is why, materially, voters trust him more to handle the economy.</p> <p>The easy answer is inflation, but the case for this as the primary driver, materially rather than rhetorically, also has some holes. The first is that inflation has drastically <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/11/nx-s1-5108607/inflation-consumer-prices-economy-interest-rates\">decreased</a>, and has been decreasing consistently since early in the Biden presidency. For most Americans, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/business/economy/inflation-wages-pay-salaries.html#:~:text=According%20to%20economic%20data%2C%20the,government%20and%20private%2Dsector%20sources.\">wages</a> have risen faster than inflation, again for years in a row. When inflation was high and harming workers\u2019 standard of living, Democrats were winning elections, historically over-performing in 2022 and sweeping special elections from the congressional level down to state legislatures and city councils.</p> <p>Many have proposed the idea of a \u201cvibes recession\u201d, wherein traditional and social media have given people a false idea of their actual economic conditions. But this answer is glib: politics are material and people actually do know their conditions.</p> <p>I propose a different explanation than inflation qua inflation: the Covid welfare state and its collapse. The massive, almost overnight expansion of the social safety net and its rapid, almost overnight rollback are materially one of the biggest policy changes in American history. For a brief period, and for the first time in history, Americans had a robust safety net: strong protections for workers and tenants, extremely generous unemployment benefits, rent control and direct cash transfers from the American government.</p> <p>Despite the trauma and death of Covid and the isolation of lockdowns, from late 2020 to early 2021, Americans briefly experienced the freedom of social democracy. They had enough liquid money to plan long term and make spending decisions for their own pleasure rather than just to survive. They had the labor protections to look for the jobs they wanted rather than feel stuck in the jobs they had. At the end of Trump\u2019s term, the American standard of living and the amount of economic security and freedom Americans had was higher than when it started, and, with the loss of this expanded welfare state, it was worse when Biden left office, despite his real policy wins for workers and unions. This is why voters view Trump as a better shepherd of the economy.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note that Trump is resolutely not a social democrat, and these policies came into place during an emergency rather than due to ideological conviction. Indeed, he is currently running on the largest <a href=\"https://x.com/jdcmedlock/status/1853444427152523740\">upward</a> transfer of wealth in American history and Republicans\u2019 Project 2025 would decimate the social safety net and immiserate millions. Beyond this, Biden wanted to continue many of these policies, but there wasn\u2019t a political pathway. Instead, they quietly expired. To voters, however, the material reality is that when Trump left office, this safety net existed, and by the time of the 2024 election, it had evaporated.</p> <p>How could Democrats have countered this? One way was by making it a central issue, fighting publicly and openly to keep these protections and messaging heavily and constantly that Republicans were taking them away while Biden fought for them. An enormous body of research has established that social programs, when implemented, are difficult and highly unpopular to take away. These were universal programs, beneficial at all income levels.</p> <p>The political miscalculation the Biden administration made was that, lacking the political ability to implement these policies permanently, it was best to have them expire quietly and avoid the public backlash of gutting welfare programs and the black mark of taking a public political loss. This was a grave miscalculation.</p> <p>Why were Democrats unable to counter the idea that Trump was an economic savant? And why did most Americans vote for someone they believe will harm the country but help their own pocketbooks? The answer is the ongoing decimation of working-class institutions and civil society, started by neoliberalism, accelerated by the rise of the internet as a medium of interaction and put into overdrive during the isolation of Covid. The vehicles for building solidarity with others and for caring about strangers have been decimated. In crass terms, people have become more selfish.</p> <p>Union membership, for example, still makes voters significantly <a href=\"https://www.americanprogressaction.org/article/unions-critical-democratic-partys-electoral-success/\">more Democratic</a> than would otherwise be expected based on demographics alone. Even this year, Harris <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/exit-polls\">won</a> union members easily while losing the popular vote overall. Unions and civil society organizations also provide a baseline of political education: members know their interests and which policies will help or harm them. Without this, Americans\u2019 views are shaped by the algorithm.</p> <p>Perhaps most emblematic of this is at the heart of Trump\u2019s campaign: his embrace of extremely online tech billionaires, crypto currency and online influencers. If the archetype of Trump\u2019s win in 2016 was the left-behind post-industrial Rust belt manufacturing worker \u2013 or, perhaps more accurately, the car dealership or McDonald\u2019s franchise owner in a left-behind post-industrial Rust belt town \u2013 this year it is the crypto scammer, the dropshipper, the app-based day trader, the online engagement farmer.</p> <p>That embrace was Trump\u2019s message, and at the core of his gains, especially with young men. Without civil society and without strong unions, people believe the only path to success is getting one over on someone else. And who is better at that than Trump?</p> <p>While the core of the resurgent-left generation of Sanders was downwardly mobile college-educated professionals, selling their labor for wages without the prospect of buying a house or retiring on a pension, the second wave of newly aging-in Trump voters entered adulthood without even those prospects, hoping only to grind out a living through scams. But this is fundamentally an anti-social and anti-humanist mode of economic activity that contributes nothing to society and offers nothing but alienation to its victims. The result is people willing to vote for someone they know will cause immense harm to others, hoping it will help them personally.</p> <p>While the new right has made great hay of returning to a communitarian model of politics, economically populist, socially conservative, and focused on family and society, the truth is that the Trumpist movement is the opposite.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has won, and most shockingly, he won the popular vote. Unlike in 2016, which could be explained as a rejection of Hillary Clinton concentrated in the crucial midwestern states, this year he won convincingly. He has increased his share of the vote, as a percentage of the overall national popular vote, in each of the three elections he has run in. Who voted for Trump and why? Many analysts of all political stripes have ready-made explanations for what happened, explanations that usually conveniently reflect the exact beliefs of the analyst. Unfortunately for them, the most common narratives do not stand up to scrutiny. The election results have blown a hole in the worldview of both the center and the left. One explanation for Trump\u2019s victory is an across-the-board collapse in turnout and increased apathy caused by an unpopular presidency, an uninspiring president and an ideologically spent brand of liberalism. There is some merit to this, but on closer inspection, it\u2019s not why Kamala Harris lost. First, it\u2019s important to note that counting votes in the United States takes a very long time. By the time it\u2019s all said and done, it\u2019s quite likely Trump received more votes in 2024 than he did in the record turnout 2020 election, probably millions more votes. The second flaw in this idea is that the turnout change wasn\u2019t uniform, nor was the change in voting behavior. In most swing states, turnout was actually up from 2020, setting records. In the states that decided the election, Democrats got their base voters to the polls and had the electorate they needed to win (and even did win in many cases in the Senate and down the rest of the ballot). The problem was Harris lost on persuasion: many voters who chose Joe Biden four years ago and even voted for other Democrats this year chose Donald Trump. Even then, where Harris campaigned on the airwaves and on the ground, she held up better than she did nationwide. However, problems with persuasion weren\u2019t the only issue: Democratic turnout did, in fact, collapse in the less competitive states, especially in blue states. This is a unique shift in voting behavior nationally and can\u2019t be explained obviously by most existing theories of the electorate. Another explanation is that Democrats have become the party of college-educated voters exclusively, and shed working-class voters, especially working-class voters of color. There is some truth to this, especially over the long term. But this explanation is also flawed. Trump did better consistently with every demographic almost everywhere in the country, including college-educated white people and women. While these numbers were more pronounced with young voters, Latinos and men, it was only slight. Most highly educated areas that had swung consistently against Republicans in 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2022 moved back toward Trump this year. His victory was not with any one demographic. It was total. As with any massive election loss, recriminations have been swift, and factions inside the Democratic party are jockeying to make their narrative about the election the conventional wisdom that shapes the future of the party, while Republicans are claiming a sweeping call to reshape society in a darker, more authoritarian way. However, conventional ideological explanations also don\u2019t stand up to scrutiny. One of the most common centrist takes has been: Democrats have become too progressive and \u201cwoke\u201d on social issues and obsessed with identity politics, and Democratic staffers and consultants live in a bubble and speak in alienating ways that have made them seem radical and off-putting to the median voter. The solution is a relentless focus on bread-and-butter issues and moderating, mostly ignoring culture war issues, besides abortion, and aggressively playing up moderate and bipartisan bona fides. It seems quite likely this narrative will win out among Democrats. It has already been expressed by elected officials and influential Democratic pundits. The key problem with this narrative is that while it may have had merit in 2020 or 2022, Democrats already actually did this. The Democratic party has, over the last few years, aggressively purged \u201cwoke\u201d-sounding language from their messaging and policies from their agenda. The Harris campaign was almost monomaniacally focused on projecting moderation and bipartisanship and on basic, kitchen-table economic issues. They relentlessly hunted the median voter with targeted messaging. They ran the campaign the popularists wanted, and lost. This theory is also belied by the fact that the most well-known progressive and radical politicians mostly did better than Harris. Rashida Tlaib performed significantly better, and while this was most pronounced with Arab and Muslim voters who rejected Harris over her stance on Israel and Gaza, it was even true in white working-class communities. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also won more votes than Harris. Understanding why thousands of people might vote for Trump and an avowed democratic socialist and vocal supporter of \u201cwoke\u201d causes like trans rights is a key to understanding the election. Progressives see the flaws with the centrist analysis and also have an explanation, typified by Bernie Sanders: Democrats lost by abandoning the working class and unions. Like the centrist narrative, it is an outdated explanation that was once true and may be true on a generational scale but is inadequate to capture what happened in this specific election fully. While Democrats have, over the last 50 years, shifted away from unions and redistributive politics, allowing inequality to grow, and this is the correct explanation for Clinton\u2019s loss in 2016, it doesn\u2019t quite fit here. Joe Biden actually did shift to the left on economic issues after winning the primary in 2020, largely due to the mass movement that formed around the Sanders campaign. And while, in the past, this may have been lip service, the Biden administration, for all its shortcomings, did follow through in real, measurable ways. Income inequality, the central theme of the progressive movement in the 2010s, decreased under Biden. The poorest workers were better off. Biden also pursued aggressive pro-labor and pro-consumer policy through the executive branch. Biden was the first president to walk a picket line, and put political capital on the line to bail out union pension funds. For many years, it was easy to explain why workers would leave the Democrats: they were making less money and losing rights. But, while the Biden administration should have been far more assertive in redistribution and class-war policy on ideological and moral grounds, it doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny that workers moved right because of an ideologically neoliberal or austerity-focused policy. Though Democrats have mostly abandoned class as a mode of communication, and struggled to name an enemy and construct a compelling economic narrative, the material explanation for Harris losing votes among the working class and union members doesn\u2019t hold as it may have in the past. The right has its own explanation, seeing a sweeping mandate for the culture war. But Republican candidates who made their campaigns into referenda on culture war issues have uniformly lost or underperformed, in the past, and also this year. Trump is the only candidate who ran aggressively on the persecution of trans people, for example, and also did better than the partisan baseline. And the idea that this is why voters flocked to Trump is just not compelling. Fifty-four percent of voters thought Trump was \u201ctoo extreme\u201d, 65% were pro-choice and, even on immigration, 56% of voters supported a pathway to citizenship rather than mass deportations. Millions of voters voted for Trump at the top of the ticket and Democrats down-ballot to check his unpopular agenda. It would be a mistake to think Trump has a mandate to remake society in a hard-right, socially conservative image. So why did people vote for Trump? Most voters still actively dislike him personally (53% of voters had an unfavorable opinion of him) and most of his policies. The obvious explanation is that people trust him more to handle the economy. Although voters didn\u2019t like his presidency, they felt like they were better off four years ago. This is true, but also so obviously true as to be facile. More interesting is why, materially, voters trust him more to handle the economy. The easy answer is inflation, but the case for this as the primary driver, materially rather than rhetorically, also has some holes. The first is that inflation has drastically decreased, and has been decreasing consistently since early in the Biden presidency. For most Americans, wages have risen faster than inflation, again for years in a row. When inflation was high and harming workers\u2019 standard of living, Democrats were winning elections, historically over-performing in 2022 and sweeping special elections from the congressional level down to state legislatures and city councils. Many have proposed the idea of a \u201cvibes recession\u201d, wherein traditional and social media have given people a false idea of their actual economic conditions. But this answer is glib: politics are material and people actually do know their conditions. I propose a different explanation than inflation qua inflation: the Covid welfare state and its collapse. The massive, almost overnight expansion of the social safety net and its rapid, almost overnight rollback are materially one of the biggest policy changes in American history. For a brief period, and for the first time in history, Americans had a robust safety net: strong protections for workers and tenants, extremely generous unemployment benefits, rent control and direct cash transfers from the American government. Despite the trauma and death of Covid and the isolation of lockdowns, from late 2020 to early 2021, Americans briefly experienced the freedom of social democracy. They had enough liquid money to plan long term and make spending decisions for their own pleasure rather than just to survive. They had the labor protections to look for the jobs they wanted rather than feel stuck in the jobs they had. At the end of Trump\u2019s term, the American standard of living and the amount of economic security and freedom Americans had was higher than when it started, and, with the loss of this expanded welfare state, it was worse when Biden left office, despite his real policy wins for workers and unions. This is why voters view Trump as a better shepherd of the economy. It\u2019s important to note that Trump is resolutely not a social democrat, and these policies came into place during an emergency rather than due to ideological conviction. Indeed, he is currently running on the largest upward transfer of wealth in American history and Republicans\u2019 Project 2025 would decimate the social safety net and immiserate millions. Beyond this, Biden wanted to continue many of these policies, but there wasn\u2019t a political pathway. Instead, they quietly expired. To voters, however, the material reality is that when Trump left office, this safety net existed, and by the time of the 2024 election, it had evaporated. How could Democrats have countered this? One way was by making it a central issue, fighting publicly and openly to keep these protections and messaging heavily and constantly that Republicans were taking them away while Biden fought for them. An enormous body of research has established that social programs, when implemented, are difficult and highly unpopular to take away. These were universal programs, beneficial at all income levels. The political miscalculation the Biden administration made was that, lacking the political ability to implement these policies permanently, it was best to have them expire quietly and avoid the public backlash of gutting welfare programs and the black mark of taking a public political loss. This was a grave miscalculation. Why were Democrats unable to counter the idea that Trump was an economic savant? And why did most Americans vote for someone they believe will harm the country but help their own pocketbooks? The answer is the ongoing decimation of working-class institutions and civil society, started by neoliberalism, accelerated by the rise of the internet as a medium of interaction and put into overdrive during the isolation of Covid. The vehicles for building solidarity with others and for caring about strangers have been decimated. In crass terms, people have become more selfish. Union membership, for example, still makes voters significantly more Democratic than would otherwise be expected based on demographics alone. Even this year, Harris won union members easily while losing the popular vote overall. Unions and civil society organizations also provide a baseline of political education: members know their interests and which policies will help or harm them. Without this, Americans\u2019 views are shaped by the algorithm. Perhaps most emblematic of this is at the heart of Trump\u2019s campaign: his embrace of extremely online tech billionaires, crypto currency and online influencers. If the archetype of Trump\u2019s win in 2016 was the left-behind post-industrial Rust belt manufacturing worker \u2013 or, perhaps more accurately, the car dealership or McDonald\u2019s franchise owner in a left-behind post-industrial Rust belt town \u2013 this year it is the crypto scammer, the dropshipper, the app-based day trader, the online engagement farmer. That embrace was Trump\u2019s message, and at the core of his gains, especially with young men. Without civil society and without strong unions, people believe the only path to success is getting one over on someone else. And who is better at that than Trump? While the core of the resurgent-left generation of Sanders was downwardly mobile college-educated professionals, selling their labor for wages without the prospect of buying a house or retiring on a pension, the second wave of newly aging-in Trump voters entered adulthood without even those prospects, hoping only to grind out a living through scams. But this is fundamentally an anti-social and anti-humanist mode of economic activity that contributes nothing to society and offers nothing but alienation to its victims. The result is people willing to vote for someone they know will cause immense harm to others, hoping it will help them personally. While the new right has made great hay of returning to a communitarian model of politics, economically populist, socially conservative, and focused on family and society, the truth is that the Trumpist movement is the opposite. It is hostile to the very concept of society and community. To combat this, we need an unabashedly pro-society left. The way to win back power for a solidaristic and humanist politics is to rebuild working-class democratic institutions. In 2020, Sanders asked the question: \u201cAre you willing to fight for someone you don\u2019t know?\u201d This is the question we must ask over and over again and the work we must do is making sure the answer becomes yes. It will be hard: the right knows that their kryptonite is organization and community, which is why they plan to launch relentless attacks on leftwing organizations and unions. We will need new forms of organization in an era of hyper-online and state repression. We must be nimble and resilient. But it is the only path forward. The first goal? Answer the United Auto Workers\u2019 call that unions across the country align their contracts for 1 May 2028, maximizing the collective leverage of the working class and giving workers across the country a shared goal and collective solidarity. In the meantime, we must rebuild organizations and unions, for a mass movement for solidaristic politics, for talking to your neighbors and co-workers, for fighting for someone you don\u2019t know and for democracy itself. The story of 2024 was Americans voting for someone they know is a threat to democracy and for millions of people who are not like them because they were left worse off than they were four years before. If that\u2019s the story of 2028, the very fabric of the nation\u2019s democracy might unravel. This must not happen. Ben Davis works in political data in Washington DC",

In large part, that move was as much an effort to vote against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a> as many in the Arab and Muslim American communities have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/14/hamtramck-donald-trump-arab-american-muslim\">expressed anger</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/biden-administration\">Biden administration</a> \u2013 and, by extension, Harris \u2013 for its support for Israel.</p> <p>Analysts, while noting that the election was only a few days ago and a full picture of voting patterns has yet to emerge, suggest a multitude of reasons why a candidate so openly hostile to immigrants would be championed by them in such large numbers.</p>    <p>Fault, they say, can be attributed to Democrats\u2019 failure to understand the nuances of the Hispanic and Latino voting populations. There were clear signs as early as January that then candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>\u2019s support from that demographic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/01/trump-biden-latino-voters-poll\">had cratered</a>, and Trump\u2019s was rising.</p> <p>Ultimately, it was Republicans\u2019 economic messaging that broke through most, several experts said. That was then combined with an admiration for Trump\u2019s bombastic and pugnacious style among Latino men who, as much as white men and women who form his base, have no problem with his insults, racism and threats, because they don\u2019t believe he is talking about them.</p> <p>\u201cThere seems to be an attraction to Trump among Latinos, Latino men, that could be a kind of defensive reaction to his aggression and aggressive rhetoric,\u201d said Guillermo Grenier, professor of sociology at Florida International University and the co-author of the book This Land is Our Land: Newcomers and Established Residents in Miami.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be they\u2019re saying: \u2018I\u2019m not one of them, you know? I\u2019m an American citizen, I\u2019m voting for you, I\u2019m not the rapist scum, I\u2019m not with them. That\u2019s the other guys, the other immigrants, not the voting immigrants.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Grenier also points to the \u201carrogance\u201d of Democrats in assuming Latinos, and other minority voting groups would gravitate towards them.</p> <p>\u201cThey always have a kind of a sense of entitlement to the minority vote. They don\u2019t put the muscle in but think African Americans should vote for them, that Latinos should vote for them, because they\u2019re the big tent party,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut we\u2019re in an age of identity politics. You can\u2019t just talk generally about ambitions and accessibility and dreams if the opposite side is digging very deeply, focusing and talking directly to the people they need to attract \u2026 When people talk about why they like Trump it\u2019s that kind of directness, and if you don\u2019t have a strategy to counter that delivery then you are just kind of flailing.\u201d</p> <p>Carlos Su\u00e1rez Carrasquillo, political science professor at the University of Florida\u2019s center for Latin American studies, sees Latino men as equally susceptible to Trump\u2019s braggadocio and misogynistic proclivities as any other group of males.</p> <p>\u201cIf white males find Trump appealing as a candidate, why wouldn\u2019t Latino males?\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cA larger conversation is whether the constituency of Latino males is inherently Democrat. Or maybe aspects of gender that Trump plays up really well is a dynamic pitching at Latino males.\u201d</p> <p>Su\u00e1rez also suggests Trump\u2019s growing appeal to male Latino voters \u2013 he was the first Republican presidential candidate to win them outright \u2013 could be that it makes them feel more American.</p> <p>\u201cYou can imagine that in some Latino quarters, supporting Trump is a way to assimilate, to incorporate,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIs the Latino experience in the US becoming slowly but surely more similar to the American white experience? Could this also be a sign that the voting behavior of Latinos, slowly but surely, start to resemble more that of white America and, in this case, white males? The argument could be made.\u201d</p> <p>Grenier, meanwhile, sees Latino voters frustrated when they feel they are being patronized.</p> <p>\u201cIn the political narrative of both parties they are treated as not American, or as a special kind of American,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cDemocrats come down and give their foreign policy speech about communism and authoritarianism like it\u2019s their number one issue, and treat these south Floridians, whether they\u2019re Venezuelans, Cubans or [other Hispanic or Latino nationalities], as refugees, immigrants or exiles.</p> <p>\u201cBut their top three issues, like anywhere in the country, are the economy, healthcare and immigration, boom boom boom.\u201d</p> <p>Other analysts agree that the Harris campaign\u2019s failures can help explain Latino turnout for Trump, which saw a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-return-power-fueled-by-hispanic-working-class-voter-support-2024-11-06/\">14-point increase</a> since the 2020 election.</p> <p>\u201cThe Latino vote was the parties\u2019 to win, not the other way around.

      "bodyText": "The raucous early morning celebration in Miami\u2019s Little Havana neighborhood was of a magnitude not seen since the Cuban dictator Fidel Castro died eight years previously. In the immigrant-saturated suburb of Westchester, too, Latinos partied beyond daybreak as Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House was confirmed. Wednesday morning\u2019s revelry in south Florida reflected a stunning victory for Trump in the previously solid blue, Hispanic-majority county of Miami-Dade that had not been won by a Republican presidential candidate in more than 30 years. His victory, fueled largely by support from Latino and Hispanic voters, particularly Latino men, was repeated in county after county in swing states as the Democrats\u2019 blue wall crumbled and it became clear Trump would once again be president. In Pennsylvania, hordes of Puerto Ricans who saw their homeland demeaned as a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally barely a week before, flocked to give him their vote. In Wisconsin, exit polls showed a six-point rise from 2020, to 43%, in Trump\u2019s Hispanic support, despite his condemnation of certain immigrants as \u201cdrug dealers\u201d, \u201cmurderers\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d, and promise to conduct the largest deportation effort in US history soon after he takes office. And among other minority groups, Arab and Muslim Americans in Michigan also seemed able to overlook Trump\u2019s full-throated support of Israel\u2019s military onslaught in Gaza to show up for him in large numbers. In large part, that move was as much an effort to vote against Kamala Harris as many in the Arab and Muslim American communities have expressed anger with the Biden administration \u2013 and, by extension, Harris \u2013 for its support for Israel. Analysts, while noting that the election was only a few days ago and a full picture of voting patterns has yet to emerge, suggest a multitude of reasons why a candidate so openly hostile to immigrants would be championed by them in such large numbers. Fault, they say, can be attributed to Democrats\u2019 failure to understand the nuances of the Hispanic and Latino voting populations. There were clear signs as early as January that then candidate Joe Biden\u2019s support from that demographic had cratered, and Trump\u2019s was rising. Ultimately, it was Republicans\u2019 economic messaging that broke through most, several experts said. That was then combined with an admiration for Trump\u2019s bombastic and pugnacious style among Latino men who, as much as white men and women who form his base, have no problem with his insults, racism and threats, because they don\u2019t believe he is talking about them. \u201cThere seems to be an attraction to Trump among Latinos, Latino men, that could be a kind of defensive reaction to his aggression and aggressive rhetoric,\u201d said Guillermo Grenier, professor of sociology at Florida International University and the co-author of the book This Land is Our Land: Newcomers and Established Residents in Miami. \u201cIt could be they\u2019re saying: \u2018I\u2019m not one of them, you know? I\u2019m an American citizen, I\u2019m voting for you, I\u2019m not the rapist scum, I\u2019m not with them. That\u2019s the other guys, the other immigrants, not the voting immigrants.\u2019\u201d Grenier also points to the \u201carrogance\u201d of Democrats in assuming Latinos, and other minority voting groups would gravitate towards them. \u201cThey always have a kind of a sense of entitlement to the minority vote. They don\u2019t put the muscle in but think African Americans should vote for them, that Latinos should vote for them, because they\u2019re the big tent party,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re in an age of identity politics. You can\u2019t just talk generally about ambitions and accessibility and dreams if the opposite side is digging very deeply, focusing and talking directly to the people they need to attract \u2026 When people talk about why they like Trump it\u2019s that kind of directness, and if you don\u2019t have a strategy to counter that delivery then you are just kind of flailing.\u201d Carlos Su\u00e1rez Carrasquillo, political science professor at the University of Florida\u2019s center for Latin American studies, sees Latino men as equally susceptible to Trump\u2019s braggadocio and misogynistic proclivities as any other group of males. \u201cIf white males find Trump appealing as a candidate, why wouldn\u2019t Latino males?\u201d he said. \u201cA larger conversation is whether the constituency of Latino males is inherently Democrat. Or maybe aspects of gender that Trump plays up really well is a dynamic pitching at Latino males.\u201d Su\u00e1rez also suggests Trump\u2019s growing appeal to male Latino voters \u2013 he was the first Republican presidential candidate to win them outright \u2013 could be that it makes them feel more American. \u201cYou can imagine that in some Latino quarters, supporting Trump is a way to assimilate, to incorporate,\u201d he said. \u201cIs the Latino experience in the US becoming slowly but surely more similar to the American white experience? Could this also be a sign that the voting behavior of Latinos, slowly but surely, start to resemble more that of white America and, in this case, white males? The argument could be made.\u201d Grenier, meanwhile, sees Latino voters frustrated when they feel they are being patronized. \u201cIn the political narrative of both parties they are treated as not American, or as a special kind of American,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats come down and give their foreign policy speech about communism and authoritarianism like it\u2019s their number one issue, and treat these south Floridians, whether they\u2019re Venezuelans, Cubans or [other Hispanic or Latino nationalities], as refugees, immigrants or exiles. \u201cBut their top three issues, like anywhere in the country, are the economy, healthcare and immigration, boom boom boom.\u201d Other analysts agree that the Harris campaign\u2019s failures can help explain Latino turnout for Trump, which saw a 14-point increase since the 2020 election. \u201cThe Latino vote was the parties\u2019 to win, not the other way around. A significant proportion of Latinos do not have strong ties to either party,\u201d said Ana Valdez, president and chief executive of the Latino Donor Collaborative, in a statement. Valdez noted that while \u201crhetoric from the right has been hurtful and horrible,\u201d the \u201cDemocratic party has let many Latinos down.\u201d \u201cThey promised much and delivered little,\u201d she said, adding that promises to tackle issues like immigration reform fell short. \u201cMany Latino voters feel ignored and unrepresented [and] Trump\u2019s team made calculated moves to reach culturally conservative Latinos. They tapped into something real for these voters, the appeal to traditional values, economic opportunity,and a message that resonated on a personal level. She continued: \u201cWith wealthier Latinos, his team pushed concerns over taxes and inflation with a directness that resonated. When it comes to young Latinos, the Trump campaign clearly did more to build their platform digitally, studying and investing more in targeting Latinos on social media. \u201cThe Latino vote continues to be the biggest blind spot for both parties. But this massive shift compared to 2020 highlights that the winning side better understood the frustrations of the Latino community and took advantage.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It was a cold, rainy afternoon in Montpellier when Arsenal first became serious about William Saliba. This was 2019, before the scouts, agents and rival clubs would descend en masse. He was playing for Saint-\u00c9tienne\u2019s under-19s and Ty Gooden, then Arsenal\u2019s France scout, had alerted them to the raw yet impressive 6ft 4in 18-year-old working his way through the ranks. His insistence had brought Francis Cagigao, then the club\u2019s head of scouting, to the south of France.</p> <p>Cagigao and Gooden initially had their eye on another centre-half at Saint-\u00c9tienne, a year older and already in the first team. He will also be playing on Sunday at Stamford Bridge, against Saliba. Indeed, the older centre-half would eventually command a \u00a370m transfer fee. However, it was Saliba\u2019s extraordinary speed and presence that attracted the Arsenal duo over Wesley Fofana.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/08/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Saliba impressed in that game but also picked up an injury, meaning it was six weeks before Arsenal could return to watch him again. After the second sighting, Cagigao called Raul Sanllehi, then Arsenal\u2019s head of football. \u201cWe have to sign this boy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>That moment is football\u2019s equivalent of discovering the holy grail. A scout\u2019s lot is to hope perpetually amid endless disappointing midwinter trips watching young teenagers at nondescript training grounds. But the ones that stand out make the job worthwhile. Cagigao was also the first Arsenal representative to lay eyes on Cesc F\u00e0bregas, a moment a scout lives for.</p> <p>In essence, it is what Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali have attempted to implement at Chelsea, with mixed results: a recruitment system so smart it takes the most talented teenagers off the market before they are well known.</p> <p>Arsenal seem to have managed it better. Saliba, along with his centre-half partner Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es, also scouted by the Gooden-Cagigao combination, and Gabriel Martinelli, discovered by Arsenal\u2019s former Brazilian scout Everton Gushiken and driven through by Cagigao, are three jewels unearthed for relatively low fees and now worth significantly more.</p>    <p>\u201cYou can be the best centre-half in Europe,\u201d Cagigao was telling a bemused Saliba at Arsenal\u2019s London Colney training ground a few months after that initial sighting. Saliba, still only 19, had only just made his Saint-\u00c9tienne first-team debut but was now at one of the biggest clubs in the world, with Cagigao going through his strengths and weaknesses, showing him data on his matches and where he might improve, how Arsenal could help him. Given he had played most of his games for Saint-\u00c9tienne II and the under-19s, it was impressive Arsenal could demonstrate they knew him so well.</p> <p>Herein lies the weakness of a youth recruitment model largely reliant on data: for the youngest players, there often isn\u2019t anything meaningful to analyse. \u201cWith young players you have to wait a certain amount of games before you can say something reliable with the data,\u201d says Ian Graham, who was Liverpool\u2019s head of research, helped to build their 2020 title-winning team and runs the consultancy Ludonautics. However, the trick is to sign a player before the mainstream and meaningful data shows he is good, because at that point every club in Europe is tracking him. It\u2019s high risk yet, if you get a player of Saliba\u2019s calibre, high reward.</p> <p>Even then, making a player and agent feel loved and appreciated is the key to recruitment. Amid the cold analytics, hearts need to be won as well as minds. After the presentation to Saliba, Huss Fahmy, at that time Arsenal\u2019s head of football operations, and Cagigao took the player and his agent Djibril Niang to Sushisamba, the fusion restaurant located on the 38th and 39th floors of the Heron Tower in the City of London, with spectacular views of the capital. Far from the suburban sleepiness of London Colney, the bustle and energy at the heart of the capital was designed to impress a teenager and did the trick.</p> <p>At that point, Tottenham became interested but were wasting their time because Saliba and Niang were sold on Arsenal. The presentation had been key. One person who was close to the deal said: \u201cThat absolutely made the difference, one million per cent.

      "bodyText": "It was a cold, rainy afternoon in Montpellier when Arsenal first became serious about William Saliba. This was 2019, before the scouts, agents and rival clubs would descend en masse. He was playing for Saint-\u00c9tienne\u2019s under-19s and Ty Gooden, then Arsenal\u2019s France scout, had alerted them to the raw yet impressive 6ft 4in 18-year-old working his way through the ranks. His insistence had brought Francis Cagigao, then the club\u2019s head of scouting, to the south of France. Cagigao and Gooden initially had their eye on another centre-half at Saint-\u00c9tienne, a year older and already in the first team. He will also be playing on Sunday at Stamford Bridge, against Saliba. Indeed, the older centre-half would eventually command a \u00a370m transfer fee. However, it was Saliba\u2019s extraordinary speed and presence that attracted the Arsenal duo over Wesley Fofana. Saliba impressed in that game but also picked up an injury, meaning it was six weeks before Arsenal could return to watch him again. After the second sighting, Cagigao called Raul Sanllehi, then Arsenal\u2019s head of football. \u201cWe have to sign this boy,\u201d he said. That moment is football\u2019s equivalent of discovering the holy grail. A scout\u2019s lot is to hope perpetually amid endless disappointing midwinter trips watching young teenagers at nondescript training grounds. But the ones that stand out make the job worthwhile. Cagigao was also the first Arsenal representative to lay eyes on Cesc F\u00e0bregas, a moment a scout lives for. In essence, it is what Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali have attempted to implement at Chelsea, with mixed results: a recruitment system so smart it takes the most talented teenagers off the market before they are well known. Arsenal seem to have managed it better. Saliba, along with his centre-half partner Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es, also scouted by the Gooden-Cagigao combination, and Gabriel Martinelli, discovered by Arsenal\u2019s former Brazilian scout Everton Gushiken and driven through by Cagigao, are three jewels unearthed for relatively low fees and now worth significantly more. \u201cYou can be the best centre-half in Europe,\u201d Cagigao was telling a bemused Saliba at Arsenal\u2019s London Colney training ground a few months after that initial sighting. Saliba, still only 19, had only just made his Saint-\u00c9tienne first-team debut but was now at one of the biggest clubs in the world, with Cagigao going through his strengths and weaknesses, showing him data on his matches and where he might improve, how Arsenal could help him. Given he had played most of his games for Saint-\u00c9tienne II and the under-19s, it was impressive Arsenal could demonstrate they knew him so well. Herein lies the weakness of a youth recruitment model largely reliant on data: for the youngest players, there often isn\u2019t anything meaningful to analyse. \u201cWith young players you have to wait a certain amount of games before you can say something reliable with the data,\u201d says Ian Graham, who was Liverpool\u2019s head of research, helped to build their 2020 title-winning team and runs the consultancy Ludonautics. However, the trick is to sign a player before the mainstream and meaningful data shows he is good, because at that point every club in Europe is tracking him. It\u2019s high risk yet, if you get a player of Saliba\u2019s calibre, high reward. Even then, making a player and agent feel loved and appreciated is the key to recruitment. Amid the cold analytics, hearts need to be won as well as minds. After the presentation to Saliba, Huss Fahmy, at that time Arsenal\u2019s head of football operations, and Cagigao took the player and his agent Djibril Niang to Sushisamba, the fusion restaurant located on the 38th and 39th floors of the Heron Tower in the City of London, with spectacular views of the capital. Far from the suburban sleepiness of London Colney, the bustle and energy at the heart of the capital was designed to impress a teenager and did the trick. At that point, Tottenham became interested but were wasting their time because Saliba and Niang were sold on Arsenal. The presentation had been key. One person who was close to the deal said: \u201cThat absolutely made the difference, one million per cent. A player and agent these days need to know you\u2019re more than just financially invested in them but know their game and can help them progress.\u201d Spurs\u2019 interest was still an unwelcome complication for Arsenal and a gift for Saint-\u00c9tienne, pushing the price from \u00a312m to \u00a318m with add-ons of up to \u00a37m. Understandably the Arsenal scouting team came under intense pressure with the increased price. Were they really still sure about this unheralded teenager? At that price? \u201cSign him!\u201d they insisted. With the departure of Edu from his role as sporting director being announced this past week, Arsenal fans can perhaps take some solace from the Saliba signing. It is not that Edu will not be missed, but the common perception that he masterminded the Saliba deal is some way from the full story.

The book is slow and incredibly arcane and niche, but it\u2019s based upon both minute perception and a very deep sense of place, and the interweaving of historical mythology and modern-day present life.</p> <h2>2.

Food</h2> <p><strong>Eating in</strong></p>    <p>I travel a lot for work, which means three meals out a day, so I probably had about 400 restaurant meals in the last year. My real food pleasure is to get the best fruit and vegetables from the garden and some really nice cheese or meat from a local butcher. To put together a simple meal at home, at my kitchen table with my wife, to me, is the greatest possible luxury. Recently we made a radicchio salad with blue cheese and toasted walnuts, and Sarah cooked some chard with cream sauce. I\u2019d rather do that than go to any restaurant in the world.</p> <h2>6.

She\u2019s got the most wonderful, strong voice. These are hymns, and I\u2019m not particularly religious, but they have an incredible sort of verve and purity. It reminded me of Friday nights in the early 70s, when the whole pub would stand around the piano and sing. Maddy Prior has distilled that sense of everybody singing together \u2013 something that was chaotic, slightly drunken, but good fun \u2013 into something rather purer, but the essence of that is still there.</p> <h2>7.

I saw it in late June, at the peak of its summer garb, but I\u2019ve seen photographs of it in winter and it looked totally different. I think a lot of Jeff Koons\u2019s stuff is ghastly, but that\u2019s why I liked it \u2013 it\u2019s always good to have your prejudices challenged. I went to mock and came away applauding.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The honey industry faces new demands to overhaul its supply chain after more than 90% of sampled products bought from large British retailers failed pioneering authenticity tests. The UK branch of the Honey Authenticity Network sent 30 samples last month from Britain for a novel commercial test based on the DNA profiles of genuine honey. Five were from UK beekeepers and 25 from big retailers, including supermarkets. The tests found that 24 out of the 25 jars of honey from retailers were considered suspicious. All five samples from UK beekeepers were considered to be genuine. Honey importers in the UK and some experts challenge the reliability of such testing, but this is the latest batch of tests suggesting what may be widespread adulteration in the honey supply chain, with some products suspected of being bulked out with cheaper sugar syrup. The British Honey Importers and Packers Association (BHIPA) said a \u201cweight of evidence\u201d assessment must be used to safeguard the supply chain. It said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of UK-sold honey was of very high standard. An EU investigation published last year found 46% of imported sampled products were suspected to be fraudulent, including all 10 honey samples from the UK. The EU is working on advanced testing techniques to detect honey fraud and has passed new legislation to provide improved labelling of country of origin on jars of honey. Lynne Ingram, a Somerset beekeeper and the chair of the Honey Authenticity Network UK, said: \u201cThe market is being flooded by cheap, imported adulterated honey and it is undermining the business of genuine honey producers.

Meanwhile, low levels of a drug \u2013 or none at all \u2013 can be found in hair taken from a regular user \u2013 for example, if it has been dyed or treated.</p> <p>The issue of test results being misreported is the subject of an <a href=\"https://www.birthcompanions.org.uk/pages/taking-a-strand\">open letter </a>sent on Tuesday to the family division of the high court.

The cut-off levels were developed by the Society of Hair Testing almost 30 years ago, long before research established what is now known about the impact of influencing factors on drug absorption, such as hair colour, race and environmental factors.</p> <p>Nevertheless, many drug companies continue to use the binary system of cut-off levels to report test results. This is despite discrepancies such as the fact that hair with darker pigmentation will absorb drugs more readily. This leads to a person who has black hair having dramatically higher levels compared with those who have light brown or blond hair, even if they have identical drug use.</p> <p>Furthermore, within the subsection of black hair there are huge variations based on race, meaning people of African-Caribbean, African or Asian descent are more likely to lose custody of their child.</p> <p>\u201cThe danger is that \u2018positive\u2019 and \u2018negative\u2019 results are being treated at face value without room for wider interpretation,\u201d said Hunter. \u201cSocial workers and parenting assessors advising the courts will often equate the level of drug detected in the hair as evidence of drug consumption, which is dangerous and wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The open letter sent to the family division states: \u201cThere is a compelling body of evidence that shows the processes used to interpret the results are vastly oversimplified and misleading.\u201d It calls for an end to \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d cut-off levels and warns of the \u201crisk of systematic racial bias\u201d.</p> <p>It has been long-established that the use of hair strand testing in isolation should not be relied on.

Child protection proceedings for newborn babies have risen from more than 1,000 in 2007/2008 to nearly 2,500 in 2016/2017.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are a first-time mother, you have a lot to prove in a short time frame about your capacity to parent and your commitment to addressing some of the issues that might have led to the concerns including substance use,\u201d says Kirsty Kitchen, head of policy at Birth Companions.</p> <p>The charity, which supports women who experience disadvantage in the justice system, organised the open letter and formed the campaign,<em> </em>Taking A Strand, along with barristers from 4PB and MSB Solicitors.</p> <p>Kitchen said: \u201cA positive hair strand test can be the sole or most significant factor regardless of everything else. If that is not contextualised, or if it is unreliable, then we have a major issue.\u201d</p> <p>Family law barrister Lucy Logan Green has become concerned about the growing number of her clients who have questioned the accuracy of hair strand test results.</p> <p>In one case a mother\u2019s alleged ongoing cannabis use was one factor the court was considering when faced with whether her child in local authority care should be returned to her or placed for adoption.</p> <p>Logan Green\u2019s client was adamant she was abstinent from all cannabis use but the most recent hair strand tests returned positive results for low-level use. The court ordered that the child should be placed for adoption.</p> <p>The barrister explained: \u201cI wrote to the testing company to ask whether the low levels of cannabis detection could be caused by environmental contamination and they responded saying it could be. But that information hadn\u2019t been provided within the company\u2019s analysis.\u201d</p> <p>Logan Green is among the signatories to the open letter, copied to the Family Justice Board, the government body responsible for improving the family justice system in England and Wales.</p> <p>It cites a <a href=\"https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2024/498\">court of appeal judgment published in May</a> in which Mr Justice Cobb concluded another judge had been wrong to attach \u201csuch presumptive weight\u201d to a set of hair strand test results that led them to order the removal of three children from their family. Cobb overturned the decision.</p> <p>The case highlights that test results, when presented without context, can be highly misleading. The advocates involved were criticised for providing only a brief summary of the test results to the judge \u2013 and omitting the comprehensive interpretation and opinions provided by the expert in the body of the report.</p> <p>The open letter argues hair-strand testing should be treated by the courts as expert opinion evidence and warns: \u201cWithout urgent and comprehensive review of the way this evidence is presented and interpreted in court proceedings, there is significant risk that many more children will be wrongly removed from their families: a most devastating form of injustice.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for HM Courts and Tribunals Service said: \u201cWhile ultimately decisions are made by the independent judiciary, it is extremely unlikely a single hair strand test would result in a parent losing custody.\u201d</p> <p>However, Logan Green said that if hair strand testing was ordered at the outset, loss of custody becomes a more likely outcome. \u201cAt the start, if you are considering the removal of a child there may not be much other evidence to go on. A positive drug test for an illicit substance can and absolutely does lead to removals.\u201d</p>",

The charity, which supports women who experience disadvantage in the justice system, organised the open letter and formed the campaign, Taking A Strand, along with barristers from 4PB and MSB Solicitors. Kitchen said: \u201cA positive hair strand test can be the sole or most significant factor regardless of everything else. If that is not contextualised, or if it is unreliable, then we have a major issue.\u201d Family law barrister Lucy Logan Green has become concerned about the growing number of her clients who have questioned the accuracy of hair strand test results. In one case a mother\u2019s alleged ongoing cannabis use was one factor the court was considering when faced with whether her child in local authority care should be returned to her or placed for adoption. Logan Green\u2019s client was adamant she was abstinent from all cannabis use but the most recent hair strand tests returned positive results for low-level use. The court ordered that the child should be placed for adoption. The barrister explained: \u201cI wrote to the testing company to ask whether the low levels of cannabis detection could be caused by environmental contamination and they responded saying it could be. But that information hadn\u2019t been provided within the company\u2019s analysis.\u201d Logan Green is among the signatories to the open letter, copied to the Family Justice Board, the government body responsible for improving the family justice system in England and Wales. It cites a court of appeal judgment published in May in which Mr Justice Cobb concluded another judge had been wrong to attach \u201csuch presumptive weight\u201d to a set of hair strand test results that led them to order the removal of three children from their family. Cobb overturned the decision. The case highlights that test results, when presented without context, can be highly misleading. The advocates involved were criticised for providing only a brief summary of the test results to the judge \u2013 and omitting the comprehensive interpretation and opinions provided by the expert in the body of the report. The open letter argues hair-strand testing should be treated by the courts as expert opinion evidence and warns: \u201cWithout urgent and comprehensive review of the way this evidence is presented and interpreted in court proceedings, there is significant risk that many more children will be wrongly removed from their families: a most devastating form of injustice.\u201d A spokesperson for HM Courts and Tribunals Service said: \u201cWhile ultimately decisions are made by the independent judiciary, it is extremely unlikely a single hair strand test would result in a parent losing custody.\u201d However, Logan Green said that if hair strand testing was ordered at the outset, loss of custody becomes a more likely outcome. \u201cAt the start, if you are considering the removal of a child there may not be much other evidence to go on. A positive drug test for an illicit substance can and absolutely does lead to removals.\u201d",

In the 2016 election, Trump won 2,584 counties nationwide while Hillary Clinton carried only 472. But Clinton\u2019s counties accounted for nearly two-thirds of America\u2019s economic output, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2016/11/29/another-clinton-trump-divide-high-output-america-vs-low-output-america/\">the Brookings Institution thinktank found</a>.</p> <p>The split finds expression in the way people dress, the TV shows they watch and the ways they interact (or don\u2019t). In 2016, Trump won 76% of counties that contained a Cracker Barrel, a restaurant offering southern homestyle cooking on interstate highways, and just 22% of counties with Whole Foods, an organic national supermarket chain. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/796425128359972864?s=20\">The Cook Report noted</a> the 54% gap compared with a 19% difference in the 1992 election.</p> <p>On the eve of the 2024 election, Trump held a campaign rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where some supporters wore miners\u2019 helmets.

These guys will. He gets it. President Trump gets it. He will not look at our boys like they are second-class citizens.\u201d</p> <p>An exit poll on Tuesday showed Trump winning voters whose household incomes are between $30,000 and $100,000. His sense of grievance struck a chord with people who feel left behind and sneered at as \u201cdeplorables\u201d or \u201cgarbage\u201d by Democratic leaders, journalists and Hollywood celebrities.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/02/republican-joe-walsh-iowa-trump\">Joe Walsh</a>, a former Republican representative and Tea Party activist who campaigned for Harris, said by phone: \u201cThe perception is that these people are elites. That\u2019s what these folks have told me for the last five years. Many of them acknowledge Trump\u2019s an asshole but they say: \u2018Look, the Democrats are looking down on me.\u2019 I heard that all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Walsh always believed that the election would be about Trump\u2019s demagoguery and its appeal to working-class Americans. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s been crystal clear for the last four, five, six years, certainly ever since Covid, regular everyday people have been concerned about immigration, a broken border, crime on the streets and the price of bread and the price of butter.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re pissed off and angry about that stuff and Democrats have ignored it, especially the issue of immigration. Biden and Harris made it worse when they came in. Trump feeds these people bullshit, like they\u2019re eating cats and dogs, but we have way too many migrants in America. It\u2019s created real problems and Democrats have decided to ignore it. It bit them in the ass.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats are now engaged in long and painful soul-searching. Sanders argued <a href=\"https://x.com/BernieSanders/status/1854271157135941698\">in a scathing statement</a> that a party that had forsaken the working class should not be surprised to \u201cfind that the working class has abandoned them\u201d. He added: \u201cFirst, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well.\u201d</p> <p>That prompted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/bernie-sanders-democrats-election\">an angry rebuke</a> from Democratic National Committee chair Jaime Harrison, who dismissed Sanders\u2019s thesis as \u201cstraight-up BS\u201d and posted a long list of Joe Biden\u2019s achievements for lower-income families. \u201cBiden was the most pro-worker president of my lifetime,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Research shows that one of Trump\u2019s most effective ads was focused on keeping boys out of girls\u2019 sports with the the tagline: \u201cKamala Harris is for they/them.

But this time he won the votes of one-fifth of Black men and nearly half of Latino men. He also made inroads among young voters.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/people/william-a-galston/\">Bill Galston</a>, a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, observed: \u201cWe are witnessing the slow eclipse of race in favour of class. The question that I posed publicly in the week before the election was: would Donald Trump be able to continue the movement of the Republican party towards a multi-ethnic working class? And, if he did, not only would he win but he would be transforming the axis of American politics.</p> <p>\u201cThe answer to that question is clearly yes, he has succeeded in moving the Republican party further down that road. What that means is that the contrast between the Republican party and the Democratic party, particularly on cultural issues, will continue to widen unless the Democrats start paying attention to the message they\u2019re receiving but, until very recently, were not hearing.\u201d</p> <p>The Democratic left rallied around Harris and projected unity in the fight against Trump but to no avail. It might be harder to pull together such a coalition next time. While Trump\u2019s rightwing populism has thrived over the past decade, some regret how leftwing populism has stalled.</p> <p>Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of the progressive group <a href=\"https://ourrevolution.com/\">Our Revolution</a>, said: \u201cAt the end of the day, there was a fundamental failure by the Harris campaign to acknowledge people\u2019s economic pain. They focused on issues of democracy and reproductive rights versus adopting Bernie Sanders-style populism, which I would argue showed where the energy was within the Democratic party in 2016 and 2020.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate because we need a populist economic left that is willing to challenge corporate power and articulate that wealthy corporations are suppressing wages. They\u2019re sacrificing Americans in the name of corporate greed \u2013 everything from climate to our educational systems to our healthcare system. I feel like she held up Trump as a villain, but a villain who was a threat to democracy, not a villain who represented corporate oligarchic rule.\u201d</p>",

Cave spends the lion\u2019s share of his set\u2019s two-hour-plus runtime pacing a narrow catwalk, clasping fingers, being held aloft and singing close into upturned faces, often handing his microphone to strangers to leap about or teach handclap patterns.</p> <p>As the night progresses, he becomes even more transported, lifting phrases such as \u201cyou\u2019re beautiful!\u201d and \u201cstop!\u201d from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eaDmGqRb1g\">Conversion</a>, a track on his recent <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/30/nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds-wild-god-review-a-different-kind-of-transcendence\">Wild God</a></em> LP, and adding them to his yammered \u201cyeah, yeah, yeahs\u201d.

Cave calls him \u201ca troubled, beautiful, broken, deeply flawed genius\u201d, adding \u201cancient\u2026\u201d with a wry smile.

In a body of work full of references to western theology, there are cameos from philosophical traditions from further east. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEtMCSIgLGI\">Song of the Lake</a> finds succour in non-attachment. \u201cFor there is either a remedy or there is none, and if there be none, never mind, never mind,\u201d he croons.</p> <p>This is a tour that leans hard on the kind of uplift that invokes forces greater than ourselves; myths, symbols and Blakean visions of gods and spirits. The most affecting of these tonight might be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yvX_SAzkmQ\">Joy</a>, a key <em>Wild God</em> track that finds Cave encouraging us to lift our gaze from a fractious world and look \u201cbeyond above\u201d at the stars \u2013 \u201cbright, triumphant metaphors of love\u201d, he calls them. Charismatic figures make for dangerous politics. But this magnetic proselytiser is keen to foreground fellow feeling and wonder as strategies in turbulent times.</p>",

Contorting into raptures on guitar, electronics and fiddle, Bad Seed MVP Warren Ellis almost upstages his dark lord, flying grey hair and wild beard joined by the wayward strands of a fraying violin bow. Cave calls him \u201ca troubled, beautiful, broken, deeply flawed genius\u201d, adding \u201cancient\u2026\u201d with a wry smile. Near the end, The Weeping Song is transformed into a kind of rave-folk by Ellis\u2019s mantric outpourings. In recent interviews, Cave has talked about his relationship with Christian belief. In a body of work full of references to western theology, there are cameos from philosophical traditions from further east. Song of the Lake finds succour in non-attachment. \u201cFor there is either a remedy or there is none, and if there be none, never mind, never mind,\u201d he croons. This is a tour that leans hard on the kind of uplift that invokes forces greater than ourselves; myths, symbols and Blakean visions of gods and spirits. The most affecting of these tonight might be Joy, a key Wild God track that finds Cave encouraging us to lift our gaze from a fractious world and look \u201cbeyond above\u201d at the stars \u2013 \u201cbright, triumphant metaphors of love\u201d, he calls them. Charismatic figures make for dangerous politics. But this magnetic proselytiser is keen to foreground fellow feeling and wonder as strategies in turbulent times.",

      "body": "<p>Occupational stress is a trigger for Rebecca Wilde, a 32-year-old tech worker in Buckinghamshire. Four years ago, work pressures combined with family issues affected her sleep, leading to a severe manic episode. She was hospitalised for a month and a half, and diagnosed with type 1 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/bipolar-disorder\">bipolar disorder</a>, also known as bipolar 1, a mood condition that can have devastating consequences if not managed well. Mania, and sometimes psychosis, is present in type 1.</p> <p>Wilde was experiencing both: at one point, she thought she could talk to dogs. She was put on the antipsychotic drug olanzapine and another mood stabiliser, lithium. She has now been taking lithium alone for a year, and it has been transformative. \u201cOn the lithium, I definitely feel like me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>While Wilde was transitioning to lithium only, researchers were furiously debating the evidence around the drug. In 2023, the journal <em>Bipolar Disorders</em> published an editorial co-written by editor-in-chief Gin S Malhi, titled <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bdi.13299\">\u201cLithium first: not merely first line\u201d</a>. This asserted that lithium should be considered not only as one of several possible initial treatments for bipolar disorder, but as the first and foremost of these. Lithium \u201cneeds to be championed\u201d, maintains Malhi, a visiting psychiatry professor at Oxford University.</p> <p>But the publication ignited a storm. \u201cIt enraged me to see this editorial,\u201d says Haim Belmaker, emeritus professor of psychiatry at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, in Beersheba, Israel. In the absence of new data, \u201cto me it was a terrible hubris for them to come out and suddenly, in a triumphal way, say that lithium was great\u201d. Belmaker fired off a <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bdi.13387\">letter to the editor</a> calling it a mistake to consider lithium the gold standard. This was published after eight peer reviews \u2013 a highly unusual amount of scrutiny. Three other commentaries then waded into the debate.</p> <p>This is not the only heated dispute among lithium researchers from the past couple of years. A <a href=\"https://sage.altmetric.com/details/164513368/twitter\">2024 critique</a> led to professors trading words such as \u201cpseudoscience\u201d and \u201cextraordinarily venomous\u201d. Feuds such as these point to the high stakes over the declining popularity of lithium.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Globally, the most common reason medical professionals give for not prescribing lithium is patients\u2019 negative beliefs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Medicinal lithium is remarkable. There is <a href=\"https://journalbipolardisorders.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40345-023-00310-x\">more evidence</a> of lithium\u2019s effectiveness in managing bipolar disorder than for any other medicine. As a naturally occurring ion, lithium can\u2019t be patented. And unlike most medicines, it\u2019s not metabolised by the body.</p> <p>Malhi explains why this is significant: \u201cWith lithium, the body can be thought of simply as a bucket of water with input and output of fluid. Then, whatever lithium you add gives you a plasma level. It means we can accurately make changes with sensitivity around plasma levels and clinical response and tolerability.\u201d</p> <p>Belmaker argues that lithium\u2019s simplicity has made it alluring, but for some people this has hardened into an almost dogmatic belief in its superiority. Indeed, words such as \u201cmystique\u201d and \u201cmagic\u201d pop up in the scientific literature around the medicine. It\u2019s still not known how lithium works to stabilise moods.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Lithium\u2019s potential to treat mood disorders began being discussed in earnest in <a href=\"https://www.springeropen.com/collections/CALI\">the middle of the 20th century</a> and was popularised in the 1960s and 70s. Research slowed after the 90s, when anticonvulsant and antipsychotic medicines started to be used for bipolar. Since then there\u2019s been a decline in expertise about lithium, says Allan Young, chair of mood disorders at King\u2019s College London. Resistance to the use of lithium has been building for decades.</p> <p>A key reason is that lithium is cumbersome to manage. It works only within a very narrow range of doses; beyond this, lithium toxicity can develop quickly, sometimes fatally. Serious side-effects include damage to the kidneys, thyroid and parathyroid. Other side-effects, such as excessive thirst and urination, can disturb sleep.</p> <p>Wilde, a keen runner, has noticed this. Initially, lithium would cause her hands to tremble with dehydration. So she\u2019s more careful about replenishing liquids and electrolytes. This has involved more night-time toilet visits, which she calls \u201cmore of an annoyance than anything\u201d.</p> <p>Overall, lithium proponents argue that concerns about <a href=\"https://journalbipolardisorders.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40345-023-00310-x\">side-effects are exaggerated</a>, including by health workers who may <a href=\"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/lithium-balancing-mental-and-renal-health\">wrongly attribute kidney issues to lithium</a>. The alternatives can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/14/lithium-should-be-more-widely-used-for-bipolar-disorder-researchers-say\">also carry side-effects</a>; Wilde experienced stubborn weight gain from an antipsychotic drug.</p> <p>The anticonvulsant sodium valproate provides another example. According to Young, when valproate was marketed as a mood stabiliser in the 1990s, pharmaceutical companies described it as safer during pregnancy than lithium, which can increase the <a href=\"https://www.medicinesinpregnancy.org/leaflets-a-z/lithium/\">likelihood of a baby being born with a heart defect</a>. \u201cThat almost certainly turned out to be erroneous, because if anything, we think valproate is worse than lithium\u201d <a href=\"https://journalbipolardisorders.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40345-023-00310-x\">for foetuses</a>, Young says. But the damage had been done: \u201cWe saw a real step back in interest in terms of lithium.\u201d</p>    <p>Because lithium is so finicky, plasma levels need to be checked with regular blood tests: initially weekly, and then every several months. Eating disorders and sudden weight loss can make lithium risky. In comparison, \u201cother drugs can be started rather cavalierly\u201d, according to Belmaker.</p> <p>It can take months or even years to know how well someone is responding to lithium. This depends on a certain continuity of care and flow of information between clinicians. Yet some argue that all these requirements are actually a benefit of lithium, as they make close monitoring of the patient essential.</p> <p>This may depend on each patient\u2019s capacity to speak up for themselves. Wilde is organised and active, so she does not mind following up on communications among her various public and private doctors, and getting blood and organ tests every few months: \u201cIt\u2019s worth the faff.\u201d However, she acknowledges that she is young and relatively healthy, and lives close to medical care. The calculus might be different for someone with health complications, mobility issues, or routines frequently disrupted by mania or depression.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections/medicines-used-mental-health-england/medicines-used-mental-health-england-201516-202324\">NHS data for medicines prescribed in England</a> shows that in 2015/16, 51,682 patients were prescribed lithium carbonate (tablets) and 941 lithium citrate (liquid). This dwindled to 42,534 and 822 in 2023/24.</p> <p>Since 2014, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg185/chapter/Recommendations\">guidelines</a> has recommended lithium as the only first-line maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder in the UK. Lithium would have been expected to trend up based on this guidance, as UK bipolar diagnoses <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pds.5318\">more than doubled</a> between 2001 and 2018, according to a sample of electronic medical records. Instead, lithium prescribing for patients with bipolar dropped from 31% to 16%.</p> <p>Joseph Hayes, a psychiatry professor at University College London, co-authored the medical records study. With the overstretched state of the NHS and the scarcity of specialist bipolar clinics, \u201cwe\u2019ve set up a mental healthcare service that makes it quite difficult to initiate lithium\u201d, Hayes says. \u201cThere are clinicians who believe they can\u2019t safely prescribe it,\u201d even though in his experience lithium is distinct from other drugs in allowing some patients to thrive, not just get by.</p> <p>\u201cLithium is woefully under-prescribed in the UK,\u201d says Simon Kitchen, chief executive of the charity Bipolar UK. \u201cIncreasing lithium use means even more people living with bipolar will be able to stay well, keep out of hospital, get back into the workplace and live the lives they deserve.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If lithium was new and drug companies could profit from it, they would shout from the rooftops about its effectiveness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lithium\u2019s declining use is a worldwide trend, though <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bdi.13366\">especially marked in North America</a>. In North America, Europe and Australia, between 1998 and 2020, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics and antidepressants were all <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bdi.13366\">prescribed more often than lithium</a> to people with bipolar disorder. Globally, the most common reason medical professionals give for not prescribing lithium is <a href=\"https://journalbipolardisorders.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40345-023-00301-y\">patients\u2019 negative beliefs</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s less surprising that lithium would be underused in the US \u2013 with its complicated swirl of <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bdi.13366\">insurance policies</a>, <a href=\"https://journalbipolardisorders.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40345-023-00310-x\">medical lawsuits</a>, and <a href=\"https://journalbipolardisorders.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40345-023-00310-x\">pharmaceutical advertising</a>. On the other hand, in low- and middle-income countries, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240084278\">insufficient resources for monitoring</a> lithium are especially concerning.</p> <p>So a niggling question is why lithium use has also dropped in countries such as the UK. Michael Gitlin, a psychiatry professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, says that while some Europeans may view Americans \u201cas like children who are distracted by shiny new drugs\u201d, the <a href=\"https://journalbipolardisorders.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40345-023-00310-x\">shiny new drug</a> factor isn\u2019t limited to the US. In 2023, Gitlin, Malhi and colleagues issued a <a href=\"https://journalbipolardisorders.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40345-023-00310-x\">\u201ccall to arms\u201d</a> to stem the decline of lithium therapy.</p> <p>Lithium\u2019s venerable status may actually be working against it. Because it has been around longer than any other drug to treat bipolar disorder, it\u2019s had longer to rack up a history of potential side-effects. Lithium has been subject to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/14/lithium-should-be-more-widely-used-for-bipolar-disorder-researchers-say\">lingering stigma</a> from the <a href=\"https://journalbipolardisorders.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40345-023-00322-7\">antipsychiatry movements of earlier decades</a> and the <a href=\"https://journalbipolardisorders.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40345-023-00301-y\">social media-amplified</a> stigma from the critical psychiatry movement today, according to Hayes. Some psychiatrists report that patients have formed negative impressions of lithium long before it\u2019s suggested to them as a treatment.</p> <p>There\u2019s another risk of complacency. Because, as Young says, bipolar is \u201csuch a highly recurrent disorder\u201d, long-term maintenance is important though sometimes underappreciated. It can be dangerous to discontinue lithium, he warns. \u201cOne of the sad situations is if someone has responded really well to lithium and then they stop it, they may not respond that well to being reintroduced. And it can be quite a rocky road to getting someone back to recovery.\u201d</p>    <p>Some researchers report that it\u2019s becoming ever more challenging to obtain research funding for lithium. Pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to fund studies or the marketing of lithium, which will never be a big earner unless they bundle it into novel compounds. \u201cIf lithium was a new drug today and someone could make a profit from it, I think drug companies would be shouting from the rooftops about how effective it is,\u201d Hayes says.</p> <p>Even getting data for research can be tough, reports Carol Crean, an associate professor in physical and materials chemistry at Surrey University. Her team has been developing less invasive methods for monitoring lithium, such as wearable sensors. Wilde already uses a bipolar symptom-tracking app; continuous monitoring technologies would give people like her more power to check their own lithium levels, as people with diabetes do for blood glucose levels. But in a vicious circle, Crean says, \u201cWith fewer people taking the drug, it can be challenging to reliably get patient samples to help progress the work.\u201d</p> <p>The increasing sophistication of technology for personalised medicine could help reverse the plummeting of lithium use. If clinicians were able to more accurately predict who would do well on lithium, it could be a gamechanger. Young is part of an EU-funded <a href=\"https://rlink.eu.com/collaborative-research-project/\">research project</a> seeking to determine the biomarkers related to lithium response, using tools including activity sensors, blood tests, machine learning and MRI techniques to directly measure the distribution of lithium in the brain. \u201cThis is probably one of the most exciting things to happen with lithium research in decades,\u201d says Young.</p> <p>Another possibility is that as the prescription of lithium for bipolar disorder keeps falling, interest in other applications of lithium will rise. Researchers continue to investigate its protective effects against <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bdi.13366\">suicide and dementia</a>, and its supplementary use in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/10/lithium-longevity-suicide-microdosing/680154/\">microdoses</a>. This has generated much excitement, though some remain concerned about the potential for overhyping lithium in new ways.</p> <p>These controversies remain academic for patients who will ultimately choose the least bad option for them. Since childhood, Wilde has tried to avoid medication where possible. She still recognises the limitations of any mood stabiliser: \u201cI really don\u2019t think it\u2019s just lithium that\u2019s going to keep me, or anyone really for that matter, stable.\u201d But combined with therapy, work-life balance, physical activity, medical checks and a strong support system, lithium has helped her get back to herself. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s working for me, I will stay on it.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Occupational stress is a trigger for Rebecca Wilde, a 32-year-old tech worker in Buckinghamshire. Four years ago, work pressures combined with family issues affected her sleep, leading to a severe manic episode. She was hospitalised for a month and a half, and diagnosed with type 1 bipolar disorder, also known as bipolar 1, a mood condition that can have devastating consequences if not managed well. Mania, and sometimes psychosis, is present in type 1. Wilde was experiencing both: at one point, she thought she could talk to dogs. She was put on the antipsychotic drug olanzapine and another mood stabiliser, lithium. She has now been taking lithium alone for a year, and it has been transformative. \u201cOn the lithium, I definitely feel like me,\u201d she says. While Wilde was transitioning to lithium only, researchers were furiously debating the evidence around the drug. In 2023, the journal Bipolar Disorders published an editorial co-written by editor-in-chief Gin S Malhi, titled \u201cLithium first: not merely first line\u201d. This asserted that lithium should be considered not only as one of several possible initial treatments for bipolar disorder, but as the first and foremost of these. Lithium \u201cneeds to be championed\u201d, maintains Malhi, a visiting psychiatry professor at Oxford University. But the publication ignited a storm. \u201cIt enraged me to see this editorial,\u201d says Haim Belmaker, emeritus professor of psychiatry at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, in Beersheba, Israel. In the absence of new data, \u201cto me it was a terrible hubris for them to come out and suddenly, in a triumphal way, say that lithium was great\u201d. Belmaker fired off a letter to the editor calling it a mistake to consider lithium the gold standard. This was published after eight peer reviews \u2013 a highly unusual amount of scrutiny. Three other commentaries then waded into the debate. This is not the only heated dispute among lithium researchers from the past couple of years. A 2024 critique led to professors trading words such as \u201cpseudoscience\u201d and \u201cextraordinarily venomous\u201d. Feuds such as these point to the high stakes over the declining popularity of lithium. Medicinal lithium is remarkable. There is more evidence of lithium\u2019s effectiveness in managing bipolar disorder than for any other medicine. As a naturally occurring ion, lithium can\u2019t be patented. And unlike most medicines, it\u2019s not metabolised by the body. Malhi explains why this is significant: \u201cWith lithium, the body can be thought of simply as a bucket of water with input and output of fluid. Then, whatever lithium you add gives you a plasma level. It means we can accurately make changes with sensitivity around plasma levels and clinical response and tolerability.\u201d Belmaker argues that lithium\u2019s simplicity has made it alluring, but for some people this has hardened into an almost dogmatic belief in its superiority. Indeed, words such as \u201cmystique\u201d and \u201cmagic\u201d pop up in the scientific literature around the medicine. It\u2019s still not known how lithium works to stabilise moods. * * * Lithium\u2019s potential to treat mood disorders began being discussed in earnest in the middle of the 20th century and was popularised in the 1960s and 70s. Research slowed after the 90s, when anticonvulsant and antipsychotic medicines started to be used for bipolar. Since then there\u2019s been a decline in expertise about lithium, says Allan Young, chair of mood disorders at King\u2019s College London. Resistance to the use of lithium has been building for decades. A key reason is that lithium is cumbersome to manage. It works only within a very narrow range of doses; beyond this, lithium toxicity can develop quickly, sometimes fatally. Serious side-effects include damage to the kidneys, thyroid and parathyroid. Other side-effects, such as excessive thirst and urination, can disturb sleep. Wilde, a keen runner, has noticed this. Initially, lithium would cause her hands to tremble with dehydration. So she\u2019s more careful about replenishing liquids and electrolytes. This has involved more night-time toilet visits, which she calls \u201cmore of an annoyance than anything\u201d. Overall, lithium proponents argue that concerns about side-effects are exaggerated, including by health workers who may wrongly attribute kidney issues to lithium. The alternatives can also carry side-effects; Wilde experienced stubborn weight gain from an antipsychotic drug. The anticonvulsant sodium valproate provides another example. According to Young, when valproate was marketed as a mood stabiliser in the 1990s, pharmaceutical companies described it as safer during pregnancy than lithium, which can increase the likelihood of a baby being born with a heart defect. \u201cThat almost certainly turned out to be erroneous, because if anything, we think valproate is worse than lithium\u201d for foetuses, Young says. But the damage had been done: \u201cWe saw a real step back in interest in terms of lithium.\u201d Because lithium is so finicky, plasma levels need to be checked with regular blood tests: initially weekly, and then every several months. Eating disorders and sudden weight loss can make lithium risky. In comparison, \u201cother drugs can be started rather cavalierly\u201d, according to Belmaker. It can take months or even years to know how well someone is responding to lithium. This depends on a certain continuity of care and flow of information between clinicians. Yet some argue that all these requirements are actually a benefit of lithium, as they make close monitoring of the patient essential. This may depend on each patient\u2019s capacity to speak up for themselves. Wilde is organised and active, so she does not mind following up on communications among her various public and private doctors, and getting blood and organ tests every few months: \u201cIt\u2019s worth the faff.\u201d However, she acknowledges that she is young and relatively healthy, and lives close to medical care. The calculus might be different for someone with health complications, mobility issues, or routines frequently disrupted by mania or depression. NHS data for medicines prescribed in England shows that in 2015/16, 51,682 patients were prescribed lithium carbonate (tablets) and 941 lithium citrate (liquid). This dwindled to 42,534 and 822 in 2023/24. Since 2014, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidelines has recommended lithium as the only first-line maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder in the UK. Lithium would have been expected to trend up based on this guidance, as UK bipolar diagnoses more than doubled between 2001 and 2018, according to a sample of electronic medical records. Instead, lithium prescribing for patients with bipolar dropped from 31% to 16%. Joseph Hayes, a psychiatry professor at University College London, co-authored the medical records study. With the overstretched state of the NHS and the scarcity of specialist bipolar clinics, \u201cwe\u2019ve set up a mental healthcare service that makes it quite difficult to initiate lithium\u201d, Hayes says. \u201cThere are clinicians who believe they can\u2019t safely prescribe it,\u201d even though in his experience lithium is distinct from other drugs in allowing some patients to thrive, not just get by. \u201cLithium is woefully under-prescribed in the UK,\u201d says Simon Kitchen, chief executive of the charity Bipolar UK. \u201cIncreasing lithium use means even more people living with bipolar will be able to stay well, keep out of hospital, get back into the workplace and live the lives they deserve.\u201d Lithium\u2019s declining use is a worldwide trend, though especially marked in North America. In North America, Europe and Australia, between 1998 and 2020, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics and antidepressants were all prescribed more often than lithium to people with bipolar disorder. Globally, the most common reason medical professionals give for not prescribing lithium is patients\u2019 negative beliefs. It\u2019s less surprising that lithium would be underused in the US \u2013 with its complicated swirl of insurance policies, medical lawsuits, and pharmaceutical advertising. On the other hand, in low- and middle-income countries, insufficient resources for monitoring lithium are especially concerning. So a niggling question is why lithium use has also dropped in countries such as the UK. Michael Gitlin, a psychiatry professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, says that while some Europeans may view Americans \u201cas like children who are distracted by shiny new drugs\u201d, the shiny new drug factor isn\u2019t limited to the US. In 2023, Gitlin, Malhi and colleagues issued a \u201ccall to arms\u201d to stem the decline of lithium therapy. Lithium\u2019s venerable status may actually be working against it. Because it has been around longer than any other drug to treat bipolar disorder, it\u2019s had longer to rack up a history of potential side-effects. Lithium has been subject to lingering stigma from the antipsychiatry movements of earlier decades and the social media-amplified stigma from the critical psychiatry movement today, according to Hayes. Some psychiatrists report that patients have formed negative impressions of lithium long before it\u2019s suggested to them as a treatment. There\u2019s another risk of complacency. Because, as Young says, bipolar is \u201csuch a highly recurrent disorder\u201d, long-term maintenance is important though sometimes underappreciated. It can be dangerous to discontinue lithium, he warns. \u201cOne of the sad situations is if someone has responded really well to lithium and then they stop it, they may not respond that well to being reintroduced. And it can be quite a rocky road to getting someone back to recovery.\u201d Some researchers report that it\u2019s becoming ever more challenging to obtain research funding for lithium. Pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to fund studies or the marketing of lithium, which will never be a big earner unless they bundle it into novel compounds. \u201cIf lithium was a new drug today and someone could make a profit from it, I think drug companies would be shouting from the rooftops about how effective it is,\u201d Hayes says.

Another possibility is that as the prescription of lithium for bipolar disorder keeps falling, interest in other applications of lithium will rise. Researchers continue to investigate its protective effects against suicide and dementia, and its supplementary use in microdoses. This has generated much excitement, though some remain concerned about the potential for overhyping lithium in new ways. These controversies remain academic for patients who will ultimately choose the least bad option for them. Since childhood, Wilde has tried to avoid medication where possible. She still recognises the limitations of any mood stabiliser: \u201cI really don\u2019t think it\u2019s just lithium that\u2019s going to keep me, or anyone really for that matter, stable.\u201d But combined with therapy, work-life balance, physical activity, medical checks and a strong support system, lithium has helped her get back to herself. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s working for me, I will stay on it.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>The incels are in charge now</h2> <p>Well that didn\u2019t take long, did it? As soon as it became clear that Donald Trump had won the election, social media saw a major spike in gleeful misogyny. And it seems Trump\u2019s army of angry incels have found a favourite new catchphrase to taunt women with: \u201cYour body, my choice.\u201d</p> <p>While the <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/your-body-my-choice\">phrase has</a> been kicking around in far-right circles for a few years, the notorious white supremacist Nick Fuentes has breathed new life into it. \u201cYour body, my choice. Forever,\u201d Fuentes tweeted late on Tuesday night, a few hours before <a href=\"https://x.com/NickJFuentes/status/1854015641218355621\">Trump officially won</a>. Shortly after that, he repeated the phrase in a live stream reacting to the results of the election, where he also said things like: \u201cWe control your bodies. Guess what, guys win again, okay. Men win again \u2026 There will never ever be a female President. It\u2019s over. Glass ceiling? It\u2019s a ceiling made of fucking bricks.\u201d</p> <p>From there, the taunt took off. Young men are <a href=\"https://x.com/RachelCharleneL/status/1854378042728022417\">now starting</a> to comment \u201cyour body, my choice\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/RachelCharleneL/status/1854383775817355518\">we own your bodies now</a>\u201d on TikTok videos posted by women. In an analysis published on Friday, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a thinktank focused on extremism, found \u201ca 4,600% increase in mentions of the terms \u2018your body, my choice\u2019 and \u2018get back in the kitchen\u2019 on X\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/02/when-trump-says-hes-going-to-protect-women-we-know-he-means-control\">When Trump says he\u2019s going to \u2018protect\u2019 women, he means \u2018control\u2019 them | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even more alarmingly, the ISD notes: \u201cThe phrase \u2018your body, my choice\u2019 appears to have made its way offline, specifically into schools. Young girls and parents have used social media to share instances of offline harassment. They include the phrase being directed at them within schools or chanted by young boys in classes.\u201d</p> <p>Various other misogynistic phrases, including calls to repeal the 19th amendment, which gave women the right to vote, have also been trending online.</p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t say that the masks are fully off now that Trump has won, because they were never exactly on to begin with. This sort of unabashed misogyny is hardly new: social media was a hotbed of bigotry long before Trump\u2019s victory. And the ubiquity of violent porn, as well as the rise of manosphere influencers like Andrew Tate \u2013 who has said women \u201cbelong\u201d to men \u2013 have had a pernicious influence on young boys. For at least the last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/02/andrew-tate-twisted-ideology-infiltrated-british-schools\">schoolteachers have been warning</a> about students imitating Tate. Boys have, for example, been trying to slip the phrase \u201cmake me a sandwich\u201d into conversations in order to belittle their peers and female teachers. That\u2019s one of Tate\u2019s favourite phrases \u2013 and he\u2019s been <a href=\"https://x.com/Cobratate/status/1854192462446653687\">posting it gleefully</a> in response to women complaining about the election.</p> <p>Still, while there was plenty of in-your-face misogyny before Trump secured a second term, his victory has clearly further emboldened bigots. Trump is a hero to many because he does whatever he likes, says whatever he likes, and seems to face no consequences for it. So it makes sense that his followers feel like they can now do the same. No need to pretend that you are anti-abortion because you care about the unborn any more. Nope, you can just be honest and say that you are anti-abortion because you want to control women.</p> <p>But what\u2019s most important here, however, is that online trolls have enormous new power now. Trump\u2019s victory was significantly enabled by Elon Musk: the patron saint of Extremely Online misogynists. And Musk will soon <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-trump-endorses-pac-administration-cabinet-connection-rcna178549\">cash in on his investment</a>. A man who jokes about impregnating <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1833728804579111268\">Taylor Swift</a>, makes endless jokes about <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2021/11/19/weeks-after-elon-musks-tits-joke-allegations-of-rampant-sexual-harassment-surface-at-tesla/\">women\u2019s breasts</a>, and who has been accused multiple times of sexual misconduct, is poised to have more influence than ever.</p> <p>Trump has also forged a strong alliance with the manosphere, spending a lot of time with rightwing male podcasters as part of his strategy to get young men to the polls. In a speech celebrating his imminent victory on Wednesday morning, Trump asked Dana White, the CEO and president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), to say a few words. In that speech, White <a href=\"https://www.jezebel.com/i-cant-believe-i-have-to-learn-who-these-people-are\">gave a shout-out</a> to manosphere influencers who helped propel Trump to victory: \u201cI want to thank the Nelk Boys, Adin Ross, Theo Von, Bussin\u2019 With the Boys, and last but not least, the mighty and powerful Joe Rogan.\u201d</p> <p>Will the likes of Adin Ross, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/06/trump-adin-ross-tesla-rolex\">controversial podcaster</a> known for crude jokes and bigoted comments, get an official position in the Trump cabinet now? Who knows. One thing I can tell you is that misogynistic online edgelords aren\u2019t in any way out on the fringes any more. They have a direct line to the incoming president\u2019s ear.</p> <h2>The US will have two Black female senators for the first time</h2> <p>There has never been more than one Black woman in the Senate at a time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/05/election-black-women-senate-maryland-delaware\">That\u2019s now changing:</a> Delaware\u2019s Lisa Blunt Rochester and Maryland\u2019s Angela Alsobrooks both won Senate seats on Tuesday.

      "bodyText": "The incels are in charge now Well that didn\u2019t take long, did it? As soon as it became clear that Donald Trump had won the election, social media saw a major spike in gleeful misogyny. And it seems Trump\u2019s army of angry incels have found a favourite new catchphrase to taunt women with: \u201cYour body, my choice.\u201d While the phrase has been kicking around in far-right circles for a few years, the notorious white supremacist Nick Fuentes has breathed new life into it. \u201cYour body, my choice. Forever,\u201d Fuentes tweeted late on Tuesday night, a few hours before Trump officially won. Shortly after that, he repeated the phrase in a live stream reacting to the results of the election, where he also said things like: \u201cWe control your bodies. Guess what, guys win again, okay. Men win again \u2026 There will never ever be a female President. It\u2019s over. Glass ceiling? It\u2019s a ceiling made of fucking bricks.\u201d From there, the taunt took off. Young men are now starting to comment \u201cyour body, my choice\u201d and \u201cwe own your bodies now\u201d on TikTok videos posted by women. In an analysis published on Friday, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a thinktank focused on extremism, found \u201ca 4,600% increase in mentions of the terms \u2018your body, my choice\u2019 and \u2018get back in the kitchen\u2019 on X\u201d. Even more alarmingly, the ISD notes: \u201cThe phrase \u2018your body, my choice\u2019 appears to have made its way offline, specifically into schools. Young girls and parents have used social media to share instances of offline harassment. They include the phrase being directed at them within schools or chanted by young boys in classes.\u201d Various other misogynistic phrases, including calls to repeal the 19th amendment, which gave women the right to vote, have also been trending online. I wouldn\u2019t say that the masks are fully off now that Trump has won, because they were never exactly on to begin with. This sort of unabashed misogyny is hardly new: social media was a hotbed of bigotry long before Trump\u2019s victory. And the ubiquity of violent porn, as well as the rise of manosphere influencers like Andrew Tate \u2013 who has said women \u201cbelong\u201d to men \u2013 have had a pernicious influence on young boys. For at least the last year, schoolteachers have been warning about students imitating Tate. Boys have, for example, been trying to slip the phrase \u201cmake me a sandwich\u201d into conversations in order to belittle their peers and female teachers. That\u2019s one of Tate\u2019s favourite phrases \u2013 and he\u2019s been posting it gleefully in response to women complaining about the election. Still, while there was plenty of in-your-face misogyny before Trump secured a second term, his victory has clearly further emboldened bigots. Trump is a hero to many because he does whatever he likes, says whatever he likes, and seems to face no consequences for it. So it makes sense that his followers feel like they can now do the same. No need to pretend that you are anti-abortion because you care about the unborn any more. Nope, you can just be honest and say that you are anti-abortion because you want to control women. But what\u2019s most important here, however, is that online trolls have enormous new power now. Trump\u2019s victory was significantly enabled by Elon Musk: the patron saint of Extremely Online misogynists. And Musk will soon cash in on his investment. A man who jokes about impregnating Taylor Swift, makes endless jokes about women\u2019s breasts, and who has been accused multiple times of sexual misconduct, is poised to have more influence than ever. Trump has also forged a strong alliance with the manosphere, spending a lot of time with rightwing male podcasters as part of his strategy to get young men to the polls. In a speech celebrating his imminent victory on Wednesday morning, Trump asked Dana White, the CEO and president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), to say a few words. In that speech, White gave a shout-out to manosphere influencers who helped propel Trump to victory: \u201cI want to thank the Nelk Boys, Adin Ross, Theo Von, Bussin\u2019 With the Boys, and last but not least, the mighty and powerful Joe Rogan.\u201d Will the likes of Adin Ross, a controversial podcaster known for crude jokes and bigoted comments, get an official position in the Trump cabinet now? Who knows. One thing I can tell you is that misogynistic online edgelords aren\u2019t in any way out on the fringes any more. They have a direct line to the incoming president\u2019s ear. The US will have two Black female senators for the first time There has never been more than one Black woman in the Senate at a time. That\u2019s now changing: Delaware\u2019s Lisa Blunt Rochester and Maryland\u2019s Angela Alsobrooks both won Senate seats on Tuesday. In another first, Delaware\u2019s Sarah McBride will be the first trans person to serve in the US House of Representatives. Americans are stockpiling abortion pills and emergency contraception No prizes for guessing why. RFK Jr is working with a group that wants to stop \u2018evil\u2019 and \u2018immoral\u2019 IVF Former presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr, who is famous for his strong anti-vaxxer views, having a worm eat part of his brain, and once dumping a dead bear in Central Park, will probably play a key role in a new Trump administration. The incoming president has previously said he thinks Kennedy should \u201chave a big role in healthcare\u201d. This is worrying for many reasons, not least because he recently starred in an ad for CatholicVote, a conservative organisation that is extremely anti-IVF. Nearly 70% of verified deaths in Gaza are women and children, the UN says The UN said the figures indicated \u201ca systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law\u201d. Children aged five to nine represent the single biggest age category when it comes to the dead. While all this is enraging, it is important to note that what this sort of framing leaves out is that many of the men who have been killed in what many experts have stated is a genocide are innocent civilians as well. The week in pawtriarchy Tickets, money, passports \u2026 raccoon? Passengers flying from New York\u2019s LaGuardia airport this week were startled when a raccoon fell through a terminal ceiling and then proceeded to scamper frantically through the terminal.

The commission has a number of disciplinary actions it can take against venues for repeated self-exclusion program breaches, including cancellation or suspension of the venue operator\u2019s licence and heavy fines. Despite that, the VGCCC told Guardian Australia no disciplinary action has ever been taken against any non-casino venue operator for letting excluded patrons into their gaming areas. While the VGCCC fined the casino Crown Melbourne $2m in October for allowing 242 people who had self-excluded from gambling to place bets over an eight-month period, no such action has been taken against Victoria\u2019s 486 clubs and hotels which between them house more than 27,300 poker machines. Poker machine losses in Victoria reached more than $3bn in 2022-23. A spokesperson for Victoria\u2019s Department of Justice and Community Safety said a review into self-exclusion is under way. \u201cFurther consultation with gambling harm experts, hotels and clubs is required to finalise the review and what can be improved,\u201d the spokesperson said. Because venue self-exclusion list data is held by Community Clubs Victoria (CCV) and the Australian Hotels Association (AHA) Victoria \u2013 which also run the self-exclusion program \u2013 the government has no data about the number of people on the exclusion list or the number of breaches reported by venues. Neither AHA Victoria nor CCV responded to requests for comment from Guardian Australia. While the venue keeps any money lost by an excluded patron, it doesn\u2019t have to pay out any winnings to someone on the exclusion list. Hughes says she is frustrated by the barriers those harmed by gambling continue to face even once they ask for help. A person harmed by gambling who self-excludes has to list the name and address of each of the 486 venues they wish to be excluded from.

There are few other legal products that have such recognised potential to cause harm that they have self-exclusion mechanisms, she says. \u201cWe need to be doing more to hold the gambling industry accountable for their role in causing harm to communities and we need to ensure that people aren\u2019t encouraged to gamble everywhere they look including through advertising and the availability of poker machines in the community.\u201d When Guardian Australia called the exclusion line numbers listed for the AHA Victoria and CCV on Melbourne Cup day, both went through to voicemail.

They\u2019re suffering, and the government and the venues know it.\u201d Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com",

Sarah McGreevy, 37, died on 16 June after climbing on to a wooden box on the balcony to manually unblock the pipe, a common practice among residents of the fifth and sixth floors of the building after heavy rainfall, according to the coroner\u2019s report. McGreevy, who was described as a \u201ctreasured daughter\u201d and a \u201cloving sister\u201d by her family, was renting a flat in a building owned by the London borough of Hackney. After her landlord, the leaseholder of the flat, told the coroner no repairs had been carried out on the building\u2019s drainpipes or guttering since McGreevy\u2019s death, the coroner, Sarah Bourke, warned Hackney council, the freeholder of the premises, that there was a risk of future deaths unless action was taken. She told the east London borough to respond to the findings of her report by 1 January. \u201cIn my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action,\u201d the coroner wrote to the operations director of the Hackney council\u2019s tenancy and homeowner services. \u201cPhotographs taken of Ms McGreevy\u2019s hands following her death show dirt around her fingernails consistent with undertaking a cleaning task. I found that it was more likely than not that Ms McGreevy had climbed on to the wooden box to clear the pipe and had accidentally fallen over the balcony,\u201d she wrote. Police officers who attended the scene found the wooden box on the balcony and noted that McGreevy\u2019s mobile phone was on a window ledge, close to a downwards drainpipe. The pipe came from the floor of the balcony above her two-bed flat before diverting down the exterior wall, and had previously been repaired using heavy duty tape. The inquest concluded that \u201cit was more likely than not\u201d that McGreevy had climbed on to the wooden box to clear the pipe and had accidentally fallen over the balcony, sustaining fatal injuries due to the height of her fall. Police were told that other residents had been having problems with the guttering and drainpipes in the block and were unblocking the pipes themselves, a practice that the coroner said carried a clear risk of falling. Yet months after McGreevy\u2019s death, no work has been undertaken by the Labour-run council to unblock the guttering or the drainpipes, Bourke\u2019s report revealed. \u201cIn the absence of remedial works, the practice of residents unblocking pipes themselves is likely to continue,\u201d the coroner warned. A spokesperson for the council said: \u201cThis is a tragic case and our thoughts are with the friends and family of Sarah McGreevy. \u201cThe coroner has detailed a number of issues for us to consider in her Prevention of Future Deaths report. \u201cWe do not expect anyone living in a Hackney council home to clean their own guttering and like the coroner we want to ensure an incident like this doesn\u2019t happen again.

      "bodyText": "A crash between two doubledecker buses in Manchester has left 17 people needing hospital treatment. The buses collided near the junction of Rochdale Road and Livesey Street, in the north of the city centre at 8.34am on Saturday. A spokesperson for North West ambulance service said: \u201cNine ambulances, an air ambulance, two response vehicles, an advanced paramedic and an operational commander attended the scene. \u201cSeventeen patients were taken to hospitals across Manchester, including seven on a bus accompanied by a paramedic. No one suffered serious injuries.\u201d Greater Manchester fire and rescue service had to rescue one passenger from the upper deck of one of the buses, and were at the scene for just over an hour. Witnesses described a scene of carnage, with sections of two Bee Network buses reduced to twisted metal, and glass and debris littering the road. Harry Yearsley, who lives next to the crash site, told the Manchester Evening News (MEN) he and his partner felt terrified when they were woken by \u201cthe biggest bang we\u2019d ever heard\u201d. \u201cWe woke up and said to each other: \u2018What is that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew it was something bad.\u201d Within five minutes they heard the air ambulance arriving. According to witnesses, the impact of the collision forced one of the vehicles sideways and off the road. Photos taken at the scene shortly after the collision showed passengers attempting to free themselves from the wreckage. Road closures were temporarily put in place but the road was cleared by the emergency services and reopened by the police shortly before midday. Transport for Greater Manchester\u2019s director of buses, Stephen Rhodes, told the MEN: \u201cThis morning, at around 8.30am there was a collision involving two Bee Network buses in Manchester near the junction of Rochdale Road and Livesey Street. We are liaising with emergency services and want to wish any passengers who have been injured a speedy recovery.\u201d",

In childhood you may thrill to the murky tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, or of Hansel and Gretel. George Benjamin and his librettist, Martin Crimp, distilled the rat-catcher legend in their decidedly adult first opera, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5c-JScVAAU\">Into the Little Hill</a></em> (2006). Engelbert Humperdinck\u2019s operatic version of the children lost in the woods \u2013 on at the Royal Academy of Music in London <a href=\"https://www.ram.ac.uk/whats-on/h%C3%A4nsel-und-gretel\">next week</a> and the Royal Opera House <a href=\"https://www.rbo.org.uk/tickets-and-events/hansel-and-gretel-details\">next month</a> \u2013 has become a seasonal favourite, sweetened by a short-lived witch and gingerbread children. For <strong><a href=\"https://musicintheround.co.uk/events/the-monster-in-the-maze/\">The Monster in the Maze</a></strong>, Jonathan Dove (and his regular librettist, Alasdair Middleton) went further back: to ancient Greek myth, tyrannical King Minos of Crete, and the Minotaur who lives in a labyrinth and feeds on young human flesh.</p> <p>Premiered in Berlin in 2015 by Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic, with follow-up performances in London and Aix-en-Provence, this opera \u201cfor children, young people and adults\u201d was a centrepiece of Sheffield\u2019s <a href=\"https://musicintheround.co.uk/whats-on/\">Music in the Round</a> celebrations last weekend. For 40 years, this wide-ranging concert series, based at the Crucible theatre, has served the city, presenting musical events for all ages, with partnerships around the country, top soloists and a resident instrumental group, <a href=\"https://ensemble360.co.uk/about/\">Ensemble 360</a>.</p> <p>This was the first performance of <em>Monster</em> in a new arrangement by Dove and music director John Lyon. Upper strings, absent in the original, have been added, enabling students of <a href=\"https://www.sheffieldmusichub.org/\">Sheffield Music Hub</a> to play alongside the professional members of 360 and the <a href=\"https://www.consonequartet.com/\">Consone Quartet</a>. Three singers \u2013 Anthony Flaum, Camille Maalawy, Robert Gildon \u2013 and an actor (Paul Hawkyard) took the named roles, with community choruses grouped either side of the central arena or on the stage itself, carrying the story and belting out Dove\u2019s persuasive melodies and intricate cross rhythms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The hero of the hour is Theseus \u2013 part Wagner\u2019s Siegfried, part Barbie\u2019s Ken</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>No one matches the composer in his gift for creating a powerful drama \u2013 here involving 140 people, primary school age to retired \u2013 with epic sweep and affecting human drama. Parents sing of the loss of their children, rounded up and shipped off to satisfy the Minotaur\u2019s appetite. Tiny children lament the disappearance of their older siblings. Several young singers had short solos. Crisply orchestrated, with vivid use of percussion \u2013 glockenspiel, tubular bells, threatening bass drum \u2013 the work romps along, holding back the arrival of the monster, the one thing we\u2019re all desperate to see.</p> <p>First heard only as a tuba-heavy roar of brass, played by a raucous \u201cMinotaur band\u201d in the gallery, the worm-like man-beast was deliciously creepy when he finally appeared through two different entrances simultaneously. The hero of the hour is Theseus \u2013 part Wagner\u2019s Siegfried, part Barbie\u2019s Ken \u2013 who wore an orange fluorescent shell suit, waved a sword as twinkly as a Christmas tree and knew no fear. The final chorus, these music-makers of Sheffield singing and playing their hearts out, was expansive and stirring.</p> <p>No one can say putting two of the world\u2019s top-selling pianists on the same stage can ever be a bad idea: how often does the Royal Festival Hall have to lay on extra seats to accommodate a capacity audience for a classical concert? All to the good: everyone present paid closest attention to <strong><a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/vikingur-olafsson-yuja-wang-two-pianos/\">Yuja Wang and V\u00edkingur \u00d3lafsson</a></strong> in their two-piano recital \u2013 from Luciano Berio to John Adams to Sergei Rachmaninov \u2013 which is part of a world tour. One wore a short, sparkly tube, the other a Gilbert and George-style green suit and tie. Their playing styles could hardly be more different, Wang achieving glittering iridescence even in her softest playing, \u00d3lafsson drawing on infinite reserves of grace, mystery and profundity.</p>    <p>They sat side by side, with the pianos facing away from each other. On occasion, \u00d3lafsson swung round and gestured emphatically to mark a general pause bar, or a final chord. Other times unanimity seemed not to be the point, especially in Schubert\u2019s Fantasia in F minor, D940, where instead of four hands, two pianos, fusing as one, each player retained a determined independence and conspicuously went their own way. Wang\u2019s fiery enthusiasm for speed was always generously accommodated by \u00d3lafsson: she propelled Rachmaninov\u2019s <em>Symphonic Dances</em> with the kind of throttle the composer, himself a lover of speedboats and fast cars, might have appreciated. The whole event was richly entertaining, and ecstatically received by the crowd. I\u2019m a fan of both these pianists. Singly is excitement enough. I had to beat a retreat, ears ringing, after three encores with more in the offing.</p>    <p>If you haven\u2019t encountered English National Opera\u2019s Little Italy-style <strong><a href=\"https://www.eno.org/whats-on/rigoletto/\">Rigoletto</a></strong> \u2013 the oldest established box-office crap game at the Coliseum \u2013 now\u2019s the time. First seen in 1982 \u2013 designs by Patrick Robertson and Rosemary Vercoe, translation by James Fenton \u2013 this revival of Jonathan Miller\u2019s production is superbly conducted by Richard Farnes, with top orchestral playing and expert male chorus. The cast isn\u2019t stellar but benefits from a strongly sung, sympathetic Rigoletto (Weston Hurt); a Duke with gleaming high notes, even if his English needs more honing (Yongzhao Yu); and a Gilda with deft, spot-on coloratura (Robyn Allegra Parton). Recreating a cinematic 1950s New York, with sharp suits, a touch of Edward Hopper and a jukebox for the duplicitous Duke, it remains the best updating of any opera.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)<br>The Monster in the Maze </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<em><br>Yuja Wang and V\u00edkingur \u00d3lafsson </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<em><br>Rigoletto </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.eno.org/whats-on/rigoletto/\">Rigoletto</a></em><a href=\"https://www.eno.org/whats-on/rigoletto/\"> is at the Coliseum, London, until 21 November</a></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The further you get from infancy, the more chilling any story about missing children becomes. Think Boko Haram. Think Gaza. Think Ukraine. In childhood you may thrill to the murky tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, or of Hansel and Gretel. George Benjamin and his librettist, Martin Crimp, distilled the rat-catcher legend in their decidedly adult first opera, Into the Little Hill (2006). Engelbert Humperdinck\u2019s operatic version of the children lost in the woods \u2013 on at the Royal Academy of Music in London next week and the Royal Opera House next month \u2013 has become a seasonal favourite, sweetened by a short-lived witch and gingerbread children. For The Monster in the Maze, Jonathan Dove (and his regular librettist, Alasdair Middleton) went further back: to ancient Greek myth, tyrannical King Minos of Crete, and the Minotaur who lives in a labyrinth and feeds on young human flesh. Premiered in Berlin in 2015 by Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic, with follow-up performances in London and Aix-en-Provence, this opera \u201cfor children, young people and adults\u201d was a centrepiece of Sheffield\u2019s Music in the Round celebrations last weekend. For 40 years, this wide-ranging concert series, based at the Crucible theatre, has served the city, presenting musical events for all ages, with partnerships around the country, top soloists and a resident instrumental group, Ensemble 360. This was the first performance of Monster in a new arrangement by Dove and music director John Lyon. Upper strings, absent in the original, have been added, enabling students of Sheffield Music Hub to play alongside the professional members of 360 and the Consone Quartet. Three singers \u2013 Anthony Flaum, Camille Maalawy, Robert Gildon \u2013 and an actor (Paul Hawkyard) took the named roles, with community choruses grouped either side of the central arena or on the stage itself, carrying the story and belting out Dove\u2019s persuasive melodies and intricate cross rhythms. No one matches the composer in his gift for creating a powerful drama \u2013 here involving 140 people, primary school age to retired \u2013 with epic sweep and affecting human drama. Parents sing of the loss of their children, rounded up and shipped off to satisfy the Minotaur\u2019s appetite. Tiny children lament the disappearance of their older siblings. Several young singers had short solos. Crisply orchestrated, with vivid use of percussion \u2013 glockenspiel, tubular bells, threatening bass drum \u2013 the work romps along, holding back the arrival of the monster, the one thing we\u2019re all desperate to see. First heard only as a tuba-heavy roar of brass, played by a raucous \u201cMinotaur band\u201d in the gallery, the worm-like man-beast was deliciously creepy when he finally appeared through two different entrances simultaneously. The hero of the hour is Theseus \u2013 part Wagner\u2019s Siegfried, part Barbie\u2019s Ken \u2013 who wore an orange fluorescent shell suit, waved a sword as twinkly as a Christmas tree and knew no fear. The final chorus, these music-makers of Sheffield singing and playing their hearts out, was expansive and stirring. No one can say putting two of the world\u2019s top-selling pianists on the same stage can ever be a bad idea: how often does the Royal Festival Hall have to lay on extra seats to accommodate a capacity audience for a classical concert? All to the good: everyone present paid closest attention to Yuja Wang and V\u00edkingur \u00d3lafsson in their two-piano recital \u2013 from Luciano Berio to John Adams to Sergei Rachmaninov \u2013 which is part of a world tour. One wore a short, sparkly tube, the other a Gilbert and George-style green suit and tie. Their playing styles could hardly be more different, Wang achieving glittering iridescence even in her softest playing, \u00d3lafsson drawing on infinite reserves of grace, mystery and profundity. They sat side by side, with the pianos facing away from each other. On occasion, \u00d3lafsson swung round and gestured emphatically to mark a general pause bar, or a final chord. Other times unanimity seemed not to be the point, especially in Schubert\u2019s Fantasia in F minor, D940, where instead of four hands, two pianos, fusing as one, each player retained a determined independence and conspicuously went their own way. Wang\u2019s fiery enthusiasm for speed was always generously accommodated by \u00d3lafsson: she propelled Rachmaninov\u2019s Symphonic Dances with the kind of throttle the composer, himself a lover of speedboats and fast cars, might have appreciated. The whole event was richly entertaining, and ecstatically received by the crowd. I\u2019m a fan of both these pianists. Singly is excitement enough. I had to beat a retreat, ears ringing, after three encores with more in the offing. If you haven\u2019t encountered English National Opera\u2019s Little Italy-style Rigoletto \u2013 the oldest established box-office crap game at the Coliseum \u2013 now\u2019s the time. First seen in 1982 \u2013 designs by Patrick Robertson and Rosemary Vercoe, translation by James Fenton \u2013 this revival of Jonathan Miller\u2019s production is superbly conducted by Richard Farnes, with top orchestral playing and expert male chorus. The cast isn\u2019t stellar but benefits from a strongly sung, sympathetic Rigoletto (Weston Hurt); a Duke with gleaming high notes, even if his English needs more honing (Yongzhao Yu); and a Gilda with deft, spot-on coloratura (Robyn Allegra Parton). Recreating a cinematic 1950s New York, with sharp suits, a touch of Edward Hopper and a jukebox for the duplicitous Duke, it remains the best updating of any opera.

The era of global warming has ended, he has argued and \u201cthe era of global boiling has arrived.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Tipping over</strong></h2> <p>Alarm over Earth\u2019s climate is based, in part, on researchers\u2019 warning that the 1.5C rise in global temperatures \u2013 which the climate negotiators had hoped to avoid \u2013 is likely to be breached over multiple years by the end of the decade, while many other climate researchers fear that holding the heat down below a 2C rise is likely to prove impossible as well.</p> <p>In such a scenario, major tipping points are likely to be passed. These will include the destabilisation of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, the abrupt thawing of the world\u2019s permafrost regions, the collapse of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/09/atlantic-ocean-circulation-nearing-devastating-tipping-point-study-finds\">North Atlantic Ocean Circulation</a>, and the massive die-off of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coral\">tropical coral reefs</a>. Widespread flooding will ensue and temperatures will continue to rise, while deadly droughts and storms will increase in frequency.

A new finance goal to help developing nations create green energy systems and to help them adapt to a warming world is high on the agenda over the next fortnight\u2019s negotiations.</p> <p>The sums of money involved are eye-watering. Most estimates suggest that developing countries will need an additional $500bn to $1 trillion per year in climate finance from international sources. That\u2019s at least five times as much as the $100bn commitment that is currently in place.</p> <p>Much of this money would come from companies and private investors as well as the multilateral development banks and would be spent on protecting threatened landscapes, creating energy sources suitable for developing countries, adapting infrastructure to be more resilient to a changing climate, and paying for the damage that a nation has suffered from global warming that has been triggered by emissions generated by developed countries.</p> <h2><strong>Gaslight</strong></h2> <p>It remains to be seen how far these plans will progress at Baku over the next two weeks. Hopes of breakthroughs \u2013 already at a low level \u2013 have been further depressed by the disclosure that a senior official in Azerbaijan\u2019s Cop29 team, Elnur Soltanov, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/08/cop29-ceo-filmed-agreeing-to-facilitate-fossil-fuel-deals-at-climate-summit\">was filmed discussing \u201cinvestment opportunities\u201d</a> in the country\u2019s state oil and gas company with a man posing as a potential investor. \u201cWe have a lot of gas fields that are to be developed,\u201d he says. These remarks have gone down badly with many delegates.</p> <h2><strong>Stepping stone</strong></h2> <p>There remains some prospect of success at Baku, however. \u201cWe should look at the meeting in Baku as a stepping stone for Cop30 in Brazil,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/stern\">Lord Stern</a>, chairman of the Grantham Research Institute. \u201cSuccessful Cop meetings often come in pairs and hopefully this will be an example,\u201d he said last week. \u201cI would be cautious about specific agreements and outcomes but I am hoping we can get at least some framework for climate finance which could be finalised \u200ba\u200bt Cop30.\u201d</p>    <p>Next year, at Bel\u00e9m on the Amazon, countries must arrive with fresh national plans \u2013 known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) \u2013 enforcing more stringent cuts to greenhouse gas emissions than they have yet promised. These must be in line with the globally accepted aim of limiting global temperature rises. A strong agreement in Baku on finance for developing countries would encourage higher ambitions.</p> <h2><strong>Running out of time</strong></h2> <p>The problem is that the world is running out of time, a point stressed by Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. \u201cWith Trump\u2019s win, we now face, at best, a repeat of his last term\u2019s climate inaction \u2013 a four-year pause we simply can\u2019t afford in this critical decade.\u201d</p> <p>However, a more optimistic take on the situation was provided by Stern. \u201cI was in Marrakech for the Cop22 summit in 2016 when the news came in that Trump had won the election,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cWe knew what that meant, but it was remarkable how strong was the resolve among delegates that we keep going.

Chelsea\u2019s third, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2024/oct/22/five-star-chelsea-fa-kay-cossington-womens-football-weekly-podcast\">a thrilling 5-2 defeat of Spurs</a>, was the Women\u2019s Super League\u2019s goal of the month for October.</p> <p>\u201cA few months ago, that wouldn\u2019t have been as normal for me as it is now,\u201d says Rytting Kaneryd, sitting by Chelsea\u2019s indoor 3G pitch before they travel north to play Liverpool on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s something I can add to my game: to be more direct, be in the right space at the right moment, and be at the back post more. The coaches have been very clear with me that this is an area I can work on.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/08/forcing-arsenal-women-out-emirates-stadium-wasted-opportunity-fixture-clash-men-champions-league\">Forcing Arsenal\u2019s women out of the Emirates is a horribly wasted opportunity | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What made her take on the chance? Confidence plays a big part. The goal against Tottenham was not her first to turn heads this season. It was the 27-year-old\u2019s first-half goal in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/20/chelsea-aston-villa-wsl-match-report\">1-0 victory over Aston Villa</a> to kickstart their campaign that set the tone for her strong start to the season. That goal, where the forward cut on to her left before lashing in the ball, was also something she had been told to work on.</p> <p>\u201cIn the first meeting I had with Sonia [Bompastor] and Cami [assistant coach Camille Abily], they were very clear: you have to use your left foot more. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve been working on. It\u2019s not something that just came to me, there\u2019s been a lot of hard work behind it. There was a session before the Aston Villa game, I was doing repetitions just with my left and I had a good feeling coming into the game.\u201d</p> <p>After the goal celebrations had ceased, Rytting Kaneryd looked over to Abily: \u201cIt was fun to give Cami a look afterwards that said: \u2018Yeah, I get it, it\u2019s actually working.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be a predictable player. That\u2019s my nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>That instant gratification at all the extra training paying off was hugely important, filling the forward with confidence and cementing her relationship with the new coaches. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to have the coaches backing you, it helps you feel very, very confident in the moment,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m just happy at the moment, and that just makes playing \u2026 easier.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018Last year was a big learning year for me \u2026 I\u2019m not a different player, Jojo 2.0 maybe\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Johanna Rytting Kaneryd</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her form is not a surprise to her. \u201cLast year was a big learning year for me and I feel like this year, I was very clear from the beginning of the season what I wanted to do on the pitch. That was to be more direct, score more goals and get more assists. I\u2019m not a different player, but a Jojo 2.0 maybe.\u201d</p> <p>The desire for instant results has meant her journey hasn\u2019t always been easy. Emma Hayes, who has since moved on to manage the US women\u2019s team, explained that when the player arrived at Chelsea, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t happy about it in the moment\u201d, says the Swede.</p>    <p>\u201cI hate to say it, but she was right. It takes a year to actually settle in at a club like Chelsea and learn everything,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt was a big, big step from what I was used to in Sweden. The first year I wouldn\u2019t say I was struggling, but mentally it was hard, because I\u2019m not a person that has a lot of patience. I really want everything to come quickly.\u201d</p> <p>The development of Rytting Kaneryd should not be a surprise to anyone. She grew up in Kolsva, which has a population of less than 3,000, 97 miles west of Stockholm, used to play football with her twin brother and was coached by her father. At 12 she was playing senior women\u2019s football. \u201cIt was division two,\u201d she says. \u201cI was playing with friends of my mum, which is insane when you think about it. I was a kid. But I learned a lot from that, and it was a test physically. I\u2019ve always been a pretty quick player, so I managed to avoid most physical duels.\u201d</p> <p>At 15 Rytting Kaneryd moved to Stockholm\u2019s Tyres\u00f6, and it was a culture shock. \u201cI\u2019ve always been very clear with what I want and I\u2019m just happy that I had my family supporting me and letting me leave at 15 years old, but it was a challenge too, there were a lot of nights calling my dad crying.\u201d</p> <p>There was a lot to learn at Tyres\u00f6, though, with the Brazil great Marta, the US international Christen Press and the Sweden legend Caroline Seger all in the team. At 17, Rytting Kaneryd was an unused substitute in the 4-3 defeat by Wolfsburg in the 2014 Champions League final. \u201cWhen I think about it now, it\u2019s pretty insane,\u201d she says. \u201cOf course Marta is one of those players I\u2019ve always looked up to. Being able to play with her and see her on a daily basis is something I\u2019m very, very, very thankful for.

      "bodyText": "When Millie Bright\u2019s diagonal ball floated towards the far post, Johanna Rytting Kaneryd was ready and waiting, right place, right time, to send a sumptuous volley past the Tottenham goalkeeper Becky Spencer. Chelsea\u2019s third, in a thrilling 5-2 defeat of Spurs, was the Women\u2019s Super League\u2019s goal of the month for October. \u201cA few months ago, that wouldn\u2019t have been as normal for me as it is now,\u201d says Rytting Kaneryd, sitting by Chelsea\u2019s indoor 3G pitch before they travel north to play Liverpool on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s something I can add to my game: to be more direct, be in the right space at the right moment, and be at the back post more. The coaches have been very clear with me that this is an area I can work on.\u201d What made her take on the chance? Confidence plays a big part. The goal against Tottenham was not her first to turn heads this season. It was the 27-year-old\u2019s first-half goal in a 1-0 victory over Aston Villa to kickstart their campaign that set the tone for her strong start to the season. That goal, where the forward cut on to her left before lashing in the ball, was also something she had been told to work on. \u201cIn the first meeting I had with Sonia [Bompastor] and Cami [assistant coach Camille Abily], they were very clear: you have to use your left foot more. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve been working on. It\u2019s not something that just came to me, there\u2019s been a lot of hard work behind it. There was a session before the Aston Villa game, I was doing repetitions just with my left and I had a good feeling coming into the game.\u201d After the goal celebrations had ceased, Rytting Kaneryd looked over to Abily: \u201cIt was fun to give Cami a look afterwards that said: \u2018Yeah, I get it, it\u2019s actually working.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be a predictable player. That\u2019s my nightmare.\u201d That instant gratification at all the extra training paying off was hugely important, filling the forward with confidence and cementing her relationship with the new coaches. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to have the coaches backing you, it helps you feel very, very confident in the moment,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m just happy at the moment, and that just makes playing \u2026 easier.\u201d Her form is not a surprise to her. \u201cLast year was a big learning year for me and I feel like this year, I was very clear from the beginning of the season what I wanted to do on the pitch. That was to be more direct, score more goals and get more assists. I\u2019m not a different player, but a Jojo 2.0 maybe.\u201d The desire for instant results has meant her journey hasn\u2019t always been easy. Emma Hayes, who has since moved on to manage the US women\u2019s team, explained that when the player arrived at Chelsea, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t happy about it in the moment\u201d, says the Swede. \u201cI hate to say it, but she was right. It takes a year to actually settle in at a club like Chelsea and learn everything,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt was a big, big step from what I was used to in Sweden. The first year I wouldn\u2019t say I was struggling, but mentally it was hard, because I\u2019m not a person that has a lot of patience. I really want everything to come quickly.\u201d The development of Rytting Kaneryd should not be a surprise to anyone. She grew up in Kolsva, which has a population of less than 3,000, 97 miles west of Stockholm, used to play football with her twin brother and was coached by her father. At 12 she was playing senior women\u2019s football. \u201cIt was division two,\u201d she says. \u201cI was playing with friends of my mum, which is insane when you think about it. I was a kid. But I learned a lot from that, and it was a test physically. I\u2019ve always been a pretty quick player, so I managed to avoid most physical duels.\u201d At 15 Rytting Kaneryd moved to Stockholm\u2019s Tyres\u00f6, and it was a culture shock. \u201cI\u2019ve always been very clear with what I want and I\u2019m just happy that I had my family supporting me and letting me leave at 15 years old, but it was a challenge too, there were a lot of nights calling my dad crying.\u201d There was a lot to learn at Tyres\u00f6, though, with the Brazil great Marta, the US international Christen Press and the Sweden legend Caroline Seger all in the team. At 17, Rytting Kaneryd was an unused substitute in the 4-3 defeat by Wolfsburg in the 2014 Champions League final. \u201cWhen I think about it now, it\u2019s pretty insane,\u201d she says. \u201cOf course Marta is one of those players I\u2019ve always looked up to. Being able to play with her and see her on a daily basis is something I\u2019m very, very, very thankful for. Even though I was young, didn\u2019t feel especially confident and I was struggling mentally at times, I learned a lot about what you need to be at the absolutely top level.\u201d This season Chelsea have seven wins from seven games across the league and Champions League. Despite a new manager, changes to coaching personnel and a number of incoming players, that is formidable form. They have scored 20 goals in five league games with 13 different goalscorers. For context, Manchester City and Tottenham are next in line having scored 12 each across six games played. It feels like something special is happening and the trophy that has eluded them to date, the Champions League, is not an unrealistic aim. \u201cIf there is any time we should win, it is this year,\u201d says Rytting Kaneryd. \u201cThe squad is incredible.

That\u2019s what we\u2019re all getting right at the moment and that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting right at the moment.\u201d Now, the Blues have a big few weeks ahead that could cement their multiple title credentials. After Liverpool on Sunday, they travel to Celtic in the Champions League before back-to-back games at Stamford Bridge, against title rivals Manchester City and Celtic in the reverse Champions League fixture, and then host Manchester United at Kingsmeadow. Stamford Bridge feels like home now. \u201cThe more games we can play, the better,\u201d Rytting Kaneryd says. \u201cHopefully, the fans show up and we can really put on a show for them.

In less than five months, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO had gone from not endorsing a candidate to becoming a fixture of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/18/elon-musk-trump-election-influence\">the president-elect\u2019s inner circle</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe future is gonna be so \ud83d\udd25 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8,\u201d Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1854026234339938528\">posted</a> to his social media platform, X, just after midnight, along with a photo of himself leaning over to talk with Trump at the Mar-a-Lago dinner.</p> <p>Musk\u2019s place at the head table was the result of months of political efforts by the world\u2019s richest man, and an injection of at least $130m of his own money.

But unlike some of his peers, who preferred operating in the shadows, shielded by Super Pacs and meetings behind closed doors, he became Trump\u2019s most visible surrogate. As so often with his endeavors, Musk was all in. And now, gambling on becoming one of Trump\u2019s most vocal and deep-pocketed supporters has won Musk direct influence and access to the nation\u2019s highest office, making him not only the world\u2019s richest man but also one of its most politically powerful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/06/how-elon-musk-stands-to-benefit-from-trump-presidency\">How Trump\u2019s \u2018new star\u2019 Elon Musk stands to benefit from his presidency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Musk\u2019s exact role in the coming administration is still unclear. Trump has previously said that the CEO would lead a full audit of the federal government, and make drastic reforms as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/23/what-does-elon-musk-want-us-elections\">secretary of cost-cutting</a>\u201d. Any such position would create immense conflicts of interest, as Musk\u2019s companies hold billions in contracts with the government and are also facing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/05/elon-musk-investigation-securities-fraud-twitter-takeover\">investigations</a> from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/05/neuralink-animal-testing-elon-musk-investigation\">federal agencies</a>. Under Trump, who has long opposed regulators and ignored ethical conflicts, that may not matter. Musk\u2019s fortune <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/07/trump-victory-adds-record-wealth-richest-top-10\">soared by $26bn</a> just two days after the election.</p> <p>Beyond any potential formal government role, Musk has also ingratiated himself as a close ally of the president-elect \u2013 who adopted some of Musk\u2019s policy suggestions during the campaign and praised him as a \u201csuper genius\u201d during his victory speech. He reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/08/elon-musk-trump-ukraine-call-zelenskyy\">joined</a> Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Wednesday, signaling broad influence.</p> <p>That same day, Trump\u2019s granddaughter posted a family photo of \u201cthe whole squad\u201d taken at the previous evening\u2019s watch party. Standing among three generations of smiling family members, just in front of Eric Trump and Jared Kushner, was Musk.</p> <h2>Musk emerges as Trump\u2019s most prominent backer</h2> <p>Musk\u2019s ascent to a key player in Trump\u2019s campaign happened rapidly. Back in March, the CEO was adamant he would not endorse a candidate for president. As late as May, he said he was still weighing his options. Then, in July, on the same day that Trump was injured in a failed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donald-trump-pennsylvania-rally-shooting\">assassination attempt</a>, he told the world he had changed his mind. He was all in immediately and called on others in the tech industry to throw their weight behind the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republican</a> party. <br><br>\u201cI fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,\u201d Musk posted alongside footage of Trump throwing his fist in the air after the shooting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1812256998588662068\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery <a href=\"https://t.co/ZdxkF63EqF\">pic.twitter.com/ZdxkF63EqF</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1812256998588662068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 13, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Musk\u2019s vow of support was in keeping with his increasingly public <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/03/elon-musk-rightwing-political-donations\">embrace of rightwing leaders</a>, and his promotion of far-right views on issues like immigration. In recent years, the billionaire had become convinced of the rightwing conspiracy theory that Democrats were planning to bring in millions of undocumented immigrants to tilt elections in their favor, with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/us/politics/elon-musk-trump.html\">the New York Times</a> reporting that he told a group of conservative billionaires in the spring of this year that if Biden won, it would be the end of American democracy. He has since repeated the claim publicly, warning of \u201cthe last election\u201d if Trump lost.</p> <p>What would quickly become clear following Musk\u2019s endorsement was that he was planning to do far more than just provide words of support. Behind the scenes, Musk had already begun offering his input into the campaign with <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/16/trump-vp-pick-jd-vance-rnc\">a phone call to Trump</a> advising him to select <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance\">JD Vance</a> as his running mate. When Musk\u2019s preferred choice was confirmed \u2013 and the nomination drew criticism over Vance\u2019s fervent anti-abortion stance and ties to extreme Christian nationalists \u2013<strong> </strong>Musk immediately posted that the ticket \u201cresounds with victory\u201d.</p> <p>Musk would soon go even further, becoming one of Trump\u2019s largest financial backers and ardent cheerleaders..</p> <h2>On the campaign trail</h2> <p>After announcing his endorsement in July, Musk immediately began contributing millions of dollars to the pro-Trump America Pac \u2013 which was set up the month prior and functioned as Musk\u2019s personal political organization and war chest for the Trump campaign. Musk donated $15m in July and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/16/elon-musk-donald-trump-donation-america-pac\">exponentially increased his funding</a> each month, ultimately contributing more than $118m by election day.</p> <p>Over the next several months, Musk took on the role of a secondary running mate, accompanying Trump at speeches, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/05/trump-musk-efficiency-commission\">giving policy ideas</a> and handling campaign strategy.</p> <p>America Pac <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/26/trump-voter-turnout-elon-musk-pac\">largely took over the Trump campaign\u2019s ground game</a> in key swing states, hiring hundreds of people across the country to canvass voters. The organization knocked on about 11m doors, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/elections/trump-musk-america-pac.html\">the New York Times</a>, while also spending millions on digital advertisements and mailers targeting voters.</p> <p>The operations faced numerous allegations of employee mistreatment and labor law violations. In one case first reported by <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-america-pac-blitz-canvassing-michigan-uhaul/\">Wired</a>, a subcontractor for Musk\u2019s America Pac allegedly flew in paid door-knockers who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/31/canvassers-musk-get-out-the-vote-effort\">had no idea</a> they would be canvassing for Trump and piled them into the back of a rented U-Haul without seatbelts or rear seating. Other canvassers allegedly falsely claimed to have visited homes in Nevada and Arizona, with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/19/trump-campaign-leaked-data-voters-elon-musk\">Guardian review</a> of leaked data finding that nearly a quarter of door-knocks were flagged as fraudulent on the canvassing app.</p>    <p>Outside of his financial contributions, Musk also made in-person appearances to support Trump. He appeared on stage in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2024/oct/14/elon-musk-stumping-for-trump\">black Maga hat</a> at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, captured jumping for joy in what has become one of the enduring images of the campaign. He opened for Trump at the Madison Square Garden rally that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/27/trump-madison-square-garden-rally\">maligned</a> for its racist and extremist rhetoric.</p> <p>As the campaign neared its end, Musk\u2019s America Pac also began directly giving money to prospective voters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/20/elon-musk-promises-to-award-1m-every-day-to-voters-as-he-steps-up-campaigning-for-trump\">doling out $1m a day</a> to a selected voter who signed a petition linked to the Pac. At one giveaway in Pittsburgh, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/21/election-elon-musk-trump-pennsylvania\">he appeared on stage</a> in front of a giant American flag to hand an oversized check to a woman and tell the crowd that he loved them.</p> <p>Musk\u2019s giveaway, which Philadelphia\u2019s district attorney <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-weighs-challenge-elon-musks-1-million-voter-giveaway-2024-11-04/\">sued to block</a>, has now become the subject of multiple lawsuits and disputes about whether it was really a lottery at all. Lawyers for Musk claimed in a Pennsylvania court hearing earlier this week that the winners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/elon-musk-giveaway-winners-lawsuit\">were not random</a> but chosen by the organization, an admission that has resulted in a proposed class-action suit from voters who claimed they were falsely led to believe they had a chance at the cash prize.</p> <h2>On Twitter</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/24/what-elon-musk-wants-from-a-donald-trump-presidency\">What Elon Musk wants from a Donald Trump presidency | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While some of Musk\u2019s ground operations and electioneering ran into legal challenges, on his own platform, he had carte blanche to promote Trump however he wanted.</p> <p>Viewed purely in financial terms, Musk\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal\">acquisition</a> of Twitter is an obvious failure. Mainstream advertisers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/01/x-twitter-advertisers-elon-musk-outburst\">have fled</a> the platform en masse as it has further entrenched itself as a haven for far-right influencers, white supremacists and conspiracy theorists. Its algorithm has shifted to promote viral videos, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/09/x-twitter-bots-republican-primary-debate-tweets-increase\">bots</a> spreading pornography, over fact-based news outlets and reliable sources of information. Musk and his investment partners, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/05/elon-musk-secures-7bn-in-outside-funding-for-twitter-takeover\">include</a> the Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal, have lost billions in value, according to a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/01/musk-twitter-investors-underwater/\">Washington Post</a> analysis, and the company is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/02/x-twitter-stock-falls-elon-musk\">worth less</a> than half of its purchase price.</p> <p>What Musk gained from his purchase, however, is control over one of the world\u2019s most influential communications platforms and the ability to make himself its loudest voice there. Musk has tweaked the platform\u2019s algorithm to ensure that his posts reach its users regardless of whether they are among his more than 200 million followers.

      "bodyText": "As Donald Trump watched election results roll in from a party at his Mar-a-Lago compound, Elon Musk sat arm\u2019s length away, basking in the impending victory he had helped secure. In less than five months, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO had gone from not endorsing a candidate to becoming a fixture of the president-elect\u2019s inner circle. \u201cThe future is gonna be so \ud83d\udd25 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8,\u201d Musk posted to his social media platform, X, just after midnight, along with a photo of himself leaning over to talk with Trump at the Mar-a-Lago dinner. Musk\u2019s place at the head table was the result of months of political efforts by the world\u2019s richest man, and an injection of at least $130m of his own money. Musk campaigned for Trump both online and offline, funded advertising and get-out-the-vote operations for a campaign at a severe financial disadvantage to its opponent. He even temporarily decamped from his home in Texas to the swing state of Pennsylvania, where he appeared at town hall events and held a $1m daily giveaway for voters. Musk wasn\u2019t the only billionaire rooting for Trump. But unlike some of his peers, who preferred operating in the shadows, shielded by Super Pacs and meetings behind closed doors, he became Trump\u2019s most visible surrogate. As so often with his endeavors, Musk was all in. And now, gambling on becoming one of Trump\u2019s most vocal and deep-pocketed supporters has won Musk direct influence and access to the nation\u2019s highest office, making him not only the world\u2019s richest man but also one of its most politically powerful. Musk\u2019s exact role in the coming administration is still unclear. Trump has previously said that the CEO would lead a full audit of the federal government, and make drastic reforms as \u201csecretary of cost-cutting\u201d. Any such position would create immense conflicts of interest, as Musk\u2019s companies hold billions in contracts with the government and are also facing investigations from federal agencies. Under Trump, who has long opposed regulators and ignored ethical conflicts, that may not matter. Musk\u2019s fortune soared by $26bn just two days after the election. Beyond any potential formal government role, Musk has also ingratiated himself as a close ally of the president-elect \u2013 who adopted some of Musk\u2019s policy suggestions during the campaign and praised him as a \u201csuper genius\u201d during his victory speech. He reportedly joined Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Wednesday, signaling broad influence. That same day, Trump\u2019s granddaughter posted a family photo of \u201cthe whole squad\u201d taken at the previous evening\u2019s watch party. Standing among three generations of smiling family members, just in front of Eric Trump and Jared Kushner, was Musk. Musk emerges as Trump\u2019s most prominent backer Musk\u2019s ascent to a key player in Trump\u2019s campaign happened rapidly. Back in March, the CEO was adamant he would not endorse a candidate for president. As late as May, he said he was still weighing his options. Then, in July, on the same day that Trump was injured in a failed assassination attempt, he told the world he had changed his mind. He was all in immediately and called on others in the tech industry to throw their weight behind the Republican party. \u201cI fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,\u201d Musk posted alongside footage of Trump throwing his fist in the air after the shooting. Musk\u2019s vow of support was in keeping with his increasingly public embrace of rightwing leaders, and his promotion of far-right views on issues like immigration. In recent years, the billionaire had become convinced of the rightwing conspiracy theory that Democrats were planning to bring in millions of undocumented immigrants to tilt elections in their favor, with the New York Times reporting that he told a group of conservative billionaires in the spring of this year that if Biden won, it would be the end of American democracy. He has since repeated the claim publicly, warning of \u201cthe last election\u201d if Trump lost. What would quickly become clear following Musk\u2019s endorsement was that he was planning to do far more than just provide words of support. Behind the scenes, Musk had already begun offering his input into the campaign with a phone call to Trump advising him to select JD Vance as his running mate. When Musk\u2019s preferred choice was confirmed \u2013 and the nomination drew criticism over Vance\u2019s fervent anti-abortion stance and ties to extreme Christian nationalists \u2013 Musk immediately posted that the ticket \u201cresounds with victory\u201d. Musk would soon go even further, becoming one of Trump\u2019s largest financial backers and ardent cheerleaders.. On the campaign trail After announcing his endorsement in July, Musk immediately began contributing millions of dollars to the pro-Trump America Pac \u2013 which was set up the month prior and functioned as Musk\u2019s personal political organization and war chest for the Trump campaign. Musk donated $15m in July and exponentially increased his funding each month, ultimately contributing more than $118m by election day. Over the next several months, Musk took on the role of a secondary running mate, accompanying Trump at speeches, giving policy ideas and handling campaign strategy. America Pac largely took over the Trump campaign\u2019s ground game in key swing states, hiring hundreds of people across the country to canvass voters. The organization knocked on about 11m doors, according to the New York Times, while also spending millions on digital advertisements and mailers targeting voters. The operations faced numerous allegations of employee mistreatment and labor law violations. In one case first reported by Wired, a subcontractor for Musk\u2019s America Pac allegedly flew in paid door-knockers who had no idea they would be canvassing for Trump and piled them into the back of a rented U-Haul without seatbelts or rear seating. Other canvassers allegedly falsely claimed to have visited homes in Nevada and Arizona, with a Guardian review of leaked data finding that nearly a quarter of door-knocks were flagged as fraudulent on the canvassing app. Outside of his financial contributions, Musk also made in-person appearances to support Trump. He appeared on stage in a black Maga hat at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, captured jumping for joy in what has become one of the enduring images of the campaign. He opened for Trump at the Madison Square Garden rally that was maligned for its racist and extremist rhetoric. As the campaign neared its end, Musk\u2019s America Pac also began directly giving money to prospective voters, doling out $1m a day to a selected voter who signed a petition linked to the Pac. At one giveaway in Pittsburgh, he appeared on stage in front of a giant American flag to hand an oversized check to a woman and tell the crowd that he loved them. Musk\u2019s giveaway, which Philadelphia\u2019s district attorney sued to block, has now become the subject of multiple lawsuits and disputes about whether it was really a lottery at all. Lawyers for Musk claimed in a Pennsylvania court hearing earlier this week that the winners were not random but chosen by the organization, an admission that has resulted in a proposed class-action suit from voters who claimed they were falsely led to believe they had a chance at the cash prize. On Twitter While some of Musk\u2019s ground operations and electioneering ran into legal challenges, on his own platform, he had carte blanche to promote Trump however he wanted. Viewed purely in financial terms, Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter is an obvious failure. Mainstream advertisers have fled the platform en masse as it has further entrenched itself as a haven for far-right influencers, white supremacists and conspiracy theorists. Its algorithm has shifted to promote viral videos, as well as bots spreading pornography, over fact-based news outlets and reliable sources of information. Musk and his investment partners, which include the Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal, have lost billions in value, according to a Washington Post analysis, and the company is now worth less than half of its purchase price. What Musk gained from his purchase, however, is control over one of the world\u2019s most influential communications platforms and the ability to make himself its loudest voice there. Musk has tweaked the platform\u2019s algorithm to ensure that his posts reach its users regardless of whether they are among his more than 200 million followers. During the campaign, he turned his account, and by extension the entire platform, into a relentless pro-Trump megaphone. In August, Musk hosted a two-hour audio interview with Trump on X in which the men discussed anti-immigration policies and Musk called Trump the \u201cpath to prosperity\u201d. While the interview provided little that hadn\u2019t been said before, it was a sign of how much had changed since Trump was permanently suspended from Twitter in 2021. Not only was Trump back, he was being feted as the future of the country by the head of the platform. Musk\u2019s promotion of Trump, as well as his attacks on Democrats, media and Kamala Harris, became a dominant part of the platform\u2019s user experience. He tweeted over 145 times in a single 24-hour period on the day following his Trump interview, according to a Guardian analysis. His feed in the lead-up to the vote was a near-constant string of invective and misinformation, along with retweets of far-right influencers promoting conspiracy theories about undocumented immigrants committing voter fraud. Musk\u2019s influence on the Trump campaign extended beyond policy into the visual representation of the candidate as well. His release of an AI image generator named Grok in August heavily influenced the visuals of the campaign. Lacking the safety guardrails of competitors such as ChatGPT, Grok could be used to create images of public figures and political leaders. Almost immediately, social media platforms became rife with AI images of Trump, Harris and other celebrities \u2013 often featuring misogynistic imagery like Harris pregnant with Trump\u2019s baby. Trump reposted AI images from rightwing influencers falsely showing Taylor Swift supporting his campaign, while Musk posted an image depicting Harris as a communist. Along with his own posts, Musk\u2019s America Pac also set up a community on X dedicated to \u201celection integrity\u201d. The community allowed users to share any evidence they found of voter fraud, but without any moderation, it effectively and immediately became a clearing house for false or unverified claims including a fake video of Haitians illegally voting for Harris. While Musk has frequently described himself as a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d, he also oversaw the suppression of information that would have potentially harmed the Trump campaign. When an independent reporter published a dossier of background research on Vance that was obtained through an alleged Iranian cyber-attack on the Trump campaign, Musk\u2019s X blocked all links to the article and suspended the reporter from that platform.

The image was a callback to when he bought Twitter and physically carried a sink into headquarters in order to make a pun, shortly before laying off most of the staff and turning the platform into a largely unregulated space where extremism thrives. \u201cLet that sink in,\u201d Musk posted.",

Its chief executive, Andy Jassy, announced in September that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/16/amazon-in-person-office-policy\">summoning its workers back to the office five days a week</a> from the new year.</p> <p>Jassy said the previous requirement for three days a week in the workplace had only \u201cstrengthened our conviction about the benefits\u201d of being in the office.</p> <p>The response to the change has been \u201cmixed\u201d, conceded Jennifer Salke, the global head of Amazon MGM Studios <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/08/bonds-audience-will-be-patient-amazon-mgm-studios-boss-on-the-hunt-for-a-new-007\">in a recent interview with the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/08/bonds-audience-will-be-patient-amazon-mgm-studios-boss-on-the-hunt-for-a-new-007\">Observer</a></em>, although she described this as simply a return to pre-Covid ways of working. \u201cWe want people to feel connected to a team,\u201d Salke said.</p>    <p>While Amazon is among the few organisations calling for full-time office attendance, its stance highlights how the balance of power appears to be swinging back towards employers.</p> <p>This shift comes despite warnings from some economists, including <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nick-bloom-stanford_lots-of-amazon-discussion-some-thoughts-activity-7241860329964494849-xnsb\">Stanford University professor Nicholas Bloom</a>, that forcing employees back to the office could prompt some of the most talented to pursue better opportunities elsewhere, potentially leaving companies with a workforce most suited to heavy office attendance, which \u201cskews slightly younger, male, [with] less diversity and disability\u201d.</p> <p>Ever since the pandemic, the financial sector has been among the most keen to get staff back to their desks.

      "bodyText": "For anyone who has recently spent their morning commute nestled under a stranger\u2019s armpit, it may come as a surprise to hear that passenger numbers on public transport have not returned to pre-Covid levels. What Transport for London calls \u201cridership\u201d has remained stubbornly stuck at about 90% of the levels seen before the pandemic. A similar picture prevails for light rail and tram systems across the rest of England, as a result of fewer people travelling daily to and from their workplaces. More than four and a half years after the first Covid lockdowns kept workers in the UK and other western nations at home, the story told by transport companies appears to reflect how the world of office-based work has changed \u2013 it seems for good. However, the end of the school summer holidays brought a flurry of announcements from large employers, which have begun to summon staff back to their desks. Last week, supermarket chain Asda became the latest to toughen up its office attendance requirements, making it compulsory for thousands of workers at its offices in Leeds and Leicester to spend at least three days a week at their desks from January. The retailer, which has been struggling with falling sales, announced the change along with job cuts and a restructuring, saying the return to office working would bring it \u201cin line with our competitors and the wider market, allowing us to build high-performing teams with a collaborative culture and respond to what our business needs the most\u201d. Speaking to the Observer, Asda\u2019s retail-veteran chair, Stuart Rose, who is currently running the supermarket, went beyond the company\u2019s official line. Lord Rose, who used to run Marks &amp; Spencer and Topshop, said having large numbers of staff based at home was \u201cnot a satisfactory way of working, particularly in an industry which is a fast-moving consumer goods industry. \u201cIt\u2019s not always as efficient with those teams working together in terms of online, in terms of Zoom calls,\u201d he said. Rose added that in his personal view, demand for hybrid working had swung too far in the workers\u2019 favour. \u201cHybrid working wasn\u2019t invented in the pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to fit the business\u2019s needs.\u201d As a sweetener for those based at its Leeds headquarters, Asda has promised to \u201cimprove the working environment\u201d with \u201ca better catering offer, an on-site Asda Express, a more welcoming atrium, more meeting spaces, quiet-space working pods, upgraded toilets, new chairs and redecoration\u201d. Asda\u2019s shopfloor and warehouse staff, meanwhile \u2013 like many others in service jobs \u2013 have not had the luxury of doing their work from dining tables or home offices. But those who are able to carry out their roles remotely have, in recent years, begun to regard flexibility over where they work as a right rather than a perk, and may feel that it will take more than an office refresh for them to give that up. The latest back-to-office mandates are just the latest skirmishes in the post-Covid clash between employers \u2013 keen to pack out their workplaces again \u2013 and their staff. The new world of work pits employees \u2013 who have grown accustomed to the flexibility of spending at least some of the working week at home or in another remote location, with the accompanying perceived improvement to their work-life balance \u2013 against organisations, which extol the benefits of the creative collaboration fostered by bringing teams together in their expensive office spaces. Among the strictest back-to-office mandates so far has come from online retailer Amazon. Its chief executive, Andy Jassy, announced in September that it was summoning its workers back to the office five days a week from the new year. Jassy said the previous requirement for three days a week in the workplace had only \u201cstrengthened our conviction about the benefits\u201d of being in the office. The response to the change has been \u201cmixed\u201d, conceded Jennifer Salke, the global head of Amazon MGM Studios in a recent interview with the Observer, although she described this as simply a return to pre-Covid ways of working. \u201cWe want people to feel connected to a team,\u201d Salke said. While Amazon is among the few organisations calling for full-time office attendance, its stance highlights how the balance of power appears to be swinging back towards employers. This shift comes despite warnings from some economists, including Stanford University professor Nicholas Bloom, that forcing employees back to the office could prompt some of the most talented to pursue better opportunities elsewhere, potentially leaving companies with a workforce most suited to heavy office attendance, which \u201cskews slightly younger, male, [with] less diversity and disability\u201d. Ever since the pandemic, the financial sector has been among the most keen to get staff back to their desks. Spanish-owned bank Santander has now told its 10,000-strong UK workforce that they will be expected to be in the office for at least 12 days a month from January, as opposed to the previous, less formal, requirement of between two and three days a week. Accountant PwC has warned it will clamp down on remote working, while its rival Deloitte has said it would no longer conduct remote interviews for graduates. The public sector is not exempt from the back-to-office trend either. In recent days, the government has reaffirmed previous office-attendance guidance, requiring most of the UK\u2019s 500,000 civil servants to spend at least 60% of their time (or three days a week) in a government building or on official business \u2013 an approach described by the Cabinet Office as \u201ccomparable to other large private and public sector employers\u201d. Employers of all kinds may be starting to firm up post-pandemic workplace rules, especially if they are finding the economic environment more challenging. Yet this may pose its own challenges when trying to recruit top talent, or graduates just starting their careers. Almost half (49%) of UK graduates said they would not apply for a job that did not offer hybrid working, according to a survey by flexible workspace provider International Workplace Group (IWG), while a further 18% said they would need to seriously consider such a role. Hybrid working was also considered as important as a competitive salary by more than half (54%) of the 1,000 graduates or final-year university students surveyed by IWG, many of whom view it as equivalent to a 13% increase in salary, because of savings made on travel and housing. The aversion to commuting \u2013 both for its cost and duration \u2013 could likewise play a significant role in putting workers off spending more time in city centre offices. The flexibility offered to new recruits and graduate trainees may differ from that permitted for existing staff who have office-based employment contracts. While the issue of forcing staff to return to the office has rarely been put to the legal test, a case earlier this year resulted in the courts finding in favour of the employer. A judge ruled that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was within its rights to refuse the request of a senior manager to work from home full-time, saying the organisation was \u201cright to identify weaknesses with remote working\u201d. Elizabeth Wilson, who had worked entirely from home since the start of the pandemic, took her case to an employment tribunal after the FCA turned down her flexible working request. The battle between employers and staff over where they work may only just be getting started.",

The strange thing is that even though you\u2019ll be in the same dark circus of emotions, everything you hear from your political side will add to your anger. That is what defeat the second time around does: the shame of losing morphs into self-hatred. You begin to be enraged by your ilk more than the opponent. That is why I am writing directly to you. Because in the coming months, your emotional state will impact domestic and global politics.</p>    <p>Sure, you remember. In 2016, when you were in a similar state of rage and depression, the collective consolation was political humour and the idea that Trump would quickly crash and burn. This time around, whenever he comes up with an outrageous idea or promises some other lunacy, you\u2019ll again see people saying, \u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d Because when people feel helpless, they soothe themselves with wishful thinking. This was what we witnessed in my home country of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/28/polls-close-in-second-round-of-the-turkish-presidential-election\">Turkey</a>, as well as Italy, India, and all the other countries that have been down the same road.</p> <p>Yet, the new chapter will come with an additional surprise: you will experience the magnetic magic of power. Some, who you assume to be your people, will decide tonormalise Trump and find ways to make themselves at home with the insanity. Hopefully, it won\u2019t happen, but just in case, prepare yourself for the most painful bit. The absolute desperation when you witness some friends, first hesitantly murmuring, then confidently saying, \u201cIt is not as bad as we imagined.\u201d You will watch in horror as they fall in line without being forced.</p> <p>Then, you\u2019ll notice that the new morality created in the White House trickles down to the people. The fundamental moral values you assumed were non-negotiable will be debated shamelessly. They will not right away cancel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/womens-rights-and-gender-equality\">women\u2019s rights</a>, but they will begin to float questions about those rights. They will not destroy the rule of law tomorrow afternoon, but you\u2019ll hear Trump\u2019s pundits say how courts are slowing down the process of \u201cmaking America great again\u201d. Trump will not walk into the White House with military boots, but here and there, you\u2019ll see more police violence on campuses and hear people saying, \u201cWell, the protesters were crossing the line anyway.\u201d The political debate will be turned into such a mess that you\u2019ll forget that in the 21st century, fascism comes to power not with goose steps but through elaborate dance moves.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in about one or two years, you will have shouted \u201cNo\u201d so often and against so many things that you will be exhausted. Many will ask again, \u201cSo, where is hope?\u201d However, you\u2019ll realise that this time, it is not hope but something more essential that is lost: <em>faith</em> \u2013 in politics and your people. And that is the loss that will turn you into a neutral element, a zero in the political equation.</p> <p>So, this is a friendly warning to stop the emotional spiralling in its early stages. Try to put self-sabotaging emotions in the freezer for four years. Your job is not to have quarrels with Trump supporters now or get pissed off with your side. If I may, your job is to replace your anger with attention. Trump surely will drive you crazy every day with new outlandish stuff, but that is only showmanship. The dangerous bit happens through the change in the institutions. Keep your eye on the institutions.</p> <p>It is not as thrilling as the blame game on your own side, but it is essential to keep it together so you can tell the Democratic party to get serious. Tell them that Trump is the strange fruit of the political system, not a deviation. To change the broken system, Democrats must consider how to achieve equality, dignity and justice for all. They must restore trust in politics and cure the nihilism and cynicism that had taken overlong before Trump came on to the scene.</p> <p>And please, this time around, don\u2019t assume that what happened in all those \u201ccrazy countries\u201d won\u2019t happen to you. Because, for us, it started just like this.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>How To Lose A Country: The Seven Steps From Democracy to Fascism</em> by Ece Temelkuran is out now published by Canongate.</p> <h2>Joseph O\u2019Connor: \u2018He might see it as a badge of honour to be dissed by liberal countries\u2019</h2>    <p>Captain Punchdown returns. The man who once publicly mocked a disabled reporter. And it\u2019s no more Mister Nice Guy. Political thugs all over the world will be emboldened. The anniversary of the January 6 attack on the Capitol will be memorable. He\u2019ll probably make it a national holiday.</p> <p>I think it will mean the end of the Democratic party in its current demonstrably unelectable form, and that will be no bad thing, although the splits will be painful. It will also pour concrete on the grave of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/25/john-mccain-obituary\">McCain</a>-era Republican party. Far from making America great, Trump Redux will see the United States become a further-divided nation that is increasingly misunderstood and disliked around the world. Probably he doesn\u2019t care; he might see it as a badge of honour to be dissed by countries where they have liberal fripperies like a social welfare system. But the isolationism will isolate. It\u2019s sad.</p> <p>The return of the wall-builder-in-chief is extraordinarily damaging to the valuable and honourable idea that electoral politics is a profession best begun with an apprenticeship of service. The victory of a four-times criminally indicted, twice impeached <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/06/trump-hush-money-sentencing\">felon</a> will encourage a particular type of newcoming extremist. That\u2019s what\u2019s most worrying. His cabinet will look like the cantina in Star Wars.</p> <p>It will set back the progress on climate change by a decade we don\u2019t have to spare. Women will be looked after, \u2018<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/donald-trump-women-protector-wisconsin-rally\">whether they like it or not</a>\u2019. The suffering of the Palestinian people will worsen, if such a thing may be imagined. Immigrants and asylum seekers will be targets for even viler abuse. It is hard to see how his promise to deport 15 million people could be carried out, but it seems likely that mass expulsion at gunpoint will become an everyday reality in the land of the free and the home of the brave. Families will be separated. More children will spend time in cages.</p> <p>Here in Dublin, where I live, the news has been greeted with gloomy resignation in government circles and with much practice of the ancient art of putting on a brave face. The relationship between Ireland and the United States is old and close, but there are concerns that Trump\u2019s planned tariff war and tax changes will rock the Irish economy. Irish membership of the EU is valued deeply by most of our people; there\u2019s a sense that pro-European sentiment will be regarded as a shootable offence in the White House and that the affection of recent American presidents for Irish culture will, for a variety of reasons, not be continuing. Seamus Heaney may not be quoted quite so often, let us say.</p> <p>In essence, Putting America First means seeing everywhere else as an inconvenience. The Irish know a bit about what that feels like. His rhetoric about immigrants could come straight from the ugly pages of Punch magazine in the 1850s, in which refugees to England from the Irish famine are portrayed as apes and murderers, bringers of terrorism and disease.</p> <p>Once, during the campaign, he made me laugh. Onstage at a rally, wearing a truck driver\u2019s fluorescent safety vest, he quipped that it made him look thin. But most things he said ranged from disconcerting to truly terrifying. Presumably, that\u2019s what they wanted, the millions of decent, betrayed Americans who voted for him: a guy who doesn\u2019t play by the rules. Be careful what you wish for.</p> <p> \u2022 <em>The Ghosts of Rome </em>by Joseph O\u2019Connor will be published by Penguin in January.</p> <h2>Andrey Kurkov: \u2018Without American aid, Ukraine may find itself in a hopeless situation\u2019</h2>    <p>Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election initially silenced Ukraine. Only weapons \u2013 all along the more than 500 miles of the front line \u2013 continued to roar, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/russia-strikes-kyiv-huge-drone-attack-trump-win\">Russian missiles and drones</a> made ever fiercer attacks against Ukrainian cities and villages.</p> <p>In silence, Ukrainians mourned the loss of one more shield of hope. Pre-election commentaries from journalists and political scientists, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/us-presidential-debate-donald-trump-ukraine-war\">speeches of Trump himsel</a>f, had made it very clear that Trump in the White House would mean greatly reduced military aid to Ukraine and that this would force President Zelenskyy to sit down at the negotiating table with Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>The outcome of such negotiations is easy to predict. Russia continues to demand that the Ukrainian leadership \u201crecognise reality\u201d. This is shorthand for saying that Ukraine must give up to Russia the territories which have been captured and occupied, and also the areas of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions which are currently free. These free territories are huge and include two major cities: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/drones-carrying-explosives-stalk-streets-of-kherson-ukraine-russia\">Kherson</a> and Zaporizhzhia.</p> <p>But today the shock wave has passed. People are beginning to share their dark visions of the future. In his video address about the US election, Zelenskyy tried to calm Ukrainians, assuring them that he and Donald Trump had established cordial relations and that, during a personal meeting in September, Donald Trump heard everything that Volodymyr Zelenskyy wished to tell him.</p> <p>Ukrainians are waiting for Trump himself to address them, as Biden did on his visit to Ukraine. Ukrainians need to hear Trump promise not to abandon them to their fate. Few believe the president-elect will make any such promise. It is not in his character or on his agenda. Neither will Zelenskyy be pushed into unfavourable, not to say dangerous, negotiations with Putin. There will most likely be a reduction in military and financial aid. </p> <p>The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/02/ukraine-us-elections-war-russia\">Ukrainian problem</a>\u201d will be handed over to the European Union as the leaders, and some of them have already taken up the baton. Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election will force the EU to focus on its own military doctrine and a common defence policy. European military aid to Ukraine will continue, but, as before, it will be delivered haltingly, preventing Ukraine from planning ahead in general, let alone planning for a counteroffensive.</p> <p>Ultimately, without American aid, Ukraine may find itself in a hopeless situation, and then unfavourable negotiations with Russia may become inevitable. This in turn will lead to more migration from Ukraine, especially of young people.</p> <p>The silence has been broken, but Ukrainians are still only murmuring their disappointment. The discussions on social media are muted. In the US, the majorityof the older generation of the Ukrainian diaspora voted for Donald Trump, but this is not discussed here either. Ukrainians who know about it keep quiet, understanding that this sector of the US population, just like most post-Soviet US citizens, want a \u201cfirm hand\u201d in politics and in the economy. And in this they are somewhat similar to today\u2019s citizens of the Russian federation.</p> <p>How to Lose a Country by Ece Temelkuran (Canongate Books, \u00a310.99).

It will also pour concrete on the grave of the McCain-era Republican party. Far from making America great, Trump Redux will see the United States become a further-divided nation that is increasingly misunderstood and disliked around the world. Probably he doesn\u2019t care; he might see it as a badge of honour to be dissed by countries where they have liberal fripperies like a social welfare system. But the isolationism will isolate. It\u2019s sad. The return of the wall-builder-in-chief is extraordinarily damaging to the valuable and honourable idea that electoral politics is a profession best begun with an apprenticeship of service. The victory of a four-times criminally indicted, twice impeached felon will encourage a particular type of newcoming extremist. That\u2019s what\u2019s most worrying. His cabinet will look like the cantina in Star Wars. It will set back the progress on climate change by a decade we don\u2019t have to spare. Women will be looked after, \u2018whether they like it or not\u2019. The suffering of the Palestinian people will worsen, if such a thing may be imagined. Immigrants and asylum seekers will be targets for even viler abuse. It is hard to see how his promise to deport 15 million people could be carried out, but it seems likely that mass expulsion at gunpoint will become an everyday reality in the land of the free and the home of the brave. Families will be separated. More children will spend time in cages. Here in Dublin, where I live, the news has been greeted with gloomy resignation in government circles and with much practice of the ancient art of putting on a brave face. The relationship between Ireland and the United States is old and close, but there are concerns that Trump\u2019s planned tariff war and tax changes will rock the Irish economy. Irish membership of the EU is valued deeply by most of our people; there\u2019s a sense that pro-European sentiment will be regarded as a shootable offence in the White House and that the affection of recent American presidents for Irish culture will, for a variety of reasons, not be continuing. Seamus Heaney may not be quoted quite so often, let us say. In essence, Putting America First means seeing everywhere else as an inconvenience. The Irish know a bit about what that feels like. His rhetoric about immigrants could come straight from the ugly pages of Punch magazine in the 1850s, in which refugees to England from the Irish famine are portrayed as apes and murderers, bringers of terrorism and disease. Once, during the campaign, he made me laugh. Onstage at a rally, wearing a truck driver\u2019s fluorescent safety vest, he quipped that it made him look thin. But most things he said ranged from disconcerting to truly terrifying. Presumably, that\u2019s what they wanted, the millions of decent, betrayed Americans who voted for him: a guy who doesn\u2019t play by the rules. Be careful what you wish for. \u2022 The Ghosts of Rome by Joseph O\u2019Connor will be published by Penguin in January. Andrey Kurkov: \u2018Without American aid, Ukraine may find itself in a hopeless situation\u2019 Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election initially silenced Ukraine. Only weapons \u2013 all along the more than 500 miles of the front line \u2013 continued to roar, while Russian missiles and drones made ever fiercer attacks against Ukrainian cities and villages. In silence, Ukrainians mourned the loss of one more shield of hope. Pre-election commentaries from journalists and political scientists, and the speeches of Trump himself, had made it very clear that Trump in the White House would mean greatly reduced military aid to Ukraine and that this would force President Zelenskyy to sit down at the negotiating table with Vladimir Putin. The outcome of such negotiations is easy to predict. Russia continues to demand that the Ukrainian leadership \u201crecognise reality\u201d. This is shorthand for saying that Ukraine must give up to Russia the territories which have been captured and occupied, and also the areas of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions which are currently free. These free territories are huge and include two major cities: Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. But today the shock wave has passed. People are beginning to share their dark visions of the future. In his video address about the US election, Zelenskyy tried to calm Ukrainians, assuring them that he and Donald Trump had established cordial relations and that, during a personal meeting in September, Donald Trump heard everything that Volodymyr Zelenskyy wished to tell him. Ukrainians are waiting for Trump himself to address them, as Biden did on his visit to Ukraine. Ukrainians need to hear Trump promise not to abandon them to their fate. Few believe the president-elect will make any such promise. It is not in his character or on his agenda. Neither will Zelenskyy be pushed into unfavourable, not to say dangerous, negotiations with Putin. There will most likely be a reduction in military and financial aid. The \u201cUkrainian problem\u201d will be handed over to the European Union as the leaders, and some of them have already taken up the baton. Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election will force the EU to focus on its own military doctrine and a common defence policy. European military aid to Ukraine will continue, but, as before, it will be delivered haltingly, preventing Ukraine from planning ahead in general, let alone planning for a counteroffensive. Ultimately, without American aid, Ukraine may find itself in a hopeless situation, and then unfavourable negotiations with Russia may become inevitable. This in turn will lead to more migration from Ukraine, especially of young people. The silence has been broken, but Ukrainians are still only murmuring their disappointment. The discussions on social media are muted. In the US, the majorityof the older generation of the Ukrainian diaspora voted for Donald Trump, but this is not discussed here either. Ukrainians who know about it keep quiet, understanding that this sector of the US population, just like most post-Soviet US citizens, want a \u201cfirm hand\u201d in politics and in the economy. And in this they are somewhat similar to today\u2019s citizens of the Russian federation. How to Lose a Country by Ece Temelkuran (Canongate Books, \u00a310.99).

I\u2019ve certainly had the most orgasms of my life in this relationship</p> </blockquote> <p>Ezra and I have been together for eight months and from the outside our relationship looks perfect. The only thing that might appear confusing is that we haven\u2019t had penetrative sex, because he\u2019s a very religious Christian. We do everything else: he goes down on me, uses his fingers and a bullet vibrator.</p> <p>Before I met Ezra, I had never really met anyone who was properly religious. I\u2019m an atheist, as are all my family and friends. We don\u2019t even talk about religion, let alone date anyone religious. Ezra and I matched on a dating app, and what was meant to be a quick first chat turned into a seven-hour call, talking about life into the early hours. He was&nbsp;upfront about his faith in that first call, saying he didn\u2019t believe in sex before marriage. He said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to come to the date tomorrow, I&nbsp;understand.\u201d I\u2019d never had a proper relationship before. Most guys I dated had concealed parts of themselves and wouldn\u2019t commit. So Ezra\u2019s honesty struck me as kind. I wanted to find out&nbsp;more about him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Many people have different politics from their partners, and I see our difference in faith as being similar</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When we first got into bed together, it was actually better than all of the penetrative sex I\u2019d had previously. Ezra is keen, focused and aware of body responses. His main aim is to make me feel good. I\u2019ve certainly had the most orgasms of my life in this relationship.</p> <p>Of course, there are times when I find it difficult to navigate. Occasionally, we will go too far and have to pull back. Sometimes I get tearful but he will comfort me. I don\u2019t have a reason not to have penetrative sex, whereas he views the act as sacred because it has the ability to make new life. It\u2019s challenging for me because I don\u2019t believe that, but I have to respect his views.

I\u2019ve certainly had the most orgasms of my life in this relationship Ezra and I have been together for eight months and from the outside our relationship looks perfect. The only thing that might appear confusing is that we haven\u2019t had penetrative sex, because he\u2019s a very religious Christian. We do everything else: he goes down on me, uses his fingers and a bullet vibrator. Before I met Ezra, I had never really met anyone who was properly religious. I\u2019m an atheist, as are all my family and friends. We don\u2019t even talk about religion, let alone date anyone religious. Ezra and I matched on a dating app, and what was meant to be a quick first chat turned into a seven-hour call, talking about life into the early hours. He was upfront about his faith in that first call, saying he didn\u2019t believe in sex before marriage. He said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to come to the date tomorrow, I understand.\u201d I\u2019d never had a proper relationship before. Most guys I dated had concealed parts of themselves and wouldn\u2019t commit. So Ezra\u2019s honesty struck me as kind. I wanted to find out more about him. When we first got into bed together, it was actually better than all of the penetrative sex I\u2019d had previously. Ezra is keen, focused and aware of body responses. His main aim is to make me feel good. I\u2019ve certainly had the most orgasms of my life in this relationship. Of course, there are times when I find it difficult to navigate. Occasionally, we will go too far and have to pull back. Sometimes I get tearful but he will comfort me. I don\u2019t have a reason not to have penetrative sex, whereas he views the act as sacred because it has the ability to make new life. It\u2019s challenging for me because I don\u2019t believe that, but I have to respect his views. I suppose many people have different politics from their partners, and I see our difference in faith as being similar. I may not agree with him, but I admire the essential values of his religion: kindness, selflessness, honesty. The fact that we can\u2019t have sex before marriage makes me contemplate marriage more, but I have to push that thought out of my head: I don\u2019t want Ezra to propose just so we can have sex.

Ezra, 26 Part of me questions whether it would be easier if we didn\u2019t do anything sexual at all I find it difficult in moments where our intimacy goes too far and we have to rein it in. I feel as if I am really hurting Priya, and a part of me questions whether it would be easier if we didn\u2019t do anything sexual at all.

Archive image: courtesy of Phil Wang</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in Stoke-on-Trent in 1990, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/phil-wang\">Phil Wang</a> is a comedian, actor and writer. He spent most of his childhood in Malaysia with his English mother, Chinese-Malaysian father and sister, before his family moved back to Bath in his teens. Wang studied engineering at Cambridge University, where he was president of the Footlights. After winning two student comedy awards, he began comedy professionally. His TV appearances include Taskmaster and Have I Got News for You, with acting roles in Wonka and 3 Body Problem. Wang\u2019s second Netflix special, <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81720942\">Wang in There, Baby!</a> is out now.</p> <p><strong>This is me, sitting on a tricycle in my childhood home</strong> in Kota Kinabalu, north Borneo, where I lived until I was 16. Dad designed the house: he\u2019s an engineer, and wanted it to look like a tree, so we had a big green tiled roof. Behind me is a folded ping-pong table; I think we used it once. From time to time, the nearby river would overflow and flood the basement, where this was taken. We wouldn\u2019t be able to play down there because it\u2019d be full of centipedes and snakes.</p> <p>I was a massive fan of professional wrestling. Partly because I was a big kid \u2013 I discovered food when I was nine and got huge. Because of my mum\u2019s European genes I was tall, and because of Dad\u2019s native genes, I was very broad. East Asians and Malaysians are quite small in general, so I felt like a freak at school. As soon as I saw wrestling on TV \u2013 all these big men running around being charismatic and entertaining \u2013 I suddenly realised: \u201cWrestling is the thing for me!\u201d \u201cStone Cold\u201d Steve Austin was my favourite, but you couldn\u2019t call yourself a fan of noughties wrestling without owning a T-shirt with the Rock\u2019s face on it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>At school, we would get a strike of a cane for every per cent we got under 80 in a test \u2026 I became quiet, very frightened and very private</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Until the age of 10, I went to Chinese schools, where corporal punishment was normal. We would get caned for speaking in class or for missing homework. One teacher was so strict that students would get a strike of a cane for every per cent you got under 80 in a test. That atmosphere made me close in on myself \u2013 I became quiet, very frightened and very private.</p> <p>At home, away from the fear of physical punishment, I could be funny. I grew up watching Jim Carrey and I loved British sitcoms like Mr Bean and French and Saunders. I had a big rubbery face; a lot to play with. This photo is a moment where I\u2019m luxuriating in silliness.</p> <p>While school instilled a fear of authority in me, I also credit that experience as being one of the things that drew me to comedy. Comedy was an environment where you were supposed to break down the rules. Being irreverent was encouraged.</p> <p>While in Malaysia, I felt white compared with everyone else; in Bath, I suddenly felt very Asian. I realised then that everywhere I went I would feel like an alien.</p> <p><strong>My first gig was at school, when I was 17.</strong> Mr Harding, the drama teacher \u2013 whom I\u2019ll always be in debt to for giving me my first gig \u2013 said I could do five minutes at Club Haha, the comedy show he was putting on for the school\u2019s improv team. I mainly ripped-off <a href=\"https://www.russellpeters.com/\">Russell Peters</a>, who is a Canadian-Indian standup comic. I swapped out \u201cIndian\u201d for \u201cChinese\u201d and found that most of his jokes worked relatively well. I did another show at school, then wrote an original set of material \u2013 10 minutes on the things I had noticed about the other students and teachers. It went great. I was relieved. Plus it was helpful in terms of the social ranking. The cool kids were like: \u201cHey! I heard that you were really funny!\u201d</p> <p>Through the Cambridge Footlights and through the comedy scene, I found a community \u2013 other funny people, and people who are funnier than me that I could learn from. It was so intoxicating. At times I felt like Batman. By day I\u2019d be doing engineering; at night I\u2019d be running standup gigs and doing my own sets. I would often only get four hours\u2019 sleep then be nodding off in class.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/12/helen-lederer-looks-back-i-met-a-man-at-my-book-launch-and-knew-id-marry-him-and-divorce-him\">Helen Lederer looks back: \u2018I met a man at my book launch and knew I\u2019d marry him. And divorce him\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once I moved to London, my pursuit of comedy became more of an addiction. I lived in a flat with my sister and did whatever gigs I could. There was a real thrill in defying people\u2019s expectations. Being the only East Asian person on the bill most of the time, I knew I\u2019d come on stage and people would see a Chinese-looking guy, and would probably think: \u201cOh boy. Is this gonna be good? I\u2019ve never seen this before.\u201d The rush of surprising them was unbeatable.</p> <p>Not much has changed in that respect. No matter how much experience I have, no matter how many times I\u2019ve been on TV, I always approach every gig assuming people don\u2019t know who I am, and have noticed that I\u2019m Asian. It\u2019s like a tick for me. I can\u2019t stop trying to bridge the gap by joking about it. I\u2019m writing new material at the moment and already the first few minutes are about being Chinese. It\u2019s not conscious. Jerry Seinfeld once said every comedian only really has the same 10 minutes, and I think there\u2019s something to that. Doing standup about Asian-ness is a way of me taking control \u2013 addressing what I think is the elephant in the room.</p> <p>As my career has progressed, comedy has become a different experience. The way I see it is, I used to date comedy and now I\u2019m married to it. I still love it, but it\u2019s not all about new experiences and places; it\u2019s now just part of my life. That\u2019s not to say I am complacent. I still worry about not getting 80% in whatever I do. I recently watched my first special on Netflix and thought: \u201cThis could have been better. I got that bit wrong. Next time, maybe I\u2019ll get 100%.\u201d That approach means I keep improving but I never celebrate. I\u2019m never happy with anything. At the end of my first Live at the Apollo set, I thought: \u201cWhat a relief.\u201d</p> <p>As for my relationship with my body, I now have a personal trainer whom I see three mornings a week. That makes me feel good. Although by the time I get back, I\u2019m so sleepy and hungry that I generally end up licking my wounds until about 3pm.</p> <p><strong>Wrestling is still a big part of my life</strong>, mainly on Instagram. My algorithm is almost entirely wrestling from the early noughties. I don\u2019t feel connected to the new stuff, or any other kind of fighting. There\u2019s something about the controlled violence of that classic era that makes me feel really comforted. In fact, it does in real life, too. I\u2019m actually the reigning comedians\u2019 wrestling champion. The comics Max &amp; Ivan put on a wrestling tournament in Edinburgh in 2023 \u2013 it took place in an actual ring, with actual comedians wrestling each other. It was a huge extravaganza. I wore my Taskmaster yellow outfit, and at one point crashed through a table. The feeling was weirdly nice. In fact, I recommend that to everyone. Forget wild swimming: crash through a table instead.</p>",

At the end of my first Live at the Apollo set, I thought: \u201cWhat a relief.\u201d As for my relationship with my body, I now have a personal trainer whom I see three mornings a week. That makes me feel good. Although by the time I get back, I\u2019m so sleepy and hungry that I generally end up licking my wounds until about 3pm. Wrestling is still a big part of my life, mainly on Instagram. My algorithm is almost entirely wrestling from the early noughties. I don\u2019t feel connected to the new stuff, or any other kind of fighting. There\u2019s something about the controlled violence of that classic era that makes me feel really comforted. In fact, it does in real life, too. I\u2019m actually the reigning comedians\u2019 wrestling champion. The comics Max &amp; Ivan put on a wrestling tournament in Edinburgh in 2023 \u2013 it took place in an actual ring, with actual comedians wrestling each other. It was a huge extravaganza. I wore my Taskmaster yellow outfit, and at one point crashed through a table. The feeling was weirdly nice. In fact, I recommend that to everyone. Forget wild swimming: crash through a table instead.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Leonardo</strong></h2> <p><em>By Charles Nicholl, biographer of Leonardo da Vinci</em></p> <p>The Royal Academy\u2019s new show brings together three Renaissance masters whose paths first crossed in Florence in 1504, their physical proximity causing a force-field of mutual influences and bitter rivalries. Leonardo da Vinci was in his early 50s, celebrated as a painter, engineer and multidisciplinary explorer in the realms of science and philosophy. Michelangelo Buonarroti was half his age, a rising star, brash, truculent and already sporting the famous boxer\u2019s nose, smashed in a fight with a rival sculptor. Raffaello Sanzio, better known in English as Raphael, was a talented young unknown scouting for new inspiration and patronage.</p> <p>Leonardo was the central figure of this redoubtable trio, his eminence eliciting very different responses from the other two. It is abundantly clear that he and Michelangelo disliked one another. There is an eyewitness account of a public spat between them, somewhere near the Ponte Santa Trinit\u00e0: Michelangelo hurled insults before stalking off to leave Leonardo with \u201chis face red because of these words\u201d. Michelangelo wanted to tear him down; the more peaceable Raphael just wanted to learn from him.</p> <p>In 1504 Michelangelo completed his David, while Leonardo was painting the Mona Lisa. Even just as objects, these creations epitomise the distance between them \u2013 a monumental six-tonne statue of a biblical warrior king, and a lightweight rectangle of poplar wood bearing the shadowy image of a well-to-do Florentine housewife. They are both \u201cgreat\u201d works, but Michelangelo\u2019s is literally huge, a statement of power and prowess, while Leonardo\u2019s is great by virtue of its reticence, its oddity, its elusiveness.</p>    <p>These secretive qualities are the magic that sets Leonardo apart: the way his most characteristic paintings float like chimeras beyond the edge of interpretation. This was the Romantic, femme fatale perception of the Mona Lisa \u2013 \u201cthis sphinx of beauty\u201d posing a \u201cyet unsolved riddle\u201d in the words of the writer Th\u00e9ophile Gautier \u2013 but it was already hinted at in the painting\u2019s original title, La Gioconda, which means The Joking Lady, perhaps even The Tease, though it is also a pun on the name of her husband, Francesco del Giocondo, who was footing the bill for the maestro\u2019s services.</p> <p>This edgy levity is a quality Leonardo had from the beginning. His earliest surviving brush-strokes are some additions to Andrea del Verrocchio\u2019s Tobias and the Angel,<em> </em>now in London\u2019s the National Gallery. It is dated 1469; he was a 17-year-old-apprentice in Verrocchio\u2019s studio. One of his contributions is a little dog, a bolognese terrier. It skips along beside the angel, alert and alive, but its silky white fur is painted with such finesse that the dog is diaphanous: you can see the line of the previously painted landscape behind it. It hovers like a hologram just above the picture surface: a fairytale dog.</p> <p>His trademark <em>sfumato</em> technique, in which (by his own definition) \u201cshadows and highlights fuse without hatching or strokes, as does smoke\u201d, is already evident in his portrait of Ginevra de\u2019 Benci (1476) and the mesmerising Virgin of the Rocks (1483), and reaches its apotheosis in the Mona Lisa, where it becomes something more than a rendering of light and shade; more an atmosphere, a mood of transience and regret. The gradations of sfumatura are also a way of depicting distance. Faraway objects, he writes, have \u201csmoky, blurred boundaries\u201d, while those closer have \u201cevident and sharp boundaries\u201d. He calls this the \u201cperspective of loss\u201d.</p>    <p>This points up a paradox in Leonardo. His paintings are full of these poetic blurrings, but much of his intellectual life was devoted to the \u201cevident and sharp\u201d requirements of scientific research. He was a hard-nosed empiricist who described himself as a \u201c<em>discepolo di sperientia</em>\u201d, a \u201cdisciple of experience\u201d (or \u201cof experiment\u201d); a sceptic who believed that received ideas should be rigorously tested before they are accounted truths.</p> <p>His autodidact\u2019s haul of knowledge is logged in his voluminous notebooks and manuscripts, but is also there in his art. The dream world of his paintings is filled with precise and learned details, and is shaped by what art historian Giorgio Nicodemi called \u201chis serene and accurate habits of thought\u201d. The wild flowers in the grotto of The Virgin of the Rocks are botanically exact. Lisa\u2019s smile can be found in a sheet of studies of the musculature of mouths and lips. His depictions of the human figure draw on data collected arduously, indeed nauseously, from the more than 30 postmortem dissections he performed, and are therefore \u2013 he claimed \u2013 much better than Michelangelo\u2019s figures, whose extravagantly muscled torsos Leonardo said look like \u201csacks full of walnuts\u201d.</p> <p><em>Charles Nicholl\u2019s <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/leonardo-da-vinci-9780140296815/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article\">Leonardo da Vinci: The Flights of the Mind</a> is published by Penguin.</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Raphael</strong></h2> <p><em>By Caroline Campbell, director of the National Gallery of Ireland</em></p>    <p>Until the 19th century, Raffaello Sanzio, better known in English as Raphael, was the undisputed exemplar for every artist trained in the western academic tradition. His name is inscribed on the walls of most public art galleries erected before 1900. In the mid-16th century, when the pioneering art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote his influential Lives of the Artists<em>, </em>he singled out Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael as the gods of the artistic pantheon. But it was Raphael whom Vasari urged aspiring artists to take as their model.</p> <p>This was not simply because of his exceptional achievements as a painter, designer and architect in a short life that ended at just 37. For Vasari, Raphael\u2019s personal qualities gave him the edge. He was endowed with exceptional tenacity as well as talent, and possessed legendary charm. Raphael was remarkably able to deal with notoriously demanding patrons who were often far above him in social status.</p> <p>Unlike Leonardo and Michelangelo, Raphael did not claim Florentine citizenship. He was born and brought up in the city of Urbino, among the vertiginous hills of the Marche. His father Giovanni, who died when Raphael was a boy (by which time he had already lost his mother) was court artist to the ruling Montefeltro family. For all Urbino\u2019s sophistication, it was a small place for one of the most precocious talents of all western art. It was soon evident to Giovanni that his&nbsp;son\u2019s abilities were in another league to his own. From a very early age, the young artist played an important role in his father\u2019s workshop. He later became a close associate of the Umbrian artist Pietro Perugino, the most celebrated painter in central Italy. </p> <p>The stimuli that Raphael encountered later in Florence enabled him to take his art to another level. When the artist first visited the city in late 1504, it was one of Europe\u2019s richest and most innovative centres, home to many celebrated artists, including the Dominican Fra Bartolommeo, Michelangelo and Leonardo. Raphael observed and was inspired by their ideas. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Looking at Raphael can give you the feeling that there is no doubt, that everything is right with the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And we can almost immediately see the impact on his art. Take the Madonna of the Pinks, a tiny devotional picture painted on yew for a private patron. It seems to be based on a work by Leonardo, the Benois Madonna, painted almost 30 years before in the late 1470s. Similarly, in the remarkable Saint Catherine, painted just before Raphael left Florence, you admire the complexity of her pose. Catherine\u2019s left leg is pushed before her right, a detail copied from Leonardo\u2019s drawing of Leda, so that your eye moves in a diagonal from the bottom right to her upturned eyes in the top left of the image. This, and the turn of her body, was taken from Michelangelo\u2019s unfinished statue of St Michael. Raphael assimilates what he\u2019s learnt from both artists so brilliantly that this unnatural contortion seems effortless. </p> <p>In 1508, Raphael\u2019s ambition took him from Florence to Rome. This was an even more energetic city, home to the papacy, which wielded power in central Italy and spiritual authority over Europe and increasing parts of the world. Raphael\u2019s first project propelled him into the very seat of power. He was commissioned to decorate semi-private spaces for the Pope and his court: the so-called Stanze, or rooms.</p> <p>The<em> </em>Stanze are near Michelangelo\u2019s Sistine ceiling, but it\u2019s hard to think of two great works of art that are more different in feeling. Michelangelo\u2019s paintings are dramatic and surprising, while Raphael\u2019s delight and beguile because he uses his close observation of people and society \u2013 he was a wonderful portraitist \u2013 to make the unbelievable and imaginary tangible and real. In the so-called School of Athens, Raphael collects together many of the greatest non-Christian philosophers (of whom two-thirds are not Athenian), with Plato and Socrates at the centre, debating whether wisdom is achieved through understanding. Their different philosophies appear united by the harmonious Roman architecture in which they stand. This is a dry, intellectual debate, but Raphael brings it alive, movement and facial expressions to show the philosophers\u2019 distinct points of view.</p>    <p>The same is true of the remarkable tapestries he designed for Pope Leo X, to hang underneath the Sistine ceiling. They depict episodes from the lives of Saints Peter and Paul, as they travelled the Mediterranean coast, preaching, administering and converting. In the Gospel narrative, the saints sometimes question Jesus. They are bewildered, and don\u2019t always understand what\u2019s going on. But, looking at Raphael can give you the feeling that there is no doubt, that everything is right with the world. Even if there is a problem, a happy resolution is never far away.<strong> </strong>We want to follow the narrative to its neat conclusion because, in Raphael\u2019s mind, there always is one. You can see why Michelangelo both disliked and was jealous of him.</p> <p>Raphael also increasingly worked as an architect. In 1514 he was appointed chief architect of St Peter\u2019s Basilica, and although much of his work was destroyed after his death, drawings give a sense of what he wanted to achieve. As the prefect of antiquities, he argued for a visual survey of all monuments within Rome, and against the destruction of ancient monuments. He collaborated with leading printmakers so that his designs could be diffused throughout Europe \u2013 and soon they were. Rubens, Rembrandt, the Carracci brothers, Poussin, Ingres and so many more knew and were inspired by his work.</p> <p>Raphael\u2019s legacy persists down to this day, his place in the artistic canon hard won. Although it is impossible not to wonder: what could he have achieved if he\u2019d had another 37 years?</p> <p><em>Caroline Campbell\u2019s first book, The Power of Art, was published in 2023.</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Michelangelo</strong></h2> <p><em>By Eliza Goodpasture, art historian</em></p>    <p>There is no other name so associated with titanic artistic genius than Michelangelo, so much so that it has become divorced from the vast reality of his work. Space, and how we move through it, was Michelangelo\u2019s defining concern. He was the original Renaissance man, working as a sculptor, painter, architect and poet, but<strong> </strong>all his work circles the same questions about how it looks and feels to move our heavy human forms through this mortal life (and beyond). No one has so defined the pinnacle of visual culture in the west since antiquity, for better or worse.</p> <p>Michelangelo was a person of intense paradox. Although he always called himself a sculptor, his paintings and buildings have equalled or surpassed the fame of his sculptures. Born in Florence and a proud Florentine throughout his life, his work came to define another city: Rome. The key works that epitomise his legacy there \u2013 including the Sistine Chapel frescos, the Piet\u00e0, the dome of St Peter\u2019s Basilica, the Piazza di Campidoglio \u2013 were made across the end of the 15th century and the first half of the 16th and, together, represent not only a redefinition of the city of Rome, but also a redefinition of the way space itself should function.</p>    <p>Michelangelo\u2019s early works of sculpture depict bodies occupying space: his Piet\u00e0, finished when he was just 24, tenderly imagines a timeless moment of sorrow, impossibly bringing together a youthful Mary and her adult son, as if in acknowledgment of the eternity of their divine relationship. Christ seems to melt into his mother\u2019s arms in death, emerging from the stone with breathtaking grace.</p> <p>The Sistine Chapel ceiling, completed 14 years later, seems to create space in its use of trompe l\u2019oeil architectural details and seemingly sculpted bodies that appear to lift off the plaster into the cavernous heavens of the ceiling. It is not a static thing, despite being two-dimensional. For the viewer on the ground, there is no one place from which to see it all: one must move through the chapel and look from various angles to appreciate the totality of the creation. By the age of 4o, not even halfway through his long life, Michelangelo had become a legend.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What makes Michelangelo\u2019s work truly breathtaking is that it is the product of one man, burdened by the joys and torments of real life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The invitation to move through space is expanded in his later architectural creations. The Piazza di Campidoglio was not completed until after his death, supervised by his great love, Tommaso dei Cavalieri. But the plans were completed by the artist, and they represent a sort of pinnacle of the artistic questions that governed his life.</p> <p>The piazza is located on the Capitoline Hill, one of the seven hills of Rome, and overlooks the Roman Forum. It has been the seat of civil government of the city since antiquity, through ever-changing cycles of leadership and systems of governance. Michelangelo\u2019s plan for the piazza reoriented it towards the Vatican, rather than the Forum, reflecting the shift in Rome\u2019s purpose from the ancient to the papal. He redesigned the square itself and the three buildings that surround it in an architectural system of symmetry and High Renaissance perfection.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/23/genius-chisel-buttocks-best-bottoms-in-art-chosen-by-our-critic-coronavirus\">\u2018It took genius to chisel these buttocks\u2019 \u2013 the top 10 bottoms in art, chosen by our critic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Two buildings already existed, and were given new facades, and a third, the Palazzo Nuovo, was built to complete the trio that surrounds the 12-pointed star on the pavement of the piazza itself, with an antique bronze statue of Emperor Marcus Aurelius at the centre.&nbsp;They all stand atop ancient Roman buildings, layering the stones of previous eras, like most of Rome. The proportions are flawless, the balance superb, and the ideal of government is given a space that is both reverential and open.</p> <p>Architecture is about enclosing space, sculpture is about excavating it, and painting, at least for Michelangelo, is about creating the illusion of it. In all three arts, he transcended the limits of what had been imagined by those before him. It is always tempting to elevate him above mere mortality, but what makes his work truly breathtaking is that it is the product of one man, burdened by the joys and torments of real life. His work continues to be a beacon of the paradoxes of the Renaissance: driving humanism butting heads with&nbsp;the fraught power dynamics of the papacy, the imperfect beauty of human physicality against the inevitability and incomprehensibility of the divine, and the weighty legacy of history meeting the alluring novelty of the present.</p> <p><em>Eliza Goodpasture is an art historian and commissioning editor at Art UK; Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael is at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, 9 November to 16 February.</em></p>",

Michelangelo\u2019s paintings are dramatic and surprising, while Raphael\u2019s delight and beguile because he uses his close observation of people and society \u2013 he was a wonderful portraitist \u2013 to make the unbelievable and imaginary tangible and real. In the so-called School of Athens, Raphael collects together many of the greatest non-Christian philosophers (of whom two-thirds are not Athenian), with Plato and Socrates at the centre, debating whether wisdom is achieved through understanding. Their different philosophies appear united by the harmonious Roman architecture in which they stand. This is a dry, intellectual debate, but Raphael brings it alive, movement and facial expressions to show the philosophers\u2019 distinct points of view. The same is true of the remarkable tapestries he designed for Pope Leo X, to hang underneath the Sistine ceiling. They depict episodes from the lives of Saints Peter and Paul, as they travelled the Mediterranean coast, preaching, administering and converting. In the Gospel narrative, the saints sometimes question Jesus. They are bewildered, and don\u2019t always understand what\u2019s going on. But, looking at Raphael can give you the feeling that there is no doubt, that everything is right with the world. Even if there is a problem, a happy resolution is never far away. We want to follow the narrative to its neat conclusion because, in Raphael\u2019s mind, there always is one. You can see why Michelangelo both disliked and was jealous of him. Raphael also increasingly worked as an architect. In 1514 he was appointed chief architect of St Peter\u2019s Basilica, and although much of his work was destroyed after his death, drawings give a sense of what he wanted to achieve. As the prefect of antiquities, he argued for a visual survey of all monuments within Rome, and against the destruction of ancient monuments. He collaborated with leading printmakers so that his designs could be diffused throughout Europe \u2013 and soon they were. Rubens, Rembrandt, the Carracci brothers, Poussin, Ingres and so many more knew and were inspired by his work. Raphael\u2019s legacy persists down to this day, his place in the artistic canon hard won. Although it is impossible not to wonder: what could he have achieved if he\u2019d had another 37 years? Caroline Campbell\u2019s first book, The Power of Art, was published in 2023. *** Michelangelo By Eliza Goodpasture, art historian There is no other name so associated with titanic artistic genius than Michelangelo, so much so that it has become divorced from the vast reality of his work. Space, and how we move through it, was Michelangelo\u2019s defining concern. He was the original Renaissance man, working as a sculptor, painter, architect and poet, but all his work circles the same questions about how it looks and feels to move our heavy human forms through this mortal life (and beyond). No one has so defined the pinnacle of visual culture in the west since antiquity, for better or worse. Michelangelo was a person of intense paradox. Although he always called himself a sculptor, his paintings and buildings have equalled or surpassed the fame of his sculptures. Born in Florence and a proud Florentine throughout his life, his work came to define another city: Rome. The key works that epitomise his legacy there \u2013 including the Sistine Chapel frescos, the Piet\u00e0, the dome of St Peter\u2019s Basilica, the Piazza di Campidoglio \u2013 were made across the end of the 15th century and the first half of the 16th and, together, represent not only a redefinition of the city of Rome, but also a redefinition of the way space itself should function. Michelangelo\u2019s early works of sculpture depict bodies occupying space: his Piet\u00e0, finished when he was just 24, tenderly imagines a timeless moment of sorrow, impossibly bringing together a youthful Mary and her adult son, as if in acknowledgment of the eternity of their divine relationship. Christ seems to melt into his mother\u2019s arms in death, emerging from the stone with breathtaking grace. The Sistine Chapel ceiling, completed 14 years later, seems to create space in its use of trompe l\u2019oeil architectural details and seemingly sculpted bodies that appear to lift off the plaster into the cavernous heavens of the ceiling. It is not a static thing, despite being two-dimensional. For the viewer on the ground, there is no one place from which to see it all: one must move through the chapel and look from various angles to appreciate the totality of the creation. By the age of 4o, not even halfway through his long life, Michelangelo had become a legend. The invitation to move through space is expanded in his later architectural creations. The Piazza di Campidoglio was not completed until after his death, supervised by his great love, Tommaso dei Cavalieri. But the plans were completed by the artist, and they represent a sort of pinnacle of the artistic questions that governed his life. The piazza is located on the Capitoline Hill, one of the seven hills of Rome, and overlooks the Roman Forum. It has been the seat of civil government of the city since antiquity, through ever-changing cycles of leadership and systems of governance. Michelangelo\u2019s plan for the piazza reoriented it towards the Vatican, rather than the Forum, reflecting the shift in Rome\u2019s purpose from the ancient to the papal. He redesigned the square itself and the three buildings that surround it in an architectural system of symmetry and High Renaissance perfection. Two buildings already existed, and were given new facades, and a third, the Palazzo Nuovo, was built to complete the trio that surrounds the 12-pointed star on the pavement of the piazza itself, with an antique bronze statue of Emperor Marcus Aurelius at the centre. They all stand atop ancient Roman buildings, layering the stones of previous eras, like most of Rome. The proportions are flawless, the balance superb, and the ideal of government is given a space that is both reverential and open. Architecture is about enclosing space, sculpture is about excavating it, and painting, at least for Michelangelo, is about creating the illusion of it. In all three arts, he transcended the limits of what had been imagined by those before him. It is always tempting to elevate him above mere mortality, but what makes his work truly breathtaking is that it is the product of one man, burdened by the joys and torments of real life. His work continues to be a beacon of the paradoxes of the Renaissance: driving humanism butting heads with the fraught power dynamics of the papacy, the imperfect beauty of human physicality against the inevitability and incomprehensibility of the divine, and the weighty legacy of history meeting the alluring novelty of the present.

      "body": "<p>Gabriel Kay really understands his target audience. As a student of industrial and product design at De Montfort University, he focused on the kettle.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone can relate to a kettle, right?\u201d says the 22-year-old graduate. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to understand and associated with comfort. It\u2019s a friendly introduction to design.\u201d</p> <p>The vital difference between Kay\u2019s kettle and the one in your kitchen is that his design \u2013 the flamboyantly named Osiris \u2013 is repairable. Its removable electronics can be replaced by anyone with a screwdriver.</p> <p>\u201cObviously I wouldn\u2019t advise anyone to go digging into typical electrical products due to safety standards and warranties,\u201d says Kay, \u201cbut I believe anybody is capable of carrying out maintenance and understanding how their products work. Osiris separates the potentially hazardous components, turning the process into something more like changing the dust bag in your vacuum than repairing an item.\u201d</p> <p>If you think this sounds like an excellent idea, you are not alone. Osiris has won awards from De Montfort University and the graduate showcase New Designers.</p>    <p>Kay has also been brought on to the <a href=\"https://www.greengrads.co.uk/\">Green Grads</a> programme. This platform was founded in 2021 by design editor Barbara Chandler as a way of promoting new UK graduates \u201cwith ideas to heal the planet\u201d. Their designs appear in exhibitions and at events \u2013 including an upcoming show at <a href=\"https://yorktonworkshops.com/project/pearson-lloyd-yorkton-workshops/\">Yorkton Workshops</a>, London, next weekend, which will feature Kay\u2019s kettle alongside a shoe that can be adapted for different terrains designed by Lewis Broughton, a new biocomposite made from rice straw, invented by Yohaan Kukreja and Ankita Khanna, and Conor McArthur\u2019s seaweed \u201cleather\u201d.</p> <p>Chandler says: \u201cOur graduates tackle issues from new biomaterials to energy reduction. But repair \u2013 and its bedfellow durability \u2013 are vital strategies for cutting waste, infinitely better than recycling. According to the EU, 80% of consumers would like repairable goods. But repairs need to be easy and reassuring. Gabriel\u2019s kettle focuses on that. You never see any scary internal electrics. Materials are robust; it looks good and works well.\u201d</p> <p>E-waste \u2013 discarded electrical goods \u2013 is becoming an urgent problem. According to the UN\u2019s fourth Global E-waste Monitor (GEM), <a href=\"https://unitar.org/about/news-stories/press/global-e-waste-monitor-2024-electronic-waste-rising-five-times-faster-documented-e-waste-recycling\">the generation of electronic waste is now rising five times faster than recyclin</a>g efforts. The report also predicted a drop in collection and recycling from 22.3% in 2022 to 20% by 2030 due to the rapid growth of e-waste.</p> <p>Despite this, many products are designed so that they cannot be repaired. Efforts to mend broken electrical goods can void the warranty. <a href=\"https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/new-right-to-repair-laws-introduced-what-do-they-actually-mean-for-you-akW160h9DWLL\">Right to repair legislation in the UK</a> was introduced in 2021 but it\u2019s described as \u201cmanifestly inadequate\u201d by Chandler. In 2020 the UK was the world\u2019s second largest producer of e-waste per capita according to GEM. E-waste is often dumped in countries in the global south \u2013 Ghana is home to one of the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2014/feb/27/agbogbloshie-worlds-largest-e-waste-dump-in-pictures\">largest e-waste dumps</a>.</p> <p>The Osiris kettle is named after the Egyptian god of death, rebirth and resurrection, and Kay hopes his product will live up to its title.</p> <p>He says: \u201cConsciousness is everything. Understanding how long your products should last against the years of use they get is key. Awareness of our effect on waste and using products to their full lifespan can help us mitigate our effect on this crisis.\u201d</p>    <p>The Osiris has not yet found investment, though it may be just a matter of time. There is growing interest in repairable electrical goods, and increasing numbers of successful green startups such as the smartphone maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/aug/15/ethical-phone-maker-covid-fairphone\">Fairphone</a> \u2013 which became profitable in 2020 \u2013 and Suri, which reached sales of more than \u00a310m with its repairable, recyclable toothbrush in 2023.</p> <p>Kay says: \u201cI think in the future, as regulations make right to repair a standard practice, there could be a perfect market for a product like this.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gabriel Kay really understands his target audience. As a student of industrial and product design at De Montfort University, he focused on the kettle. \u201cEveryone can relate to a kettle, right?\u201d says the 22-year-old graduate. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to understand and associated with comfort. It\u2019s a friendly introduction to design.\u201d The vital difference between Kay\u2019s kettle and the one in your kitchen is that his design \u2013 the flamboyantly named Osiris \u2013 is repairable. Its removable electronics can be replaced by anyone with a screwdriver. \u201cObviously I wouldn\u2019t advise anyone to go digging into typical electrical products due to safety standards and warranties,\u201d says Kay, \u201cbut I believe anybody is capable of carrying out maintenance and understanding how their products work. Osiris separates the potentially hazardous components, turning the process into something more like changing the dust bag in your vacuum than repairing an item.\u201d If you think this sounds like an excellent idea, you are not alone. Osiris has won awards from De Montfort University and the graduate showcase New Designers. Kay has also been brought on to the Green Grads programme. This platform was founded in 2021 by design editor Barbara Chandler as a way of promoting new UK graduates \u201cwith ideas to heal the planet\u201d. Their designs appear in exhibitions and at events \u2013 including an upcoming show at Yorkton Workshops, London, next weekend, which will feature Kay\u2019s kettle alongside a shoe that can be adapted for different terrains designed by Lewis Broughton, a new biocomposite made from rice straw, invented by Yohaan Kukreja and Ankita Khanna, and Conor McArthur\u2019s seaweed \u201cleather\u201d. Chandler says: \u201cOur graduates tackle issues from new biomaterials to energy reduction. But repair \u2013 and its bedfellow durability \u2013 are vital strategies for cutting waste, infinitely better than recycling. According to the EU, 80% of consumers would like repairable goods. But repairs need to be easy and reassuring. Gabriel\u2019s kettle focuses on that. You never see any scary internal electrics. Materials are robust; it looks good and works well.\u201d E-waste \u2013 discarded electrical goods \u2013 is becoming an urgent problem. According to the UN\u2019s fourth Global E-waste Monitor (GEM), the generation of electronic waste is now rising five times faster than recycling efforts. The report also predicted a drop in collection and recycling from 22.3% in 2022 to 20% by 2030 due to the rapid growth of e-waste. Despite this, many products are designed so that they cannot be repaired. Efforts to mend broken electrical goods can void the warranty. Right to repair legislation in the UK was introduced in 2021 but it\u2019s described as \u201cmanifestly inadequate\u201d by Chandler. In 2020 the UK was the world\u2019s second largest producer of e-waste per capita according to GEM. E-waste is often dumped in countries in the global south \u2013 Ghana is home to one of the world\u2019s largest e-waste dumps. The Osiris kettle is named after the Egyptian god of death, rebirth and resurrection, and Kay hopes his product will live up to its title. He says: \u201cConsciousness is everything. Understanding how long your products should last against the years of use they get is key. Awareness of our effect on waste and using products to their full lifespan can help us mitigate our effect on this crisis.\u201d The Osiris has not yet found investment, though it may be just a matter of time. There is growing interest in repairable electrical goods, and increasing numbers of successful green startups such as the smartphone maker Fairphone \u2013 which became profitable in 2020 \u2013 and Suri, which reached sales of more than \u00a310m with its repairable, recyclable toothbrush in 2023. Kay says: \u201cI think in the future, as regulations make right to repair a standard practice, there could be a perfect market for a product like this.\u201d",

Of course, it matters a great deal to find out why people who voted for Democrats in 2020 failed to turn out; of course, there needs to be an explanation (not freewheeling speculation) about Trump\u2019s gains among Latino men in particular.</p> <p>Yet one larger question deserves at least as much attention: why does anything recognizable to international observers as a center-right option seem to have disappeared from our politics? Why was the only 2024 choice between the far right and a vaguely progressive (not progressive enough for progressives, to be sure) center party?</p> <p>This is another way of asking: why has never-Trumpism been such a failure? After all, among the self-exiled and the ejected, the movement featured creative political minds and, at least for a while, quite a bit of cash.</p> <p>Part of the answer is that such figures never faced up to a proper reckoning with the history of the post-second world war American right (which also made Harris\u2019s embrace of the Cheneys such a politically and morally dubious choice). If in doubt, never-Trumpers would <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/opinion/never-trump-maga-evangelicals.html\">default</a> into Ronald Reagan or John McCain idolatry: such apparent moral icons would seem to provide the maximum contrast with Trump; they also served as shorthand for the ideological mix that the center right think remains their unique political offering: pro-business, strong on defense, conventional <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9781935408345/family-values\">family values</a> (such that men, exhausted from competing in the market, would find a nice, but also disciplined, home in which to recover \u2026).</p> <p>What is conveniently left out is the Republicans\u2019 longstanding commitment to the \u201csouthern strategy\u201d, which is to say appealing to those alienated (to put it politely) by the Democrats\u2019 turn to civil rights promotion.</p> <p>It is largely forgotten that Reagan opposed both the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.

      "bodyText": "The blame game\u2019s in full swing. Armchair campaign strategists just know that Kamala Harris should have thrown Joe Biden under the bus, or gone on Joe Rogan, or \u2013 the perennial favorite among self-declared centrists \u2013 trashed identity politics. Of course, it matters a great deal to find out why people who voted for Democrats in 2020 failed to turn out; of course, there needs to be an explanation (not freewheeling speculation) about Trump\u2019s gains among Latino men in particular. Yet one larger question deserves at least as much attention: why does anything recognizable to international observers as a center-right option seem to have disappeared from our politics? Why was the only 2024 choice between the far right and a vaguely progressive (not progressive enough for progressives, to be sure) center party? This is another way of asking: why has never-Trumpism been such a failure? After all, among the self-exiled and the ejected, the movement featured creative political minds and, at least for a while, quite a bit of cash. Part of the answer is that such figures never faced up to a proper reckoning with the history of the post-second world war American right (which also made Harris\u2019s embrace of the Cheneys such a politically and morally dubious choice). If in doubt, never-Trumpers would default into Ronald Reagan or John McCain idolatry: such apparent moral icons would seem to provide the maximum contrast with Trump; they also served as shorthand for the ideological mix that the center right think remains their unique political offering: pro-business, strong on defense, conventional family values (such that men, exhausted from competing in the market, would find a nice, but also disciplined, home in which to recover \u2026). What is conveniently left out is the Republicans\u2019 longstanding commitment to the \u201csouthern strategy\u201d, which is to say appealing to those alienated (to put it politely) by the Democrats\u2019 turn to civil rights promotion. It is largely forgotten that Reagan opposed both the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. Those people born after the 60s might not have liked Reagan, but probably remember a charming, almost avuncular figure who perpetually radiated optimism. Anyone looking at footage of Reagan as California governor will see a man seething with resentment and spouting rhetoric no different from what the far right says about \u201cliberal institutions\u201d today.

McCain might be presented in history books as an upright defender of democracy and human rights internationally, as well as the unlikely person who saved the Affordable Care Act during Trump\u2019s first term. But he\u2019s also the man who brought us Sarah Palin, a Trumpista before there was Trump. The conceit has always been that rightwing elites could turn the rightwing populism \u2013 and, often enough, sheer racism \u2013 up or down as desired; they failed to understand that they eventually created something they couldn\u2019t control.

      "bodyText": "Ruben Amorim has already flagged his greatest challenge when taking over Manchester United on Monday: to make the club of Billy Meredith, George Best, Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo play again in the tradition of these irresistible attacking forces. The \u201cwow\u201d factor has been missing from those donning United colours for most of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s off-the-cuff counterattack play apart, the teams of David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Erik ten Hag lacked the dizzying fizz of United\u2019s finest vintages. When Amorim declared after Sporting\u2019s 4-1 Champions League rout of Manchester City on Tuesday night that United cannot play as defensively as the Portuguese champions, he signalled an intent to make his iteration a front-foot, box-office proposition. His clear challenge is how to engineer this with a side in 13th place before the weekend\u2019s fixtures \u2013 they host Leicester today \u2013 and with players unaccustomed to his preferred 3-4-3 configuration. \u201cUnited cannot play the way we play, they cannot be so defensive,\u201d he said after his Sporting side had sat back and waited to play on the break against Pep Guardiola\u2019s City. However, Amorim often harnesses the counterattack against higher-quality opposition and you have to wonder if United will be markedly more attacking than Sporting were in midweek. How the Old Trafford crowd will receive this is another matter. Even Solskj\u00e6r, who restored the bond between club and supporters broken by his predecessor, Mourinho, drew ire for playing on the break. Until Amorim can start building the squad he desires, whether his United can excite in his first months in charge will depend on an inherited group of players that are not obviously suited to his direction. United have six central defenders so perming three for any matchday for the rearguard trident should be no problem. If his preferred lineup is Lisandro Mart\u00ednez, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro (once fit), Amorim faces the question of whether they can initiate his tactics that build attacks from deep. In the Portuguese\u2019s middle quartet, the wing-backs at United will be called on to perform an unfamiliar role. At Sporting, Amorim has fielded the pacy Geovany Quenda on the left and Maximiliano Ara\u00fajo on the right, inverted wing-backs operating on the opposing flank to their natural sides. At United Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui are candidates as right-sided defenders whom Amorim could select on either flank. Beyond whether they are able to adapt to the position, it will be intriguing to see whether either has the pace required to operate expertly by sprinting back and forward in attack and defence. Amorim has a further problem regarding the reliability of two injury-plagued left-backs in Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia. The manager could plump for Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho to patrol the corridors but neither are renowned for their defensive discipline. Antony may feel a flatlining United career has a chance of revival with a move to the position but, now in a third season at United, this seems an outside prospect. If this key part of the XI does not function, Amorim could consider a return to Sporting to sign one of Quenda and Ara\u00fajo but with funds limited a January move may not be possible. Central midfield presents another conundrum. If Amorim wishes to operate a flat four then he must find a way to fit in the two creative forces of Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes. But there would be no room for either Manuel Ugarte, as a dedicated holding player, or Casemiro. A diamond formation may be the solution, with Ugarte or Casemiro at the base, plus wing-backs either side and Fernandes or Mainoo at the tip. But one of the latter two would miss out, which, for a team whose heritage demands buccaneering football, seems unlikely and contradicts Amorim\u2019s own declaration that United should not be dour. His front three seems the least complicated selection area. On either wing, he can pick two from Garnacho, Rashford and the ever-improving Amad Diallo, with Rasmus H\u00f8jlund at centre-forward.

He was surrounded by his wife, Melania, and his children, the Stars and Stripes and giant banners that proclaimed: \u201cDream big again\u201d and \u201cTrump will fix it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to help our country heal,\u201d Trump vowed. \u201cWe have a country that needs help and it needs help very badly.

And at its core was the promise of Trump unleashed: a radical expansion of presidential power.</p> <p>The 45th and 47th commander-in-chief will face fewer limits on his ambition when he is sworn in again in January. He returns as the head of a Republican party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/09/donald-trump-republican-party\">remade in his image</a> over the past decade and as the architect of a right-leaning judiciary that helped eliminate his legal perils. Second time around, he has allies across Washington ready to enforce his will.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-election-11-issues-threat\">With Trump returning to the presidency, everything from abortion to immigration is under threat</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.newsnationnow.com/author/kurt-bardella/\">Kurt Bardella</a>, a Democratic strategist and former Republican congressional aide, said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to have is an imperial presidency. This is going to be probably the most powerful presidency in terms of centralising power and wielding power that we\u2019ve had probably since FDR [Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was president from 1933 until his death in 1945].\u201d</p> <p>Trump won big in this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-us-presidential-election\">presidential election</a> against Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-president. He became the first Republican in 20 years to win the national popular vote. He improved on his 2020 performance in every state except two (Washington and Utah) and made gains in nearly every demographic. A third of voters of colour supported him. Whereas Joe Biden won Latino men by 23 percentage points in 2020, Trump won them by 10 points in 2024.</p> <p>Emboldened by this mandate, Trump, who said he <a href=\"https://link.nbcnews.com/external/37374116.80053/aHR0cHM6Ly90aW55dXJsLmNvbS8yeGZ1a3h1OD9jaWQ9ZW1sX2JuaWdodGx5XzIwMjQxMTA2/583d119ae9328b293c8b45cbB8f8564ef\">would be a \u201cdictator\u201d,</a> but only on \u201cday one\u201d, is promising a second act more sweeping and transformational than the first. He is backed by a Republican party that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/senate-elections-republicans-win\">regained control of the Senate</a>, might retain the House of Representatives and is more acquiescent than ever. The opposition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/trump-election-win-10-key-takeaways\">Democratic party is demoralised</a> and lacks an obvious leader.</p> <p>Trump, who arrived in Washington as a political neophyte eight years ago, is less likely this time to be surrounded by establishment figures and steady hands curbing his darkest impulses. His allies have spent the past several months pre-screening candidates for his administration, aiming to ensure key posts will be filled by dependable foot soldiers. His pugnacious son <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/19/trump-family-melania-don-jr-ivanka-election\">Don Jr</a> intends to have a say.</p> <p>Bardella added: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a more competent version of the first term. This time Donald Trump and his team know how the White House works. They know what type of personnel they need where to achieve what they want to achieve. They have, unlike last time, more of a complete hold of Congress.\u201d</p> <p>Trump sceptics such as the House speaker Paul Ryan or the congresswoman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/liz-cheney\">Liz Cheney</a> are gone, he noted, replaced by Maga devotees primed to do his bidding. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be more continuity, more synergy, everyone\u2019s going to march to the beat of the same drummer. There is no resistance within the Republican party any more and they are now facing a Democratic party that is leaderless, that is searching for its own identity, that\u2019s going to have to recalibrate.\u201d</p> <p>Trump will also expect compliance from a conservative supreme court that includes three of his own appointees. The court has loosened the legal guardrails that have hemmed past presidents in thanks to a July decision that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jul/01/supreme-court-decision-trump-immunity-ruling\">gives presidents broad immunity</a> from criminal prosecution.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There might be things that the president wants to do that people don\u2019t like that the Republican Congress goes along with him on but that\u2019s politics.

Chief among these is X, the social media platform owned by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a>, the world\u2019s richest man, who played a key role in the Trump campaign.</p> <p>Despite the daunting outlook, however, some commentators are optimistic that checks and balances will remain.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/people/elaine-kamarck/\">Elaine Kamarck</a>, a former official in the Bill Clinton administration, said: \u201cFor him to expand presidential power, Congress has to give up power and they\u2019re not in the mood to do that. They\u2019ve never done that. There are plenty of institutionalists in Congress.\u201d</p> <p>Kamarck also expressed faith in the federal courts, noting that judges appointed by Trump only constitute 11% of the total placed on the bench by former presidents. A Trump dictatorship is \u201cnot going to happen\u201d, she added. \u201cNow, there might be things that the president wants to do that people don\u2019t like that the Republican Congress goes along with him on but that\u2019s politics.

      "bodyText": "At 2.25am, Donald Trump gazed out at his jubilant supporters wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats. He was surrounded by his wife, Melania, and his children, the Stars and Stripes and giant banners that proclaimed: \u201cDream big again\u201d and \u201cTrump will fix it!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to help our country heal,\u201d Trump vowed. \u201cWe have a country that needs help and it needs help very badly. We\u2019re going to fix our borders, we\u2019re going to fix everything about our country and we\u2019ve made history for a reason tonight, and the reason is going to be just that.\u201d Having risen from the political dead, the president-elect was already looking ahead to what he called the \u201cgolden age of America\u201d \u2013 a country that had just shifted sharply to the right. And at its core was the promise of Trump unleashed: a radical expansion of presidential power. The 45th and 47th commander-in-chief will face fewer limits on his ambition when he is sworn in again in January. He returns as the head of a Republican party remade in his image over the past decade and as the architect of a right-leaning judiciary that helped eliminate his legal perils. Second time around, he has allies across Washington ready to enforce his will. Kurt Bardella, a Democratic strategist and former Republican congressional aide, said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to have is an imperial presidency. This is going to be probably the most powerful presidency in terms of centralising power and wielding power that we\u2019ve had probably since FDR [Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was president from 1933 until his death in 1945].\u201d Trump won big in this week\u2019s presidential election against Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-president. He became the first Republican in 20 years to win the national popular vote. He improved on his 2020 performance in every state except two (Washington and Utah) and made gains in nearly every demographic. A third of voters of colour supported him. Whereas Joe Biden won Latino men by 23 percentage points in 2020, Trump won them by 10 points in 2024. Emboldened by this mandate, Trump, who said he would be a \u201cdictator\u201d, but only on \u201cday one\u201d, is promising a second act more sweeping and transformational than the first. He is backed by a Republican party that regained control of the Senate, might retain the House of Representatives and is more acquiescent than ever. The opposition Democratic party is demoralised and lacks an obvious leader. Trump, who arrived in Washington as a political neophyte eight years ago, is less likely this time to be surrounded by establishment figures and steady hands curbing his darkest impulses. His allies have spent the past several months pre-screening candidates for his administration, aiming to ensure key posts will be filled by dependable foot soldiers. His pugnacious son Don Jr intends to have a say. Bardella added: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a more competent version of the first term. This time Donald Trump and his team know how the White House works. They know what type of personnel they need where to achieve what they want to achieve. They have, unlike last time, more of a complete hold of Congress.\u201d Trump sceptics such as the House speaker Paul Ryan or the congresswoman Liz Cheney are gone, he noted, replaced by Maga devotees primed to do his bidding. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be more continuity, more synergy, everyone\u2019s going to march to the beat of the same drummer. There is no resistance within the Republican party any more and they are now facing a Democratic party that is leaderless, that is searching for its own identity, that\u2019s going to have to recalibrate.\u201d Trump will also expect compliance from a conservative supreme court that includes three of his own appointees. The court has loosened the legal guardrails that have hemmed past presidents in thanks to a July decision that gives presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution. The 78-year-old businessman and former reality TV star also hopes to exploit a new universe of rightwing podcasters and influencers who were instrumental in his election and could help him shape the information ecosystem. Chief among these is X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, who played a key role in the Trump campaign. Despite the daunting outlook, however, some commentators are optimistic that checks and balances will remain. Elaine Kamarck, a former official in the Bill Clinton administration, said: \u201cFor him to expand presidential power, Congress has to give up power and they\u2019re not in the mood to do that. They\u2019ve never done that. There are plenty of institutionalists in Congress.\u201d Kamarck also expressed faith in the federal courts, noting that judges appointed by Trump only constitute 11% of the total placed on the bench by former presidents. A Trump dictatorship is \u201cnot going to happen\u201d, she added. \u201cNow, there might be things that the president wants to do that people don\u2019t like that the Republican Congress goes along with him on but that\u2019s politics. That\u2019s not a dictatorship.\u201d Trump will return to power with an aggressive agenda that includes what his ally Steve Bannon called \u201cthe deconstruction of the administrative state\u201d. He has proposed a government efficiency commission headed by Musk that would gut the federal bureaucracy. Trump plans to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. They could be replaced by what are essentially political appointees loyal to him. On his signature issue, illegal immigration, Trump has vowed to carry out the biggest deportation operation in American history, starting with people who have criminal records or final orders of deportation. He has called for using the national guard and empowering domestic police forces in what he has said will be \u201ca bloody story\u201d. He told Time magazine that he did not rule out building new migrant detention camps but \u201cthere wouldn\u2019t be that much of a need for them\u201d because people would be rapidly removed. His running mate, JD Vance, told the New York Times that deporting 1 million immigrants a year would be \u201creasonable\u201d. During the election campaign Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the supreme court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence the Republican platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Even so, Trump has not explicitly said he would veto a national ban if it reached his desk. He has also indicated that he would let Robert F Kennedy Jr, the anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, \u201cgo wild\u201d on public health matters, including women\u2019s health. \u200aTrump has promised to extend his 2017 tax cut, reversing Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping levies that fund energy measures to combat the climate crisis. Trump also has proposals aimed at working- and middle-class Americans: exempting tips and overtime wages from income taxes. Steve Schmidt, a political strategist and former campaign operative for George W Bush and John McCain, said: \u201cHe\u2019s going to have a Republican Congress go through a deregulatory frenzy; they\u2019re going to propose brutal spending cuts that will affect the people primarily that voted for them but also a lot of other poor people in the country.\u201d Trump has vowed to eliminate the Department of Education and slash federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing critical race theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children\u201d. \u200aThe Trump campaign made opposition to transgender rights a central part of its closing argument, with the president-elect vowing to \u201ckeep men out of women\u2019s sports\u201d. He plans to end Biden\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students and ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognised at birth. On the world stage, Trump touts an \u201cAmerica first\u201d ideology that would make the US more isolationist, non-interventionist and protectionist than at any time since the second world war. He has proposed tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods despite economists\u2019 warnings that this would drive up inflation. Trump has repeatedly praised authoritarians such as Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and not ruled out withdrawing from Nato. He has said he would end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine within a day, prompting fears of a a deal that compels Ukraine to surrender territory, and reportedly told Israel\u2019s president, Benjamin Netanyahu, that he wants the war in Gaza to be finished by January. Schmidt commented: \u201cThey will act very quickly in Ukraine to end the war while escalating the situation with Iran and you\u2019ll see very quickly a tremendous amount of instability with Mexico. It\u2019s going to be horrendous. It\u2019s going to be shocking.\u201d Trump, who falsely claims that the climate crisis is a \u201choax\u201d, has said he will again remove the US from the Paris climate accords and dismantle Biden\u2019s climate agenda. He has promised to increase oil production and burn more fossil fuels \u2013 \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies \u2013 and weaken regulatory powers or eliminate bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency. The ascent of Trump, the first convicted criminal to be elected president, is also a crisis for the rule of law. The justice department is moving to wind down the two federal cases against him after he vowed to fire the special counsel Jack Smith \u201cwithin two seconds\u201d of becoming president. Trump has vowed to bend the department to his will, pardon January 6 rioters and target journalists, election workers and other perceived political enemies. Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cWill people who he believes broke the law in trying to persecute him and his friends be investigated? Yes. Will they be subject to all of the defense mechanisms and the fair trials that he was afforded? Absolutely. \u201cI\u2019m sure he looks at it and says, \u2018I could have gone after Hillary, there\u2019s a lot of reason to; I showed you an open hand and what did you do? You persecuted me for eight years. The gloves are off.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t mean anything other than, \u2018OK, you decided to use these weapons, I now own the weapons. I\u2019m going to use the weapons too.\u2019 It\u2019s not the end of American democracy.\u201d Others, however, are less sanguine. Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman who campaigned for Harris this year, said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a revenge tour on steroids. I don\u2019t think people realise what\u2019s coming.

      "body": "<p>\u201cLife is short and the world / is at least half terrible,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/89897/good-bones\">observes</a> the poet Maggie Smith. But which are the books to reach for when the terrible half is in the ascendant? I\u2019ve come to treasure a&nbsp;particular category I\u2019d define as the literary comfort novel: elegant and beautifully written stories that renew our faith in humanity, that leave us better than they found us, that work \u2013 and thus expand \u2013 the muscle of the heart. Lately, I\u2019ve come to realise that I want to read one story: <em>despite everything, it&nbsp;is going to be OK</em>.</p> <p>That \u201cdespite\u201d is key. Solace is distinct from escape, and I\u2019d define a&nbsp;literary comfort novel as distinct from pure escapism. I don\u2019t want the narcotic and temporary palliative of the soap opera \u2013 without judgment, I should add \u2013 but, perhaps because I&nbsp;have been aged or wounded out of fairy stories, I want a more convincing consolation, grounded in real life. The best books rebuild our strength so we can face reality, and maybe even fight to change it. I don\u2019t want briefly to suspend my disbelief. Instead, I long to&nbsp;believe again.</p>    <p>Nick Hornby looks for \u201cabsorption, the possibility of jokes or wit, a writer who understands that their job is to entertain the reader. Optimism is nice too. If literature continues to paint itself into the miserable and difficult corner then it will die, and yield the ground it should be occupying to other forms of entertainment. So I am left only with Dickens, Austen, Wodehouse, Wells, Waugh, Green, Vonnegut, Strout, Patchett, Tyler \u2013 and about 500 other authors who wish to provide pleasure to the reader.\u201d</p> <p>Probably there will always remain a&nbsp;snobbery about the optimistic; certainly there endures the belief that optimism is inherently naive, and that a novel can only have literary value if it opens up or illuminates yet another chamber of horrors in the catalogue of human misery. A&nbsp;surprising number of readers believe a happy ending should mean automatic disqualification from any serious literary award. Good luck to them: I wish them joy in their wallowing. In my turn, I\u2019ve come to believe the opposite. To reach only for novels that reaffirm our darkest fears is merely to make an escape of a different sort, not the escapism of brooding heroes and wedding finales, but the security blanket of an equally foregone conclusion: the safety of imagining the worst. I would argue that to live only in that place is simply cowardice in better camouflage. The truth is that it\u2019s far riskier to remain in&nbsp;uncertainty. Far braver, far more radical to keep hoping.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If these are the only novels you read on loop for the rest of your life, I reckon you\u2019ll be all right</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Here, then, is my ultimate reading list for soul sustenance. Each is a&nbsp;guaranteed source of humour, compassion and insight; all are by brilliant writers whose sentence-by-sentence work will itself bring pleasure. If these are the only novels you read on loop for the rest of your life, I reckon you\u2019ll be all right.</p> <p>If there\u2019s a more triumphant character in contemporary literature than Audra Cavanaugh, I don\u2019t know her. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/07/katherine-heiny-writing-about-sex-and-relationships-ends-up-being-about-infidelity\">Katherine Heiny</a>\u2019s masterpiece, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/13/standard-deviation-katherine-heiny-review-aspergers\">Standard Deviation</a><em>,</em> Audra is eccentric and inexhaustible, tender-hearted and spectacularly tin-eared, and somehow essentially unknowable to her older husband Graham, despite the fact that she would tell absolutely anything to anyone, and frequently does. Heiny captures the good-faith muddle of a real marriage under strain; a couple absolutely united in their devotion to their 10-year-old son but in little else, it sometimes seems, and it becomes increasingly obvious that Graham is not as straightforward and dependable a character as he himself insists. Here, fidelity and even honesty might be overrated \u2013 love, a sense of shared purpose and a&nbsp;robust sense of humour win the day.</p> <p>Loving deception is also at the centre of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/family-happiness-9781474615952/\">Family Happiness</a> by Laurie Colwin: another messy marriage, another sublime New York novel. Polly is the perfect daughter of the perfect Solo-Millers, for whom visits to her artist lover are enabled by the fact that&nbsp;no one in the family takes the remotest interest in her job, though they\u2019d be alarmed if she forgot the olives for lunch. No tidy endings here either, just&nbsp;the bliss of a fantastic and underrated writer.</p>    <p>Speaking of underrated, more people in the UK should be reading Kevin Wilson. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/02/in-brief-nothing-to-see-here-kevin-wilson-one-of-them-michael-cashman-big-sky-kate-atkinson\">Nothing to See Here</a> is possibly the ultimate literary comfort read. Lillian\u2019s old school pal Madison calls for Lillian\u2019s help (not the first time that impoverished, vulnerable Lillian is called in to cover for her rich best friend). Madison needs someone to mind the 10-year-old twins from her husband\u2019s first marriage; the minor catch is that Bessie and Roland burst into spontaneous flames whenever they\u2019re upset. Lillian is a dropout and a cynic, wickedly smart and relentlessly hilarious, while her growing connection with the two children is&nbsp;nothing short of transcendent. Most people are horrible and life generally sucks, suggests this novel, and yet. And yet. In unlikely places, humanity flickers and catches alight. It will all \u2013 somehow \u2013 turn out OK.</p> <p>The novels that bring most comfort to writer Sathnam Sanghera all share landlocked settings, as a reader \u201cboth from the Midlands and with heritage from the Punjab\u201d. He\u2019s comforted when the world of the novel feels safe, and cites fellow Black Country writer Jonathan Coe as his ultimate comfort read because \u201cthere\u2019s so much warmth to his characters\u201d. Also Possession by AS Byatt, which is \u201ca book about books, and therefore safety within safety\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For warmth of characters, compassion and humour, James McBride\u2019s The Heaven\u00a0and Earth Grocery Store is unsurpassed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For warmth of characters, together with exquisite compassion and humour, James McBride\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/26/the-heaven-earth-grocery-store-by-james-mcbride-review-sweet-solidarity\">The Heaven&nbsp;and Earth Grocery Store</a> is unsurpassed. In the early decades of the 20th century, the residents of Pennsylvania\u2019s Chicken Hill are not exactly living the American dream; African Americans and Jewish immigrants together contend, in their&nbsp;marginalised community, with racism, poverty and disability. They are challenged over and over, but this is an epic novel suffused with hope for humanity, and one which reminds us of the power of community, and love.</p> <p>No list would be complete without an Austen, and my top nomination would always be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/jul/18/persuasion-jane-austens-kung-fu-novel\">Persuasion</a>. Her most mature and refined novel, it is still the closest to an escapist fairytale, the Cinderella story of sweet, longsuffering Anne Elliot, burdened with and neglected by her appalling father and sisters. Austen leads us inexorably towards the proposal, the wedding, the man of good fortune, but along the way Anne suffers, and Austen\u2019s clear eyes and sharp nib make the predictable miraculous. I challenge you not to sob when you read Frederick\u2019s letter.</p>    <p>Everyone by now has read the wonderful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/19/lessons-in-chemistry-by-bonnie-garmus-review-the-right-comic-formula\">Lessons in Chemistry</a> by Bonnie Garmus: funny, poignant, unbelievably satisfying. I loved it \u2013 and in a similar vein, have you also read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/29/whered-you-go-bernadette-review\">Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette</a> by Maria Semple? The two have in common a&nbsp;gifted woman resisting the role in which she has been cast; losing and then triumphantly finding herself. </p> <p>R\u00f3n\u00e1n Hession\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/02/panenka-by-ronan-hession-review-moments-of-grace\">Panenka</a> breaks my rule that it must all turn out all right \u2013 but it\u2019s a worthy exception. In a substantial sense it will definitely not be OK; it rarely is when the protagonist begins by mentioning that he suffers from the sort of headaches that deliver nights alone curled in agony on the bathroom floor. Yet with Hession\u2019s tender treatment it remains a story of hope, and redemption. Recently reunited with his adult daughter and seven-year-old grandson, Joseph is a&nbsp;retired footballer living in a run-down town, and has for years been held single-handedly responsible for the declining fate of the beloved local team (and thus the town itself), after one misjudged penalty kick. It\u2019s full of&nbsp;warmth and forgiveness, of reconnections and second chances, and what it&nbsp;is, in the end, that really matters.</p> <p>Margaret Drabble\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/21/millstone-margaret-drabble-review\">The Millstone</a> is&nbsp;a delight because nothing in Rosamund\u2019s life should go as well as it&nbsp;does; one keeps expecting her to succumb to the cliches of 1960s unmarried motherhood and yet on she&nbsp;goes, skirting disaster, happy despite what anyone believes she ought to feel about her predicament. In short, she isn\u2019t punished, either by her generation or by the imagination that&nbsp;created her. Ah, yes. There\u2019s another condition I\u2019ve laid down for my own favourites \u2013 writers who treat their characters with respect. I can no longer stomach watching novelists pull the wings off the flies they have written into being.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/26/tom-lake-by-ann-patchett-review-homespun-happiness\">Tom Lake</a> by Ann Patchett takes optimism almost as its guiding principle \u2013 broken hearts heal; lost young people eventually find their way into contented adulthood. It is a sublimely reassuring novel because of its structure: most (but not all) of the novel\u2019s suffering is contained within a long-ago episode, recounted by a narrator who is now a happily married mother in her 50s, picking ripe fruit in the sunshine. If to some that lack of peril makes it saccharine, well, tough cheese. As Ann Patchett herself has said in these pages, \u201cI am a glass-half-full, can-do kind of gal. It\u2019s just the salt in my brain. So, people give me grief about being too hopeful or too cheerful or too interested in family \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not writing all the novels.\u201d Readers are free to give ourselves over to the journey, for we have already taken possession of a happy ending.</p> <p>For the novelist Naomi Alderman a&nbsp;literary comfort read should be \u201ca pep talk in the corner of the boxing ring of&nbsp;life\u201d, and her own favourites are Susanna Clarke\u2019s magisterial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/17/piranesi-by-susanna-clarke-review-an-elegant-study-in-solitude\">Piranesi</a>, \u201cwhich is really a book about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/12/susanna-clarke-i-was-cut-off-from-the-world-bound-in-one-place-by-illness\">surviving a long illness</a>, but somehow also about how it\u2019s OK to be changed by life, by hard times, by the world; that being changed can be a power as well as a wound\u201d. And George Saunders\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/08/lincoln-in-the-bardo-george-saunders-review\">Lincoln in the Bardo</a>, \u201cabout a man facing the worst possible thing, the death of his child, and having to haul himself together to save his country. It\u2019s a book that\u2019s rich and tender, and so full of clear-eyed love for humanity \u2013 the belief that, with all our rough edges and unsavouriness, we are still worth saving.\u201d</p> <p>For that, after all, is the heart of what it is to be consoled.

      "bodyText": "\u201cLife is short and the world / is at least half terrible,\u201d observes the poet Maggie Smith. But which are the books to reach for when the terrible half is in the ascendant? I\u2019ve come to treasure a particular category I\u2019d define as the literary comfort novel: elegant and beautifully written stories that renew our faith in humanity, that leave us better than they found us, that work \u2013 and thus expand \u2013 the muscle of the heart. Lately, I\u2019ve come to realise that I want to read one story: despite everything, it is going to be OK. That \u201cdespite\u201d is key. Solace is distinct from escape, and I\u2019d define a literary comfort novel as distinct from pure escapism. I don\u2019t want the narcotic and temporary palliative of the soap opera \u2013 without judgment, I should add \u2013 but, perhaps because I have been aged or wounded out of fairy stories, I want a more convincing consolation, grounded in real life. The best books rebuild our strength so we can face reality, and maybe even fight to change it. I don\u2019t want briefly to suspend my disbelief. Instead, I long to believe again. Nick Hornby looks for \u201cabsorption, the possibility of jokes or wit, a writer who understands that their job is to entertain the reader. Optimism is nice too. If literature continues to paint itself into the miserable and difficult corner then it will die, and yield the ground it should be occupying to other forms of entertainment. So I am left only with Dickens, Austen, Wodehouse, Wells, Waugh, Green, Vonnegut, Strout, Patchett, Tyler \u2013 and about 500 other authors who wish to provide pleasure to the reader.\u201d Probably there will always remain a snobbery about the optimistic; certainly there endures the belief that optimism is inherently naive, and that a novel can only have literary value if it opens up or illuminates yet another chamber of horrors in the catalogue of human misery. A surprising number of readers believe a happy ending should mean automatic disqualification from any serious literary award. Good luck to them: I wish them joy in their wallowing. In my turn, I\u2019ve come to believe the opposite. To reach only for novels that reaffirm our darkest fears is merely to make an escape of a different sort, not the escapism of brooding heroes and wedding finales, but the security blanket of an equally foregone conclusion: the safety of imagining the worst. I would argue that to live only in that place is simply cowardice in better camouflage. The truth is that it\u2019s far riskier to remain in uncertainty. Far braver, far more radical to keep hoping. Here, then, is my ultimate reading list for soul sustenance. Each is a guaranteed source of humour, compassion and insight; all are by brilliant writers whose sentence-by-sentence work will itself bring pleasure. If these are the only novels you read on loop for the rest of your life, I reckon you\u2019ll be all right. If there\u2019s a more triumphant character in contemporary literature than Audra Cavanaugh, I don\u2019t know her. In Katherine Heiny\u2019s masterpiece, Standard Deviation, Audra is eccentric and inexhaustible, tender-hearted and spectacularly tin-eared, and somehow essentially unknowable to her older husband Graham, despite the fact that she would tell absolutely anything to anyone, and frequently does. Heiny captures the good-faith muddle of a real marriage under strain; a couple absolutely united in their devotion to their 10-year-old son but in little else, it sometimes seems, and it becomes increasingly obvious that Graham is not as straightforward and dependable a character as he himself insists. Here, fidelity and even honesty might be overrated \u2013 love, a sense of shared purpose and a robust sense of humour win the day. Loving deception is also at the centre of Family Happiness by Laurie Colwin: another messy marriage, another sublime New York novel. Polly is the perfect daughter of the perfect Solo-Millers, for whom visits to her artist lover are enabled by the fact that no one in the family takes the remotest interest in her job, though they\u2019d be alarmed if she forgot the olives for lunch. No tidy endings here either, just the bliss of a fantastic and underrated writer. Speaking of underrated, more people in the UK should be reading Kevin Wilson. Nothing to See Here is possibly the ultimate literary comfort read. Lillian\u2019s old school pal Madison calls for Lillian\u2019s help (not the first time that impoverished, vulnerable Lillian is called in to cover for her rich best friend). Madison needs someone to mind the 10-year-old twins from her husband\u2019s first marriage; the minor catch is that Bessie and Roland burst into spontaneous flames whenever they\u2019re upset. Lillian is a dropout and a cynic, wickedly smart and relentlessly hilarious, while her growing connection with the two children is nothing short of transcendent. Most people are horrible and life generally sucks, suggests this novel, and yet. And yet. In unlikely places, humanity flickers and catches alight. It will all \u2013 somehow \u2013 turn out OK. The novels that bring most comfort to writer Sathnam Sanghera all share landlocked settings, as a reader \u201cboth from the Midlands and with heritage from the Punjab\u201d. He\u2019s comforted when the world of the novel feels safe, and cites fellow Black Country writer Jonathan Coe as his ultimate comfort read because \u201cthere\u2019s so much warmth to his characters\u201d. Also Possession by AS Byatt, which is \u201ca book about books, and therefore safety within safety\u201d. For warmth of characters, together with exquisite compassion and humour, James McBride\u2019s The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store is unsurpassed. In the early decades of the 20th century, the residents of Pennsylvania\u2019s Chicken Hill are not exactly living the American dream; African Americans and Jewish immigrants together contend, in their marginalised community, with racism, poverty and disability. They are challenged over and over, but this is an epic novel suffused with hope for humanity, and one which reminds us of the power of community, and love. No list would be complete without an Austen, and my top nomination would always be Persuasion. Her most mature and refined novel, it is still the closest to an escapist fairytale, the Cinderella story of sweet, longsuffering Anne Elliot, burdened with and neglected by her appalling father and sisters. Austen leads us inexorably towards the proposal, the wedding, the man of good fortune, but along the way Anne suffers, and Austen\u2019s clear eyes and sharp nib make the predictable miraculous. I challenge you not to sob when you read Frederick\u2019s letter. Everyone by now has read the wonderful Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus: funny, poignant, unbelievably satisfying. I loved it \u2013 and in a similar vein, have you also read Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette by Maria Semple? The two have in common a gifted woman resisting the role in which she has been cast; losing and then triumphantly finding herself. R\u00f3n\u00e1n Hession\u2019s Panenka breaks my rule that it must all turn out all right \u2013 but it\u2019s a worthy exception. In a substantial sense it will definitely not be OK; it rarely is when the protagonist begins by mentioning that he suffers from the sort of headaches that deliver nights alone curled in agony on the bathroom floor. Yet with Hession\u2019s tender treatment it remains a story of hope, and redemption. Recently reunited with his adult daughter and seven-year-old grandson, Joseph is a retired footballer living in a run-down town, and has for years been held single-handedly responsible for the declining fate of the beloved local team (and thus the town itself), after one misjudged penalty kick. It\u2019s full of warmth and forgiveness, of reconnections and second chances, and what it is, in the end, that really matters. Margaret Drabble\u2019s The Millstone is a delight because nothing in Rosamund\u2019s life should go as well as it does; one keeps expecting her to succumb to the cliches of 1960s unmarried motherhood and yet on she goes, skirting disaster, happy despite what anyone believes she ought to feel about her predicament. In short, she isn\u2019t punished, either by her generation or by the imagination that created her. Ah, yes. There\u2019s another condition I\u2019ve laid down for my own favourites \u2013 writers who treat their characters with respect. I can no longer stomach watching novelists pull the wings off the flies they have written into being. Tom Lake by Ann Patchett takes optimism almost as its guiding principle \u2013 broken hearts heal; lost young people eventually find their way into contented adulthood. It is a sublimely reassuring novel because of its structure: most (but not all) of the novel\u2019s suffering is contained within a long-ago episode, recounted by a narrator who is now a happily married mother in her 50s, picking ripe fruit in the sunshine. If to some that lack of peril makes it saccharine, well, tough cheese. As Ann Patchett herself has said in these pages, \u201cI am a glass-half-full, can-do kind of gal. It\u2019s just the salt in my brain. So, people give me grief about being too hopeful or too cheerful or too interested in family \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not writing all the novels.\u201d Readers are free to give ourselves over to the journey, for we have already taken possession of a happy ending. For the novelist Naomi Alderman a literary comfort read should be \u201ca pep talk in the corner of the boxing ring of life\u201d, and her own favourites are Susanna Clarke\u2019s magisterial Piranesi, \u201cwhich is really a book about surviving a long illness, but somehow also about how it\u2019s OK to be changed by life, by hard times, by the world; that being changed can be a power as well as a wound\u201d. And George Saunders\u2019s Lincoln in the Bardo, \u201cabout a man facing the worst possible thing, the death of his child, and having to haul himself together to save his country. It\u2019s a book that\u2019s rich and tender, and so full of clear-eyed love for humanity \u2013 the belief that, with all our rough edges and unsavouriness, we are still worth saving.\u201d For that, after all, is the heart of what it is to be consoled. Holding fast to our faith that we are worthy; maintaining our determination to save ourselves, and one another. A truly successful comfort novel should leave us a small, smooth pebble of reassurance that we can close into our palm and carry with us, back into the real world, back into the fray. \u2022 Welcome to Glorious Tuga by Francesca Segal is published by Chatto &amp; Windus.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a unicorn of a summer\u2019s day in 2020; the kind that demands factor 50 and flip-flops. I\u2019m being driven around my neighbourhood by my husband, Arlo, my hair pulled up off my neck and a cool can of something fizzy in my hand. My daily medication has kicked in: a serotonin reuptake inhibitor that I\u2019ve taken for 15 years to ease my low-level anxiety. Without it, I\u2019m no longer sure I can stay with this man I have loved for 12 years. I am mute and smiling passively.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s another one!\u201d he points to the right. \u201cAt least it\u2019s not disguised as a tree.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cDo they think we\u2019re idiots?\u201d</p> <p>Arlo is updating me on the new 5G masts that have been covertly installed through the Trojan horse of the pandemic. It\u2019s not the day out I\u2019d anticipated for our Saturday, but this is our life now. What began as a polite request to turn off the microwave after use and switch off the router before bed is now the dictum that if one of these emitters of radioactive deathrays pops up on our street \u201cwe need to move\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to pinpoint the moment that Arlo went down the conspiracy rabbit hole. Today, he can\u2019t even answer the question for himself. He thinks it may have started with a conversation he had in the park, or a film he saw. He\u2019d read George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four at school and it had stayed with him. What came next was a slow radicalisation through his screens and the people he met online. Maybe a curiosity fed into an algorithm that became an echo chamber. Who knows?</p> <p>However, there were indications that something as big as the pandemic might go this way for him. Arlo is the son of liberal parents, born rebels with anti-establishment leanings. He was conceived on the India hippy trail in the 70s. Meanwhile, I grew up in Surrey, in a mock-Tudor house opposite a tennis club. Being with me and my solid family anchored him for a while. Because, yes, I think these 5G masts are an eyesore but I don\u2019t think they will fry my frontal cortex.</p> <p>In 2020, life gradually became a battleground of conspiracies with little basis in fact. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/how-false-claims-about-5g-health-risks-spread-into-the-mainstream\">threat of 5G radiation</a> was just the entry point: by the end of the year, my husband also believed that nanoparticles in the Covid-19 vaccine would be used to integrate us with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/06/internet-of-things-smart-home-smart-city\">Internet of Things</a> (if the vaccine didn\u2019t kill us from myocarditis first); that digital ID would limit our travel and affect financial independence; that debt was a social construct and could be avoided using \u201cmaritime law\u201d; and that only cryptocurrency could save us.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the package?\u201d I asked after I handed over a plump brown envelope.</p> <p>\u201cStickers,\u201d he replied gleefully, spreading them out on the office desk. \u201cYou vil eat ze bugs!\u201d he announced in a crude impersonation of Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum, an organisation that conspiracy theorists were convinced was plotting to have us all <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/03/31/1166649732/conspiracy-theory-eating-bugs-4chan\">eating insects</a> by 2030. I laughed. We were still laughing together at that point.</p> <p>\u201cWe do not consent to lockdown,\u201d he read aloud from another sticker as he raced downstairs to slap it on our front door.</p> <p>\u201cOh please, not there,\u201d I begged him. Too late. It was already glued tight and I couldn\u2019t get my nails under the edges.</p> <p>On Thursdays, we hid behind the curtains of the spare room to watch our neighbours enthusiastically pound their saucepans with wooden spoons for the NHS. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right, get those jabs in,\u201d he mocked. He sure as hell wasn\u2019t getting his vaccination.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to close the borders,\u201d he warned. A&nbsp;relative of Arlo\u2019s had already packed his family into a van and made a break for Portugal to start a new life. Arlo was manically arguing the case for us to leave, too, but I managed to talk him down.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea that this man from\u00a0a corner of England was privy to an international cover-up was ridiculous</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I didn\u2019t recognise my husband as the man I married four years earlier: a charming and adventurous photographer who missed his calling as a lead guitarist, is solid on the tennis court and does uncanny, but not unkind, impressions of our friends. Nor did those friends, or my family \u2013 most of whom blocked him from sending streams of warning content and some of whom would only see me alone. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in the woods for a dog walk,\u201d agreed Arlo\u2019s old friend Justin. \u201cBut can you not bring Arlo? He\u2019ll just do my head in.\u201d</p> <p>Arlo knew he was being blocked by his friends, but the distancing rules meant their absence wasn\u2019t as obvious as it would have been in different times. Which meant it increasingly fell to me to be Arlo\u2019s sounding board. I felt battered. I took my mobile phone into quiet corners of the house to phone my closest friends, but I don\u2019t think anyone but my family really understood the assault on my mental health.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to come round here to get a break?\u201d my sister offered, since she lived just 10 minutes away. She could hear my distress and was angry. \u201cI\u2019m going to text him.\u201d</p> <p>When she did, that opened a dialogue for Arlo. \u201cJust watch this, please,\u201d he wrote back, with a link to a documentary on vaccine injuries, and then another link to a podcast episode from Joe Rogan, and then another. There was an answer to everything if you challenged the material. Everything was binary, nothing was nuanced. Arlo had \u201cQuestion the Narrative\u201d printed on some T-shirts. At least now people could see him coming.</p> <p>I got dizzy trying to extract the logic from some of his arguments.</p> <p>\u201cHow the hell was 9/11 an inside job?\u201d I asked, exasperated.</p> <p>\u201cYou should look into building No 7 at the World Trade Center. It was the biggest faux pas of mainstream media when the BBC said it had gone down \u2026 before it actually did. They knew it was going to happen. Why? Because it had debt bonds that were due to mature the next day. Then Bin Laden was flown out of the country, despite airspace being shut down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd how does Arlo from Crystal Palace know that?\u201d My jaw clenched, braced for another fight. The idea that this man from a corner of England was privy to an international cover-up was ridiculous. I couldn\u2019t accept his worldview. I had to believe in the good in people. I&nbsp;had to hope the pandemic was an accident and not, as Arlo believed, something inflicted on us to sell vaccines and facilitate the biggest wealth transfer in history.</p> <p>I remember fighting back tears after these interactions. I felt as if I was losing my grip on what was real and what wasn\u2019t, and sometimes the evidence was even convincing. There <em>was</em> a link between the Covid vaccines and an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, that was true; the British Heart Foundation <a href=\"https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/coronavirus-and-your-health/coronavirus-vaccine-your-questions-answered/myocarditis-and-covid-19-vaccines-should-you-be-worried#:~:text=research%20is%20happening%3F-,Do%20Covid%2D19%20vaccines%20cause%20myocarditis%20and%20pericarditis%3F,the%20lining%20around%20the%20heart.\">wrote as much</a>.</p> <p>I tried to dig into my journalist roots, the need to corroborate information with several parties, to find out if evidence was peer-reviewed, to show due diligence. But Arlo was impassioned and articulate and it was too overwhelming to keep up.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>In early 2021, we sold our holiday apartment in Mallorca. Neither of us had worked much in the pandemic, living off the small furlough we received from his limited company. Arlo gave me 30% of the money from the sale and immediately started investing the rest in a slew of \u201calternative\u201d crypto coins.</p> <p>Along with the trading came a barrage of shouty, red-faced shock jocks: BitBoy, Krypto Karl and Elon Musk were often in his ear. There was much furtive exchange of intel on Telegram. Something about cryptocurrency aligned with the ideologies he\u2019d adopted: it promised decentralised power and transparent data on a ledger that could be read by all. I wasn\u2019t against it, in principle.</p> <p>By May, Arlo had invested thousands in Dogecoin, which was also known as a \u201cjoke\u201d or \u201cmeme\u201d coin, namechecked in various tweets by Musk. The billionaire was due to appear on Saturday Night Live and Arlo was galvanised for a big increase in value. I also needed a night out.</p> <p>We went to see Cabaret in the West End of London. Arlo wasn\u2019t into musicals, but he had always been a \u201cyes\u201d person; culturally engaged and up for any new experience. I loved that about him. We had cocktails, laughed and flirted. Away from any devices, we talked about the show as we walked back, hand in hand, along the Strand.</p> <p>Seeing the \u201cold\u201d Arlo being fun and caring, I felt sorry for him. He just wanted to feel control in a world that was spiralling out of it. That\u2019s what these conspiracies gave him: a sense of being in on \u201cthe truth\u201d. He was looking out for those he loved, worried that they would be corralled into taking vaccines that had been rushed through without a lengthy period for testing. He was our protector and the threat was a global pandemic. How could anyone behave normally in those circumstances?</p> <p>Still, we came home and within minutes he had his head in his hands.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked nervously.</p> <p>In the time we\u2019d been at the theatre, Musk had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/may/09/saturday-night-live-elon-musk\">an awkward host of SNL</a> and took part in a skit that branded Dogecoin a \u201chustle\u201d.

We\u2019d lost thousands. I was too tired and overwhelmed to fight about it.</p>    <p>\u201cI met a guy at the park who\u2019s made a million,\u201d Arlo told me the next day, trying to convince me that he needed to stay in the game. Then a friend from the coast gave notice on his job, able to retire on his bitcoin haul. Happy endings were just a few degrees of separation away. But Arlo was not an early adopter, and while bitcoin and ethereum were established coins, the market was flooded with \u201calt\u201d currencies, and for every big winner there had to be a multitude of losers. We were losers and the debts were mounting.</p> <p>He\u2019d lost about \u00a330,000 from the Mallorca property sale by this point and our credit cards were almost maxed out. I was less angry about the waste of money than the impact of Arlo\u2019s stress on me. The more he lost, the more I had to endure his temper and the manic energy that followed as he tried to rectify things.</p> <p>I was alarmed and disempowered by this new shift&nbsp;in&nbsp;our marriage and by my financial vulnerability. I&nbsp;tried to manage our living space, constantly racing to&nbsp;the radio to change from news of more confusing lockdown parameters to 6 Music, and deleting emails&nbsp;in&nbsp;his inbox from YouTube channels he subscribed to. It was exhausting, and just when I\u2019d asserted some control, he\u2019d find some documentary about how the moon landings were faked and the world was suddenly a place filled with lies, manipulation and fear again.</p> <p>We went to see the James Bond film No Time to Die. When L\u00e9a Seydoux\u2019s character infected herself with a nanobot, Arlo turned to me and whispered, \u201cI told you that technology exists!\u201d Confirmation bias was everywhere. Not even the Picturehouse was safe.</p> <p>We did agree on something. Well, someone: Russell Brand. In 2021, he was still a figure we could both get behind. He believed we should all form our own self-governing communities and stay free by being informed, yes, but more importantly, by being hopeful and proactive. It helped that he was also easy on the eye, and funny.</p> <p>But I was hanging on by the skin of my teeth, spending longer on dog walks and more nights in the spare room to give myself space and conserve my sanity. I still loved Arlo, despite the stress his ideologies had caused me. And by the end of the year Covid seemed to be dissipating; a new dawn in sight.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The following spring of 2022, Arlo left me for six weeks to start an off-grid commune in Portugal. The crypto trading was going badly and he was still losing our money, hand over fist, but land in Portugal was the latest plan \u2013 a place where he thought he could shield those he loved and live a self-sustained life away from the grip of big pharma, invasive tech and authoritarian governments. His relative had been reporting back from&nbsp;the Mondego valley and encouraging him to invest&nbsp;there.</p> <p>Portugal has tax incentives for populating the rural regions with eco-friendly businesses and, most importantly, any profits made from crypto are tax-free. I didn\u2019t fight the idea; I looked forward to the peace and&nbsp;quiet.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere near this Portugal plot unless there is a 30-metre lap pool,\u201d I declared.</p> <p>\u201cFine, but first we need a composting toilet!\u201d</p> <p>It was a Wednesday and I was home from hot yoga, a coffee in hand. Arlo sent me a video. He was at a place called the Pineal Foundation he\u2019d found on Instagram; a community of flat-Earthers who identified as a \u201csovereign autonomous nation state\u201d. His relative had stayed there and learned skills that Arlo thought might be useful for his build. I was pleased he hadn\u2019t lost his sense of humour when we giggled at their 3D model of the Earth \u2013 a contradiction in itself \u2013 and earnest explanations of how the horizon doesn\u2019t align with our taught mathematics.</p> <p>He described a community leader dressed in ceremonial white and purple robes; a kindly man who was in a polyamorous relationship with a few women in the group. The food was delicious, Arlo said. He showed me plates filled high with farm to fork produce: crispy kale, foraged mushrooms, grains and pomegranate seeds.</p> <p>The next day, I woke to find the car being clamped for an \u201cunlawful\u201d fine that Arlo had challenged. One of many, as it turned out. The dog needed walking and I needed the car to get to the park. I was fuming. I stormed out to meet the bailiff without shoes on my feet and a face like thunder.</p> <p>\u201cThis is my husband, right?\u201d He read out the name on the paperwork, as if it needed confirming.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Arlo had been hanging out at a wellness space founded by conspiracy theorists. Without my knowledge, he paid them \u00a38,000</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I stumbled attempting to explain Arlo\u2019s rationale for nonpayment (something to do with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawman_theory\">strawmen</a> and maritime law), before stabbing my pin number into the bailiff\u2019s card machine and parting with \u00a3600. He gave me a tight smile, intended to show empathy. \u201cYup. I&nbsp;hear it more and more, that conspiracy talk.\u201d</p> <p>When I relayed the incident to Arlo, he suggested that while more fines were being contested I should hide the car around the neighbourhood to avoid detection. My coffee tasted bitter and the froth had dissolved. I wished he\u2019d come home.</p> <p>Arlo returned after six weeks, as promised, buoyed up by the co-purchase of five hectares of verdant land in the Mondego valley at a cost of \u00a320,000. He took out a loan for his part in it. \u201cIt has 60 mature olive trees to make our own virgin olive oil and huge monolithic boulders full of quartz crystals. The land is so fertile. And it has three stone ruins we can convert \u2013 and spring water!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat will I do there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re an actress, you can start an amateur dramatics society.\u201d</p> <p>My heart sank.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I read some bad press about the Pineal Foundation. A 13-month-old baby in the community had died from an unspecified health problem. The infant had never been seen by a doctor or taken to hospital. They didn\u2019t register the death, choosing instead to honour the child\u2019s memory with a ceremony of their own, cremating the body and scattering the ashes in a river. It was probably deeply meaningful, surrounded by nature, but it also set a dangerous precedent. If we don\u2019t register births and deaths, then we make ourselves vulnerable to those who mean us harm. Thankfully, Arlo agreed, and didn\u2019t go back to the foundation after that.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It was summer and Arlo had been hanging out at a London wellness space founded by some conspiracy theorists, where he heard about a company called Matrix Freedom. Without my knowledge, Arlo paid them \u00a38,000 to write off his loans, credit card and mortgage debt using \u201cmaritime law\u201d and access webinars about the process.</p> <p>Their website states: \u201cThe surname on your birth certificate, deliberately written in capital letters, is not you. It is your agent of commerce, known otherwise as your \u2018Strawman\u2019. Your strawman is a debtor operating in commerce under the law of the sea.\u201d I wondered if the Tin Man and the Lion were also complicit, but of course it turned out that this was just another <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawman_theory\">discredited conspiracy theory</a>. The Financial Conduct Authority issued a <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/senj-limited-seychelles-mortgagefree-natural-justice-sovereign-reserve-matrix-freedom\">warning</a> about the company in 2021, but Arlo didn\u2019t heed it. Six months after handing over that \u00a38,000, Arlo was asking for a refund and not having his emails or phone calls returned.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t believe that he had fallen for that rubbish, furious with the people who\u2019d scammed him. I wanted our money back, so we needed to go to their office and confront them. Arlo accepted he\u2019d been conned and wanted answers, too.</p> <p>So, there we were, in a ghostly industrial estate on the outskirts of Chessington, Surrey. Each door in the building was protected by key codes, but we managed to slip in behind the one person who seemed to be on site. I was simultaneously fired up for confrontation but also a bit excited to be on a covert mission of our&nbsp;own. Eventually, two female bruisers who looked as if&nbsp;they were married to the mob came out from nowhere.&nbsp;I felt immediately under threat. These were not people I wanted to mess with. I surreptitiously wedged my phone between crossed arms to video the&nbsp;conversation.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re keeping our money and you\u2019re not returning it, that\u2019s why I\u2019m angry,\u201d I began.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the day, the process has changed,\u201d one of the women said. \u201cWe\u2019ve explained all of that \u2026 we\u2019ve said about going on to the webinars.\u201d</p> <p>Fifteen minutes went by and nothing they said made sense. They were evasive; they said the payment terminals were not working to authorise a refund; that their boss had the final say, in any case. They used the word \u201cprocess\u201d a lot. I suspected they knew they were being filmed.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no refunds,\u201d they eventually told us, glibly. We followed up by email, but it came to nothing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/04/escape-from-the-rabbit-hole-the-conspiracy-theorist-who-abandoned-his-dangerous-beliefs\">Escape from the rabbit hole: the conspiracy theorist who abandoned his dangerous beliefs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Taking stock of where we are now, we have lost a lot of money, but with that has come acceptance for Arlo. The magic beans have not grown us a fortune and he has stopped trading the little remains of his crypto \u201cinvestment\u201d, and returned to his photography career with a renewed enthusiasm. I am grateful for this innate talent. Without it, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019d have found purpose, coming out of that hole.</p> <p>The Matrix Freedom debacle helped crush some of Arlo\u2019s more radical theories. Then Russell Brand, our go-to voice of the alternative media, became a Christian and the subject of allegations of sexual misconduct (which he denies), and we both went off him. His channel has become another shouty, manipulative shopfront, appealing to a new US audience with clickbait tropes such as, \u201cThis is really happening!\u201d and, \u201cIt\u2019s started!\u201d We aren\u2019t even alarmed by the content, just bored.</p> <p>Arlo acknowledges that he needs to raise investment for the Portugal retreat and not treat our bank account as its money pit. He has opened a joint bank account to give me more financial say and security. He admits that some of what he had prophesied has not happened. Our borders have not closed; we travel as much as we always have. He\u2019s learning that old adage of focusing on what you can control and letting go of what you can\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t handle myself better; I was a wrecking ball,\u201d Arlo says to me in the darkness of our bedroom at night. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the tools to express myself properly. I was scared, but I\u2019ll do better.\u201d</p> <p>Our marriage survived Arlo\u2019s radicalisation because I knew his heart was in the right place, because I was medicated, and because, to my surprise, I\u2019m able to concede that some of what he was shouting about has come to pass.</p> <p>As I write, Mark Zuckerberg has just penned an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxlpjlgdzjo\">open letter to the US House Committee chair</a> regretting that he censored material related to the Covid pandemic under pressure from the Biden administration. A&nbsp;perfect example of government overreach. </p> <p>As a result, I&nbsp;acknowledge that there may have been a kernel of truth to some of the theories he shared.</p> <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s scar tissue. My parents took a long time to start inviting him round again, and a few friends still won\u2019t \u201cgo there\u201d if he triggers any kind of polarising debate. We never used to argue about money. We absolutely do now. And yes, I\u2019m still on high alert for anything shouty coming from his headphones or suspicious withdrawals from our bank account.</p> <p>Arlo was on a big commercial shoot this summer \u2013 three days in Lisbon for a food brand. I knew he would&nbsp;be&nbsp;back from Gatwick knackered and starving, so I had some dinner on the go when he walked through&nbsp;the door.</p> <p>\u201cI got us these,\u201d he said and handed me two exquisite past\u00e9is de nata, boxed and tied with a ribbon, so I popped them in the fridge for afters.</p> <p>When I turned back around, Arlo had transformed some leftover tinfoil into a stupid hat.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I went a bit mad,\u201d he said out of nowhere and, just like that, we were finally laughing about it. </p> <p><em>Some names have been changed</em><em>.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a unicorn of a summer\u2019s day in 2020; the kind that demands factor 50 and flip-flops. I\u2019m being driven around my neighbourhood by my husband, Arlo, my hair pulled up off my neck and a cool can of something fizzy in my hand. My daily medication has kicked in: a serotonin reuptake inhibitor that I\u2019ve taken for 15 years to ease my low-level anxiety. Without it, I\u2019m no longer sure I can stay with this man I have loved for 12 years. I am mute and smiling passively. \u201cThere\u2019s another one!\u201d he points to the right. \u201cAt least it\u2019s not disguised as a tree.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cDo they think we\u2019re idiots?\u201d Arlo is updating me on the new 5G masts that have been covertly installed through the Trojan horse of the pandemic. It\u2019s not the day out I\u2019d anticipated for our Saturday, but this is our life now. What began as a polite request to turn off the microwave after use and switch off the router before bed is now the dictum that if one of these emitters of radioactive deathrays pops up on our street \u201cwe need to move\u201d. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint the moment that Arlo went down the conspiracy rabbit hole. Today, he can\u2019t even answer the question for himself. He thinks it may have started with a conversation he had in the park, or a film he saw. He\u2019d read George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four at school and it had stayed with him. What came next was a slow radicalisation through his screens and the people he met online. Maybe a curiosity fed into an algorithm that became an echo chamber. Who knows? However, there were indications that something as big as the pandemic might go this way for him. Arlo is the son of liberal parents, born rebels with anti-establishment leanings. He was conceived on the India hippy trail in the 70s. Meanwhile, I grew up in Surrey, in a mock-Tudor house opposite a tennis club. Being with me and my solid family anchored him for a while. Because, yes, I think these 5G masts are an eyesore but I don\u2019t think they will fry my frontal cortex. In 2020, life gradually became a battleground of conspiracies with little basis in fact. The threat of 5G radiation was just the entry point: by the end of the year, my husband also believed that nanoparticles in the Covid-19 vaccine would be used to integrate us with the Internet of Things (if the vaccine didn\u2019t kill us from myocarditis first); that digital ID would limit our travel and affect financial independence; that debt was a social construct and could be avoided using \u201cmaritime law\u201d; and that only cryptocurrency could save us. \u201cWhat\u2019s the package?\u201d I asked after I handed over a plump brown envelope. \u201cStickers,\u201d he replied gleefully, spreading them out on the office desk. \u201cYou vil eat ze bugs!\u201d he announced in a crude impersonation of Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum, an organisation that conspiracy theorists were convinced was plotting to have us all eating insects by 2030. I laughed. We were still laughing together at that point. \u201cWe do not consent to lockdown,\u201d he read aloud from another sticker as he raced downstairs to slap it on our front door. \u201cOh please, not there,\u201d I begged him. Too late. It was already glued tight and I couldn\u2019t get my nails under the edges. On Thursdays, we hid behind the curtains of the spare room to watch our neighbours enthusiastically pound their saucepans with wooden spoons for the NHS. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right, get those jabs in,\u201d he mocked. He sure as hell wasn\u2019t getting his vaccination. \u201cThey\u2019re going to close the borders,\u201d he warned. A relative of Arlo\u2019s had already packed his family into a van and made a break for Portugal to start a new life. Arlo was manically arguing the case for us to leave, too, but I managed to talk him down. I didn\u2019t recognise my husband as the man I married four years earlier: a charming and adventurous photographer who missed his calling as a lead guitarist, is solid on the tennis court and does uncanny, but not unkind, impressions of our friends. Nor did those friends, or my family \u2013 most of whom blocked him from sending streams of warning content and some of whom would only see me alone. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in the woods for a dog walk,\u201d agreed Arlo\u2019s old friend Justin. \u201cBut can you not bring Arlo? He\u2019ll just do my head in.\u201d Arlo knew he was being blocked by his friends, but the distancing rules meant their absence wasn\u2019t as obvious as it would have been in different times. Which meant it increasingly fell to me to be Arlo\u2019s sounding board. I felt battered. I took my mobile phone into quiet corners of the house to phone my closest friends, but I don\u2019t think anyone but my family really understood the assault on my mental health. \u201cDo you want to come round here to get a break?\u201d my sister offered, since she lived just 10 minutes away. She could hear my distress and was angry. \u201cI\u2019m going to text him.\u201d When she did, that opened a dialogue for Arlo. \u201cJust watch this, please,\u201d he wrote back, with a link to a documentary on vaccine injuries, and then another link to a podcast episode from Joe Rogan, and then another. There was an answer to everything if you challenged the material. Everything was binary, nothing was nuanced. Arlo had \u201cQuestion the Narrative\u201d printed on some T-shirts. At least now people could see him coming. I got dizzy trying to extract the logic from some of his arguments. \u201cHow the hell was 9/11 an inside job?\u201d I asked, exasperated. \u201cYou should look into building No 7 at the World Trade Center. It was the biggest faux pas of mainstream media when the BBC said it had gone down \u2026 before it actually did. They knew it was going to happen. Why? Because it had debt bonds that were due to mature the next day. Then Bin Laden was flown out of the country, despite airspace being shut down.\u201d \u201cAnd how does Arlo from Crystal Palace know that?\u201d My jaw clenched, braced for another fight. The idea that this man from a corner of England was privy to an international cover-up was ridiculous. I couldn\u2019t accept his worldview. I had to believe in the good in people. I had to hope the pandemic was an accident and not, as Arlo believed, something inflicted on us to sell vaccines and facilitate the biggest wealth transfer in history. I remember fighting back tears after these interactions. I felt as if I was losing my grip on what was real and what wasn\u2019t, and sometimes the evidence was even convincing. There was a link between the Covid vaccines and an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, that was true; the British Heart Foundation wrote as much. I tried to dig into my journalist roots, the need to corroborate information with several parties, to find out if evidence was peer-reviewed, to show due diligence. But Arlo was impassioned and articulate and it was too overwhelming to keep up. * * * In early 2021, we sold our holiday apartment in Mallorca. Neither of us had worked much in the pandemic, living off the small furlough we received from his limited company. Arlo gave me 30% of the money from the sale and immediately started investing the rest in a slew of \u201calternative\u201d crypto coins. Along with the trading came a barrage of shouty, red-faced shock jocks: BitBoy, Krypto Karl and Elon Musk were often in his ear. There was much furtive exchange of intel on Telegram. Something about cryptocurrency aligned with the ideologies he\u2019d adopted: it promised decentralised power and transparent data on a ledger that could be read by all. I wasn\u2019t against it, in principle. By May, Arlo had invested thousands in Dogecoin, which was also known as a \u201cjoke\u201d or \u201cmeme\u201d coin, namechecked in various tweets by Musk. The billionaire was due to appear on Saturday Night Live and Arlo was galvanised for a big increase in value. I also needed a night out. We went to see Cabaret in the West End of London. Arlo wasn\u2019t into musicals, but he had always been a \u201cyes\u201d person; culturally engaged and up for any new experience. I loved that about him. We had cocktails, laughed and flirted. Away from any devices, we talked about the show as we walked back, hand in hand, along the Strand. Seeing the \u201cold\u201d Arlo being fun and caring, I felt sorry for him. He just wanted to feel control in a world that was spiralling out of it. That\u2019s what these conspiracies gave him: a sense of being in on \u201cthe truth\u201d. He was looking out for those he loved, worried that they would be corralled into taking vaccines that had been rushed through without a lengthy period for testing. He was our protector and the threat was a global pandemic. How could anyone behave normally in those circumstances? Still, we came home and within minutes he had his head in his hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked nervously. In the time we\u2019d been at the theatre, Musk had been an awkward host of SNL and took part in a skit that branded Dogecoin a \u201chustle\u201d. It didn\u2019t give the market confidence. As a result, the coin had crashed in value by 29.5%. We\u2019d lost thousands. I was too tired and overwhelmed to fight about it. \u201cI met a guy at the park who\u2019s made a million,\u201d Arlo told me the next day, trying to convince me that he needed to stay in the game. Then a friend from the coast gave notice on his job, able to retire on his bitcoin haul. Happy endings were just a few degrees of separation away. But Arlo was not an early adopter, and while bitcoin and ethereum were established coins, the market was flooded with \u201calt\u201d currencies, and for every big winner there had to be a multitude of losers. We were losers and the debts were mounting. He\u2019d lost about \u00a330,000 from the Mallorca property sale by this point and our credit cards were almost maxed out. I was less angry about the waste of money than the impact of Arlo\u2019s stress on me. The more he lost, the more I had to endure his temper and the manic energy that followed as he tried to rectify things. I was alarmed and disempowered by this new shift in our marriage and by my financial vulnerability. I tried to manage our living space, constantly racing to the radio to change from news of more confusing lockdown parameters to 6 Music, and deleting emails in his inbox from YouTube channels he subscribed to. It was exhausting, and just when I\u2019d asserted some control, he\u2019d find some documentary about how the moon landings were faked and the world was suddenly a place filled with lies, manipulation and fear again. We went to see the James Bond film No Time to Die. When L\u00e9a Seydoux\u2019s character infected herself with a nanobot, Arlo turned to me and whispered, \u201cI told you that technology exists!\u201d Confirmation bias was everywhere. Not even the Picturehouse was safe. We did agree on something. Well, someone: Russell Brand. In 2021, he was still a figure we could both get behind. He believed we should all form our own self-governing communities and stay free by being informed, yes, but more importantly, by being hopeful and proactive. It helped that he was also easy on the eye, and funny. But I was hanging on by the skin of my teeth, spending longer on dog walks and more nights in the spare room to give myself space and conserve my sanity. I still loved Arlo, despite the stress his ideologies had caused me. And by the end of the year Covid seemed to be dissipating; a new dawn in sight. * * * The following spring of 2022, Arlo left me for six weeks to start an off-grid commune in Portugal. The crypto trading was going badly and he was still losing our money, hand over fist, but land in Portugal was the latest plan \u2013 a place where he thought he could shield those he loved and live a self-sustained life away from the grip of big pharma, invasive tech and authoritarian governments. His relative had been reporting back from the Mondego valley and encouraging him to invest there. Portugal has tax incentives for populating the rural regions with eco-friendly businesses and, most importantly, any profits made from crypto are tax-free. I didn\u2019t fight the idea; I looked forward to the peace and quiet. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere near this Portugal plot unless there is a 30-metre lap pool,\u201d I declared. \u201cFine, but first we need a composting toilet!\u201d It was a Wednesday and I was home from hot yoga, a coffee in hand. Arlo sent me a video. He was at a place called the Pineal Foundation he\u2019d found on Instagram; a community of flat-Earthers who identified as a \u201csovereign autonomous nation state\u201d. His relative had stayed there and learned skills that Arlo thought might be useful for his build. I was pleased he hadn\u2019t lost his sense of humour when we giggled at their 3D model of the Earth \u2013 a contradiction in itself \u2013 and earnest explanations of how the horizon doesn\u2019t align with our taught mathematics. He described a community leader dressed in ceremonial white and purple robes; a kindly man who was in a polyamorous relationship with a few women in the group. The food was delicious, Arlo said. He showed me plates filled high with farm to fork produce: crispy kale, foraged mushrooms, grains and pomegranate seeds. The next day, I woke to find the car being clamped for an \u201cunlawful\u201d fine that Arlo had challenged. One of many, as it turned out. The dog needed walking and I needed the car to get to the park. I was fuming. I stormed out to meet the bailiff without shoes on my feet and a face like thunder. \u201cThis is my husband, right?\u201d He read out the name on the paperwork, as if it needed confirming. I stumbled attempting to explain Arlo\u2019s rationale for nonpayment (something to do with strawmen and maritime law), before stabbing my pin number into the bailiff\u2019s card machine and parting with \u00a3600. He gave me a tight smile, intended to show empathy. \u201cYup. I hear it more and more, that conspiracy talk.\u201d When I relayed the incident to Arlo, he suggested that while more fines were being contested I should hide the car around the neighbourhood to avoid detection. My coffee tasted bitter and the froth had dissolved. I wished he\u2019d come home. Arlo returned after six weeks, as promised, buoyed up by the co-purchase of five hectares of verdant land in the Mondego valley at a cost of \u00a320,000. He took out a loan for his part in it. \u201cIt has 60 mature olive trees to make our own virgin olive oil and huge monolithic boulders full of quartz crystals. The land is so fertile. And it has three stone ruins we can convert \u2013 and spring water!\u201d \u201cWhat will I do there?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re an actress, you can start an amateur dramatics society.\u201d My heart sank. Meanwhile, I read some bad press about the Pineal Foundation. A 13-month-old baby in the community had died from an unspecified health problem. The infant had never been seen by a doctor or taken to hospital. They didn\u2019t register the death, choosing instead to honour the child\u2019s memory with a ceremony of their own, cremating the body and scattering the ashes in a river. It was probably deeply meaningful, surrounded by nature, but it also set a dangerous precedent. If we don\u2019t register births and deaths, then we make ourselves vulnerable to those who mean us harm. Thankfully, Arlo agreed, and didn\u2019t go back to the foundation after that. * * * It was summer and Arlo had been hanging out at a London wellness space founded by some conspiracy theorists, where he heard about a company called Matrix Freedom. Without my knowledge, Arlo paid them \u00a38,000 to write off his loans, credit card and mortgage debt using \u201cmaritime law\u201d and access webinars about the process. Their website states: \u201cThe surname on your birth certificate, deliberately written in capital letters, is not you. It is your agent of commerce, known otherwise as your \u2018Strawman\u2019. Your strawman is a debtor operating in commerce under the law of the sea.\u201d I wondered if the Tin Man and the Lion were also complicit, but of course it turned out that this was just another discredited conspiracy theory. The Financial Conduct Authority issued a warning about the company in 2021, but Arlo didn\u2019t heed it. Six months after handing over that \u00a38,000, Arlo was asking for a refund and not having his emails or phone calls returned. I couldn\u2019t believe that he had fallen for that rubbish, furious with the people who\u2019d scammed him. I wanted our money back, so we needed to go to their office and confront them. Arlo accepted he\u2019d been conned and wanted answers, too. So, there we were, in a ghostly industrial estate on the outskirts of Chessington, Surrey. Each door in the building was protected by key codes, but we managed to slip in behind the one person who seemed to be on site. I was simultaneously fired up for confrontation but also a bit excited to be on a covert mission of our own. Eventually, two female bruisers who looked as if they were married to the mob came out from nowhere. I felt immediately under threat. These were not people I wanted to mess with. I surreptitiously wedged my phone between crossed arms to video the conversation. \u201cYou\u2019re keeping our money and you\u2019re not returning it, that\u2019s why I\u2019m angry,\u201d I began. \u201cAt the end of the day, the process has changed,\u201d one of the women said. \u201cWe\u2019ve explained all of that \u2026 we\u2019ve said about going on to the webinars.\u201d Fifteen minutes went by and nothing they said made sense. They were evasive; they said the payment terminals were not working to authorise a refund; that their boss had the final say, in any case. They used the word \u201cprocess\u201d a lot. I suspected they knew they were being filmed. \u201cThere are no refunds,\u201d they eventually told us, glibly. We followed up by email, but it came to nothing. Taking stock of where we are now, we have lost a lot of money, but with that has come acceptance for Arlo. The magic beans have not grown us a fortune and he has stopped trading the little remains of his crypto \u201cinvestment\u201d, and returned to his photography career with a renewed enthusiasm. I am grateful for this innate talent. Without it, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019d have found purpose, coming out of that hole. The Matrix Freedom debacle helped crush some of Arlo\u2019s more radical theories. Then Russell Brand, our go-to voice of the alternative media, became a Christian and the subject of allegations of sexual misconduct (which he denies), and we both went off him. His channel has become another shouty, manipulative shopfront, appealing to a new US audience with clickbait tropes such as, \u201cThis is really happening!\u201d and, \u201cIt\u2019s started!\u201d We aren\u2019t even alarmed by the content, just bored. Arlo acknowledges that he needs to raise investment for the Portugal retreat and not treat our bank account as its money pit. He has opened a joint bank account to give me more financial say and security. He admits that some of what he had prophesied has not happened. Our borders have not closed; we travel as much as we always have. He\u2019s learning that old adage of focusing on what you can control and letting go of what you can\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t handle myself better; I was a wrecking ball,\u201d Arlo says to me in the darkness of our bedroom at night. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the tools to express myself properly. I was scared, but I\u2019ll do better.\u201d Our marriage survived Arlo\u2019s radicalisation because I knew his heart was in the right place, because I was medicated, and because, to my surprise, I\u2019m able to concede that some of what he was shouting about has come to pass. As I write, Mark Zuckerberg has just penned an open letter to the US House Committee chair regretting that he censored material related to the Covid pandemic under pressure from the Biden administration. A perfect example of government overreach. As a result, I acknowledge that there may have been a kernel of truth to some of the theories he shared. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s scar tissue. My parents took a long time to start inviting him round again, and a few friends still won\u2019t \u201cgo there\u201d if he triggers any kind of polarising debate. We never used to argue about money. We absolutely do now. And yes, I\u2019m still on high alert for anything shouty coming from his headphones or suspicious withdrawals from our bank account. Arlo was on a big commercial shoot this summer \u2013 three days in Lisbon for a food brand. I knew he would be back from Gatwick knackered and starving, so I had some dinner on the go when he walked through the door. \u201cI got us these,\u201d he said and handed me two exquisite past\u00e9is de nata, boxed and tied with a ribbon, so I popped them in the fridge for afters. When I turned back around, Arlo had transformed some leftover tinfoil into a stupid hat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I went a bit mad,\u201d he said out of nowhere and, just like that, we were finally laughing about it. Some names have been changed.",

      "body": "<p>More than 30 former firefighters, police officers and other public servants who died in the line of duty have become the first recipients of an award in recognition of their service.</p> <p>The Elizabeth Emblem, named after the late queen, will be awarded to the next of kin of those who died in public service. Among those honoured are PCs Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone, who were murdered by Dale Cregan in Greater Manchester in 2012.</p>    <p>After a campaign by their fathers, Bryn Hughes and Paul Bone, it was announced earlier this year that the emblem would be awarded to the next of kin of police officers, firefighters and other public servants.</p> <p>Bone, from Pool-in-Wharfedale, West Yorkshire, said every public sector worker who dies in the line of duty \u201cshould have the opportunity to be remembered and honoured\u201d.</p> <p>Hughes said: \u201cI think it\u2019s vitally important, not just for Nicola and Fiona and for other police officers, but for all public sector workers who are killed or die in the line of duty or in operational circumstances. It\u2019s vitally important that they\u2019re recognised and remembered.\u201d</p> <p>The honour is the civilian equivalent of the Elizabeth Cross, which recognises members of the UK armed forces who died in action or as a result of a terrorist attack. Hughes said politicians had told him the award was \u201clong overdue\u201d, adding \u201cthere was an element of surprise that nothing like this existed before\u201d.</p> <p>Both men met the prime minister and the Cabinet Office minister, Pat McFadden, on Wednesday. Bone said Keir Starmer told them \u201che couldn\u2019t imagine losing his children\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe replied: \u2018Well, we didn\u2019t actually imagine losing ours either, but once it\u2019s happened, you\u2019ve got to carry on.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The design of the emblem includes a rosemary wreath, a traditional symbol of remembrance, surrounding a Tudor crown and the inscription \u201cFor a Life Given in Service\u201d.</p> <p>Asked how his daughter would feel about the award, Hughes said: \u201cI know Nicola would be embarrassed. I think she\u2019d be pleased and proud that it had happened for us, but I think she\u2019d be embarrassed about it.\u201d</p> <p>Bone said he would like their daughters to be remembered as \u201chappy, bubbly public servants\u201d, adding \u201cthey were doing their job happily, tried to help people \u2013 on that day it just went all wrong\u201d.</p> <p>Hughes, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, said: \u201cPolice officers put their lives on the line every single day. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going into. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s behind that door, and for me, that says a lot about what they do every day.\u201d</p> <p>Other recipients of the award include the police officer PC Andrew Harper, who worked for Thames Valley police, and was killed while responding to a bike theft by three teenagers in Berkshire in August 2019. He was caught in a strap attached to the back of a car and dragged down a winding country road, just four weeks after getting married. The emblem was given to his widow, Lissie.</p> <p>The daughter of the firefighter Leslie Marsh, of West Midlands fire service, will be awarded the Emblem 75 years after he died falling through a hole in the first floor of a derelict church when responding to a fire on 7 February 1949.</p> <p>Starmer said: \u201cWe must never forget those who have given their lives to protect others in the line of duty. While families will never be able to replace their loved ones, the Elizabeth Emblem pays tribute to the sacrifice they have made.\u201d</p> <p>The chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, chief constable Gavin Stephens, said: \u201cWhen a colleague dies in the line of duty, shockwaves and sadness reverberate throughout policing. The families, friends and loved ones left behind bear the enduring pain of sacrifice in public service. We owe them a debt of gratitude as we remember their loved ones, always. We recognise their next of kin and pay tribute to them.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "More than 30 former firefighters, police officers and other public servants who died in the line of duty have become the first recipients of an award in recognition of their service. The Elizabeth Emblem, named after the late queen, will be awarded to the next of kin of those who died in public service. Among those honoured are PCs Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone, who were murdered by Dale Cregan in Greater Manchester in 2012. After a campaign by their fathers, Bryn Hughes and Paul Bone, it was announced earlier this year that the emblem would be awarded to the next of kin of police officers, firefighters and other public servants. Bone, from Pool-in-Wharfedale, West Yorkshire, said every public sector worker who dies in the line of duty \u201cshould have the opportunity to be remembered and honoured\u201d. Hughes said: \u201cI think it\u2019s vitally important, not just for Nicola and Fiona and for other police officers, but for all public sector workers who are killed or die in the line of duty or in operational circumstances. It\u2019s vitally important that they\u2019re recognised and remembered.\u201d The honour is the civilian equivalent of the Elizabeth Cross, which recognises members of the UK armed forces who died in action or as a result of a terrorist attack. Hughes said politicians had told him the award was \u201clong overdue\u201d, adding \u201cthere was an element of surprise that nothing like this existed before\u201d. Both men met the prime minister and the Cabinet Office minister, Pat McFadden, on Wednesday. Bone said Keir Starmer told them \u201che couldn\u2019t imagine losing his children\u201d. He added: \u201cWe replied: \u2018Well, we didn\u2019t actually imagine losing ours either, but once it\u2019s happened, you\u2019ve got to carry on.\u2019\u201d The design of the emblem includes a rosemary wreath, a traditional symbol of remembrance, surrounding a Tudor crown and the inscription \u201cFor a Life Given in Service\u201d. Asked how his daughter would feel about the award, Hughes said: \u201cI know Nicola would be embarrassed. I think she\u2019d be pleased and proud that it had happened for us, but I think she\u2019d be embarrassed about it.\u201d Bone said he would like their daughters to be remembered as \u201chappy, bubbly public servants\u201d, adding \u201cthey were doing their job happily, tried to help people \u2013 on that day it just went all wrong\u201d. Hughes, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, said: \u201cPolice officers put their lives on the line every single day. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going into. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s behind that door, and for me, that says a lot about what they do every day.\u201d Other recipients of the award include the police officer PC Andrew Harper, who worked for Thames Valley police, and was killed while responding to a bike theft by three teenagers in Berkshire in August 2019. He was caught in a strap attached to the back of a car and dragged down a winding country road, just four weeks after getting married. The emblem was given to his widow, Lissie. The daughter of the firefighter Leslie Marsh, of West Midlands fire service, will be awarded the Emblem 75 years after he died falling through a hole in the first floor of a derelict church when responding to a fire on 7 February 1949. Starmer said: \u201cWe must never forget those who have given their lives to protect others in the line of duty. While families will never be able to replace their loved ones, the Elizabeth Emblem pays tribute to the sacrifice they have made.\u201d The chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, chief constable Gavin Stephens, said: \u201cWhen a colleague dies in the line of duty, shockwaves and sadness reverberate throughout policing. The families, friends and loved ones left behind bear the enduring pain of sacrifice in public service. We owe them a debt of gratitude as we remember their loved ones, always. We recognise their next of kin and pay tribute to them.\u201d",

An NHS 111 adviser was unaware of the child\u2019s Down\u2019s Syndrome, which greatly increased his clinical vulnerability. As a result, the adviser did not tell the child\u2019s mother to take him to hospital immediately.

Labour has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/21/wes-streeting-unveils-plans-for-patient-passports-to-hold-all-medical-records\">announced plans</a> to store each NHS patient\u2019s health data in one place, and for patient records to be made readily available via standardised information systems across the NHS. The plans apply to England, with health mostly devolved in the rest of the UK.</p> <p>Health secretary Wes Streeting said: \u201cNo patient should lose their life in 2024 because different parts of the NHS can\u2019t share information. This is why we desperately need to modernise our health service.</p> <p>\u201cThe budget provided an extra \u00a32bn to arm NHS staff with modern technology, including digital patient records. Through our 10-year plan we will deliver a single patient record on the NHS app, so clinicians have the full picture of the patient they are treating. I am determined that we drag our analogue health service into the digital age, which will be better for patients and make the health service more efficient.\u201d</p>    <p>A Welsh government spokesperson said: \u201cWe have provided over \u00a3300m to support digital change in NHS Wales over the last five years.\u201d</p> <p>But privacy campaigners are concerned that Labour\u2019s plans threaten patient confidentiality. \u201cThe new central care record will have all the written notes from your GP accessible wherever the NHS logo is seen,\u201d said Sam Smith, coordinator at medConfidential, which campaigns to protect medical confidentiality. \u201cThat\u2019s necessary for A&amp;E to work to save lives, but also risks a stalkers\u2019 paradise.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed to two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/14/nhs-england-data-privacy-confidentiality-records-addenbrookes-hospital\">recent</a> cases where doctors accessed the medical records of their ex-boyfriends\u2019 new partners, and called for patients to be able to see in the NHS app \u201cwhen and where records were snooped on\u201d.</p> <p>Aside from the cases where inadequate sharing of information led to patients dying, there have been 38 cases this year where coroners have flagged concerns about incomplete or incorrect information being inputted into patient records systems.</p>",

In a third case, mental health staff did not know why a patient had been taken to A&amp;E, as her digital patient information was unavailable. They discharged her instead of detaining her under the Mental Health Act. She killed herself the next morning. The warnings reinforce the need for better information-sharing in the NHS. Labour has announced plans to store each NHS patient\u2019s health data in one place, and for patient records to be made readily available via standardised information systems across the NHS. The plans apply to England, with health mostly devolved in the rest of the UK. Health secretary Wes Streeting said: \u201cNo patient should lose their life in 2024 because different parts of the NHS can\u2019t share information. This is why we desperately need to modernise our health service. \u201cThe budget provided an extra \u00a32bn to arm NHS staff with modern technology, including digital patient records. Through our 10-year plan we will deliver a single patient record on the NHS app, so clinicians have the full picture of the patient they are treating. I am determined that we drag our analogue health service into the digital age, which will be better for patients and make the health service more efficient.\u201d A Welsh government spokesperson said: \u201cWe have provided over \u00a3300m to support digital change in NHS Wales over the last five years.\u201d But privacy campaigners are concerned that Labour\u2019s plans threaten patient confidentiality. \u201cThe new central care record will have all the written notes from your GP accessible wherever the NHS logo is seen,\u201d said Sam Smith, coordinator at medConfidential, which campaigns to protect medical confidentiality. \u201cThat\u2019s necessary for A&amp;E to work to save lives, but also risks a stalkers\u2019 paradise.\u201d He pointed to two recent cases where doctors accessed the medical records of their ex-boyfriends\u2019 new partners, and called for patients to be able to see in the NHS app \u201cwhen and where records were snooped on\u201d. Aside from the cases where inadequate sharing of information led to patients dying, there have been 38 cases this year where coroners have flagged concerns about incomplete or incorrect information being inputted into patient records systems.",

      "body": "<p>Here we are in a crisis in which almost everything we love is going to be under siege in the US in ways that will affect the world in many ways. Most of all this will be because a Trump administration is going to go to war on climate action domestically and internationally \u2013 on nature itself and the ways we protect it and thereby protect the systems on which human life depends.</p> <p>I was asked to talk about hope. First of all, hope does not mean saying this is not bad, and it does not mean saying that we can defeat it. It just means saying we will keep showing up. That we will not give up. That we will assess our powers and weaknesses and recognise that the future we face looks grim, but we do not know how it will unfold, and neither do those we oppose. How it will unfold depends in no small part on what we do. People too often think hope is smiles and sunshine, when it\u2019s fury in the face of danger and oppression, and pressing on in the storm.</p> <p>But I do not want to talk about hope today, because people so often confuse it with optimism \u2013 which assumes everything will be fine \u2013 or feeling good, though I\u2019ve long said you can be hopeful and heartbroken, and most of us have had our hearts broken in many ways and are still standing. Hope is not even the opposite of despair, if and when you remember that despair is an emotion, not an analysis. You can feel despair and commit to the hope that the prison-abolition activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mariame-kaba\">Mariame Kaba</a> told us is a discipline. Within you the despair can give way to fury that you have to feel despair, which can itself be the energy to get you out of it. I\u2019m wary about anger \u2013 as George Orwell once observed, it\u2019s easily redirected, like the flame of a blowlamp, and it has been in this election as people whose own lives were thwarted economically and otherwise got on board with the scapegoating of immigrants. So it\u2019s something to be careful with. Even so, \u201crage is a form of prayer too,\u201d as Reverend Dr. Renita J. Weems declared after this terrible US election.</p> <p>I suspect she means that behind that rage is care, and this is something I have found secular activists often forget \u2013 you are angry the children are being bombed or the forest is being cleared because you care about them, so it\u2019s not the feelings about the forces of destruction that is primary. It\u2019s the love, and not losing sight of that is crucial. \u201cThe true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him,\u201d GK Chesterson once wrote, explaining why it\u2019s so easy to lose sight of the prime mover that is love. In some cases. Maga and the manosphere of internet misogyny and racism and crass punching-down having-it-both-ways didn\u2019t-really-mean-it jokes has made smirking cruelty and callousness their brand, and there\u2019s nothing behind that so far as I can tell but ego, ambition and unconsciousness.</p>    <p>Not being them and not being like them is the first job, not just as negatives but as an embrace of the ideals of love, kindness, open-mindedness, the ability to engage with uncertainty and ambiguity, inclusiveness. \u201cFight on\u201d might sound like a lot now, but maybe you can at least not quit, even if you need to take time off, which is not the same thing as checking out. In stillness and quiet comes the recharging of self and strength, just as in sleep the body rebuilds itself. \u201cBack to work \u2013 and notably bucking up the younger people I know with reminders that dignity lies in a refusal to be complicit and that despair ultimately is a form of complicity,\u201d the LGBTQ public historian Gerard Koskovich wrote in a note to me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/far-right-figures-celebrate-trump-win-bolsonaro-milei-meloni-salvini\">\u2018Time for patriots\u2019: global far-right figures celebrate Trump\u2019s win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I do not want to talk about hope. I want to talk about being resolute and lining up resources, the way people generations ago laid up supplies for winter. Just like the fossil fuel industry loves doomers who give up on defeating it, so authoritarians love fear, surrender, people who\u2019ve decided they\u2019re already defeated, who are already afraid to resist. Do not give them what they want. After the first Trump election Timothy Snyder\u2019s first mandate for facing the coming trouble was: \u201cDo not obey prematurely. Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do.\u201d I\u2019ve half-joked ever since that we shouldn\u2019t obey maturely, either. There will be all too many opportunities for direct resistance, not least offering solidarity and sanctuary to those most under attack, including those who are immigrants, need reproductive rights, are transgender, or have boldly spoken up.</p> <p>There will be practical opportunities to take care of what you love, including donating, participating, and supporting the ways that towns, counties, states, and public institutions and private organisations can and do set their own policies on everything from energy to education, as they did in the last Trump and Bush administrations. Blue states may become refuges for those from red states \u2013 and already have when it comes to reproductive rights \u2013 and my own powerful state, California, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/california-resistance-state-trump-federal-government\">has again issued a statement of resistance</a>. Remember that in the real map of the election no state is pure red or pure blue \u2013 Idaho and Utah are magenta, Vermont is violet, and the rest are shades of purple. Your allies are everywhere, as are your opponents.</p> <p>There are other kinds of resistance that mean making your own life and your own mind an independent republic in which the pursuit of truth, human rights, kindness and empathy, the preservation of history and memory, of being an example of someone living by values other than the values \u2013 if they deserve such a term \u2013 of the cruelty, greed, and dishonesty of Donald Trump and the circle around him. This does not overthrow the regime, but it does mean being someone who has not been conquered by it, and it invites others who have not been or who can throw off the shackles to join you.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/trump-project-2025-rightwing-policy-influence\">\u2018This victory is a mandate\u2019: rightwing groups ready with policy proposals for new Trump administration</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finding community, and building and strengthening relationships, with people you trust and agree with about these moral and political issues is also important; it will strengthen you and give you people to act with when it is time to act. The pandemic and the online world have given rise to an epidemic of loneliness, which has crushed a lot of us and made us more susceptible to the worst of what\u2019s out there. The historian Hannah Arendt wrote (back in that era when \u201cmen\u201d meant all of us): \u201cWhat prepares men for totalitarian domination in the non-totalitarian world is the fact that loneliness, once a borderline experience usually suffered in certain marginal social conditions like old age, has become an everyday experience of the ever-growing masses of our century.\u201d</p> <p>By reaching out and creating the conditions for mutual support and encouragement, you become a source of strength to others. When the election outcome became clear to me late Tuesday night, I wrote: \u201cTake care of yourself and remember that taking care of something else is an important part of taking care of yourself, because you are interwoven with the 10tn things in this single garment of destiny that has been stained and torn, but is still being woven and mended and washed.\u201d There\u2019s a false dichotomy between the popular business of self-care and being engaged and caring for other things; doing the latter can bring you into community with people who are good for you, can help you find that dignity Gerard spoke of, can strengthen and encourage you \u2013 and even make you hopeful, because to be around the best versions of human nature does that for you. There will be heroes in the crises to come; look for them. Maybe you\u2019ll be one.</p> <p>Even reading about heroes can remind you of the sheer perseverance and courage some of us are capable of and maybe make you more capable. We have heroes, from Nelson Mandela to Malala to V\u00e1clav Havel to the Zapatistas and the poets of Gaza to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/23/thich-nhat-hanh-obituary\">Thich Nhat Hanh</a> and the Buddhist monks who spoke up against the war in Vietnam to, in the US, Harriet Tubman and Ella Baker and whole nations of Native Americans on this continent who, more than 530 years after the genocides against them began, have not just retained their culture and identity but have reclaimed land, language, rights, power, and public participation in this millennium. My friend (and hero) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/01/on-guam-there-is-no-birdsong-you-cannot-imagine-the-trauma-of-a-silent-island\">Julian Aguon</a>, a climate activist and lawyer indigenous to Guam, writes that Indigenous peoples are those who \u201chave a unique capacity to resist despair through connection to collective memory and who just might be our best hope to build a new world rooted in reciprocity and mutual respect \u2013 for the earth and for each other\u201d.</p>    <p>If we are going to talk about hope, I would note that, as Aguon says, hope does not come from knowing the future; it comes from knowing the past. Octavia Butler writes: \u201cTo try to foretell the future without studying history is like trying to learn to read without bothering to learn the alphabet.\u201d I don\u2019t believe you can foretell it, but I believe you can learn to recognise the patterns, and what the patterns teach is unpredictability: a regime suddenly collapses, an unforeseen revolution emerges from the shadows, public imagination shifts in some profound way because of work done by people who ignored those who told them their efforts were futile and their ideas unreasonable, and public imagination\u2019s shifts lead to new laws and social conditions. I\u2019ve lived through it with the collapse of the Soviet satellite states in 1989, the power of the anti-globalisation movements a decade later, the rise of indigenous leadership in the climate movement, the way the feminist and anti-racist activism of the last decade changed the national conversation and some very practical things.</p> <p>The study of heroes is one way to ground yourself in memory. The US is an uneasy cobbling together of different constituencies by race, class, gender and culture, and those who have been subordinated have exemplified heroic resistance all along, have given us Geronimo and Frederick Douglass, Ady Barkan and Harvey Milk, Audre Lorde and Grace Lee Boggs. This country has been rich in oppression, which might be why it has also been rich in heroes.</p> <p>The visionary climate organiser Daniel Hunter wrote guidelines for facing the next Trump administration; one part of his analysis declares: \u201cDistrust fuels the flame of autocracy because it makes it much easier to divide. We can see that in the casual nature of Trump\u2019s rhetoric \u2013 telling people to distrust immigrants, Democrats, socialists, people from Chicago, women marchers, Mexicans, the press and so on. This is a social disease: you know whom to trust by whom they tell you to distrust. Trust-building starts with your own self. It includes trusting your own eyes and gut, as well as building protection from the ways the crazy-making can become internalised.\u201d</p> <p>His words echo something I learned from Orwell. In Nineteen Eighty-Four he wrote: \u201cThe Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.\u201d It is only by learning to distrust yourself that you come to trust those who are unworthy of it, who are transparently dishonest and self-serving, who offer lies that contradict yesterday\u2019s lies and new promises after breaking the old ones. If it\u2019s not clear yet, I\u2019m talking about building a strong self to face what is to come \u2013 how to put that strength to work will emerge as the trouble emerges. Orwell fortified himself by gardening, taking care of animals, spending time in nature, as well as through strong friendships and everyday pleasures. Though he watered his roses, doing so let him turn back to face totalitarianism and the factories of lies again and again even as his poor health morphed into slow death at 46.</p> <p>I believe this election turned out the way it did in no small part because a large number of Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/07/us-progressive-election-trump-maga\">are now submerged in new factories of lies</a> more insidious than anything Orwell imagined, and that while the worst of it is the foreign and far-right intentional distortion of reality, too much of the mainstream media has been deferential and will be more deferential to authoritarianism and will not stop letting the right set the agenda about what to be concerned about and what matters. In fact, I don\u2019t have to believe that disinformation is impactful; I know it because it\u2019s been documented. The data group Ipsos reports: \u201cAmericans who answer questions about inflation, crime, and immigration incorrectly are more likely to opt for Trump, while Americans who answer those questions correctly prefer Harris.\u201d</p> <p>Many mainstream media voices will urge us to make peace with people who want to make war on us, to find compromise as if the space halfway between truth and lies is a good destination, to make nice with atrocity, because they\u2019ve been doing that energetically at least since 2016. I believe in leaving the door open for those who might join us, and in finding ways to reach out and invite in, but that is compatible with standing on principle, and the strength of that stand can itself be a convincing argument in ways compromise does not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/project-2025-kevin-roberts-book-burning-fbi-new-york-times\">Project 2025 chief\u2019s book urges \u2018burning\u2019 of FBI, New York Times and Boy Scouts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The outcome of this election is the result of disinformation and the rise of a huge rightwing media industry, both as enterprises like Fox and Newsmax but also the hordes of blogs, podcasts, Russian-produced propaganda on social media, Elon Musk\u2019s takeover of Twitter, online subcultures of misogynists and white supremacists and the rest.

      "bodyText": "Here we are in a crisis in which almost everything we love is going to be under siege in the US in ways that will affect the world in many ways. Most of all this will be because a Trump administration is going to go to war on climate action domestically and internationally \u2013 on nature itself and the ways we protect it and thereby protect the systems on which human life depends. I was asked to talk about hope. First of all, hope does not mean saying this is not bad, and it does not mean saying that we can defeat it. It just means saying we will keep showing up. That we will not give up. That we will assess our powers and weaknesses and recognise that the future we face looks grim, but we do not know how it will unfold, and neither do those we oppose. How it will unfold depends in no small part on what we do. People too often think hope is smiles and sunshine, when it\u2019s fury in the face of danger and oppression, and pressing on in the storm. But I do not want to talk about hope today, because people so often confuse it with optimism \u2013 which assumes everything will be fine \u2013 or feeling good, though I\u2019ve long said you can be hopeful and heartbroken, and most of us have had our hearts broken in many ways and are still standing. Hope is not even the opposite of despair, if and when you remember that despair is an emotion, not an analysis. You can feel despair and commit to the hope that the prison-abolition activist Mariame Kaba told us is a discipline. Within you the despair can give way to fury that you have to feel despair, which can itself be the energy to get you out of it. I\u2019m wary about anger \u2013 as George Orwell once observed, it\u2019s easily redirected, like the flame of a blowlamp, and it has been in this election as people whose own lives were thwarted economically and otherwise got on board with the scapegoating of immigrants. So it\u2019s something to be careful with. Even so, \u201crage is a form of prayer too,\u201d as Reverend Dr. Renita J. Weems declared after this terrible US election. I suspect she means that behind that rage is care, and this is something I have found secular activists often forget \u2013 you are angry the children are being bombed or the forest is being cleared because you care about them, so it\u2019s not the feelings about the forces of destruction that is primary. It\u2019s the love, and not losing sight of that is crucial. \u201cThe true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him,\u201d GK Chesterson once wrote, explaining why it\u2019s so easy to lose sight of the prime mover that is love. In some cases. Maga and the manosphere of internet misogyny and racism and crass punching-down having-it-both-ways didn\u2019t-really-mean-it jokes has made smirking cruelty and callousness their brand, and there\u2019s nothing behind that so far as I can tell but ego, ambition and unconsciousness. Not being them and not being like them is the first job, not just as negatives but as an embrace of the ideals of love, kindness, open-mindedness, the ability to engage with uncertainty and ambiguity, inclusiveness. \u201cFight on\u201d might sound like a lot now, but maybe you can at least not quit, even if you need to take time off, which is not the same thing as checking out. In stillness and quiet comes the recharging of self and strength, just as in sleep the body rebuilds itself. \u201cBack to work \u2013 and notably bucking up the younger people I know with reminders that dignity lies in a refusal to be complicit and that despair ultimately is a form of complicity,\u201d the LGBTQ public historian Gerard Koskovich wrote in a note to me. I do not want to talk about hope. I want to talk about being resolute and lining up resources, the way people generations ago laid up supplies for winter. Just like the fossil fuel industry loves doomers who give up on defeating it, so authoritarians love fear, surrender, people who\u2019ve decided they\u2019re already defeated, who are already afraid to resist. Do not give them what they want. After the first Trump election Timothy Snyder\u2019s first mandate for facing the coming trouble was: \u201cDo not obey prematurely. Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do.\u201d I\u2019ve half-joked ever since that we shouldn\u2019t obey maturely, either. There will be all too many opportunities for direct resistance, not least offering solidarity and sanctuary to those most under attack, including those who are immigrants, need reproductive rights, are transgender, or have boldly spoken up. There will be practical opportunities to take care of what you love, including donating, participating, and supporting the ways that towns, counties, states, and public institutions and private organisations can and do set their own policies on everything from energy to education, as they did in the last Trump and Bush administrations. Blue states may become refuges for those from red states \u2013 and already have when it comes to reproductive rights \u2013 and my own powerful state, California, has again issued a statement of resistance. Remember that in the real map of the election no state is pure red or pure blue \u2013 Idaho and Utah are magenta, Vermont is violet, and the rest are shades of purple. Your allies are everywhere, as are your opponents. There are other kinds of resistance that mean making your own life and your own mind an independent republic in which the pursuit of truth, human rights, kindness and empathy, the preservation of history and memory, of being an example of someone living by values other than the values \u2013 if they deserve such a term \u2013 of the cruelty, greed, and dishonesty of Donald Trump and the circle around him.

In recent months, she was arguably more visible in promoting her own memoir, in which she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/02/melania-trump-memoir-defends-abortion-rights\">advocated</a> for abortion rights.</p> <p>But while some wondered if the marriage would crumble once Trump was out of office in 2020, she was by his side as he <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy5x7wr7peo\">greeted supporters</a> after his win, and is expected to resume her constitutional role as first lady.</p> <h2>Donald Trump Jr</h2>    <p>Trump\u2019s oldest son has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/19/trump-family-melania-don-jr-ivanka-election\">a significant figure</a> behind the scenes of his father\u2019s campaign, building a close connection to the Maga electoral base.</p> <p>Don Jr, who is the executive vice-president of the Trump Organization and hosts a podcast, Triggered, is credited with helping his friend JD Vance secure the VP nomination, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e529f88-084d-4929-af1f-0ed3b01fe83b\">some </a>argue he could be the power behind the throne of the new administration.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-second-term-banned-white-house-b2630515.html\">has been</a> <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-second-term-banned-white-house-b2630515.html\">closely involved</a> in his father\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/donald-trump-jr-transition-2024_n_672dc432e4b0933e82c97f21\">transition team</a> and there is inevitable speculation he could be given a prominent role \u2013 perhaps with an eye on a political future of his own.</p> <h2>Ivanka Trump</h2>    <p>Trump\u2019s older daughter was highly visible during his first administration, even being given the official title of \u201cfirst daughter and adviser to the president\u201d. But she has been entirely absent this time \u2013 her appearance with the family on Tuesday was <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/ivanka-trump-first-appearance-2024-campaign-victory-speech/\">her first</a> of the entire campaign.</p> <p>Once described as <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161224142406/https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/inside-ivanka-trump-and-tiffany-trump-complicated-sister-act\">Trump\u2019s favourite child</a>, Ivanka has testified that she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/09/ivanka-trump-election-not-stolen-testimony\">did not believe</a> her father\u2019s false claim that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d, and in 2022 said in a statement that while she loved her father, \u201cthis time around, I am choosing to prioritise my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics.\u201d</p> <h2>Jared Kushner</h2>    <p>Ivanka\u2019s husband, once a Democrat, was integral to his father-in-law\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and was appointed a senior adviser during Trump\u2019s first term, helping shape the administration\u2019s Middle East policies.</p> <p>Since 2020 the real estate investor and former publisher of the New York Observer has concentrated on his $3bn investment fund, Affinity Partners. It is heavily backed by the Saudi government\u2019s public investment fund, which has led to questions from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/25/jared-kushner-affinity-partners-firm-senate-inquiry\">Senate finance committee</a>.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2512e5cb-603c-4980-98f9-83395c55e37b\">is reported</a> to have ruled out joining the new administration but could advise on foreign affairs.</p> <h2>Eric Trump</h2>    <p>Though he has generally had a lower profile than his older brother, Don Jr, concentrating instead on the family\u2019s business and real estate firm, Trump\u2019s second son <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-trial-eric-family-man-rcna150264\">supported him</a> in person during his fraud court hearings earlier this year and was a loyal cheerleader on the campaign trail.</p> <h2>Lara Trump</h2>    <p>Eric\u2019s wife since 2014 and mother of their two children, the former TV producer has described having a political \u201cawakening\u201d when her father-in-law was first elected in 2016 and has moved increasingly into positions of influence. Earlier this year Trump installed Lara as co-chair of the Republican national committee, <a href=\"https://time.com/6997498/lara-trump-rnc-profile/\">reportedly telling her</a>: \u201cI need someone I can trust.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about speculation that she may consider running for office herself one day, she has said: \u201cNever say never with a Trump.\u201d</p> <h2>Tiffany Trump</h2>    <p>Trump\u2019s fourth child, Tiffany, whose mother is his second wife, Marla Maples, has been a loyal if lower-profile family member during his campaign. She recently announced her first pregnancy with her husband, Michael Boulos, a Lebanese-American businessman.</p> <h2>Barron Trump</h2>    <p>Trump\u2019s son with Melania, after spending some of his early teenage years living at the White House, is now 18 and studying business at New York University. Though still young, Barron has been credited as being an important influence on his father\u2019s campaign by <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/barron-trump-son-donald-trump-election-campaign-podcasts-5gkz205l8\">urging him</a> to target the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/08/donald-trump-adin-ross-young-men\">\u201cbro vote\u201d</a> through interviews with popular podcasters.</p> <p>Increased visibility has also brought a focus on his 6ft 7in height, which his father has credited to the attentions of his Slovenian maternal grandmother, Amalija Knavs: \u201cBoy, did she take care of Barron \u2026 That\u2019s how he got so tall \u2013 only ate her food.\u201d</p> <h2>Kimberly Guilfoyle</h2>    <p>A former Fox News presenter (and former San Francisco prosecutor <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/politics/kamala-harris-kimberly-guilfoyle-san-francisco-da.html\">alongside Kamala Harris</a>), she has been engaged to Donald Jr since 2020, after his 2018 divorce from his first wife, Vanessa, the mother of his five children.</p> <p>Guilfoyle was previously married to the Democratic mayor of San Francisco, Gavin Newsom, but was an outspoken critic of Harris on the campaign trail, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/28/kimberly-guilfoyle-kamala-harris-trump\">hinting</a> at a highly personal animus.</p> <h2>Kai Trump</h2>    <p>The eldest of Donald Jr\u2019s five children, Kai, 17, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se52V7ZmKNw\">addressed the RNC</a> in July, saying of her grandfather: \u201cTo me, he\u2019s just a normal grandpa \u2026 He gives us candy and soda when our parents aren\u2019t looking.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we play golf together, if I\u2019m not on his team, he\u2019ll try to get inside of my head, and he\u2019s always surprised I don\u2019t let him get to me.

Donald Trump Jr Trump\u2019s oldest son has been a significant figure behind the scenes of his father\u2019s campaign, building a close connection to the Maga electoral base. Don Jr, who is the executive vice-president of the Trump Organization and hosts a podcast, Triggered, is credited with helping his friend JD Vance secure the VP nomination, and some argue he could be the power behind the throne of the new administration. He has been closely involved in his father\u2019s transition team and there is inevitable speculation he could be given a prominent role \u2013 perhaps with an eye on a political future of his own. Ivanka Trump Trump\u2019s older daughter was highly visible during his first administration, even being given the official title of \u201cfirst daughter and adviser to the president\u201d. But she has been entirely absent this time \u2013 her appearance with the family on Tuesday was her first of the entire campaign. Once described as Trump\u2019s favourite child, Ivanka has testified that she did not believe her father\u2019s false claim that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d, and in 2022 said in a statement that while she loved her father, \u201cthis time around, I am choosing to prioritise my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics.\u201d Jared Kushner Ivanka\u2019s husband, once a Democrat, was integral to his father-in-law\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and was appointed a senior adviser during Trump\u2019s first term, helping shape the administration\u2019s Middle East policies. Since 2020 the real estate investor and former publisher of the New York Observer has concentrated on his $3bn investment fund, Affinity Partners. It is heavily backed by the Saudi government\u2019s public investment fund, which has led to questions from the Senate finance committee. He is reported to have ruled out joining the new administration but could advise on foreign affairs. Eric Trump Though he has generally had a lower profile than his older brother, Don Jr, concentrating instead on the family\u2019s business and real estate firm, Trump\u2019s second son supported him in person during his fraud court hearings earlier this year and was a loyal cheerleader on the campaign trail. Lara Trump Eric\u2019s wife since 2014 and mother of their two children, the former TV producer has described having a political \u201cawakening\u201d when her father-in-law was first elected in 2016 and has moved increasingly into positions of influence. Earlier this year Trump installed Lara as co-chair of the Republican national committee, reportedly telling her: \u201cI need someone I can trust.\u201d Asked about speculation that she may consider running for office herself one day, she has said: \u201cNever say never with a Trump.\u201d Tiffany Trump Trump\u2019s fourth child, Tiffany, whose mother is his second wife, Marla Maples, has been a loyal if lower-profile family member during his campaign. She recently announced her first pregnancy with her husband, Michael Boulos, a Lebanese-American businessman. Barron Trump Trump\u2019s son with Melania, after spending some of his early teenage years living at the White House, is now 18 and studying business at New York University. Though still young, Barron has been credited as being an important influence on his father\u2019s campaign by urging him to target the \u201cbro vote\u201d through interviews with popular podcasters. Increased visibility has also brought a focus on his 6ft 7in height, which his father has credited to the attentions of his Slovenian maternal grandmother, Amalija Knavs: \u201cBoy, did she take care of Barron \u2026 That\u2019s how he got so tall \u2013 only ate her food.\u201d Kimberly Guilfoyle A former Fox News presenter (and former San Francisco prosecutor alongside Kamala Harris), she has been engaged to Donald Jr since 2020, after his 2018 divorce from his first wife, Vanessa, the mother of his five children. Guilfoyle was previously married to the Democratic mayor of San Francisco, Gavin Newsom, but was an outspoken critic of Harris on the campaign trail, hinting at a highly personal animus. Kai Trump The eldest of Donald Jr\u2019s five children, Kai, 17, addressed the RNC in July, saying of her grandfather: \u201cTo me, he\u2019s just a normal grandpa \u2026 He gives us candy and soda when our parents aren\u2019t looking. \u201cWhen we play golf together, if I\u2019m not on his team, he\u2019ll try to get inside of my head, and he\u2019s always surprised I don\u2019t let him get to me. But I have to remind him, I\u2019m a Trump, too.\u201d",

The last such intervention \u2013 the 13-year UN stabilisation mission Minustah, which ended in 2017<em> \u2013 </em>was blamed for human rights violations, sexual abuse and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/dec/01/haiti-cholera-outbreak-stain-on-reputation-un-says\">causing a cholera outbreak</a> that killed thousands and continues to haunt the country.</p>    <p>\u201cBut at the same time, Haitian people are exhausted. They are tired. There is no life in Haiti,\u201d Esp\u00e9rance said as gang combatants continued their latest offensive against two strategically located neighbourhoods just a few miles from where he sat.</p> <p>Haiti\u2019s interim prime minister, Garry Conille, echoed those sentiments, criticising the international community for failing to send sufficient resources and troops to help the foreign mission restore order. \u201cWe are facing urban guerrilla warfare \u2026 [but] we still do not have what we need to fight this battle,\u201d <a href=\"https://lenouvelliste.com/en/article/251249/prime-minister-conille-expresses-discontent-with-international-security-cooperation\">Conille said</a>, according to the newspaper <em>Le Nouvelliste</em>.</p> <p>Gana, a 31-year-old primary healthcare physician, has had a front-row seat for the recent surge in violence at MSF\u2019s Turgeau emergency centre, which is close to Port-au-Prince\u2019s biggest public park, the Champs de Mars, now one of the frontlines of the gang insurrection.</p> <p>The criminal uprising has turned the area just west of that plaza \u2013 which is also home to the presidential palace \u2013 into a bullet-riddled ghost town from which most residents have fled. Stray dogs and families of chickens roam the empty, litter-strewn streets. Gunfire can be heard day and night.</p>    <p>\u201cIt is becoming intense once again. It has been about two weeks where we have an increase in patients,\u201d said Gana, who arrived in the Caribbean city in January just days before criminal groups rose up against the Haitian state and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/12/haiti-pm-ariel-henry-resignation-details-update\">toppled the unpopular prime minister</a>, Ariel Henry.</p> <p>Almost immediately Gana was forced to respond to an explosion of violence that saw gangs capture major roads and besiege government buildings and the airport, cutting Haiti\u2019s capital off from the world.</p> <p>The hospital\u2019s staff treated shooting victims from all walks of life and of all ages, including toddlers and babies. \u201cThe team \u2026 they go right into action, regardless of the age of our patients. But \u2026 it\u2019s definitely something that\u2019s impacting to see,\u201d Gana said of those wounded infants.</p> <p>During the most intense periods of fighting, up to 16 gunshot victims a day have been admitted. Such was the grip the gangs had on the city that the injured sometimes took up to 12 hours to reach the emergency room, Gana said, since they were unable to leave home to seek treatment.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly difficult situation.

      "bodyText": "It was mid-morning in central Port-au-Prince and already two shooting victims had been rushed into the hospital past a mural instructing visitors to leave machetes and rifles outside. The two men \u2013 a 60-year-old accountant and a 29-year-old electrician \u2013 sat in the trauma centre\u2019s \u201cshock room\u201d being patched up as the city around them fell apart. \u201cWe had one yesterday \u2013 it was an 81-year-old man who was going about his business and \u2026 then his life changes,\u201d said James Gana, a Nigerian doctor who runs the unit for the French NGO Doctors Without Borders (MSF). Minutes later sirens blared and a third casualty was wheeled in after also taking a bullet \u2013 the latest victim of a year of mayhem in Haiti, which the UN says has claimed several thousand lives. The arrival of a Kenyan-led international policing mission in June prompted a brief lull in the fighting between security forces, self-defence vigilante groups and a coalition of politically connected gangs called Viv Ansanm (Living Together) who appear determined to seize almost complete control of Haiti\u2019s capital for a mix of criminal and political reasons. But in recent weeks \u2013 seemingly after gang leaders realised the 400-member security mission was too weak to challenge them \u2013 the bloodshed has again accelerated, prompting calls for a larger peacekeeping operation. \u201cWhat we have today, it will not work,\u201d said Pierre Esp\u00e9rance, one of Haiti\u2019s leading human rights advocates as he sat in his group\u2019s headquarters in Port-au-Prince. Esp\u00e9rance admitted it was painful to call for yet another foreign deployment in a country that has suffered a succession of humiliating and ill-conceived interventions since a 19-year occupation by the US Marines in 1915. The last such intervention \u2013 the 13-year UN stabilisation mission Minustah, which ended in 2017 \u2013 was blamed for human rights violations, sexual abuse and causing a cholera outbreak that killed thousands and continues to haunt the country. \u201cBut at the same time, Haitian people are exhausted. They are tired. There is no life in Haiti,\u201d Esp\u00e9rance said as gang combatants continued their latest offensive against two strategically located neighbourhoods just a few miles from where he sat. Haiti\u2019s interim prime minister, Garry Conille, echoed those sentiments, criticising the international community for failing to send sufficient resources and troops to help the foreign mission restore order. \u201cWe are facing urban guerrilla warfare \u2026 [but] we still do not have what we need to fight this battle,\u201d Conille said, according to the newspaper Le Nouvelliste. Gana, a 31-year-old primary healthcare physician, has had a front-row seat for the recent surge in violence at MSF\u2019s Turgeau emergency centre, which is close to Port-au-Prince\u2019s biggest public park, the Champs de Mars, now one of the frontlines of the gang insurrection. The criminal uprising has turned the area just west of that plaza \u2013 which is also home to the presidential palace \u2013 into a bullet-riddled ghost town from which most residents have fled. Stray dogs and families of chickens roam the empty, litter-strewn streets. Gunfire can be heard day and night. \u201cIt is becoming intense once again. It has been about two weeks where we have an increase in patients,\u201d said Gana, who arrived in the Caribbean city in January just days before criminal groups rose up against the Haitian state and toppled the unpopular prime minister, Ariel Henry. Almost immediately Gana was forced to respond to an explosion of violence that saw gangs capture major roads and besiege government buildings and the airport, cutting Haiti\u2019s capital off from the world. The hospital\u2019s staff treated shooting victims from all walks of life and of all ages, including toddlers and babies. \u201cThe team \u2026 they go right into action, regardless of the age of our patients. But \u2026 it\u2019s definitely something that\u2019s impacting to see,\u201d Gana said of those wounded infants. During the most intense periods of fighting, up to 16 gunshot victims a day have been admitted. Such was the grip the gangs had on the city that the injured sometimes took up to 12 hours to reach the emergency room, Gana said, since they were unable to leave home to seek treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly difficult situation. We\u2019re here to see how we can support \u2013 but it\u2019s indescribable,\u201d said Gana, whose office overlooks one of scores of camps for internally displaced people that have opened to house families fleeing the gangs. According to the UN\u2019s migration agency, 700,000 Haitians now live in such temporary shelters, including 350,000 children. Haiti\u2019s humanitarian crisis has been compounded by the fact that several clinics and hospitals have been forced to close because of the violence. They include its biggest public hospital, the General hospital, which was at the heart of the response to the 2010 earthquake that pulverised Port-au-Prince and killed an estimated 200,000 people. Back then, volunteer surgeons flew in from around the world to amputate limbs from those crushed by falling debris. These days doctors in Port-au-Prince are dealing with different kinds of injuries inflicted by weapons of war, many of which are smuggled in from the US. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen very, very big exit wounds; we\u2019ve seen smaller ones; we\u2019ve seen ricochets ... we see it all,\u201d said Gana as he toured the emergency department, which was briefly forced to close last year after a severely wounded patient suspected of being a gang member was dragged from an MSF ambulance outside, beaten and shot dead. The stories of the two shooting victims being treated during the Observer\u2019s visit to the ER spoke to a city that has tumbled deeper into criminal tyranny and turmoil since the president, Jovenel Mo\u00efse, was murdered in his mansion in 2021. That still poorly explained assassination \u2013 and the subsequent collapse of the Haitian state \u2013 paved the way towards today\u2019s security breakdown, ushering in a ferocious push for power by Haiti\u2019s gangs: well-financed and heavily-armed groups that local politicians have long been accused of bankrolling and equipping in order to intimidate rivals and reap the electoral benefits of their territorial control. Kidnappings and sexual violence surged and thousands of people were forced from their homes as gangs advanced across the capital and the surrounding region. By some estimates, 85% of Port-au-Prince is now outside government control and run by criminal groups.

Working-class voters, particularly young white men, are turning to the extremes in frustration at falling living standards, stagnant wages, precarious jobs and anti-refugee resentment.</p> <p>The coalition broke up ostensibly over economic policy. The finance minister, Christian Lindner, leader of the liberal, pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), rejected calls from the Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens to loosen Germany\u2019s rigid constitutional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/08/germany-coalition-odd-throuple-fiscal-policy-squabble\">\u201cdebt brake\u201d</a> and allow more spending on support for Ukraine and reviving the economy. Lindner demanded tax cuts and sharp reductions in welfare spending instead (even though <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/GGXWDG_NGDP@WEO/OEMDC/WEOWORLD/ADVEC\">public debt is lower</a> than in any other G7 economy). That prompted the SPD chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to fire him rather than wait for the FDP to walk out.</p> <p>In reality, Lindner wanted out because his party is fighting for survival, polling well below the 5% threshold needed to keep seats in the Bundestag, and has fallen out of many regional parliaments. </p> <p>Scholz is now limping on with a minority SPD-Greens government and plans to seek a confidence vote on 15 January, which he is bound to lose \u2013 setting the stage for early elections in March. The opposition Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) are demanding that he call an immediate confidence vote to bring the election forward, but they do not have enough votes to elect an alternative chancellor.</p> <p>The German crisis comes at a time when France, its key partner in European leadership, is hamstrung by its own political turmoil. President Emmanuel Macron is increasingly a lame duck after his bungled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/09/frances-snap-election-what-happened-why-and-whats-next\">dissolution of parliament in June</a> left him cohabiting with a minority centre-right government whose survival is at the mercy of Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally.</p> <p>This is all bad news for anyone expecting decisive European leadership as Trump takes office next year, and a windfall for opponents of closer European integration, led by the illiberal Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n.</p> <p>Opinion polls <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2025_German_federal_election\">taken before the coalition imploded</a> put Friedrich Merz\u2019s CDU/CSU on about 33%, with the far-right AfD in second place on about 18%, the SPD on 15%, the Greens on 10%, BSW on 8%, and the FDP between 3 and 4%. Since no mainstream party is willing to consider a coalition with AfD, the only plausible governing combination would be a \u201cGrand Coalition\u201d of CDU/CSU and SPD for the fourth time since 2005, but even that alliance might barely have a parliamentary majority and need a third partner. Even if the FDP managed to jump the 5% hurdle, the CDU/CSU and FDP would not have enough seats to form a centre-right coalition.</p> <p>Merz strongly supports increased military assistance to Ukraine and has criticised the \u201ctraffic light\u201d government for holding back supplies of Leopard 2 tanks and more recently <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/why-ukraine-wants-germanys-taurus-missiles-explained/a-66505534#:~:text=This%20metal%20penetrator%2C%20weighing%20400,before%20the%20actual%20warhead%20explodes.\">Taurus long-range missiles</a>. However, it is not clear that he would be willing to suspend the debt brake and increase government borrowing to pay for more aid to Kyiv, or to invest more in Germany\u2019s creaking public infrastructure or the green transition. He has also pulled the conservatives to the right on issues such as migration and energy policy since the days of the centrist chancellor Angela Merkel, and he may try to go back on the outgoing government\u2019s ambitious net zero targets.</p> <p>The collapse of the \u201ctraffic light\u201d coalition is a disillusionment for those who believed that a progressive alliance was possible between pro-market forces, supporters of a bold green energy transition and advocates of social justice. The external hammer blows of the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and <a href=\"https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/german-exports-challenged-china-replaces-made-in-germany-31897/\">falling Chinese demand</a> for German imports helped dash the German dream.</p> <p>But German fiscal fetishism also played a central role in dooming Scholz\u2019s government to failure. The centre-left went along for far too long with the conservatives and the FDP in clinging to the cult of balanced budgets and the debt brake. As a result, public borrowing remained taboo and investment in the country\u2019s crumbling infrastructure has been woefully insufficient.</p> <p>Whether a new conservative-led coalition would be willing or able to wriggle out of this stifling fiscal straitjacket is far from clear. If not, the German economy will die in good health, and Europe will be dragged down with it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy Centre</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Its economic model is broken because of the end of cheap Russian gas and declining exports to China, which is increasingly an industrial competitor. Its mighty car industry is shedding jobs and shuttering factories as orders slump. The government even revived border checks within the European Schengen zone in a panicked reaction after a migrant stabbed three people to death. Populist, Eurosceptic anti-immigration parties of the extreme right and left \u2013 opposed to support for Ukraine \u2013 are gaining ground, making the formation of stable national and regional governments increasingly difficult. Between them, the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) and a new leftist insurgent movement led by the former communist Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) are polling at about 25% of the national vote. Germany is succumbing to the \u201cDutch disease\u201d \u2013 the collapse of big-tent mainstream parties and the fragmentation of the political spectrum that is debilitating many European democracies. Sociologically, there are echoes of what drove Trump\u2019s comeback. Working-class voters, particularly young white men, are turning to the extremes in frustration at falling living standards, stagnant wages, precarious jobs and anti-refugee resentment. The coalition broke up ostensibly over economic policy. The finance minister, Christian Lindner, leader of the liberal, pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), rejected calls from the Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens to loosen Germany\u2019s rigid constitutional \u201cdebt brake\u201d and allow more spending on support for Ukraine and reviving the economy. Lindner demanded tax cuts and sharp reductions in welfare spending instead (even though public debt is lower than in any other G7 economy). That prompted the SPD chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to fire him rather than wait for the FDP to walk out. In reality, Lindner wanted out because his party is fighting for survival, polling well below the 5% threshold needed to keep seats in the Bundestag, and has fallen out of many regional parliaments. Scholz is now limping on with a minority SPD-Greens government and plans to seek a confidence vote on 15 January, which he is bound to lose \u2013 setting the stage for early elections in March. The opposition Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) are demanding that he call an immediate confidence vote to bring the election forward, but they do not have enough votes to elect an alternative chancellor. The German crisis comes at a time when France, its key partner in European leadership, is hamstrung by its own political turmoil. President Emmanuel Macron is increasingly a lame duck after his bungled dissolution of parliament in June left him cohabiting with a minority centre-right government whose survival is at the mercy of Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally. This is all bad news for anyone expecting decisive European leadership as Trump takes office next year, and a windfall for opponents of closer European integration, led by the illiberal Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Opinion polls taken before the coalition imploded put Friedrich Merz\u2019s CDU/CSU on about 33%, with the far-right AfD in second place on about 18%, the SPD on 15%, the Greens on 10%, BSW on 8%, and the FDP between 3 and 4%. Since no mainstream party is willing to consider a coalition with AfD, the only plausible governing combination would be a \u201cGrand Coalition\u201d of CDU/CSU and SPD for the fourth time since 2005, but even that alliance might barely have a parliamentary majority and need a third partner. Even if the FDP managed to jump the 5% hurdle, the CDU/CSU and FDP would not have enough seats to form a centre-right coalition. Merz strongly supports increased military assistance to Ukraine and has criticised the \u201ctraffic light\u201d government for holding back supplies of Leopard 2 tanks and more recently Taurus long-range missiles. However, it is not clear that he would be willing to suspend the debt brake and increase government borrowing to pay for more aid to Kyiv, or to invest more in Germany\u2019s creaking public infrastructure or the green transition. He has also pulled the conservatives to the right on issues such as migration and energy policy since the days of the centrist chancellor Angela Merkel, and he may try to go back on the outgoing government\u2019s ambitious net zero targets. The collapse of the \u201ctraffic light\u201d coalition is a disillusionment for those who believed that a progressive alliance was possible between pro-market forces, supporters of a bold green energy transition and advocates of social justice. The external hammer blows of the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and falling Chinese demand for German imports helped dash the German dream. But German fiscal fetishism also played a central role in dooming Scholz\u2019s government to failure. The centre-left went along for far too long with the conservatives and the FDP in clinging to the cult of balanced budgets and the debt brake. As a result, public borrowing remained taboo and investment in the country\u2019s crumbling infrastructure has been woefully insufficient. Whether a new conservative-led coalition would be willing or able to wriggle out of this stifling fiscal straitjacket is far from clear. If not, the German economy will die in good health, and Europe will be dragged down with it.

      "body": "<p>In Britain, as our government has promised, we\u2019re going to have a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/sep/03/coalition-of-english-councils-calls-for-emergency-644m-to-fund-housing\">council housing revolution</a>\u201d, the building of as yet unknown numbers of homes at genuinely affordable rents, a return to policies of 50 and more years ago in order to address the well-known housing crisis. Which is welcome. It also raises the question of what these homes may be like, of their quality as well as their quantity, whether they are stacked-up accumulations of units or places that contribute to their communities and enrich the lives of their inhabitants.</p> <p>Luckily there are, close at hand, outstanding examples of how this might be done, in cities and countries on the continent of Europe. In many of these places, public bodies and architects see their job as doing more than meeting numbers of homes completed. They also want to make beautiful places to live, sustainable to build and run, with homes planned to suit contemporary ways of living, and with shared and public spaces given as much importance as the private interiors. They seek to reduce environmental impacts by using natural materials, and to adapt existing buildings where possible rather than demolish them. They aim to reduce the costs of heating and air conditioning almost to zero \u2013 a simple-enough ambition, and extremely important to their tenants.</p> <p>In Vienna, a city with a history of ambitious public housing going back a century, not-for-profit housing organisations plan affordable apartment blocks <a href=\"https://gernergernerplus.com/en/projects/att-2/\">where produce can be grown on their roofs and in their courtyards</a>, irrigated by waste water, and then sold in a ground-floor shop. Communal kitchens and workshops are also included with housing developments, to help make them into communities rather than mere stacks of residential units.</p>    <p>In Paris, on the Quai de Valmy, there\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.fb-architectes.fr/quai-de-valmy\">canalside warehouse conversion</a> that, with exposed brick vaults and light-filled rooms, looks for all the world like another block of luxury lofts for well-off professionals. It\u2019s actually social housing, completed in 2022. In the heart of the same city is the \u00celot Saint-Germain development, an <a href=\"https://www.fb-architectes.fr/isg\">old office block that has been made into light-filled homes</a> \u2013 also social housing, completed last year \u2013 with the help of a deep layer of balconies. Both projects are by the same architect, <a href=\"https://www.fb-architectes.fr/\">Fran\u00e7ois Brugel and Associates</a>. In another part of the city, D\u00e9chelette Architecture have designed and recently completed an apartment block with a timber structure and rammed earth walls, the materials of desert villages imported to the stone city of Baron Haussmann, in the interests of a stylish kind of ecology.</p> <p>But some of the most remarkable public housing is now being built in Spain. In Mallorca they build social housing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/06/back-to-the-stone-age-the-sustainable-building-material-weve-all-been-waiting-for-amin-taha-groupwork-webb-yates-the-stonemasonry-company\">locally quarried stone</a> \u2013 solid stone \u2013 not out of reckless extravagance, but because it\u2019s a sustainable and durable material. In Barcelona there\u2019s a shelter for homeless women with warm wooden interiors and generous loggias, designed by <a href=\"https://www.vivasarquitectos.com/en/\">Vivas Arquitectos</a>, enriched with ceramic tiles and silvery aluminium cladding. The architecture speaks of calm and care, not desperation and last resorts.</p> <p>The Barcelona architects <a href=\"https://peristoral.com/\">Marta Peris and Jos\u00e9 Toral</a> say they design \u201csocial housing that looks like housing for rich people\u201d. They also express a belief, widespread among those who commission and design such projects, that public investment should take a lead for private developers to follow, to \u201ccreate examples that benefit the rest of society\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a level of imagination and determination in some of the best European projects that Britain\u2019s risk-averse public agencies have yet to match</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Philip Oldfield, a professor of architecture who studies European housing projects from faraway Sydney and regularly fills his <a href=\"https://x.com/SustainableTall?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">X feed with inspirational examples</a>, admires \u201cthe consistency of design excellence in Barcelona, how every project uses effective design strategies that improve occupant comfort and quality of life\u201d. Apartments, he points out, are rarely organised along a long central corridor but instead around communal atria or courtyards, with all homes having dual aspects.</p> <p>A good place to see what these attitudes make possible is <a href=\"https://lachalmeta.coop/\">La Chalmeta</a>, a cooperative apartment block in Marina del Prat Vermell, a new district of both public and private housing in an old industrial area, where almost 30,000 people are expected to live. The project is the result of an initiative by the former mayor Ada Colau, whereby the city government donates plots of land to cooperative organisations for periods of 75 years, while also supporting them with loans from a public bank, the Catalan Institute of Finance. Residents can live there for a down payment of \u20ac40,000 (\u00a333,000) \u2013 which can be reduced in individual cases by public subsidies \u2013 and a monthly charge of \u20ac650 for a three-bedroom flat, but if they want to move out, they have to return their stake for its original value. They can\u2019t speculate, in other words, on rises in the housing market.</p>    <p>For Tomoko Sakamoto, who lives there with her partner, David, and their two teenage children, the attraction of La Chalmeta is not only its affordability but its community spirit. In an experience typical of what she calls Barcelona\u2019s \u201cvery severe housing crisis\u201d, they found themselves having to move home repeatedly in the face of rent increases of up to 50%. She also \u201cstarted to imagine how I might live when I grow old, when I might be alone\u201d.</p> <p>Cooperative living means that everyone knows everyone else. They share access to a studio for remote working, courtyard gardens, a carpentry workshop, a rooftop for such things as yoga and meditation, a massage studio, bike storage, a room for meetings, events and (if desired) communal meals, as well as shared washing machines and DIY tools, which spare everyone the need to keep such things in their flat. Residents make decisions together about the management of the building, including the construction of solar panels on the roof, installed by them after the main construction works were complete. Neighbours can spontaneously ask each other for help and support.</p>    <p>The building\u2019s spare and lean design, by Pau Vidal and Vivas Arquitectos, concentrates on making spaces that enhance its collective life. It consists of an eight-storey and a four-storey block, connected by staircases and access decks wide enough for people to pause and chat, with views through and across the building and courtyards for ventilation and daylight. This approach augments the spaces within the well-planned but compact apartments, the common areas being in effect extensions of home. Another resident, Antje, tells how her children can roam freely about the block. Sharing and collaboration in a co-housing project, she says, helps address the challenges of raising small children, with which too many families too often struggle on their own.</p> <p>Cooperative living isn\u2019t for everyone. You have to be up for the joint decision-making and be able to make the initial payment. Such developments also take time to organise and build \u2013 a total of seven years in the case of La Chalmeta \u2013 which doesn\u2019t make them the most effective way of meeting urgent need. For these reasons, cooperative housing is only part of much wider efforts to create dignified affordable homes in and around Barcelona. They are driven by the pressures of a city where prices have risen dramatically, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/22/barcelona-to-ban-apartment-rentals-to-tourists-in-bid-to-cut-housing-costs\">intensified by its popularity with tourist</a> and buyers of second homes. There is a historical need to make up for lost time. Policies started under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco directed public resources into subsidising homes for sale \u2013 with the aim of turning \u201cproletarians\u201d into \u201cproprietors\u201d \u2013 which means that there is not a large stock of affordable homes for rent.</p> <p>Barcelona is also a city with a proud history of architecture, going back at least to Antoni Gaud\u00ed and his contemporaries, revived and celebrated in the renewal of the city around the time that it hosted the 1992 Olympics. Much of this pride and energy now goes into housing. Architectural competitions give younger architects the chance to contribute, and the opportunity for new ideas to be put into practice. \u201cWe have a culture of architecture as a public service,\u201d says Anna Puigjaner of the architects <a href=\"https://www.maio-architects.com/\">Maio</a>. \u201cWe feel privileged.

Impsol is also responsible for a block by Peris+Toral <a href=\"https://peristoral.com/proyectos/modulus-matrix-85-social-housing-cornella\">in nearby Cornell\u00e0 de Llobregat</a>, a timber structure with a \u201cnon-hierarchical\u201d arrangement of rooms of a kind that has become widespread.

More surprising, almost out of the blue, is a bold programme of building social housing in the Balearic Islands.

      "bodyText": "In Britain, as our government has promised, we\u2019re going to have a \u201ccouncil housing revolution\u201d, the building of as yet unknown numbers of homes at genuinely affordable rents, a return to policies of 50 and more years ago in order to address the well-known housing crisis. Which is welcome. It also raises the question of what these homes may be like, of their quality as well as their quantity, whether they are stacked-up accumulations of units or places that contribute to their communities and enrich the lives of their inhabitants. Luckily there are, close at hand, outstanding examples of how this might be done, in cities and countries on the continent of Europe. In many of these places, public bodies and architects see their job as doing more than meeting numbers of homes completed. They also want to make beautiful places to live, sustainable to build and run, with homes planned to suit contemporary ways of living, and with shared and public spaces given as much importance as the private interiors. They seek to reduce environmental impacts by using natural materials, and to adapt existing buildings where possible rather than demolish them. They aim to reduce the costs of heating and air conditioning almost to zero \u2013 a simple-enough ambition, and extremely important to their tenants. In Vienna, a city with a history of ambitious public housing going back a century, not-for-profit housing organisations plan affordable apartment blocks where produce can be grown on their roofs and in their courtyards, irrigated by waste water, and then sold in a ground-floor shop. Communal kitchens and workshops are also included with housing developments, to help make them into communities rather than mere stacks of residential units. In Paris, on the Quai de Valmy, there\u2019s a canalside warehouse conversion that, with exposed brick vaults and light-filled rooms, looks for all the world like another block of luxury lofts for well-off professionals. It\u2019s actually social housing, completed in 2022. In the heart of the same city is the \u00celot Saint-Germain development, an old office block that has been made into light-filled homes \u2013 also social housing, completed last year \u2013 with the help of a deep layer of balconies. Both projects are by the same architect, Fran\u00e7ois Brugel and Associates. In another part of the city, D\u00e9chelette Architecture have designed and recently completed an apartment block with a timber structure and rammed earth walls, the materials of desert villages imported to the stone city of Baron Haussmann, in the interests of a stylish kind of ecology. But some of the most remarkable public housing is now being built in Spain. In Mallorca they build social housing with locally quarried stone \u2013 solid stone \u2013 not out of reckless extravagance, but because it\u2019s a sustainable and durable material. In Barcelona there\u2019s a shelter for homeless women with warm wooden interiors and generous loggias, designed by Vivas Arquitectos, enriched with ceramic tiles and silvery aluminium cladding. The architecture speaks of calm and care, not desperation and last resorts. The Barcelona architects Marta Peris and Jos\u00e9 Toral say they design \u201csocial housing that looks like housing for rich people\u201d. They also express a belief, widespread among those who commission and design such projects, that public investment should take a lead for private developers to follow, to \u201ccreate examples that benefit the rest of society\u201d. Philip Oldfield, a professor of architecture who studies European housing projects from faraway Sydney and regularly fills his X feed with inspirational examples, admires \u201cthe consistency of design excellence in Barcelona, how every project uses effective design strategies that improve occupant comfort and quality of life\u201d. Apartments, he points out, are rarely organised along a long central corridor but instead around communal atria or courtyards, with all homes having dual aspects. A good place to see what these attitudes make possible is La Chalmeta, a cooperative apartment block in Marina del Prat Vermell, a new district of both public and private housing in an old industrial area, where almost 30,000 people are expected to live. The project is the result of an initiative by the former mayor Ada Colau, whereby the city government donates plots of land to cooperative organisations for periods of 75 years, while also supporting them with loans from a public bank, the Catalan Institute of Finance. Residents can live there for a down payment of \u20ac40,000 (\u00a333,000) \u2013 which can be reduced in individual cases by public subsidies \u2013 and a monthly charge of \u20ac650 for a three-bedroom flat, but if they want to move out, they have to return their stake for its original value. They can\u2019t speculate, in other words, on rises in the housing market. For Tomoko Sakamoto, who lives there with her partner, David, and their two teenage children, the attraction of La Chalmeta is not only its affordability but its community spirit. In an experience typical of what she calls Barcelona\u2019s \u201cvery severe housing crisis\u201d, they found themselves having to move home repeatedly in the face of rent increases of up to 50%. She also \u201cstarted to imagine how I might live when I grow old, when I might be alone\u201d. Cooperative living means that everyone knows everyone else. They share access to a studio for remote working, courtyard gardens, a carpentry workshop, a rooftop for such things as yoga and meditation, a massage studio, bike storage, a room for meetings, events and (if desired) communal meals, as well as shared washing machines and DIY tools, which spare everyone the need to keep such things in their flat. Residents make decisions together about the management of the building, including the construction of solar panels on the roof, installed by them after the main construction works were complete. Neighbours can spontaneously ask each other for help and support. The building\u2019s spare and lean design, by Pau Vidal and Vivas Arquitectos, concentrates on making spaces that enhance its collective life. It consists of an eight-storey and a four-storey block, connected by staircases and access decks wide enough for people to pause and chat, with views through and across the building and courtyards for ventilation and daylight. This approach augments the spaces within the well-planned but compact apartments, the common areas being in effect extensions of home. Another resident, Antje, tells how her children can roam freely about the block. Sharing and collaboration in a co-housing project, she says, helps address the challenges of raising small children, with which too many families too often struggle on their own. Cooperative living isn\u2019t for everyone. You have to be up for the joint decision-making and be able to make the initial payment. Such developments also take time to organise and build \u2013 a total of seven years in the case of La Chalmeta \u2013 which doesn\u2019t make them the most effective way of meeting urgent need. For these reasons, cooperative housing is only part of much wider efforts to create dignified affordable homes in and around Barcelona. They are driven by the pressures of a city where prices have risen dramatically, intensified by its popularity with tourist and buyers of second homes. There is a historical need to make up for lost time. Policies started under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco directed public resources into subsidising homes for sale \u2013 with the aim of turning \u201cproletarians\u201d into \u201cproprietors\u201d \u2013 which means that there is not a large stock of affordable homes for rent. Barcelona is also a city with a proud history of architecture, going back at least to Antoni Gaud\u00ed and his contemporaries, revived and celebrated in the renewal of the city around the time that it hosted the 1992 Olympics. Much of this pride and energy now goes into housing. Architectural competitions give younger architects the chance to contribute, and the opportunity for new ideas to be put into practice. \u201cWe have a culture of architecture as a public service,\u201d says Anna Puigjaner of the architects Maio. \u201cWe feel privileged. We get respect.\u201d There are public agencies such as Impsol (the Metropolitan Institute of Land Development and Property Management), which builds and runs social housing in the metropolitan area around Barcelona, and whose bland acronymic title conceals a willingness to experiment. It receives no public subsidy, apart from the sites provided by local authorities, so has to be financially self-sufficient, but this doesn\u2019t stop its ambitions for sustainability and what it calls \u201csocial innovation\u201d. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s a matter of changing society,\u201d is how Josep Maria Borrell, who leads its architectural work, describes its purpose.

      "body": "<p>For 10 months, between September 2021 and June 2022, the French writer Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re went every day to the Palais de Justice in Paris. He was there to attend the trial of a group of men accused of involvement in the terrorist attacks carried out in that city in November 2015, in which Islamic State militants massacred 130 people and injured hundreds more. The trial, which became known in the media as \u201cV13\u201d\u2013 the attacks took place on Friday (<em>Vendredi</em>) 13th&nbsp;\u2013 was the longest in French legal history, and among the most high profile.</p> <p>Carr\u00e8re\u2019s book V13, published in English translation this month, is the result of those months spent in court, listening to the testimonies of the survivors, the bereaved and those defendants connected to the attacks who remained alive. (The terrorists themselves \u2013 the men who shot and killed all those Parisians at the Bataclan theatre, the attackers outside the Stade de France and on the streets outside restaurants and cafes \u2013 were all killed, either in the suicide attacks of that night or in police shootouts.)</p> <p>At times, V13 is almost unbearably painful to read, in particular in its relation of the testimonies of the survivors. There is a chapter called In the Pit that relays what happened at the Bataclan from the points of view&nbsp;of several concert-goers. Ga\u00eblle: \u201cI knew that I\u2019d&nbsp;been badly wounded when I tried to get the shoe of&nbsp;the guy lying on top of me out of my face. That was when I saw that my cheek had been ripped off and was&nbsp;hanging down beside my face. I put my right hand into my mouth to pull out my teeth so that I wouldn\u2019t choke on them, because otherwise I could gag and attract the terrorists\u2019 attention.\u201d Lydia: \u201cYou move, you die. We pretend to be dead. Mobiles ring non-stop, with those distinctive iPhone jingles that still chill my blood six years later.\u201d</p> <p>Again and again, victims describe the smell of blood and gunpowder, the calm \u201crelish\u201d with which the killers move around the room shooting people, the \u201chuman confetti\u201d that rains down when the terrorists explode their suicide vests, and finally the rescue. \u00c9dith: \u201cThey&nbsp;got us to stand up and walk towards the exit in single file with our hands on our heads. They told us not to look, but I couldn\u2019t help looking. The sea of thick black blood that kept getting bigger and bigger. All of those bodies that were drinking and dancing just an hour earlier.\u201d</p> <p>The book began as a series of columns Carr\u00e8re wrote for the French news weekly Le Nouvel Obs. As such, it\u2019s a kind of contemporaneous diary of the trial, filled with sketches and observations of its vast gallery of characters. As a portrait of a trial and its participants \u2013 young working-class Muslim men pulled, to varying&nbsp;degrees, into an orbit of Islamist extremism; Parisian lawyers and journalists; families and friends processing their rage and sadness in a variety of ways \u2013 the book\u2019s material is that of a sprawling social novel, laying bare a country cross-sectioned at an incision point of trauma.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The state wanted the trial to be exemplary \u2013 they wanted a symbol of the response of democracy to barbarity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so, and I hope it\u2019s true,\u201d says Carr\u00e8re, when I put this to him over Zoom. (His English is perfectly good, but he wanted, in the interest of precision, to have an interpreter on the call; this was John Lambert, a longtime friend of Carr\u00e8re who is responsible for the excellent English translation of V13.) \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t looking to write a kind of nonfiction social novel when I started. What I was looking for was something about law, something about how the justice system works. In fact, when I started I didn\u2019t even know it was going to be a book.\u201d</p> <p>Writers, Carr\u00e8re tells me, tend naturally to be interested in trials because they are a raw form of drama. \u201cThe narrative, the spectacle, the theatre of it all is fascinating. And even though the journalists who go to a trial all witness the same spectacle, everybody sees it in their own way. And what was special in this trial was the nature of the involvement of the state. The state wanted the trial to be exemplary. They wanted, in a way, a symbol of the response of democracy to barbarity. And I was kind of sceptical about this at first, but in fact that is what happened.\u201d</p> <p>Although it\u2019s not a case the book explicitly makes, it does present a kind of defence of the French justice system as a humane and humanistic institution. Running beneath this account of the day-by-day business of the court is a sense that to try to get to the truth of that day, from the points of view of both the victims and the defendants, is a good in itself.</p> <p>Early in V13, Carr\u00e8re writes of a brother and sister, Aristide and Alice, who survived the attack with severe&nbsp;gunshot wounds, and who give their testimonies at the trial. Aristide speaks of his desire to understand how young people could decide to shoot other young people. Perhaps there is nothing to understand, he says, but he is glad that they can be questioned, that the trial is taking place. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re here, talking to us,\u201d writes Carr\u00e8re of the siblings\u2019 testimonies, \u201cis already justice.\u201d</p> <p>Because the men who committed the actual atrocities are all dead, the defendants at the centre of the trial are, for the most part, bit players who assisted in some way, wittingly or otherwise, those terrorists. Only one of the defendants, a Belgian named Salah Abdeslam, was directly involved in the plot: he was supposed to blow himself up at the Stade de France, along with the other suicide bombers he drove there, but he backed out at the last minute, put his suicide vest in a bin and went on the run. Although there is never any question of Abdeslam being innocent, the trial (and the book) has to consider whether he backed out because of moral qualms about taking the lives of others, or simply because he lacked the courage to end his own in the process.</p> <p>Carr\u00e8re speaks with empathy about the more minor players among the defendants, those whose connection to the attacks was more or less tangential. One particular defendant, Farid Kharkhach, made fake IDs that were used by the terrorists but insisted, fairly plausibly, that he had no idea what he was involved in. Carr\u00e8re would see him eating his lunch outside the court and felt tremendous pity for him, a petty criminal who forged documents for the wrong people and wound up on the stand in the largest terrorist trial in French history. He was a loving father who, Carr\u00e8re writes, could not bear to tell his own young children that he was on trial for associating with terrorists. When they came to see him in prison, he told them that he was not a prisoner but rather a guard.</p> <p>V13\u2019s pages are scattered with such surprising details, moments of unexpected humanity. Typically, Carr\u00e8re tells me, writers who write about trials are interested in the perpetrators. But the defendants in this case were of much less interest to him, he says, than the plaintiffs. \u201cThe plaintiffs,\u201d he says, \u201cthat was where the real story lay. In the impressive nobility of these people.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s their stories that are the book\u2019s most compelling and richly rendered. You get the sense that he could well have written an entire book about any&nbsp;number of these people: about the young woman who kept on her person, in a plastic tube, a metal bolt&nbsp;that&nbsp;embedded itself in her cheek in an explosion at the&nbsp;Stade&nbsp;de France; about Georges Salines, whose son&nbsp;was killed at the Bataclan and who conducted a&nbsp;series of conversations, later published as a book, with&nbsp;Azdyne Amimour, whose son blew himself up&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;stage.</p>    <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>Carr\u00e8re is one of the most exciting and formally innovative of current nonfiction writers. He is best known for his book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/03/the-adversary-emmanuel-carrere-jean-claude-romand-shelf-life-rachel-cooke\">The Adversary</a>, about the conman and murderer Jean-Claude Romand, which was published in French in 2000, and the following year in English, to widespread acclaim and major commercial&nbsp;success. It is, as far as I\u2019m concerned, among the greatest ever works of literary nonfiction. (I first got in contact with Carr\u00e8re a couple of years ago, after I\u2019d written my book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/25/a-thread-of-violence-by-mark-oconnell-review-a-masterpiece-of-murkiness\">A Thread of Violence</a>, because I&nbsp;wanted him to know how much The Adversary, and his work generally, had meant to me as a model. My out-of-the-blue email to him remains the only actual fan letter I\u2019ve ever written.)</p> <p>As someone whose work also focuses on the darker aspects of human nature, I was curious, as I read V13, about Carr\u00e8re\u2019s own interest in such subjects \u2013 in&nbsp;violence, and pain, and human perversity. I tell him&nbsp;that I am often asked why I tend to focus on such&nbsp;dark stories, that I am perpetually at a loss to answer such a question, and that I often wonder how he would answer it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy for me to answer either,\u201d he says, speaking in English. \u201cAnd sometimes, it\u2019s not only that I myself don\u2019t understand, it\u2019s also that I\u2019m a bit ashamed. I feel, well, why <em>do</em> I have an interest in such horrible things?\u201d</p> <p>He pauses for a long time, considering the question. Then he breaks his silence with a chuckle, and a resigned shrug. \u201cWell, I suppose,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s good stories, and everybody is interested in them. It\u2019s about humanity. But there is also one other thing: I think we are \u2013 you and me, and perhaps some of our fellow writers \u2013 interested in the kind of criminals with whom we can identify, at least a little. With whom we can say, well, in other circumstances, maybe I would be able to do something like that.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There were moments that were so, so terrible I had nightmares...</p> <footer> <cite>Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There were stretches in the early months of the trial, says Carr\u00e8re, that he found very difficult: these narratives of pain and loss were cumulatively almost too much to bear. \u201cThere were moments that were so, so terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cI had nightmares. And it was impossible to share it with my wife, my friends, because if you were not sitting in that hall, you could not understand it.</p> <p>\u201cBut as a writer,\u201d he continues, raising a hand for emphasis, \u201cit was OK. As a writer, I loved it.\u201d There was the extraordinary material unfolding in front of him, and there was the presence of a framework, in the form of the commitment to a weekly column \u2013 an imperative he found strangely liberating. \u201cThere was never a fear of the white page.\u201d</p> <p>Although hardly a straightforward work of journalism, V13 is less insistently autobiographical than much of Carr\u00e8re\u2019s previous work \u2013 and certainly less so than the recent, genre-agnostic Yoga, a raw and intimate&nbsp;account of a mental breakdown suffered at a meditation retreat.</p>    <p>In his early work, throughout the 1980s and 90s, Carr\u00e8re moved back and forth between novels and nonfiction projects: a critical text on the films of Werner Herzog; a historical novel about the writing of Frankenstein; a book about Philip K Dick; a surreal novella called The Moustache, about a man whose life falls to pieces when he shaves off his moustache and everyone around him insists he never had one to begin with. It was The Adversary, however, that marked a major inflection point, and where Carr\u00e8re really became Carr\u00e8re. (He has long had a parallel, or complementary, career in film and television.)</p> <p>As a true-crime book, The Adversary is written not so much in the tradition of In Cold Blood as against it. Where Truman Capote wrote his masterpiece as a \u201cnonfiction novel\u201d, scrupulously removing all trace of his own presence from the story (even where he was intimately involved), Carr\u00e8re put himself close to the centre. I\u2019ve lost count of how many times I\u2019ve read the book, but even now when I read its opening sentences they still retain the power to shock me:</p> <p>\u201cOn the Saturday morning of January 9, 1993, while Jean-Claude Romand was killing his wife and children, I was with mine in a parent-teacher meeting at the school attended by Gabriel, our eldest son. He was five years old, the same age as Antoine Romand. Then we went to have lunch with my parents, as Jean-Claude Romand did with his, whom he killed after their meal.\u201d</p> <p>At both the sentence and narrative level, he moves nimbly between disparate narrative points of view, his writing continually acknowledging and examining its own subjectivity. In all of the books he has published since \u2013 including the memoirs My Life As a Russian Novel, Other Lives But Mine and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/29/yoga-by-emmanuel-carrere-review-the-writer-who-ate-himself\">Yoga</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/24/the-kingdom-emmanuel-carrere-review-john-lambert\">The Kingdom</a>, about the foundation of Christianity and the writing of the Gospels; and Limonov, a biography of the Russian sci-fi writer and ultranationalist extremist Eduard Limonov \u2013 Carr\u00e8re has expanded on the radical proposition of those lines.</p> <p>This self-absorption \u2013 Carr\u00e8re\u2019s capacity to write himself and his life into any story, even about the foundation of Christianity \u2013 is equal to his ability to empathise with other people. It is not merely that he doesn\u2019t want to think outside himself, it\u2019s that he sees himself in others, and others in himself.</p> <p>If the queasy fascination of The Adversary and Limonov is Carr\u00e8re\u2019s ability to place himself in uncomfortable proximity to men who do terrible things, in V13 Carr\u00e8re found himself identifying most strongly with the parents of the victims, he tells me; people of roughly his age, whose children were roughly the age of his own. The book contains many portraits of them: studies, variously, in pain, strength and human forbearance.</p> <p>Among the most vivid is that of Nadia Mondeguer, whose 30-year-old daughter Lamia was killed in the attacks. Nadia, who was born in Cairo, is from a family of Palestinian Christians; she has a deep interest in Islam and in Arab culture, and wrote a master\u2019s thesis on the Syrian scholar Muhammad Rashid Rida, whose writings were an inspiration to the founders of the Muslim Brotherhood, and to what later became the Islamist movement. At the end of the book, Carr\u00e8re writes about her return to Cairo, three years after her daughter\u2019s death. In a park at sunset, she tells a stranger, a policeman, about her daughter and what happened to her, and he tells her that Lamia, and those other victims who died with her, are <em>shaheed</em>, martyrs. \u201cTo hear from the mouth of this Egyptian policeman that they were martyrs,\u201d writes Carr\u00e8re, \u201cand not the killers who attributed this dignity to themselves from the depths of their crass, manipulated ignorance, it was as if the world was falling back into place.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an important moment at the end of the book: an instance of beauty and tentative redemption. And when it comes, it feels deeply, and arduously, earned: you feel that Carr\u00e8re has been through it with Nadia, and with her fellow plaintiffs, and that he has taken you with him. (He and Nadia, he tells me, became good friends during the course of the trial.)</p> <p>It wouldn\u2019t be true to say that V13 reads like a novel. It reads like what it is: an episodic account of a sprawling and complex trial. But its final chapters are among the most remarkable stretches in Carr\u00e8re\u2019s oeuvre. As it&nbsp;draws to a close, he describes a dreamlike evening, right after the verdicts have been handed down, in which all the players in the grand drama of the trial \u2013 the countless lawyers, the journalists, the plaintiffs and their families, even some of the acquitted defendants \u2013 gather in a brasserie across the street from the Palais de Justice.</p> <p>There\u2019s an extraordinary fluidity to the milieu, which is strangely evocative of the closing night of a long theatrical run. There is something celebratory about the scene: not just a relief at the conclusion of the trial, but a celebration of its ambition and scale. And there is the fact, too, of its taking place on the terrace of a Paris restaurant, not unlike the sites where the terrorists gunned down so many victims on the night of the attacks. (\u201cThe terraces have won!\u201d someone bawls, amid the drunken clamour.) It\u2019s a celebration, in its way, of Paris, of its persistence and beauty in the wake of horror. It\u2019s also, movingly, a group portrait of the figures Carr\u00e8re has sketched throughout the book.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I am,\u201d says Carr\u00e8re. \u201cI consider myself a portraitist. And so it\u2019s really a gallery of portraits, this book. And a trial is a great place for a portraitist.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 V13: Chronicle of a Trial by Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re (Fern) is published on 14 November.

      "bodyText": "For 10 months, between September 2021 and June 2022, the French writer Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re went every day to the Palais de Justice in Paris. He was there to attend the trial of a group of men accused of involvement in the terrorist attacks carried out in that city in November 2015, in which Islamic State militants massacred 130 people and injured hundreds more. The trial, which became known in the media as \u201cV13\u201d\u2013 the attacks took place on Friday (Vendredi) 13th \u2013 was the longest in French legal history, and among the most high profile. Carr\u00e8re\u2019s book V13, published in English translation this month, is the result of those months spent in court, listening to the testimonies of the survivors, the bereaved and those defendants connected to the attacks who remained alive. (The terrorists themselves \u2013 the men who shot and killed all those Parisians at the Bataclan theatre, the attackers outside the Stade de France and on the streets outside restaurants and cafes \u2013 were all killed, either in the suicide attacks of that night or in police shootouts.) At times, V13 is almost unbearably painful to read, in particular in its relation of the testimonies of the survivors. There is a chapter called In the Pit that relays what happened at the Bataclan from the points of view of several concert-goers. Ga\u00eblle: \u201cI knew that I\u2019d been badly wounded when I tried to get the shoe of the guy lying on top of me out of my face. That was when I saw that my cheek had been ripped off and was hanging down beside my face. I put my right hand into my mouth to pull out my teeth so that I wouldn\u2019t choke on them, because otherwise I could gag and attract the terrorists\u2019 attention.\u201d Lydia: \u201cYou move, you die. We pretend to be dead. Mobiles ring non-stop, with those distinctive iPhone jingles that still chill my blood six years later.\u201d Again and again, victims describe the smell of blood and gunpowder, the calm \u201crelish\u201d with which the killers move around the room shooting people, the \u201chuman confetti\u201d that rains down when the terrorists explode their suicide vests, and finally the rescue. \u00c9dith: \u201cThey got us to stand up and walk towards the exit in single file with our hands on our heads. They told us not to look, but I couldn\u2019t help looking. The sea of thick black blood that kept getting bigger and bigger. All of those bodies that were drinking and dancing just an hour earlier.\u201d The book began as a series of columns Carr\u00e8re wrote for the French news weekly Le Nouvel Obs. As such, it\u2019s a kind of contemporaneous diary of the trial, filled with sketches and observations of its vast gallery of characters. As a portrait of a trial and its participants \u2013 young working-class Muslim men pulled, to varying degrees, into an orbit of Islamist extremism; Parisian lawyers and journalists; families and friends processing their rage and sadness in a variety of ways \u2013 the book\u2019s material is that of a sprawling social novel, laying bare a country cross-sectioned at an incision point of trauma. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so, and I hope it\u2019s true,\u201d says Carr\u00e8re, when I put this to him over Zoom. (His English is perfectly good, but he wanted, in the interest of precision, to have an interpreter on the call; this was John Lambert, a longtime friend of Carr\u00e8re who is responsible for the excellent English translation of V13.) \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t looking to write a kind of nonfiction social novel when I started. What I was looking for was something about law, something about how the justice system works. In fact, when I started I didn\u2019t even know it was going to be a book.\u201d Writers, Carr\u00e8re tells me, tend naturally to be interested in trials because they are a raw form of drama. \u201cThe narrative, the spectacle, the theatre of it all is fascinating. And even though the journalists who go to a trial all witness the same spectacle, everybody sees it in their own way. And what was special in this trial was the nature of the involvement of the state. The state wanted the trial to be exemplary. They wanted, in a way, a symbol of the response of democracy to barbarity. And I was kind of sceptical about this at first, but in fact that is what happened.\u201d Although it\u2019s not a case the book explicitly makes, it does present a kind of defence of the French justice system as a humane and humanistic institution. Running beneath this account of the day-by-day business of the court is a sense that to try to get to the truth of that day, from the points of view of both the victims and the defendants, is a good in itself. Early in V13, Carr\u00e8re writes of a brother and sister, Aristide and Alice, who survived the attack with severe gunshot wounds, and who give their testimonies at the trial. Aristide speaks of his desire to understand how young people could decide to shoot other young people. Perhaps there is nothing to understand, he says, but he is glad that they can be questioned, that the trial is taking place. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re here, talking to us,\u201d writes Carr\u00e8re of the siblings\u2019 testimonies, \u201cis already justice.\u201d Because the men who committed the actual atrocities are all dead, the defendants at the centre of the trial are, for the most part, bit players who assisted in some way, wittingly or otherwise, those terrorists. Only one of the defendants, a Belgian named Salah Abdeslam, was directly involved in the plot: he was supposed to blow himself up at the Stade de France, along with the other suicide bombers he drove there, but he backed out at the last minute, put his suicide vest in a bin and went on the run. Although there is never any question of Abdeslam being innocent, the trial (and the book) has to consider whether he backed out because of moral qualms about taking the lives of others, or simply because he lacked the courage to end his own in the process. Carr\u00e8re speaks with empathy about the more minor players among the defendants, those whose connection to the attacks was more or less tangential. One particular defendant, Farid Kharkhach, made fake IDs that were used by the terrorists but insisted, fairly plausibly, that he had no idea what he was involved in. Carr\u00e8re would see him eating his lunch outside the court and felt tremendous pity for him, a petty criminal who forged documents for the wrong people and wound up on the stand in the largest terrorist trial in French history. He was a loving father who, Carr\u00e8re writes, could not bear to tell his own young children that he was on trial for associating with terrorists. When they came to see him in prison, he told them that he was not a prisoner but rather a guard. V13\u2019s pages are scattered with such surprising details, moments of unexpected humanity. Typically, Carr\u00e8re tells me, writers who write about trials are interested in the perpetrators. But the defendants in this case were of much less interest to him, he says, than the plaintiffs. \u201cThe plaintiffs,\u201d he says, \u201cthat was where the real story lay. In the impressive nobility of these people.\u201d And it\u2019s their stories that are the book\u2019s most compelling and richly rendered. You get the sense that he could well have written an entire book about any number of these people: about the young woman who kept on her person, in a plastic tube, a metal bolt that embedded itself in her cheek in an explosion at the Stade de France; about Georges Salines, whose son was killed at the Bataclan and who conducted a series of conversations, later published as a book, with Azdyne Amimour, whose son blew himself up on the stage. *** Carr\u00e8re is one of the most exciting and formally innovative of current nonfiction writers. He is best known for his book The Adversary, about the conman and murderer Jean-Claude Romand, which was published in French in 2000, and the following year in English, to widespread acclaim and major commercial success. It is, as far as I\u2019m concerned, among the greatest ever works of literary nonfiction. (I first got in contact with Carr\u00e8re a couple of years ago, after I\u2019d written my book A Thread of Violence, because I wanted him to know how much The Adversary, and his work generally, had meant to me as a model. My out-of-the-blue email to him remains the only actual fan letter I\u2019ve ever written.) As someone whose work also focuses on the darker aspects of human nature, I was curious, as I read V13, about Carr\u00e8re\u2019s own interest in such subjects \u2013 in violence, and pain, and human perversity. I tell him that I am often asked why I tend to focus on such dark stories, that I am perpetually at a loss to answer such a question, and that I often wonder how he would answer it. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy for me to answer either,\u201d he says, speaking in English. \u201cAnd sometimes, it\u2019s not only that I myself don\u2019t understand, it\u2019s also that I\u2019m a bit ashamed.

With whom we can say, well, in other circumstances, maybe I would be able to do something like that.\u201d There were stretches in the early months of the trial, says Carr\u00e8re, that he found very difficult: these narratives of pain and loss were cumulatively almost too much to bear. \u201cThere were moments that were so, so terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cI had nightmares. And it was impossible to share it with my wife, my friends, because if you were not sitting in that hall, you could not understand it. \u201cBut as a writer,\u201d he continues, raising a hand for emphasis, \u201cit was OK. As a writer, I loved it.\u201d There was the extraordinary material unfolding in front of him, and there was the presence of a framework, in the form of the commitment to a weekly column \u2013 an imperative he found strangely liberating. \u201cThere was never a fear of the white page.\u201d Although hardly a straightforward work of journalism, V13 is less insistently autobiographical than much of Carr\u00e8re\u2019s previous work \u2013 and certainly less so than the recent, genre-agnostic Yoga, a raw and intimate account of a mental breakdown suffered at a meditation retreat. In his early work, throughout the 1980s and 90s, Carr\u00e8re moved back and forth between novels and nonfiction projects: a critical text on the films of Werner Herzog; a historical novel about the writing of Frankenstein; a book about Philip K Dick; a surreal novella called The Moustache, about a man whose life falls to pieces when he shaves off his moustache and everyone around him insists he never had one to begin with. It was The Adversary, however, that marked a major inflection point, and where Carr\u00e8re really became Carr\u00e8re. (He has long had a parallel, or complementary, career in film and television.) As a true-crime book, The Adversary is written not so much in the tradition of In Cold Blood as against it. Where Truman Capote wrote his masterpiece as a \u201cnonfiction novel\u201d, scrupulously removing all trace of his own presence from the story (even where he was intimately involved), Carr\u00e8re put himself close to the centre. I\u2019ve lost count of how many times I\u2019ve read the book, but even now when I read its opening sentences they still retain the power to shock me: \u201cOn the Saturday morning of January 9, 1993, while Jean-Claude Romand was killing his wife and children, I was with mine in a parent-teacher meeting at the school attended by Gabriel, our eldest son. He was five years old, the same age as Antoine Romand. Then we went to have lunch with my parents, as Jean-Claude Romand did with his, whom he killed after their meal.\u201d At both the sentence and narrative level, he moves nimbly between disparate narrative points of view, his writing continually acknowledging and examining its own subjectivity. In all of the books he has published since \u2013 including the memoirs My Life As a Russian Novel, Other Lives But Mine and Yoga; The Kingdom, about the foundation of Christianity and the writing of the Gospels; and Limonov, a biography of the Russian sci-fi writer and ultranationalist extremist Eduard Limonov \u2013 Carr\u00e8re has expanded on the radical proposition of those lines. This self-absorption \u2013 Carr\u00e8re\u2019s capacity to write himself and his life into any story, even about the foundation of Christianity \u2013 is equal to his ability to empathise with other people. It is not merely that he doesn\u2019t want to think outside himself, it\u2019s that he sees himself in others, and others in himself. If the queasy fascination of The Adversary and Limonov is Carr\u00e8re\u2019s ability to place himself in uncomfortable proximity to men who do terrible things, in V13 Carr\u00e8re found himself identifying most strongly with the parents of the victims, he tells me; people of roughly his age, whose children were roughly the age of his own. The book contains many portraits of them: studies, variously, in pain, strength and human forbearance. Among the most vivid is that of Nadia Mondeguer, whose 30-year-old daughter Lamia was killed in the attacks. Nadia, who was born in Cairo, is from a family of Palestinian Christians; she has a deep interest in Islam and in Arab culture, and wrote a master\u2019s thesis on the Syrian scholar Muhammad Rashid Rida, whose writings were an inspiration to the founders of the Muslim Brotherhood, and to what later became the Islamist movement. At the end of the book, Carr\u00e8re writes about her return to Cairo, three years after her daughter\u2019s death. In a park at sunset, she tells a stranger, a policeman, about her daughter and what happened to her, and he tells her that Lamia, and those other victims who died with her, are shaheed, martyrs. \u201cTo hear from the mouth of this Egyptian policeman that they were martyrs,\u201d writes Carr\u00e8re, \u201cand not the killers who attributed this dignity to themselves from the depths of their crass, manipulated ignorance, it was as if the world was falling back into place.\u201d It\u2019s an important moment at the end of the book: an instance of beauty and tentative redemption. And when it comes, it feels deeply, and arduously, earned: you feel that Carr\u00e8re has been through it with Nadia, and with her fellow plaintiffs, and that he has taken you with him. (He and Nadia, he tells me, became good friends during the course of the trial.) It wouldn\u2019t be true to say that V13 reads like a novel. It reads like what it is: an episodic account of a sprawling and complex trial. But its final chapters are among the most remarkable stretches in Carr\u00e8re\u2019s oeuvre. As it draws to a close, he describes a dreamlike evening, right after the verdicts have been handed down, in which all the players in the grand drama of the trial \u2013 the countless lawyers, the journalists, the plaintiffs and their families, even some of the acquitted defendants \u2013 gather in a brasserie across the street from the Palais de Justice. There\u2019s an extraordinary fluidity to the milieu, which is strangely evocative of the closing night of a long theatrical run. There is something celebratory about the scene: not just a relief at the conclusion of the trial, but a celebration of its ambition and scale. And there is the fact, too, of its taking place on the terrace of a Paris restaurant, not unlike the sites where the terrorists gunned down so many victims on the night of the attacks. (\u201cThe terraces have won!\u201d someone bawls, amid the drunken clamour.) It\u2019s a celebration, in its way, of Paris, of its persistence and beauty in the wake of horror. It\u2019s also, movingly, a group portrait of the figures Carr\u00e8re has sketched throughout the book. \u201cThat\u2019s what I am,\u201d says Carr\u00e8re. \u201cI consider myself a portraitist. And so it\u2019s really a gallery of portraits, this book. And a trial is a great place for a portraitist.\u201d \u2022 V13: Chronicle of a Trial by Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re (Fern) is published on 14 November.

It would often taken feverish consultations with Trump\u2019s senior aides, including some in the Pentagon, before a plan \u2013 such as a premature withdrawal of 2,500 US troops from Afghanistan \u2013 could be finessed.</p> <p>Now, for all the pro-forma congratulations, that sense of foreboding is back. Although only 4% of the American electorate said foreign policy was the most important issue to them in the election, for those watching from abroad it was the all-consuming preoccupation.</p> <p>That is hardly surprising, as Trump represents an injection of highly combustible material into an already explosive world. Two wars are raging, one now including North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia, and the other still capable of pitting Iran against Israel. And a third with China is looming. In the eyes of Republican foreign policy thinkers, that is at least two wars too many.</p> <p>Yet, extraordinarily, Trump\u2019s campaign left few clues as to how he would conduct foreign policy. Often the proposals he referenced were mere headlines \u2013 such as ending the war in Ukraine in 24 hours; outlandish, such as deporting 10 million migrants; or contradictory, concerning committing to Nato and suggesting Russia does whatever it wants to European freeloaders.</p> <p>Apart from that, there is a broad intent to make tariffs as much as sanctions the central part of the US foreign policy armoury.</p> <p>It is hard to claim it amounted to a serious prospectus.</p>    <p>At one level, this is surprising, as so much of Trump\u2019s analysis of America\u2019s domestic ills derives from his analysis of the failures of US foreign policy. Indeed, the link between foreign and domestic policy is a preoccupation of the small group of foreign policy experts closest to him, not least the vice-president-elect, JD Vance.</p> <p>Vance, for instance, has argued: \u201cFrom Iraq to Afghanistan, from the financial crisis to the Great Recession, from open borders to stagnant wages, the people who govern this country have failed and failed again.\u201d</p> <p>He went on: \u201cFurthermore, they failed because they bought into a theory of the world that forgot to put the interests of the US front and centre. No longer. As Trump famously declared back in 2016 when he first won the White House, \u2018Americanism, not globalism, will now be our credo.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Peace through strength?</h2> <p>How Trump intervenes in the world now is a matter of debate within his circle of foreign policy specialists. Jeremy Shapiro from the European Council on Foreign Relations has put them into three tribes \u2013 the restrainers, who want the US to do as little as possible, the prioritisers, who argue that distractions such as Ukraine must be removed to focus on the Great Power competition with China, and the primacists, who insist the US must remain the hegemonic power throughout the globe, and ceding any status to the rising powers in Brics would be fatal.</p> <p>But they all agree Trump\u2019s second term has to be different, because the challenges have changed.</p> <p>Nadia Schadlow, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cHe will step into a more hazardous geopolitical arena than the one he left four years earlier. Simply resuming the foreign policy of his first term will not be sufficient to navigate a complex environment in which US rivals are arming at a rapid pace and, in the case of Russia and Iran, are engaged in regional wars. This is no longer just a competition; today\u2019s conflicts could be a prelude to a wider war.\u201d</p> <p>A second Trump administration, she argued, would need to adjust its mindset to ensure that the US can protect itself and restore deterrence in an increasingly dangerous world.</p> <p>\u201cThe US would need to adopt a strategy of overmatch, a military concept that refers to combining capabilities in sufficient scale to ensure lopsided victories over the enemy in combat,\u201d Schadlow said. \u201cTo achieve overmatch, US forces must be able to seize the initiative, maintain their freedom of action and find ways to limit the country\u2019s adversaries to reactive measures.\u201d</p>    <p>This assertion of peace through strength comes with a price tag. She says it would require a \u201cbuild-up of US military force not seen since the last decade of the cold war\u201d. That necessitates prioritising, the key theme of the 2018 Trump national security strategy in which Elbridge Colby had a key role.</p> <p>Colby insists Trump will not oppose alliances per se but view them as less values-driven and more \u201ca private business partnership\u201d, in which both sides aim to have their commercial self-interest satisfied. If those partnerships become inequitable, or the US feels it is being fleeced, then they can be broken.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Concessions to Putin and Netanyahu</h2> <p>The first test of this transactionalism will come with Ukraine. Vance has already set out one idea of what could happen. He said in September: \u201cTrump would sit down with Russians, Ukrainians and Europeans and say: \u2018You guys need to figure out what a peaceful settlement looks like.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But Vance said he already knew what this deal would entail, making the European presence at the negotiation table close to superfluous. \u201cThe Russians would retain the land they have taken and a demilitarised zone would be established along the current battle lines, with the Ukrainian side heavily fortified to prevent another Russian invasion,\u201d he said.</p> <p>While the remainder of Ukraine would stay an independent sovereign state, Vance said, Russia would get a \u201cguarantee of neutrality\u201d from Ukraine. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t join Nato, it doesn\u2019t join some of these sort of allied institutions. I think that\u2019s ultimately what this looks like.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, a lead candidate to be Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Richard O\u2019Brien, writing in Foreign Affairs, said he supported Ukraine so long as Europe paid more, something it feels it is already doing.</p> <p>He wrote: \u201cTrump\u2019s approach would be to continue to provide lethal aid to Ukraine, financed by European countries, while keeping the door open to diplomacy with Russia \u2013 and keeping Moscow off balance with a degree of unpredictability. He would also push Nato to rotate ground and air forces to Poland<strong> </strong>to augment its capabilities closer to Russia\u2019s border and to make unmistakably clear that the alliance will defend all its territory from foreign aggression.</p> <p>\u201cIf Europe wants to show that it is serious about defending Ukraine, it should admit the country to the European Union immediately, waiving the usual bureaucratic accession protocol.\u201d</p>    <p>Conspicuously, in neither plan would there be any room for Ukraine to enter Nato, a red line for Putin.</p> <p>Olaf Scholz, eager to shed the cost of Ukraine before next year\u2019s federal election, may feel Europe has no choice but to urge Zelenskyy to accept, yet there is no guarantee Putin will negotiate. Sir Peter Westmacott, a former UK ambassador to the US, suggests that Trump, if he wants to be the negotiator in chief, should listen to David Cameron and buy Ukraine some time to get some better bargaining chips on the table.</p> <p>Ukraine\u2019s future will be part of a wider discussion, conducted in Europe and across the Atlantic, about the nature of the Russian threat and perennial subject of strengthening European security.</p> <p>Europe, of course, already had four years to make itself more self-reliant before a possible second Trump term. There were phrases bandied about such as \u201cthe era of geopolitical outsourcing is over\u201d. But Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, the German CDU party\u2019s foreign policy expert, told a recent Chatham House event: \u201cWe are not prepared and we are to blame for that.\u201d The European rhetoric never matched reality.</p> <p>The coordination in defence spending advocated by the French for a decade had proved too daunting, expensive and at odds with the needs of national defence industries. A pan-European air defence shield, for example, would cost \u20ac500bn ($540bn; \u00a3416bn), the EU\u2019s incoming defence commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, said this week. That\u2019s roughly 50% more than EU countries collectively spend on defence each year, he added.</p> <p>Europe is already pointing out that, as of June, 23 of Nato\u2019s 32 members had met its target of spending 2% of GDP on defence, twice as many as four years ago. But Colby, who believes the US should focus its energy on China, says that Europe, however indebted, will have to spend still more. In this narrow regard, he and Emmanuel Macron think alike.</p> <p>Part of the problem is that the EU has demonstrated its unwillingness to conduct a common foreign policy, as evidenced by its year-long division over Palestine, divisions born of national histories.</p> <p>Those divisions will allow Trump, in partnership with Benjamin Netanyahu, to ignore the resolutions of the UN, which both men hold in contempt. Netanyahu will have a freer hand to obliterate Hamas and form an Israeli-led administration in Gaza.</p> <p>The sporadic US pressure on Israel to back a two-state solution, encouraged by Saudi Arabia, will dissipate. Trump told Time magazine: \u201cThere was a time when I thought two states could work.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, O\u2019Brien says, Iran and those who trade with Iran will once again feel the heat of maximum sanctions pressure, the policy devised by Stephen Mull, now appointed to be the head of Trump transition at the State Department. Iran in turn will debate in its more isolated circumstances whether the fatwa on possessing nuclear weapons should be lifted.</p> <p>But there will be a tension. Some in the administration will back the Greater Israel project. Others will want Saudi to normalise relations with Israel in a further extension of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/15/uae-bahrain-and-israel-sign-historic-accords-at-white-house-event-formal-relations-trump-netanyahu\">Abraham accords</a>, Trump\u2019s signature first-term foreign policy achievement.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Focus on China</h2> <p>All of this is for a single purpose \u2013 to focus laser-like on the coming challenge of China, and what Colby has referenced as \u201cthe cosmic role of the dice\u201d, the decision facing China on whether to invade Taiwan. The sense that China is the pre-eminent strategic threat shines through the thinking of the entire Trump policy circle, many of whom advocate the complete decoupling of the two economies.</p> <p>Beijing may have drawn comfort from Trump\u2019s recent proclamation that \u201cTaiwan doesn\u2019t give us anything\u201d, even though the US, which he likened to the mafia, gave them protection. But Beijing knows that is not a green light.</p>    <p>O\u2019Brien writes: \u201dThe Chinese Communist party seeks to expand its power and security by supplanting the United States as the global leader in technological development and innovation in critical areas such as electric vehicles, solar power, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. To do so, Beijing relies on enormous subsidies, intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices.\u201d</p> <p>Beijing knows what is coming: tariffs. Yet Trump\u2019s threat to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese exports (and up to 200% on electric vehicles) would, if implemented, destabilise international trade patterns and raise political tension with Europe. Brussels would either have to follow suit, or, worried about China retaliating, pursue a visibly different approach towards engagement with China, which may incur US penalties.</p> <p>Those penalties could include efforts to destabilise the EU by offering tariff deals to populist rightwing governments. Dividing allies so as to rule them is far from beneath Trump, and it is far from beneath European states to push one another aside in the hope of winning Trump\u2019s favour.</p> <p>Yet even here, Trump is contradictory. In his last presidency he offered to lift key export controls in return for the elusive trade deal with China that never materialised. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/trump-joe-rogan-podcast\">Appearing on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast</a>, he attacked the Chips and Science Act, designed to reduce US reliance on Asia for semiconductors and passed with overwhelming Republican support, complaining it had given government support to key American competitors.</p> <p>It is going to take advisers of great patience and loyalty to work alongside what the political scientist Stephen Walt has warned will be \u201can increasingly erratic and infirm president\u201d.</p> <p>It is hard to underestimate how foreign policy will not be about his advisers but about Trump, and the efficacy of his protection-racket diplomacy. He told the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board in October that he would not have to threaten China with the use of US military force over Taiwan because Xi Jinping \u201crespects me and knows I am crazy\u201d.</p> <p>Similarly, he claims he told the Russian leader: \u201cVladimir, if you go after Ukraine, I am going to hit you so hard, you\u2019re not even going to believe it. I\u2019m going to hit you right in the middle of fricking Moscow.\u201d</p> <p>Welcome to the new world order.</p>",

To do so, Beijing relies on enormous subsidies, intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices.\u201d Beijing knows what is coming: tariffs. Yet Trump\u2019s threat to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese exports (and up to 200% on electric vehicles) would, if implemented, destabilise international trade patterns and raise political tension with Europe. Brussels would either have to follow suit, or, worried about China retaliating, pursue a visibly different approach towards engagement with China, which may incur US penalties. Those penalties could include efforts to destabilise the EU by offering tariff deals to populist rightwing governments. Dividing allies so as to rule them is far from beneath Trump, and it is far from beneath European states to push one another aside in the hope of winning Trump\u2019s favour. Yet even here, Trump is contradictory. In his last presidency he offered to lift key export controls in return for the elusive trade deal with China that never materialised. Appearing on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast, he attacked the Chips and Science Act, designed to reduce US reliance on Asia for semiconductors and passed with overwhelming Republican support, complaining it had given government support to key American competitors. It is going to take advisers of great patience and loyalty to work alongside what the political scientist Stephen Walt has warned will be \u201can increasingly erratic and infirm president\u201d. It is hard to underestimate how foreign policy will not be about his advisers but about Trump, and the efficacy of his protection-racket diplomacy. He told the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board in October that he would not have to threaten China with the use of US military force over Taiwan because Xi Jinping \u201crespects me and knows I am crazy\u201d. Similarly, he claims he told the Russian leader: \u201cVladimir, if you go after Ukraine, I am going to hit you so hard, you\u2019re not even going to believe it. I\u2019m going to hit you right in the middle of fricking Moscow.\u201d Welcome to the new world order.",

The invasion of the England football player\u2019s home was one in a recent string of burglaries targeting the homes of high-profile sports stars when they are on the field or overseas. To criminals, the home of a footballer is no doubt an attractive proposition; likely to contain tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of high-value goods, including electronics, jewellery, designer clothing and luxury watches. Burglars are able to work out their best opportunities to strike from the social media accounts of sports stars, who often post about their time away training or on family holidays, or even simply from the fixtures timetable.

It turns out that the teens have their nightmares in common: they\u2019re all being stalked by a razor-gloved man named Fred Krueger (Robert Englund) with a burned, disfigured face, a ragged red-and-green-striped sweater, and an old fedora.

      "body": "<p>There was a moment when Clarisse Cr\u00e9mer stopped working her boat and simply wept. She crouched below deck, sheltering from the wind and waves that were battering the hull into pieces. The solo yachtswoman was mid-race, between France and New York, in May. If she did not finish the Transat CIC, she would fail to qualify for the 2024 Vend\u00e9e Globe, the round-the-world race that takes place every four years. But there was a crack in her bulkhead more than four metres long. This was not about racing any more, it was about surviving.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always super humbling,\u201d Cr\u00e9mer says, recalling her emotions that day. \u201cSailors are competitive people, we like to push ourselves and the boat hard, but suddenly you realise you\u2019re just on a very small boat in the middle of a big ocean and the amount of water around you is infinite.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/20/ben-ainslie-britain-new-zealand-sailing-americas-cup\">Ben Ainslie keeps faith in Britain\u2019s prolonged pursuit of America\u2019s Cup </a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the next four days she gingerly shepherded her craft across 500 miles to the Azores and her only hope of repair. Her technical team worked in shifts for three days: Cr\u00e9mer ended up sailing L\u2019Occitane en Provence across the finish line in New York with just hours to spare.</p> <p>On Sunday the French sailor will compete in the Vend\u00e9e Globe for a second time. In the last edition she became the fastest woman to sail solo around the world, breaking the record set by Ellen MacArthur in 2005. Her presence on the starting line is a miracle and a rebuke to the chauvinism she continues to face in ocean racing. Last year Cr\u00e9mer was sacked by her team a few months after becoming a mother.

      "bodyText": "There was a moment when Clarisse Cr\u00e9mer stopped working her boat and simply wept. She crouched below deck, sheltering from the wind and waves that were battering the hull into pieces. The solo yachtswoman was mid-race, between France and New York, in May. If she did not finish the Transat CIC, she would fail to qualify for the 2024 Vend\u00e9e Globe, the round-the-world race that takes place every four years. But there was a crack in her bulkhead more than four metres long. This was not about racing any more, it was about surviving. \u201cIt\u2019s always super humbling,\u201d Cr\u00e9mer says, recalling her emotions that day. \u201cSailors are competitive people, we like to push ourselves and the boat hard, but suddenly you realise you\u2019re just on a very small boat in the middle of a big ocean and the amount of water around you is infinite.\u201d For the next four days she gingerly shepherded her craft across 500 miles to the Azores and her only hope of repair. Her technical team worked in shifts for three days: Cr\u00e9mer ended up sailing L\u2019Occitane en Provence across the finish line in New York with just hours to spare. On Sunday the French sailor will compete in the Vend\u00e9e Globe for a second time. In the last edition she became the fastest woman to sail solo around the world, breaking the record set by Ellen MacArthur in 2005. Her presence on the starting line is a miracle and a rebuke to the chauvinism she continues to face in ocean racing. Last year Cr\u00e9mer was sacked by her team a few months after becoming a mother.

      "body": "<p>After Donald Trump\u2019s US presidential election victory this week, <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/tips-look-after-your-mental-health-during-traumatic-world-events\">a briefing</a> handily re-appeared in the \u201cmost popular topics\u201d section of the <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/\">Mental Health Foundation </a>website: \u201cTips to look after your mental health during traumatic world events.\u201d</p> <p>The briefing has been well-read before, at times of war, conflict, violence and social tension \u2013 and people were turning to it for advice once again as Trump\u2019s win ushered in a phase of deep despondency and political uncertainty for many people.</p> <p>\u201cThese are difficult and intense moments for many people. Anxiety is not an unreasonable response, and you should not feel diminished for being worried,\u201d said Lee Knifton, a Mental Health Foundation director.</p> <p>The potential changes augured by the Trump presidency \u2013 economic and social upheaval, threats to human rights, the prospect of racial divisiveness \u2013 can create or exacerbate feelings of anxiety, foreboding and loss of control.</p> <p>Even if we are not directly involved, watching traumatic world events unfold that cause actual or portents of harm or suffering, whether to ourselves, loved ones or complete strangers, can affect our mental health, the foundation says.</p> <p>It is worth trying to pause, reflect and see if perspectives settle after the initial shock and despair, it says. Try to accept events may be out of your control and influence. \u201cTime is important. It\u2019s useful to see how things land,\u201d said Knifton.</p> <p>If the feelings of gloom persist there are ways to cope, the foundation says, however helpless things may seem. One strategy is to limit your news consumption and reduce social media use, especially if it puts you in low spirits. Avoid long scrolling sessions.</p> <p>Another strategy is to find ways to connect and engage with others. Don\u2019t bottle things up, and remember many others share your feelings. Volunteering and activism are practical ways to find a sense of agency and esteem, often expressed as a desire to make a difference.</p> <p>The beneficial mental health effects of volunteering are well documented. A <a href=\"https://www.ncvo.org.uk/news-and-insights/news-index/time-well-spent-2023/\">2023 study</a> by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations found 75% of respondents reported that volunteering was good for their mental health and wellbeing.</p> <p>Nine out of 10 respondents reported that volunteering \u2013 with a charity, community group, or school or civic institution \u2013 made them feel they were making a difference. Seventy-four per cent said it brought them into positive contact with people from different backgrounds, and 68% that it made them feel less socially isolated.</p> <p>Getting involved in political and civic activism can help lessen the feelings of being voiceless or having little control. The foundation recommends exploring involvement with political, civic or social groups, or seeking out public events and debates.</p> <h2>Get involved in local civic causes</h2> <p>Politicians and activists often say they were inspired to start by local injustices encountered in their own lives or neighbourhoods. This could be campaigning against the closure of a school or library, opposing controversial planning decisions, or proactively setting up services where none exist, such as self-help groups for parents, or sports teams for children.</p> <h2>Volunteering</h2> <p>Charities are often crying out for volunteer expertise. <a href=\"https://reachvolunteering.org.uk/\">Reach Volunteering</a> is a national charity offering a range of opportunities for people with professional and technical skills \u2013 it might be finance, legal, IT, building work, education or cookery \u2013 and links them with voluntary roles at a wide range of good causes, from local community groups to food banks and hospices.</p> <h2>Political, social and environmental activism</h2> <p>Joining a local political party or activist group can open opportunities to discuss and debate pressing local and international issues. It may give you a voice in the drawing up of local or national policies, and offer opportunities for you to get your point across through elected roles as well as marches, demonstrations, and petitions. Donating financially to good causes close to your heart is another way to show solidarity.</p>",

      "bodyText": "After Donald Trump\u2019s US presidential election victory this week, a briefing handily re-appeared in the \u201cmost popular topics\u201d section of the Mental Health Foundation website: \u201cTips to look after your mental health during traumatic world events.\u201d The briefing has been well-read before, at times of war, conflict, violence and social tension \u2013 and people were turning to it for advice once again as Trump\u2019s win ushered in a phase of deep despondency and political uncertainty for many people. \u201cThese are difficult and intense moments for many people. Anxiety is not an unreasonable response, and you should not feel diminished for being worried,\u201d said Lee Knifton, a Mental Health Foundation director. The potential changes augured by the Trump presidency \u2013 economic and social upheaval, threats to human rights, the prospect of racial divisiveness \u2013 can create or exacerbate feelings of anxiety, foreboding and loss of control. Even if we are not directly involved, watching traumatic world events unfold that cause actual or portents of harm or suffering, whether to ourselves, loved ones or complete strangers, can affect our mental health, the foundation says. It is worth trying to pause, reflect and see if perspectives settle after the initial shock and despair, it says. Try to accept events may be out of your control and influence. \u201cTime is important. It\u2019s useful to see how things land,\u201d said Knifton. If the feelings of gloom persist there are ways to cope, the foundation says, however helpless things may seem. One strategy is to limit your news consumption and reduce social media use, especially if it puts you in low spirits. Avoid long scrolling sessions. Another strategy is to find ways to connect and engage with others. Don\u2019t bottle things up, and remember many others share your feelings. Volunteering and activism are practical ways to find a sense of agency and esteem, often expressed as a desire to make a difference. The beneficial mental health effects of volunteering are well documented. A 2023 study by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations found 75% of respondents reported that volunteering was good for their mental health and wellbeing. Nine out of 10 respondents reported that volunteering \u2013 with a charity, community group, or school or civic institution \u2013 made them feel they were making a difference. Seventy-four per cent said it brought them into positive contact with people from different backgrounds, and 68% that it made them feel less socially isolated. Getting involved in political and civic activism can help lessen the feelings of being voiceless or having little control. The foundation recommends exploring involvement with political, civic or social groups, or seeking out public events and debates. Get involved in local civic causes Politicians and activists often say they were inspired to start by local injustices encountered in their own lives or neighbourhoods. This could be campaigning against the closure of a school or library, opposing controversial planning decisions, or proactively setting up services where none exist, such as self-help groups for parents, or sports teams for children. Volunteering Charities are often crying out for volunteer expertise. Reach Volunteering is a national charity offering a range of opportunities for people with professional and technical skills \u2013 it might be finance, legal, IT, building work, education or cookery \u2013 and links them with voluntary roles at a wide range of good causes, from local community groups to food banks and hospices. Political, social and environmental activism Joining a local political party or activist group can open opportunities to discuss and debate pressing local and international issues. It may give you a voice in the drawing up of local or national policies, and offer opportunities for you to get your point across through elected roles as well as marches, demonstrations, and petitions. Donating financially to good causes close to your heart is another way to show solidarity.",

      "body": "<p>There has been a worrying silence this week around A$AP Rocky\u2019s plans to buy Tranmere Rovers. A co-investor has dropped out. Further finance is being urgently sought. Given the Tranmere consortium also currently features Matthew Bevilaqua from The&nbsp;Sopranos \u2013 a bit random, but, hey, it\u2019s just good to see the Bevilaqua kid doing OK \u2013 it seems fair to say the field is pretty open here. What\u2019s Badger from Breaking Bad up to these days?</p> <p>For those who don\u2019t know, A$AP Rocky is a musical superstar, retailer of four million albums, famous for his association with Rihanna. For those who don\u2019t know from the other side, Tranmere are the 1990 Football League Trophy winners, famous for their association with Elton Welsby.</p> <p>At first glance this might seem an unlikely meeting of interests. But it does also look like it could be real. This type of takeover, the MC-Hammer-buys-Lincoln-City dynamic, is common now in football. The purchase model says this is all in the end just engagement, eyeballs, product-hunger. A famous face leverages the brand, even when that brand is currently a worried-looking Nigel Adkins and Mike Dean throwing limbs in a puffa coat.</p> <p>It is also a good fit in a wider sense. Merseyside and New York, where A$AP Rocky is from, have their own well-seasoned links. He makes hugely popular, soulful music that connects with people. He recorded L$D, one of the most amazing love songs of all time. Rap music and football are a good fit generally, as evidenced by pictures this week of Cole Palmer looking genuinely excited to launch a new Chelsea charity alongside the London grime/drill MC Central Cee (best Central&nbsp;Cee-\u200acentred football lyric: Dave on Trojan Horse, \u201cBlack Brit in Italian kit, I feel like Tammy in Roma\u201d).</p>    <p>At which point two questions present themselves. Why are you going on about this, grandad? And why do you have so many opinions on Central Cee and A$AP Rocky? Go and listen to a podcast on the unification of Italy or something.</p> <p>Answering this presents an obvious opportunity to self-cancel, to be transformed into a living embodiment of the Steve Buscemi \u201chello, fellow kids\u201d skateboarding meme, and also to Get Music Wrong and annoy people (men). But sod it, this is football and words and music and no one has a monopoly on those things, and the fact is UK rap is just brilliant, addictive super-smart music.</p> <p>My kids listened to it, then left me with it, so I\u2019m kind of stuck in a particular period. But what a period. Dave, J Hus, Stormzy, Central Cee, Headie One. These are sublime creative people, not just brilliant recording artists, but also nice, wise and really funny. You will like them. It\u2019s high art too, in my opinion. Dave is a mainstream megastar, but also just a flat-out genius with words.</p> <p>At which point, football comes back in. Listening to this music will make you love and crave football, all the more so if you belong even tangentially to the alienated, game\u2019s-gone demographic. Basically there are just constant, really good references. The obvious start point is Thiago Silva, Dave and AJ Tracey\u2019s self-published track from 2016. The title comes from a bit where Dave describes blocking a romantic interest on his phone in the all-business style of Thiago Silva, who was at Paris Saint-Germain at the time, and in his elegant, long-striding pomp \u2013 so yes, good ref, works, scans.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQTsZGvVUbs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OQTsZGvVUbs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Beyond this the football stuff is everywhere. Most common are random funny nods to unexpected players. Some examples:</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Victor Wanyama defending that fixture.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI chase cheques like Aubameyang.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI still wonder why we had burners from young, like Alexandre Pato.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLoose grip on the glass/El Shaarawy man skip, then blast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t wanna see me blow/So she let my talent go to waste like Robinho.\u201d</p> <p>And a favourite, from Dave: \u201cI\u2019m a ronin Blaszczykowski, I\u2019m trying to score with the Polish.\u201d</p> <p>Even these simple ones are well chosen. Pato (Dave on JKYL+HYD) expresses speed, wealth and tarnished promise perfectly. In 2019\u2019s Audacity, Stormzy is coming \u201coff the wing like Andros Townsend\u201d. Not the more triumphant Mo Salah or Riyad Mahrez, but with a sense he is instead trapped in certain behaviours, always moving into trouble, stepping inside not outside.</p> <p>Too much? I don\u2019t think so. These words are not chosen idly. How else to explain Kamakaze on Warm-Up Sessions, who was at the time playing for Woking while doing music shows later the same day. Or as he puts it, \u201cdoing gigs after games like his sister-in-law\u201d, which is just triple-sided genius.</p> <p>AJ Tracey in The Lane is \u201cControlling the game like Sepp Blatter\u201d (grand, doomed, no regrets). Then there\u2019s this, Stormzy saying on Know Me From: \u201cBare pagan boys / I come to your team and I fuck shit up, I\u2019m David Moyes.\u201d It\u2019s just really funny. A few years later he\u2019s recording the most moving, tender, uplifting song about surviving depression and wrapping it around the line \u201cevery Hendo needs a Stevie G\u201d, which just totally makes sense in the moment.</p> <p>This is hardly new, and there are already endless internet lists of this stuff out there. The connection might become a little more overt as entertainment absorbs football. But right now it seems safe to say no other form of culture has wrapped itself around football so intimately.</p>    <p>Certainly music has never spoken to the game like this. What did we get previously? Rod Stewart kicking a ball around in winkle-pickers on Top of the Pops. Indie bands worshipping 1970s mavericks. But no one wrote actual, warm, meaningful lyrics about Steve Bould or Peter Shilton.Otherwise music and football is basically the Kasabian bloke at Leicester looking as if he wants to fight someone in a kebab shop. It\u2019s Oasis and Manchester City, old men retailing Abu Dhabi-branded clothing while making music that sounds like a stadium version of the noise inside the head of an alcoholic pub dog.</p> <p>Whereas in UK rap you get nuance and love and connection with the players. The music can feel like a version of some classic storytelling tradition, from Calypso to Chaucer, riffing on dirty jokes and the stuff in front of you.</p> <p>Not that it\u2019s all heartwarming. A lot of this is driven by pain and anger and difficulty, the desire to burn things down. But the talent and the life is real. It is also, from a football angle, the exact opposite of what this industrialised sport can look like, the wall of corporate waffle, accountancy tools, money, politicking, white noise on the internet. Connection is good, moments and shared energy are good. And yes, for older people there is something worthwhile in even a baffled attempt to understand why things can still be good while also being different.</p> <p>How long can it last? My own frame of reference is limited. Some of the established canon is ageing already. \u201cI\u2019m Pep, I ball with flair,\u201d Stormzy says on Clash from 2021. Is this still accurate? It feels pre-Haaland, pre-four-centre-backs, pre-champions of the world.</p> <p>But then late last year Dave released a song with the US rapper Jack Harlow, a breakout moment in the biggest market on earth, and there were of course no football references right up until Dave\u2019s last line, where he says: \u201cShe more Olivier than France is.\u201d And yes, he just couldn\u2019t resist, because this is, I think, a reference to being Oliver Twist, pissed, but mixed into football with Olivier Giroud. And obviously almost nobody in America is going to get this, which just makes it even greater.</p> <p>Back in the real world the A$AP Rocky thing may or may not happen from here. Tranmere have just lost to Grimsby, Crewe and Oldham and host Newport County on Saturday, which may or may not prove an additional lure. But it\u2019s hardly the craziest idea out there. And music and football, well, that\u2019s a live connection.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Frustrated beetroot, bean and berry growers can now enter their dream contest: to win two new allotment sites, which will be purchased in neighbourhoods starved of good places to grow fruit and vegetables. The charity Green Allotments is pledging to buy and set up new not-for-profit allotment sites with peppercorn rents for two lucky communities. Individuals and community groups in England and Wales have until the end of November to make their case to the new charity, which is dedicated to meeting the much-needed demand for more and new allotments. The charity will announce the two winners early next year, and plans to complete the purchase of land and set up the allotments with the required facilities for local people as quickly as possible. \u201cAllotments bring multiple benefits for people and planet: health benefits, grow-your-own food, nature, community and culture,\u201d said Deborah Burn, the chief executive of Green Allotments. \u201cCurrently, allotments in the public mind are a combination of a long wait, expensive, and under threat. We want to change that picture. \u201cWe are making this offer to start changing the allotment story from one of despair to one of hope if you are on an allotment waiting list. We want to hear from local communities across England and Wales: tell us about land in your area which is suitable for allotments and why your community deserves a new allotment site.\u201d Waiting lists for allotments have almost doubled in the last 12 years. Although the selling off of existing council allotment sites for housing has slowed since the importance of allotments for people has been formally recognised in the national planning policy framework, privately-owned allotments continue to be sold off for housing. There are currently passionate local campaigns to save allotments at Combe Down near Bath and Great Ayton in North Yorkshire which are set to be sold off. Meanwhile, the provision of new allotments has totally failed to keep pace with rising demand, according to the charity, despite councils having a legal duty to provide allotment sites. \u201cCentral government can\u2019t and won\u2019t help because allotment provision is devolved to local councils. Approach councils and they have insufficient funds because of cuts, go to Westminster and the response is \u2018not our problem\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s a merry-go-round of blame switching\u201d said Burn. Cash-strapped councils, keen to make their allotment portfolio \u201ccost neutral\u201d, are increasing rents, with rents of \u00a3300 a year for some council plots and upwards of \u00a3500 for commercial sites. Entrants to the competition are simply asked to demonstrate a demand for allotments in an area short of them, and to identify suitable or desired land. It does not necessarily have to be already for sale because the charity is willing to approach landowners to see if they are prepared to sell. Angus Hanton, a charity trustee and financial backer, hopes that Green Allotments will fill a gap, with no organisations seemingly equipped or motivated to create new allotments. \u201cThere\u2019s no obvious person to do anything about creating new allotments,\u201d he said. \u201cCentral government thinks it\u2019s local government\u2019s job. Local government has its own existing allotments to manage and its many other costly social services. Business doesn\u2019t do it because there\u2019s no money in it, and there shouldn\u2019t be. And the National Allotment Society is very much focused on supporting existing ones.\u201d Perhaps the biggest barrier to establishing new allotment sites is that land suitable for local growers that is close to towns is often prohibitively expensive if it has the potential to be developed for new homes. But Hanton, who has spent 30 years identifying and buying land for his woodlands.co.uk business, is confident that the charity can find suitable new allotment sites. These might include metropolitan land zoned for no development or land with covenants that prevent housebuilding. Landowners such as utility companies or railways or companies with certain community or environmental goals may be prepared to sell land for allotments that underscore their green credentials.

      "body": "<p>Shortly after opening his north London restaurant, Hugh Corcoran noticed a pattern among some of his diners: large groups ordering tap water, starters and mains to share. So, he took to social media. \u201cRestaurants are not public benches,\u201d he wrote on his Instagram last week. \u201cYou are there to spend money.\u201d</p> <p>By the weekend, his post had accrued 150 comments, some accusing him of being tone deaf, others in agreement. Either way, a discourse was born.</p> <p>The Belfast-born chef opened The Yellow Bittern three weeks ago. It has three members of staff, seats 18 people, and is only open for lunch on weekdays. If you want to book a table, you phone the landline or send a postcard. Curiously, it\u2019s not on Instagram.</p>    <p>This early in its life, it should be in no position to change the way we eat. And yet thanks to its famous pies (\u201cwe do pies when we fancy doing pies\u201d), his predilection for the long boozy lunch, and its old-fashioned set up \u2013 it\u2019s also cash only \u2013 Corcoran is attracting and dividing diners who take umbrage with being told there is a right way to have lunch.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an etiquette everywhere \u2013 theatres, bars \u2013 simple manners. You don\u2019t talk in a cinema, and you go to a restaurant when you\u2019re ready to eat, as a treat,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re not hungry, don\u2019t go.\u201d</p> <p>His preference, he says, is minimum one plate per person, \u201cbut one starter and two mains between four, that\u2019s just not acceptable\u201d.</p> <p>This is a fraught time for new restaurants. Years of work go into funding. Then there are soaring food prices. Add to that the current climate for hospitality: an<a href=\"https://home.binwise.com/blog/restaurant-failure-rate#:~:text=What%20Percentage%20of%20Restaurants%20are,within%205%20years%20of%20opening.\"> estimated 60%</a> close within their first year. So why is Corcoran angering his diners?</p> <p>He does reservations by phone because \u201cin London, everyone got into the \u2018just in case\u2019 craze \u2013 booking online and then cancelling\u201d. The cash-only policy is the last vestige of privacy. That, and atmosphere. \u201cCards leave out interesting people in society who are cash-in-hand. Frankly, I\u2019d also prefer it if clients didn\u2019t use their phones.\u201d</p>    <p>The real issue, he says, lies in \u201crestaurant tourism \u2013 going to a place to show that you\u2019ve been to that place, without actually eating\u201d. That, and what\u2019s known as \u201cwindow dining\u201d.</p> <p>Two recent diners, he says, ordered half the menu, took photographs but didn\u2019t touch the food. \u201cIt all went in the bin,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to force-feed people. And you can share food. But if I\u2019m going to get stick for standing against that, so be it.\u201d</p> <p>Jan Ostle runs <a href=\"https://www.wilsonsbristol.co.uk/\">Wilson\u2019s</a>, a small but critically acclaimed farm-to-table restaurant in Bristol, which opened in 2016. \u201cSometimes people come in and only order a main, and all your projections get mangled,\u201d he agrees. \u201cThe problem is, people want to go out and feel rich but they can\u2019t afford to do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost restaurants today have to traverse two lines \u2013 firstly as a local restaurant with regulars, and secondly as a destination one,\u201d says Ostle. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have both, which we do. But if someone comes in, takes photographs and doesn\u2019t seem fussed on the food, that\u2019s the modern world. You need a thick skin for it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.anniegray.co.uk/\">Annie Gray</a>, a food historian, blames Covid \u2013 and years of austerity \u2013 for the divide. \u201cPeople have become entitled. Hospitality has been hard hit \u2013 Covid, austerity, cost of living crisis, the overseas labour. But diners don\u2019t necessarily care because they\u2019ve been through it too, and they\u2019re spending money,\u201d she says.</p> <p>This is not lost on Corcoran. In the end, he just doesn\u2019t want to see people eating nothing, but photographing everything.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shortly after opening his north London restaurant, Hugh Corcoran noticed a pattern among some of his diners: large groups ordering tap water, starters and mains to share. So, he took to social media. \u201cRestaurants are not public benches,\u201d he wrote on his Instagram last week. \u201cYou are there to spend money.\u201d By the weekend, his post had accrued 150 comments, some accusing him of being tone deaf, others in agreement. Either way, a discourse was born. The Belfast-born chef opened The Yellow Bittern three weeks ago. It has three members of staff, seats 18 people, and is only open for lunch on weekdays. If you want to book a table, you phone the landline or send a postcard. Curiously, it\u2019s not on Instagram. This early in its life, it should be in no position to change the way we eat. And yet thanks to its famous pies (\u201cwe do pies when we fancy doing pies\u201d), his predilection for the long boozy lunch, and its old-fashioned set up \u2013 it\u2019s also cash only \u2013 Corcoran is attracting and dividing diners who take umbrage with being told there is a right way to have lunch. \u201cThere\u2019s an etiquette everywhere \u2013 theatres, bars \u2013 simple manners. You don\u2019t talk in a cinema, and you go to a restaurant when you\u2019re ready to eat, as a treat,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re not hungry, don\u2019t go.\u201d His preference, he says, is minimum one plate per person, \u201cbut one starter and two mains between four, that\u2019s just not acceptable\u201d. This is a fraught time for new restaurants. Years of work go into funding. Then there are soaring food prices. Add to that the current climate for hospitality: an estimated 60% close within their first year. So why is Corcoran angering his diners? He does reservations by phone because \u201cin London, everyone got into the \u2018just in case\u2019 craze \u2013 booking online and then cancelling\u201d. The cash-only policy is the last vestige of privacy. That, and atmosphere. \u201cCards leave out interesting people in society who are cash-in-hand. Frankly, I\u2019d also prefer it if clients didn\u2019t use their phones.\u201d The real issue, he says, lies in \u201crestaurant tourism \u2013 going to a place to show that you\u2019ve been to that place, without actually eating\u201d. That, and what\u2019s known as \u201cwindow dining\u201d. Two recent diners, he says, ordered half the menu, took photographs but didn\u2019t touch the food. \u201cIt all went in the bin,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to force-feed people. And you can share food. But if I\u2019m going to get stick for standing against that, so be it.\u201d Jan Ostle runs Wilson\u2019s, a small but critically acclaimed farm-to-table restaurant in Bristol, which opened in 2016. \u201cSometimes people come in and only order a main, and all your projections get mangled,\u201d he agrees. \u201cThe problem is, people want to go out and feel rich but they can\u2019t afford to do it.\u201d \u201cMost restaurants today have to traverse two lines \u2013 firstly as a local restaurant with regulars, and secondly as a destination one,\u201d says Ostle. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have both, which we do. But if someone comes in, takes photographs and doesn\u2019t seem fussed on the food, that\u2019s the modern world. You need a thick skin for it.\u201d Annie Gray, a food historian, blames Covid \u2013 and years of austerity \u2013 for the divide. \u201cPeople have become entitled. Hospitality has been hard hit \u2013 Covid, austerity, cost of living crisis, the overseas labour. But diners don\u2019t necessarily care because they\u2019ve been through it too, and they\u2019re spending money,\u201d she says. This is not lost on Corcoran. In the end, he just doesn\u2019t want to see people eating nothing, but photographing everything.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a year and a half since Jody last spoke to her mother, and the conversation ended badly. Though their relationship was always fractious, with long spells of not speaking, Jody had been feeling anxious about some big changes in her life and was craving comfort. Listening to some old voicemails from her mother made her nostalgic enough to pick up the phone. But the call quickly degenerated.</p> <p>\u201cMy mom has a proclivity for expressing her emotions in really extreme, volatile ways. She lashes out and insults people,\u201d says Jody, who is 29 and in the process of moving overseas. Her mother has suffered long-term mental health problems, she says, and sees herself as a victim conspired against by others: Jody learned young that if she didn\u2019t beg for forgiveness when her mother started hurling accusations, she would be frozen out. But not this time. \u201cWhen it finally clicked that my mom weaponised her own emotions to manipulate mine, I stopped feeling a reflex to defend myself.\u201d She hung up, blocked her mother\u2019s number, and decided they would never speak again.</p> <p>Though Jody is sure she made the right decision, living with it hasn\u2019t been easy. \u201cI still miss her, and wish I could have those moments other people have with their moms. I can\u2019t remember what she smells like or how it felt to hug her.\u201d But she can\u2019t live, she says, with being continually tested, as if she were an employee permanently on probation. \u201cWhat she didn\u2019t seem to take into account is that, just like any other fed-up employee, I can quit.\u201d</p> <p>The kind of broken relationship Jody describes is almost certainly more common than you might think. In Britain, research by the charity Stand Alone suggests around <a href=\"https://www.standalone.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/StandAlonePrevalenceRESEARCH3.pdf\">one in five</a> families may be affected by estrangement \u2013 defined as a relationship in which communication has stopped. In the US (where Jody currently lives), a <a href=\"https://news.osu.edu/adult-children-more-likely-to-be-estranged-from-dad-than-mom/\">study</a> by researchers at Ohio State University found 6% of respondents were estranged from a mother and a startling 26% from a father.</p> <p> While the experience is still often cloaked in secrecy and shame, it\u2019s perhaps no longer as taboo as it was. In her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/sep/24/a-woman-like-me-a-memoir-by-diane-abbott-review-rich-and-complex-record-of-resilience\">recent memoir</a>, the Labour MP Diane Abbott described her complicated feelings about being estranged from her difficult, domineering father when he died. Prince Harry\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/08/prince-harry-and-meghan-say-they-are-stepping-back-from-royal-family\">exodus from the royal family</a> and his wife Meghan\u2019s estrangement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/17/its-no-surprise-thomas-markle-and-his-daughter-meghan-are-now-estranged\">from her father</a> have been played out under glaring spotlights. And what was once a lonely, isolating experience is increasingly shared on TikTok, Reddit or in forums offering advice on how to go \u201cno contact\u201d (cutting ties entirely) or \u201clow contact\u201d (bare minimum interaction) without feeling guilty.</p> <p>Though some make it look seductively easy, in essence they\u2019re making the same case the poet Philip Larkin did half a century ago in his <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48419/this-be-the-verse\">1971 poem</a> This Be The Verse: \u201cThey fuck you up, your mum and dad/They may not mean to, but they do.\u201d The poem bleakly advises readers to \u201cget out as early as you can\u201d, and not have kids themselves.</p> <p>\u201cPeople seem to think that hashtags on social media create estrangement,\u201d sighs Becca Bland, who founded Stand Alone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/dec/15/becca-bland-estranged-parents\">after being estranged</a> from her own parents aged 25, and has since moved on to coach estranged families. \u201cBut in the 12 or 13 years I\u2019ve worked on this, I\u2019ve never met someone who hasn\u2019t had an extremely good reason to consider it.\u201d Apart from the loneliness and pain of leaving a family, she says, young people can pay dearly for being estranged in a world in which almost a third of British 25- to 29-year-olds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/10/number-adults-living-parents-england-wales-up-700000-decade\">still live at home</a> and parents often co-sign student loans, guarantee a young person\u2019s rent or contribute to a first-time buyer\u2019s <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/news/around-half-first-time-buyers-their-20s-receive-financial-help-buy-their-home-large\">deposit</a>. All of which may help explain why the peak age of estrangement isn\u2019t in the rebellious teens but \u2013 as it was for Jody \u2013 during the more considered, financially stable late 20s and 30s.</p> <p>Sometimes estrangement is a result of physical or sexual abuse, addiction or mental health issues on one&nbsp;side or the other. (It\u2019s not just children who cut parents&nbsp;off: sometimes it can be the other way around.) And sometimes it reflects a seemingly irreconcilable clash of religious or ethical beliefs. \u201cIf you\u2019re from an immigrant family that has very fixed values, and you\u2019re growing up in a society that is much more free and liberal, there\u2019s a huge risk factor,\u201d says Bland, who has collaborated with the University of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Family Research on <a href=\"https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/news/research-conduct-dr-s-foley-dr-b-bland-dr-l-blake-and-dr-s-imrie-investigates-family\">studying estrangement</a>. \u201cI\u2019d say political beliefs, too: Brexit, or different convictions about how you want society to be.\u201d Research shows that parental separation and remarriage is a risk factor, especially if the child dislikes a step-parent or feels pushed to take sides, and estrangement is also more common among LGBTQ+ young people. (One <a href=\"https://www.justlikeus.org/blog/2023/04/19/new-research-shows-almost-half-of-lgbt-adults-are-estranged-from-family-and-a-third-not-confident-their-parents-will-accept-them/\">study</a> for the LGBT+ charity Just Like Us found almost half of respondents were estranged from a family member.)</p> <p>But sometimes things are less clearcut. Sometimes estrangement can look more like the product of a therapy-literate generation that defines abuse more broadly than their own parents may have done, and believes in putting boundaries around people who make you miserable \u2013 even if they did give birth to you.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It feels like a\u00a0bereavement. I\u00a0go over and over it in my head and beat myself up wondering why my daughter won\u2019t see me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way in terms of understanding, say with domestic violence, how you shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship where you have no equality, love or respect,\u201d Bland says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be in a family relationship where you have no say. Society and relationships have evolved, and family is going to evolve with them.\u201d Just as baby boomers scandalised their parents by inventing the pill or destigmatising divorce, she suggests, younger generations are reimagining family life in ways that are sometimes uncomfortable to their elders.</p> <p>The idea that filial love is no longer unconditional can be very frightening for parents who genuinely believe they have done their best, only to be damned by the standards of a different era. What if they never see their beloved child again? \u201cIt\u2019s a massive power shift, and to give parents credit, there\u2019s no support for that,\u201d Bland says. \u201cWhat we all do is copy what we know, and so many parents have copied what their parents did.\u201d As with any relationship breakup, estrangement can leave behind it a trail of the hurt, the bewildered and the ghosted.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>\u201cWhenever I\u2019d read stories about estrangement, I\u2019d think, \u2018But you must have done <em>something,</em>\u2019\u201d says Caroline, a gently spoken professional woman from the north of England, over the phone. But that was before one of her own adult children stopped talking to her.</p> <p>Her daughter was a challenging teenager, she says: there were lots of fights, a breakdown in her college years, and Caroline sometimes felt pushed into playing parental \u201cbad cop\u201d after separating from her husband. But the relationship had been happy enough for over a decade, until last year. \u201cI kept thinking something was a bit off, but I couldn\u2019t put a finger on it. I\u2019d send a WhatsApp message and it didn\u2019t get responded to, and I started to think, \u2018Have I been muted?\u2019\u201d She wondered if she was being oversensitive. But when she gently raised it, her daughter burst into tears and said she was struggling to reconcile the mother she had now with \u201chow horrible you were\u201d when she was little.</p> <p>Caroline was horrified and bewildered: she couldn\u2019t understand what she was being accused of. \u201cAs parents, we all have regrets, and there are things I regret. I can think of one occasion when I lost my temper and I wish I hadn\u2019t. But overall I think I have been a really good mum, I am confident about that.\u201d Both mother and daughter had counselling separately. But after another stormy meeting, her daughter messaged to say she no longer wanted to engage. They still swap birthday cards, but don\u2019t speak to or see each other. \u201cUntil recently I cried every day. It feels like a bereavement, I can\u2019t do anything about it. I go over and over it in my head and beat myself up thinking about why. I\u2019m devastated.\u201d</p> <p>For now, Caroline is trying to give her daughter space. It hurts that her daughter is still in touch with her father, while Caroline \u2013 having done the hard yards as a single parent \u2013 is ostracised. \u201cI often feel with mothers it\u2019s what we <em>haven\u2019t</em> done that gets held up to us, not what we <em>have</em> done. We organise all the Christmases and birthdays, keep them on track at school and with homework, feed them and read to them every night \u2026 A friend said to me, \u2018You are the one she feels secure and safe with, so you are the one she can act out with because you will always love her.\u2019 I know all this logically, but it doesn\u2019t stop it feeling terribly unfair.\u201d</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Joshua Coleman specialises in untangling mysteries like this. A white-bearded California grandfather with a soothing manner, in his<strong> </strong>private practice as a psychologist, he counsels parents desperate to win back adult children who have cut them off. It\u2019s a feeling he knows well: in his book Rules of Estrangement he describes how, at 22, his own daughter temporarily stopped talking to him. (After he separated from her mother and remarried, he writes, she hadn\u2019t felt like \u201cthe unambiguous priority\u201d: though they\u2019re now reconciled, he says it took years of patiently applying the strategies he now teaches other parents.)</p> <p>Is there any such thing as an excommunicated parent who genuinely did nothing wrong? \u201cAlmost every article about estrangement that I read in the US is written by an estranged adult child and it\u2019s easy to sympathise with \u2013 their parent was abusive, they tried for a long time, finally they had to do this, it\u2019s better for their mental health,\u201d he tells me, over Zoom from his San Francisco office. \u201cAnd those cases exist. They\u2019re just not the sum set of the reasons people estrange themselves.\u201d Most parents, he thinks, are muddling through as best they can. But that doesn\u2019t mean their best was always enough for their child.</p> <p>\u201cThere are separate realities in every family. A parent could credibly feel as if they did a good, conscientious job as a parent, and their child could credibly feel that their behaviour was hurtful in some way.\u201d Typically, the adult child is trying to express something that\u2019s important&nbsp;to them, even if it baffles the rejected parent.</p> <p>Sometimes, he argues, estrangement can be a child\u2019s way of disentangling themselves from an overly close relationship. \u201cSomething I see a lot of is just a need to separate from over-involved, loving parents. Parents have become much more anxious, much more invested, much more guilt-ridden, much more involved.\u201d</p> <p>Other triggers include what he suggests are clumsy therapists identifying childhood trauma where it doesn\u2019t exist, and clashes between parents and an adult child\u2019s partner. (In a survey of 1,600 estranged parents Coleman conducted, 70% said they only finally become estranged after their child married: be careful about criticising someone your offspring is dating, he warns.)</p> <p>In his consulting room, clients often reel off long, indignant lists of everything they did for their children, from birthday parties to paying for college education. Fathers in particular tend to balk at his strategy of writing a \u201cletter of amends\u201d apologising to their child, he says, though mothers are often keener to do whatever it takes (interestingly, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37304343/\">research</a> shows men are less likely than women to end up reconciled with estranged children). \u201cDads will often say, \u2018No, they can give <em>me</em> an amends letter, why should I write one? I was a good parent,\u2019\u201d Coleman says. But he warns them it\u2019s usually the child who has the whip hand, as they\u2019re the ones ultimately willing to walk out. While estrangement is increasingly seen as \u201cthe strong, assertive thing to do\u201d, he argues, it\u2019s also a cataclysmic event in a family that can pit sibling against sibling, cut grandchildren off from grandparents, and reverberate down generations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re the generation that has\u00a0finally had enough of, \u2018Well, it didn\u2019t do me any harm\u2019 and, \u2018That\u2019s how we\u2019ve always done this\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s no hard evidence on whether estrangement is becoming more common, as opposed to being just more commonly talked about, either in the US or the UK. But Coleman\u2019s hunch is that it\u2019s on the rise, fuelled by polarising politics \u2013 one couple consulted him after their son announced, \u201cIf you vote for Trump in the next election, we are done\u201d \u2013 and a growing emphasis on individual happiness over collective bonds or old-fashioned filial duty. Family relationships, he thinks, are starting to resemble romantic ones: if they\u2019re not emotionally fulfilling, moving on is no longer inconceivable. \u201cIt\u2019s a tectonic shift in the way we organise family relationships and a lot of parents haven\u2019t really gotten the memo yet.\u201d</p> <p>What most confuses parents, he argues, is the way definitions of abusive behaviour have shifted since they grew up, when smacking or yelling at your kids was considered routine. \u201cSo many of the letters that parents are responding negatively to are, \u2018You emotionally abused me, you traumatised me\u2019 and that\u2019s when parents are like, \u2018What the hell are you talking about? I wish <em>I </em>had your childhood.\u2019\u201d The word \u201cnarcissist\u201d is particularly overused, he says, to the bafflement of many parents. (Once a clinical term for pathological self-importance, it\u2019s seeped into casual conversation to mean anyone selfish, cold, manipulative or just difficult.) \u201cThere\u2019s been this enormous expansion over what gets labelled as pathological behaviour.\u201d What Coleman seems to be describing isn\u2019t just a series of conflicts between individual children and parents, but a broader clash between generations with different expectations of relationships, and often different language to describe it.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t happen. And if it did, it wasn\u2019t that bad. And if it was, that\u2019s not a big deal. And if it is, it\u2019s not my fault \u2026\u201d So begins <a href=\"https://www.thelifedoctor.org/the-narcissist-s-prayer\">The Narcissist\u2019s Prayer</a> by Belfast poet Dayna Craig, which holds a special resonance for the many estranged adult children plastering it across their social media feeds. The poem seems to capture their sense of being gaslit by an abusive parent but also by outsiders, asking how they can be so cruel as to cut their families off.</p> <p>Lauren,<strong> </strong>from London, grew up with a mother who was absent for several years and a father she calls emotionally abusive and cruel. He didn\u2019t hit her, she says, but he didn\u2019t have to: the things he said were worse, calling her a whore for painting her nails, for example, or telling her to kill herself. \u201cI never understood that \u2018sticks and stones will break your bones\u2019 thing \u2013 actually, words do hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>At 18 she left home, and tried keeping contact to a bare minimum. She would meet her father only in public places, accompanied by her partner, and communicate only by email. But it didn\u2019t help, she says: her father railed against the loss of control, and the emails turned abusive. So she stopped speaking to him altogether, to her extended family\u2019s outrage. In Nigerian families, she explains, aunties, uncles and cousins are closely involved, and parents and children are expected to retain an even closer bond: it was easier, she thinks, for her relatives to blame her for the relationship breaking down than to engage with what she was saying about her father\u2019s behaviour. \u201cIt\u2019s psychologically more comfortable to say, \u2018No, that can\u2019t be right, I would have known,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d get told, \u2018You\u2019ll miss him when he\u2019s gone\u2019 but I\u2019m pretty certain I won\u2019t. People seem to require justification but I don\u2019t feel I should have to provide it before people believe me.\u201d</p> <p>On TikTok and in estrangement forums, family and friends who try to broker reunions are sometimes bitterly labelled \u201cflying monkeys\u201d, after the winged flunkies who did the Wicked Witch\u2019s bidding in The Wizard of Oz. These often well-meaning interventions are a common phenomenon, says Sarah Davies, a chartered counselling psychologist and trauma therapist, and the author of Raised by Narcissists: How to Handle Your Difficult, Toxic and Abusive<strong> </strong>Parents. But they can be distressing for adult children who have chosen no contact for very good reasons.</p> <p>\u201cI tell people to be very careful about who they share the details with in order to protect themselves from comments like, \u2018But it\u2019s your mum \u2026\u2019 Well, yes, that\u2019s what makes it hard.\u201d Friends shouldn\u2019t rush to judge an estrangement that seems puzzling to them, she argues: if there was abuse involved, people might not want to tell everyone what happened. \u201cYou don\u2019t fully understand what somebody has been through.\u201d</p> <p>Deciding what you are prepared to tolerate from an abusive parent is a highly individual decision that each adult child must carefully work through for themselves, Davies argues, including honestly examining their own motives for doing it: \u201cIt\u2019s a very conscious process rather than, \u2018No, I\u2019m done.\u2019\u201d That said, however, she writes in the book that \u201cif you can go no contact with an abusive parent, then do\u201d. Is she trying to give people permission to do something that feels transgressive? \u201cI think sometimes children of narcissists feel they need permission. When you grow up with a toxic parent, you feel guilty, you feel bad, you feel as if it\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p> <p>Davies, who ended contact with her own parents two years ago, says Christmas, birthdays and family occasions are still tough for many of her clients: she was once unexpectedly flooded with sadness in a spa, watching mothers and daughters enjoying a day out together. Others struggle with how to respond to an ageing estranged parent who is ill or dying: should they agree to one last visit?</p> <p>Lauren, however, is resolute: the next time she sees her father will be at his funeral. Millennials are often told they\u2019re snowflakes, she says, for objecting to behaviour that previous generations put up with. \u201cBut we\u2019re the generation that has finally had enough of, \u2018Well, it didn\u2019t do me any harm\u2019 and, \u2018That\u2019s how we\u2019ve always done this.\u2019\u201d Her determination not to keep on repeating the cycle is such that, now in her 30s, she has decided not to have children herself.</p> <p>For millennial parents, the idea that good parenting means working to \u201cbreak the cycle\u201d \u2013 as Prince Harry explained in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57110267#:~:text=Prince%20Harry%20told%20American%20actor,had%20suffered%2C%20I%E2%80%99m%20\">an earnest 2021 interview</a> alongside his then pregnant wife \u2013 instead of unwittingly making the same mistakes as their parents, is a powerful one.</p> <p>\u201cGenerational trauma is such a big word for my generation \u2013 what trauma has been passed down that we want to think about not repeating. Whereas my parents\u2019 generation did not even understand it,\u201d Bland says. \u201cIt creates tensions where people don\u2019t understand why they\u2019ve been cut off.\u201d Perhaps that is particularly true for parents who survived difficult upbringings themselves.</p> <p>Nancy was hard up when she got pregnant, and as a single mother had no support from her own mother, whom she calls \u201ca piece of work\u201d. Even before the baby was born, she realised she might have bitten off more than she could chew. \u201cBut I knuckled down, I did my best. We were never homeless. We were never so poor that I couldn\u2019t afford what we needed,\u201d she tells me over the phone. And for a long time, as she tells it, they were unusually close. A single mother to an only daughter, Nancy breastfed until her baby was two and says they shared a bed for years afterwards. \u201cWe never fought. I was her world, everything was always fine between us.\u201d She managed to put her daughter through university and gave her a lump sum afterwards. \u201cAnd it went from that to, \u2018I don\u2019t want to have a relationship with you, I never want you around your grandchild.\u2019 It just shocked me, and she never told me why.\u201d</p> <p>Nancy\u2019s daughter is a lesbian and though she insists that wasn\u2019t an issue for her, she sounds cooler on the subject of her daughter-in-law. \u201cI didn\u2019t really get on well with her but I didn\u2019t get on poorly. I accepted her, I gave her presents.\u201d But the arguments began, she says, when her daughter got pregnant and said she wanted some space. Accordingly, Nancy says, she backed off. But after the baby was born, she called. She says she can\u2019t remember much about the conversation: \u201cShe was taking care of her newborn and I didn\u2019t want to press her on anything.\u201d But whatever was said, after that came the letter cutting her off, and she hasn\u2019t tried to resume contact: another rejection, she says, would be too painful. More than a decade on, she has never met her grandchild and, to avoid explanations, usually says she has no children when asked.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You think about them every day. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re gone \u2013 every single day they\u2019re still in your headspace</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now in her 70s, Nancy has rewritten her will to leave her house to a local housing authority and appointed new executors. \u201cThey\u2019ll get rid of all my stuff and scatter the ashes. I don\u2019t know how my daughter will feel about it \u2013 if she\u2019ll feel I\u2019ve taken something away from her.\u201d Nancy looked after her own mother in old age, despite their difficult relationship, she says, because she thought that was what family did. But her own daughter told her their relationship \u201ccan\u2019t be about duty\u201d.</p> <p>As we talk, Nancy seems torn between sadness and rage. \u201cI sometimes wonder why the anger is still so strong. My therapist would say it\u2019s to protect me from more hurt and I want to move past it. But part of me \u2013 if she would just sit down with me at the kitchen table \u2013 would like to say, \u2018What the fuck, why did you do this? What did you get out of this, that your life is so much better without me in it?\u2019 As a parent your child is central to your life but as a child your parent is not central.\u201d</p> <p>Towards the end of our conversation, Nancy reveals that her own mother had mental health problems, and that she sometimes wonders if that had something to do with her daughter breaking ties, as if to inoculate herself against something. \u201cMaybe she thought that I was going to become like her.\u201d</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>According to the Ohio State University study, the vast majority of estranged adult children eventually resume contact with their families. But it may not always be a fairytale happy ending, with some families cycling repeatedly in and out of contact.</p> <p>Pippa was in her early 40s when her tolerance for the father she describes as abusive, domineering and controlling finally snapped. \u201cHe started his usual stuff of telling me how everybody thought he was wonderful and I sat there listening and said, \u2018Shall I tell you what I\u2019ve been up to?\u2019 I told him one thing and he just went \u2018hmmm\u2019 and carried on talking about himself.\u201d In that moment, she decided she couldn\u2019t see him any longer.</p> <p>But the most painful aspect of cutting off her father was that it meant also losing touch with her mother \u2013 who Pippa says was damaged herself, and coercively controlled by her father \u2013 as well as her siblings and wider family, whom she didn\u2019t see for almost a decade. \u201cWe come from a family where nobody talks about feelings, nobody talks about anything; you\u2019re not allowed to have emotions.\u201d</p> <p>They had just begun talking again, in a reunion brokered by a relative, when her mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Pippa moved back home to nurse her, and in the last few weeks mother and daughter finally acknowledged the time they had lost. \u201cI did say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry I left you, and I do regret having missed things.\u2019\u201d But she found the experience of temporarily sharing a roof with her father traumatic.</p> <p>What surprised Pippa most about the estrangement, she says, is that it wasn\u2019t the clean break she\u2019d imagined. \u201cYou think about them every day. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re gone \u2013 every single day they\u2019re on your mind, and that\u2019s the weird thing. They\u2019re not in your physical space but they\u2019re still in your headspace.\u201d</p> <p>If some estrangements seem sadly inevitable, could others be avoidable? In his book, Coleman writes that, while he\u2019s often asked if estrangement is generally justifiable, a better question is whether it\u2019s right to cut a parent off when you know that will ruin their life. Americans\u2019 love for individual needs and rights, he adds, \u201cconceals how much sorrow is left in the wake\u201d.</p> <p>When I ask if he means children should take more responsibility for their parents\u2019 happiness, he pauses. \u201cNo, not at any cost. The parent has to be able and willing to take responsibility, to show compassion, to not be defensive, to understand why the child feels that estrangement is the healthiest thing to do. They can\u2019t just show up with their arms folded and go, \u2018I\u2019m your father, you have to accept me.\u2019\u201d But trying to understand why a parent does what they do \u2013 perhaps because of their own childhood, or what\u2019s happened to them in a marriage \u2013 can sometimes be therapeutic, he argues, even if it doesn\u2019t make them any easier to live with.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/sep/26/the-experts-therapists-on-19-ways-to-have-much-happier-healthier-relationships\">The experts: therapists on 19 ways to have much happier, healthier relationships</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adult children struggling to deal with a hyper-critical or undermining parent, he suggests, could try giving them a chance to change: perhaps say that their behaviour makes family get-togethers hard and ask them to stop criticising your partner, parenting, or whatever the flashpoint is.

But that\u2019s often the thing that can turn your child even further against you, because when you start blaming, defending, criticising or guilt-tripping, none of those are going to work in your favour.\u201d</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean accepting an allegation if it\u2019s factually wrong, he explains. \u201cBut if a child says, \u2018You emotionally abused me, you neglected me\u2019 I think it\u2019s OK for a parent to say, \u2018It\u2019s clear I have blind spots as a parent \u2013 I wasn\u2019t aware that you felt I was emotionally abusive to you, but I\u2019m glad that you told me and I want to learn more.\u2019\u201d (Keeping the lines open may be particularly important in the rare cases when an adult child breaks contact under pressure from their violent or coercively controlling partner, who is seeking to cut them off from help: if you suspect that is what\u2019s going on, advice from the domestic violence charity <a href=\"https://refuge.org.uk/\">Refuge</a> is to try to speak to them away from the abusive partner about what might be happening, avoid sounding judgmental of the relationship and signpost them to resources such as the <a href=\"https://www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk/#:~:text=Call%20us%2024%2F7&amp;text=Call%20for%20free%20and%20in,a%20day%3A%200808%202000%20247.\">National Domestic Abuse Helpline</a>.)</p> <p>Bland agrees it\u2019s worth considering first whether the relationship can be improved with the help of a mediator or a counsellor, if only so that you know you tried everything you could. And if it can\u2019t be fixed? \u201cYou have to consider the boundaries in your life \u2013 how much you can do. For some people that might be going low contact \u2013 you could see each other once a year.\u201d</p> <p>After a decade and a half apart, she finds it hard to imagine reconciling with her own parents, \u201cunless some really big things changed\u201d, and has found peace with that. \u201cI don\u2019t think the struggle is greater than having a relationship with a parent who devalues you on a daily basis,\u201d she says slowly, pointing out that having to be independent has in some ways been empowering. When she became a homeowner, at least she knew she\u2019d done it by herself. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of confidence, a lot of fearlessness. Nothing holds me back. And that was a product of thinking, \u2018I\u2019ve got nothing left to lose.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But for others it\u2019s less clearcut. For Pippa, her father\u2019s eventual death some years after she lost her mother left her with unexpectedly conflicting feelings. \u201cAll my childhood and all my life, there was always part of me that hoped one day I would get some evidence that my dad gave a shit. So when he died, yes, there was a lot of relief, but there was also the grief that I\u2019m never going to get the opportunity now for him to show that. Though, of course, the conscious adult knows that was never going to happen anyway.\u201d When I ask what she wishes more people understood about estrangement, her answer is that it\u2019s not actually an ending; more an ongoing process of living without both your actual parent, and the parent you always wanted but now realise you can never have. </p> <p><em>Some names have been changed.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a year and a half since Jody last spoke to her mother, and the conversation ended badly. Though their relationship was always fractious, with long spells of not speaking, Jody had been feeling anxious about some big changes in her life and was craving comfort. Listening to some old voicemails from her mother made her nostalgic enough to pick up the phone. But the call quickly degenerated. \u201cMy mom has a proclivity for expressing her emotions in really extreme, volatile ways. She lashes out and insults people,\u201d says Jody, who is 29 and in the process of moving overseas. Her mother has suffered long-term mental health problems, she says, and sees herself as a victim conspired against by others: Jody learned young that if she didn\u2019t beg for forgiveness when her mother started hurling accusations, she would be frozen out. But not this time. \u201cWhen it finally clicked that my mom weaponised her own emotions to manipulate mine, I stopped feeling a reflex to defend myself.\u201d She hung up, blocked her mother\u2019s number, and decided they would never speak again. Though Jody is sure she made the right decision, living with it hasn\u2019t been easy. \u201cI still miss her, and wish I could have those moments other people have with their moms. I can\u2019t remember what she smells like or how it felt to hug her.\u201d But she can\u2019t live, she says, with being continually tested, as if she were an employee permanently on probation. \u201cWhat she didn\u2019t seem to take into account is that, just like any other fed-up employee, I can quit.\u201d The kind of broken relationship Jody describes is almost certainly more common than you might think. In Britain, research by the charity Stand Alone suggests around one in five families may be affected by estrangement \u2013 defined as a relationship in which communication has stopped. In the US (where Jody currently lives), a study by researchers at Ohio State University found 6% of respondents were estranged from a mother and a startling 26% from a father. While the experience is still often cloaked in secrecy and shame, it\u2019s perhaps no longer as taboo as it was. In her recent memoir, the Labour MP Diane Abbott described her complicated feelings about being estranged from her difficult, domineering father when he died. Prince Harry\u2019s exodus from the royal family and his wife Meghan\u2019s estrangement from her father have been played out under glaring spotlights. And what was once a lonely, isolating experience is increasingly shared on TikTok, Reddit or in forums offering advice on how to go \u201cno contact\u201d (cutting ties entirely) or \u201clow contact\u201d (bare minimum interaction) without feeling guilty. Though some make it look seductively easy, in essence they\u2019re making the same case the poet Philip Larkin did half a century ago in his 1971 poem This Be The Verse: \u201cThey fuck you up, your mum and dad/They may not mean to, but they do.\u201d The poem bleakly advises readers to \u201cget out as early as you can\u201d, and not have kids themselves. \u201cPeople seem to think that hashtags on social media create estrangement,\u201d sighs Becca Bland, who founded Stand Alone after being estranged from her own parents aged 25, and has since moved on to coach estranged families. \u201cBut in the 12 or 13 years I\u2019ve worked on this, I\u2019ve never met someone who hasn\u2019t had an extremely good reason to consider it.\u201d Apart from the loneliness and pain of leaving a family, she says, young people can pay dearly for being estranged in a world in which almost a third of British 25- to 29-year-olds still live at home and parents often co-sign student loans, guarantee a young person\u2019s rent or contribute to a first-time buyer\u2019s deposit. All of which may help explain why the peak age of estrangement isn\u2019t in the rebellious teens but \u2013 as it was for Jody \u2013 during the more considered, financially stable late 20s and 30s. Sometimes estrangement is a result of physical or sexual abuse, addiction or mental health issues on one side or the other. (It\u2019s not just children who cut parents off: sometimes it can be the other way around.) And sometimes it reflects a seemingly irreconcilable clash of religious or ethical beliefs. \u201cIf you\u2019re from an immigrant family that has very fixed values, and you\u2019re growing up in a society that is much more free and liberal, there\u2019s a huge risk factor,\u201d says Bland, who has collaborated with the University of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Family Research on studying estrangement. \u201cI\u2019d say political beliefs, too: Brexit, or different convictions about how you want society to be.\u201d Research shows that parental separation and remarriage is a risk factor, especially if the child dislikes a step-parent or feels pushed to take sides, and estrangement is also more common among LGBTQ+ young people. (One study for the LGBT+ charity Just Like Us found almost half of respondents were estranged from a family member.) But sometimes things are less clearcut. Sometimes estrangement can look more like the product of a therapy-literate generation that defines abuse more broadly than their own parents may have done, and believes in putting boundaries around people who make you miserable \u2013 even if they did give birth to you. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way in terms of understanding, say with domestic violence, how you shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship where you have no equality, love or respect,\u201d Bland says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be in a family relationship where you have no say. Society and relationships have evolved, and family is going to evolve with them.\u201d Just as baby boomers scandalised their parents by inventing the pill or destigmatising divorce, she suggests, younger generations are reimagining family life in ways that are sometimes uncomfortable to their elders. The idea that filial love is no longer unconditional can be very frightening for parents who genuinely believe they have done their best, only to be damned by the standards of a different era. What if they never see their beloved child again? \u201cIt\u2019s a massive power shift, and to give parents credit, there\u2019s no support for that,\u201d Bland says. \u201cWhat we all do is copy what we know, and so many parents have copied what their parents did.\u201d As with any relationship breakup, estrangement can leave behind it a trail of the hurt, the bewildered and the ghosted. * * * \u201cWhenever I\u2019d read stories about estrangement, I\u2019d think, \u2018But you must have done something,\u2019\u201d says Caroline, a gently spoken professional woman from the north of England, over the phone. But that was before one of her own adult children stopped talking to her. Her daughter was a challenging teenager, she says: there were lots of fights, a breakdown in her college years, and Caroline sometimes felt pushed into playing parental \u201cbad cop\u201d after separating from her husband. But the relationship had been happy enough for over a decade, until last year. \u201cI kept thinking something was a bit off, but I couldn\u2019t put a finger on it. I\u2019d send a WhatsApp message and it didn\u2019t get responded to, and I started to think, \u2018Have I been muted?\u2019\u201d She wondered if she was being oversensitive. But when she gently raised it, her daughter burst into tears and said she was struggling to reconcile the mother she had now with \u201chow horrible you were\u201d when she was little. Caroline was horrified and bewildered: she couldn\u2019t understand what she was being accused of. \u201cAs parents, we all have regrets, and there are things I regret. I can think of one occasion when I lost my temper and I wish I hadn\u2019t. But overall I think I have been a really good mum, I am confident about that.\u201d Both mother and daughter had counselling separately. But after another stormy meeting, her daughter messaged to say she no longer wanted to engage. They still swap birthday cards, but don\u2019t speak to or see each other. \u201cUntil recently I cried every day. It feels like a bereavement, I can\u2019t do anything about it. I go over and over it in my head and beat myself up thinking about why. I\u2019m devastated.\u201d For now, Caroline is trying to give her daughter space. It hurts that her daughter is still in touch with her father, while Caroline \u2013 having done the hard yards as a single parent \u2013 is ostracised. \u201cI often feel with mothers it\u2019s what we haven\u2019t done that gets held up to us, not what we have done. We organise all the Christmases and birthdays, keep them on track at school and with homework, feed them and read to them every night \u2026 A friend said to me, \u2018You are the one she feels secure and safe with, so you are the one she can act out with because you will always love her.\u2019 I know all this logically, but it doesn\u2019t stop it feeling terribly unfair.\u201d * * * Joshua Coleman specialises in untangling mysteries like this. A white-bearded California grandfather with a soothing manner, in his private practice as a psychologist, he counsels parents desperate to win back adult children who have cut them off. It\u2019s a feeling he knows well: in his book Rules of Estrangement he describes how, at 22, his own daughter temporarily stopped talking to him. (After he separated from her mother and remarried, he writes, she hadn\u2019t felt like \u201cthe unambiguous priority\u201d: though they\u2019re now reconciled, he says it took years of patiently applying the strategies he now teaches other parents.) Is there any such thing as an excommunicated parent who genuinely did nothing wrong? \u201cAlmost every article about estrangement that I read in the US is written by an estranged adult child and it\u2019s easy to sympathise with \u2013 their parent was abusive, they tried for a long time, finally they had to do this, it\u2019s better for their mental health,\u201d he tells me, over Zoom from his San Francisco office. \u201cAnd those cases exist. They\u2019re just not the sum set of the reasons people estrange themselves.\u201d Most parents, he thinks, are muddling through as best they can. But that doesn\u2019t mean their best was always enough for their child. \u201cThere are separate realities in every family. A parent could credibly feel as if they did a good, conscientious job as a parent, and their child could credibly feel that their behaviour was hurtful in some way.\u201d Typically, the adult child is trying to express something that\u2019s important to them, even if it baffles the rejected parent. Sometimes, he argues, estrangement can be a child\u2019s way of disentangling themselves from an overly close relationship. \u201cSomething I see a lot of is just a need to separate from over-involved, loving parents. Parents have become much more anxious, much more invested, much more guilt-ridden, much more involved.\u201d Other triggers include what he suggests are clumsy therapists identifying childhood trauma where it doesn\u2019t exist, and clashes between parents and an adult child\u2019s partner. (In a survey of 1,600 estranged parents Coleman conducted, 70% said they only finally become estranged after their child married: be careful about criticising someone your offspring is dating, he warns.) In his consulting room, clients often reel off long, indignant lists of everything they did for their children, from birthday parties to paying for college education. Fathers in particular tend to balk at his strategy of writing a \u201cletter of amends\u201d apologising to their child, he says, though mothers are often keener to do whatever it takes (interestingly, research shows men are less likely than women to end up reconciled with estranged children). \u201cDads will often say, \u2018No, they can give me an amends letter, why should I write one? I was a good parent,\u2019\u201d Coleman says. But he warns them it\u2019s usually the child who has the whip hand, as they\u2019re the ones ultimately willing to walk out. While estrangement is increasingly seen as \u201cthe strong, assertive thing to do\u201d, he argues, it\u2019s also a cataclysmic event in a family that can pit sibling against sibling, cut grandchildren off from grandparents, and reverberate down generations. There\u2019s no hard evidence on whether estrangement is becoming more common, as opposed to being just more commonly talked about, either in the US or the UK. But Coleman\u2019s hunch is that it\u2019s on the rise, fuelled by polarising politics \u2013 one couple consulted him after their son announced, \u201cIf you vote for Trump in the next election, we are done\u201d \u2013 and a growing emphasis on individual happiness over collective bonds or old-fashioned filial duty. Family relationships, he thinks, are starting to resemble romantic ones: if they\u2019re not emotionally fulfilling, moving on is no longer inconceivable. \u201cIt\u2019s a tectonic shift in the way we organise family relationships and a lot of parents haven\u2019t really gotten the memo yet.\u201d What most confuses parents, he argues, is the way definitions of abusive behaviour have shifted since they grew up, when smacking or yelling at your kids was considered routine. \u201cSo many of the letters that parents are responding negatively to are, \u2018You emotionally abused me, you traumatised me\u2019 and that\u2019s when parents are like, \u2018What the hell are you talking about? I wish I had your childhood.\u2019\u201d The word \u201cnarcissist\u201d is particularly overused, he says, to the bafflement of many parents. (Once a clinical term for pathological self-importance, it\u2019s seeped into casual conversation to mean anyone selfish, cold, manipulative or just difficult.) \u201cThere\u2019s been this enormous expansion over what gets labelled as pathological behaviour.\u201d What Coleman seems to be describing isn\u2019t just a series of conflicts between individual children and parents, but a broader clash between generations with different expectations of relationships, and often different language to describe it. * * * \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen. And if it did, it wasn\u2019t that bad. And if it was, that\u2019s not a big deal. And if it is, it\u2019s not my fault \u2026\u201d So begins The Narcissist\u2019s Prayer by Belfast poet Dayna Craig, which holds a special resonance for the many estranged adult children plastering it across their social media feeds. The poem seems to capture their sense of being gaslit by an abusive parent but also by outsiders, asking how they can be so cruel as to cut their families off. Lauren, from London, grew up with a mother who was absent for several years and a father she calls emotionally abusive and cruel. He didn\u2019t hit her, she says, but he didn\u2019t have to: the things he said were worse, calling her a whore for painting her nails, for example, or telling her to kill herself. \u201cI never understood that \u2018sticks and stones will break your bones\u2019 thing \u2013 actually, words do hurt you.\u201d At 18 she left home, and tried keeping contact to a bare minimum. She would meet her father only in public places, accompanied by her partner, and communicate only by email. But it didn\u2019t help, she says: her father railed against the loss of control, and the emails turned abusive. So she stopped speaking to him altogether, to her extended family\u2019s outrage. In Nigerian families, she explains, aunties, uncles and cousins are closely involved, and parents and children are expected to retain an even closer bond: it was easier, she thinks, for her relatives to blame her for the relationship breaking down than to engage with what she was saying about her father\u2019s behaviour. \u201cIt\u2019s psychologically more comfortable to say, \u2018No, that can\u2019t be right, I would have known,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d get told, \u2018You\u2019ll miss him when he\u2019s gone\u2019 but I\u2019m pretty certain I won\u2019t. People seem to require justification but I don\u2019t feel I should have to provide it before people believe me.\u201d On TikTok and in estrangement forums, family and friends who try to broker reunions are sometimes bitterly labelled \u201cflying monkeys\u201d, after the winged flunkies who did the Wicked Witch\u2019s bidding in The Wizard of Oz. These often well-meaning interventions are a common phenomenon, says Sarah Davies, a chartered counselling psychologist and trauma therapist, and the author of Raised by Narcissists: How to Handle Your Difficult, Toxic and Abusive Parents. But they can be distressing for adult children who have chosen no contact for very good reasons. \u201cI tell people to be very careful about who they share the details with in order to protect themselves from comments like, \u2018But it\u2019s your mum \u2026\u2019 Well, yes, that\u2019s what makes it hard.\u201d Friends shouldn\u2019t rush to judge an estrangement that seems puzzling to them, she argues: if there was abuse involved, people might not want to tell everyone what happened. \u201cYou don\u2019t fully understand what somebody has been through.\u201d Deciding what you are prepared to tolerate from an abusive parent is a highly individual decision that each adult child must carefully work through for themselves, Davies argues, including honestly examining their own motives for doing it: \u201cIt\u2019s a very conscious process rather than, \u2018No, I\u2019m done.\u2019\u201d That said, however, she writes in the book that \u201cif you can go no contact with an abusive parent, then do\u201d. Is she trying to give people permission to do something that feels transgressive? \u201cI think sometimes children of narcissists feel they need permission. When you grow up with a toxic parent, you feel guilty, you feel bad, you feel as if it\u2019s your fault.\u201d Davies, who ended contact with her own parents two years ago, says Christmas, birthdays and family occasions are still tough for many of her clients: she was once unexpectedly flooded with sadness in a spa, watching mothers and daughters enjoying a day out together. Others struggle with how to respond to an ageing estranged parent who is ill or dying: should they agree to one last visit? Lauren, however, is resolute: the next time she sees her father will be at his funeral. Millennials are often told they\u2019re snowflakes, she says, for objecting to behaviour that previous generations put up with. \u201cBut we\u2019re the generation that has finally had enough of, \u2018Well, it didn\u2019t do me any harm\u2019 and, \u2018That\u2019s how we\u2019ve always done this.\u2019\u201d Her determination not to keep on repeating the cycle is such that, now in her 30s, she has decided not to have children herself. For millennial parents, the idea that good parenting means working to \u201cbreak the cycle\u201d \u2013 as Prince Harry explained in an earnest 2021 interview alongside his then pregnant wife \u2013 instead of unwittingly making the same mistakes as their parents, is a powerful one. \u201cGenerational trauma is such a big word for my generation \u2013 what trauma has been passed down that we want to think about not repeating. Whereas my parents\u2019 generation did not even understand it,\u201d Bland says. \u201cIt creates tensions where people don\u2019t understand why they\u2019ve been cut off.\u201d Perhaps that is particularly true for parents who survived difficult upbringings themselves. Nancy was hard up when she got pregnant, and as a single mother had no support from her own mother, whom she calls \u201ca piece of work\u201d. Even before the baby was born, she realised she might have bitten off more than she could chew. \u201cBut I knuckled down, I did my best. We were never homeless. We were never so poor that I couldn\u2019t afford what we needed,\u201d she tells me over the phone. And for a long time, as she tells it, they were unusually close. A single mother to an only daughter, Nancy breastfed until her baby was two and says they shared a bed for years afterwards. \u201cWe never fought. I was her world, everything was always fine between us.\u201d She managed to put her daughter through university and gave her a lump sum afterwards. \u201cAnd it went from that to, \u2018I don\u2019t want to have a relationship with you, I never want you around your grandchild.\u2019 It just shocked me, and she never told me why.\u201d Nancy\u2019s daughter is a lesbian and though she insists that wasn\u2019t an issue for her, she sounds cooler on the subject of her daughter-in-law. \u201cI didn\u2019t really get on well with her but I didn\u2019t get on poorly. I accepted her, I gave her presents.\u201d But the arguments began, she says, when her daughter got pregnant and said she wanted some space. Accordingly, Nancy says, she backed off. But after the baby was born, she called. She says she can\u2019t remember much about the conversation: \u201cShe was taking care of her newborn and I didn\u2019t want to press her on anything.\u201d But whatever was said, after that came the letter cutting her off, and she hasn\u2019t tried to resume contact: another rejection, she says, would be too painful. More than a decade on, she has never met her grandchild and, to avoid explanations, usually says she has no children when asked. Now in her 70s, Nancy has rewritten her will to leave her house to a local housing authority and appointed new executors. \u201cThey\u2019ll get rid of all my stuff and scatter the ashes. I don\u2019t know how my daughter will feel about it \u2013 if she\u2019ll feel I\u2019ve taken something away from her.\u201d Nancy looked after her own mother in old age, despite their difficult relationship, she says, because she thought that was what family did. But her own daughter told her their relationship \u201ccan\u2019t be about duty\u201d. As we talk, Nancy seems torn between sadness and rage. \u201cI sometimes wonder why the anger is still so strong. My therapist would say it\u2019s to protect me from more hurt and I want to move past it. But part of me \u2013 if she would just sit down with me at the kitchen table \u2013 would like to say, \u2018What the fuck, why did you do this? What did you get out of this, that your life is so much better without me in it?\u2019 As a parent your child is central to your life but as a child your parent is not central.\u201d Towards the end of our conversation, Nancy reveals that her own mother had mental health problems, and that she sometimes wonders if that had something to do with her daughter breaking ties, as if to inoculate herself against something. \u201cMaybe she thought that I was going to become like her.\u201d * * * According to the Ohio State University study, the vast majority of estranged adult children eventually resume contact with their families. But it may not always be a fairytale happy ending, with some families cycling repeatedly in and out of contact. Pippa was in her early 40s when her tolerance for the father she describes as abusive, domineering and controlling finally snapped. \u201cHe started his usual stuff of telling me how everybody thought he was wonderful and I sat there listening and said, \u2018Shall I tell you what I\u2019ve been up to?\u2019 I told him one thing and he just went \u2018hmmm\u2019 and carried on talking about himself.\u201d In that moment, she decided she couldn\u2019t see him any longer. But the most painful aspect of cutting off her father was that it meant also losing touch with her mother \u2013 who Pippa says was damaged herself, and coercively controlled by her father \u2013 as well as her siblings and wider family, whom she didn\u2019t see for almost a decade. \u201cWe come from a family where nobody talks about feelings, nobody talks about anything; you\u2019re not allowed to have emotions.\u201d They had just begun talking again, in a reunion brokered by a relative, when her mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Pippa moved back home to nurse her, and in the last few weeks mother and daughter finally acknowledged the time they had lost. \u201cI did say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry I left you, and I do regret having missed things.\u2019\u201d But she found the experience of temporarily sharing a roof with her father traumatic. What surprised Pippa most about the estrangement, she says, is that it wasn\u2019t the clean break she\u2019d imagined. \u201cYou think about them every day. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re gone \u2013 every single day they\u2019re on your mind, and that\u2019s the weird thing. They\u2019re not in your physical space but they\u2019re still in your headspace.\u201d If some estrangements seem sadly inevitable, could others be avoidable? In his book, Coleman writes that, while he\u2019s often asked if estrangement is generally justifiable, a better question is whether it\u2019s right to cut a parent off when you know that will ruin their life. Americans\u2019 love for individual needs and rights, he adds, \u201cconceals how much sorrow is left in the wake\u201d. When I ask if he means children should take more responsibility for their parents\u2019 happiness, he pauses. \u201cNo, not at any cost. The parent has to be able and willing to take responsibility, to show compassion, to not be defensive, to understand why the child feels that estrangement is the healthiest thing to do. They can\u2019t just show up with their arms folded and go, \u2018I\u2019m your father, you have to accept me.\u2019\u201d But trying to understand why a parent does what they do \u2013 perhaps because of their own childhood, or what\u2019s happened to them in a marriage \u2013 can sometimes be therapeutic, he argues, even if it doesn\u2019t make them any easier to live with. Adult children struggling to deal with a hyper-critical or undermining parent, he suggests, could try giving them a chance to change: perhaps say that their behaviour makes family get-togethers hard and ask them to stop criticising your partner, parenting, or whatever the flashpoint is. If nothing changes, then say their behaviour makes you want to see or call them less: \u201cI like to think of it as a shot across the bows.\u201d Parents on the receiving end of such warnings need to be humble enough to listen. \u201cThe natural reaction is to fight strongly against it. But that\u2019s often the thing that can turn your child even further against you, because when you start blaming, defending, criticising or guilt-tripping, none of those are going to work in your favour.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean accepting an allegation if it\u2019s factually wrong, he explains. \u201cBut if a child says, \u2018You emotionally abused me, you neglected me\u2019 I think it\u2019s OK for a parent to say, \u2018It\u2019s clear I have blind spots as a parent \u2013 I wasn\u2019t aware that you felt I was emotionally abusive to you, but I\u2019m glad that you told me and I want to learn more.\u2019\u201d (Keeping the lines open may be particularly important in the rare cases when an adult child breaks contact under pressure from their violent or coercively controlling partner, who is seeking to cut them off from help: if you suspect that is what\u2019s going on, advice from the domestic violence charity Refuge is to try to speak to them away from the abusive partner about what might be happening, avoid sounding judgmental of the relationship and signpost them to resources such as the National Domestic Abuse Helpline.) Bland agrees it\u2019s worth considering first whether the relationship can be improved with the help of a mediator or a counsellor, if only so that you know you tried everything you could. And if it can\u2019t be fixed? \u201cYou have to consider the boundaries in your life \u2013 how much you can do. For some people that might be going low contact \u2013 you could see each other once a year.\u201d After a decade and a half apart, she finds it hard to imagine reconciling with her own parents, \u201cunless some really big things changed\u201d, and has found peace with that. \u201cI don\u2019t think the struggle is greater than having a relationship with a parent who devalues you on a daily basis,\u201d she says slowly, pointing out that having to be independent has in some ways been empowering. When she became a homeowner, at least she knew she\u2019d done it by herself. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of confidence, a lot of fearlessness. Nothing holds me back. And that was a product of thinking, \u2018I\u2019ve got nothing left to lose.\u2019\u201d But for others it\u2019s less clearcut. For Pippa, her father\u2019s eventual death some years after she lost her mother left her with unexpectedly conflicting feelings. \u201cAll my childhood and all my life, there was always part of me that hoped one day I would get some evidence that my dad gave a shit. So when he died, yes, there was a lot of relief, but there was also the grief that I\u2019m never going to get the opportunity now for him to show that. Though, of course, the conscious adult knows that was never going to happen anyway.\u201d When I ask what she wishes more people understood about estrangement, her answer is that it\u2019s not actually an ending; more an ongoing process of living without both your actual parent, and the parent you always wanted but now realise you can never have.

      "body": "<p>It is a cold, autumnal wee hour of the morning in Istanbul and I am sipping a sweet, orchid-root-flavoured drink called <em>sahlep</em> and smoking a water pipe. I\u2019m lurking outside a <em>nargile</em> (hookah pipe) joint on a small road called Ticarethane Sokak in what is known as the Old City or Historic Peninsula. This is where many of the city\u2019s great monuments are, including the Hagia Sophia mosque, Topkapi Palace and the Hippodrome. This is also where Inspector Cetin Ikmen, the central character of my novels and subsequent BBC TV series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jul/07/the-turkish-detective-review-downright-ridiculous-in-a-good-way\">The Turkish Detective</a> lives. Like Ikmen, I enjoy wandering the city in the dark early hours of the morning. When only the hardiest, the mad, the bad and the protectors of the city roam the streets, so also do the phantoms appear.</p> <p>In common with Ikmen, I disappear easily. I\u2019m a woman of a certain age in&nbsp;a big coat and battered boots, and I&nbsp;walk like a man. I avoid eye contact. I\u2019m here for the ghosts. Walking down Ticarethane Sokak, I join the main thoroughfare, Divan Yolu, and make my way past shuttered shops and silent coffee houses to the royal tombs on the corner of Bab-\u0131 Ali Caddesi. This&nbsp;consists of a small cemetery for Ottoman princes and princesses, and a&nbsp;mausoleum that houses the remains of three 19th-century sultans \u2013 ranging in character from reformers to despots. Now they lie side by side in darkness, stared at by me through a metal grille. The ghost of Sultan Abd\u00fclaziz (1830-1876) \u2013 or maybe a&nbsp;white cat \u2013 briefly flits across my field&nbsp;of vision when I&nbsp;remember that he was found dead in&nbsp;mysterious circumstances.</p>    <p>Were this daytime, I\u2019d probably carry on along Divan Yolu and head for the Kapal\u0131\u00e7ar\u015f\u0131 (the Grand Bazaar) and attempt to locate the time portal that is said to exist at the centre of the great market, in the I\u00e7 Bedesten. But the bazaar closes at 7pm and so I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of that snippet of Istanbul esoterica at this time. At 3am, a quick pop back to Byzantium or forward to who-knows-what is denied to me. Instead, I head back the way I came and sit cross-legged on a bench beside the vast open space that was once the Hippodrome of Byzantium. This is approached via&nbsp;At Meydan\u0131 Caddesi, which is exactly opposite Ticarethane Sokak. Cetin Ikmen can see it from his apartment balcony but he, like me, prefers to go there.</p>    <p>Not even passing cops notice me as I&nbsp;let my imagination loose around the great Roman circus first constructed by the emperor Septimius Severus in AD203. Refashioned by the city\u2019s first Christian emperor, Constantine the Great, in AD324, this was where the mighty Byzantine empire rewarded its&nbsp;citizens with bloody chariot races between political factions called the Greens and the Blues. Supported by opposing political parties, the rivalry between these teams was legendary, and in AD532 resulted in riots during which 30,000 people were killed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Tendril by tendril, mist begins to roll across the city from the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara. Ships\u2019 fog horns moan into the night like damned souls</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I wish I could say that it\u2019s rare to find someone who claims to have seen ghostly chariots racing round the Hippodrome at night, but I can\u2019t because almost everyone except me has seen them. However, I\u2019m not daunted and instead I close my eyes and listen. Faint at first, a hissing sound persists when I open my eyes again and I walk towards the Serpent Column. Set low in the ground in the middle of the Hippodrome, known as the spina, the column is now not much more than a short bronze candy-twist. But it wasn\u2019t always like this. Created to commemorate the victory of the Greeks over the Persians in 479BC, it was once much taller and topped by three serpent heads bearing a solid gold bowl. Half-closing my eyes, I can see them writhe.

      "bodyText": "It is a cold, autumnal wee hour of the morning in Istanbul and I am sipping a sweet, orchid-root-flavoured drink called sahlep and smoking a water pipe. I\u2019m lurking outside a nargile (hookah pipe) joint on a small road called Ticarethane Sokak in what is known as the Old City or Historic Peninsula. This is where many of the city\u2019s great monuments are, including the Hagia Sophia mosque, Topkapi Palace and the Hippodrome. This is also where Inspector Cetin Ikmen, the central character of my novels and subsequent BBC TV series The Turkish Detective lives. Like Ikmen, I enjoy wandering the city in the dark early hours of the morning. When only the hardiest, the mad, the bad and the protectors of the city roam the streets, so also do the phantoms appear. In common with Ikmen, I disappear easily. I\u2019m a woman of a certain age in a big coat and battered boots, and I walk like a man. I avoid eye contact. I\u2019m here for the ghosts. Walking down Ticarethane Sokak, I join the main thoroughfare, Divan Yolu, and make my way past shuttered shops and silent coffee houses to the royal tombs on the corner of Bab-\u0131 Ali Caddesi. This consists of a small cemetery for Ottoman princes and princesses, and a mausoleum that houses the remains of three 19th-century sultans \u2013 ranging in character from reformers to despots. Now they lie side by side in darkness, stared at by me through a metal grille. The ghost of Sultan Abd\u00fclaziz (1830-1876) \u2013 or maybe a white cat \u2013 briefly flits across my field of vision when I remember that he was found dead in mysterious circumstances. Were this daytime, I\u2019d probably carry on along Divan Yolu and head for the Kapal\u0131\u00e7ar\u015f\u0131 (the Grand Bazaar) and attempt to locate the time portal that is said to exist at the centre of the great market, in the I\u00e7 Bedesten. But the bazaar closes at 7pm and so I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of that snippet of Istanbul esoterica at this time. At 3am, a quick pop back to Byzantium or forward to who-knows-what is denied to me. Instead, I head back the way I came and sit cross-legged on a bench beside the vast open space that was once the Hippodrome of Byzantium. This is approached via At Meydan\u0131 Caddesi, which is exactly opposite Ticarethane Sokak. Cetin Ikmen can see it from his apartment balcony but he, like me, prefers to go there. Not even passing cops notice me as I let my imagination loose around the great Roman circus first constructed by the emperor Septimius Severus in AD203. Refashioned by the city\u2019s first Christian emperor, Constantine the Great, in AD324, this was where the mighty Byzantine empire rewarded its citizens with bloody chariot races between political factions called the Greens and the Blues. Supported by opposing political parties, the rivalry between these teams was legendary, and in AD532 resulted in riots during which 30,000 people were killed. I wish I could say that it\u2019s rare to find someone who claims to have seen ghostly chariots racing round the Hippodrome at night, but I can\u2019t because almost everyone except me has seen them. However, I\u2019m not daunted and instead I close my eyes and listen. Faint at first, a hissing sound persists when I open my eyes again and I walk towards the Serpent Column. Set low in the ground in the middle of the Hippodrome, known as the spina, the column is now not much more than a short bronze candy-twist. But it wasn\u2019t always like this. Created to commemorate the victory of the Greeks over the Persians in 479BC, it was once much taller and topped by three serpent heads bearing a solid gold bowl. Half-closing my eyes, I can see them writhe. As a friend to snakes, born under the sign of the Serpent Bearer, Ophiuchus, the disputed 13th sign of the zodiac, I am down with slithery ghosts. Tendril by tendril, mist begins to roll across the city from the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara. Ships\u2019 fog horns moan into the night like damned souls and I, together with a small tribe of local cats, head off towards the sacred precinct of Hagia Sophia. Now a mosque, until recently Hagia Sophia was a museum. Prior to that it was an Ottoman mosque, but it was built as a Byzantine Orthodox church in AD360. And though it has been rebuilt three times \u2013 the current structure dates from AD537 \u2013 a sacred building has stood on this site for almost 17 centuries. My small cohort of the famous Istanbul cat population don\u2019t give a damn about history and are only hanging around with me in case I magically produce some food. But I like their company, their soft yowls, their furry bodies winding themselves through my legs. Echoes of long-dead Byzantine emperors and empresses float by. This whole area was once the Great Palace of the Byzantines. Now deep underground, the Great Palace contained a room made entirely from red porphyry stone where every true member of the royal family was born.

However, my favourite myth is the one concerning what happened in Hagia Sophia on the night of 29 May 1453. After a siege lasting 53 days, the Ottoman Turkish army under the command of the 21-year-old Sultan Mehmet II entered what was then called Constantinople and broke into the church. Hagia Sophia\u2019s priests, who had been praying for deliverance from the Turks day and night for weeks, neither looked at the young sultan as he rode his white stallion up to the altar, nor did they cease their devotions. It is said that, still praying, they turned away from Mehmet and disappeared into the walls of the building where they remain to this day, awaiting the return of their once mighty empire. Amid the shifting outlines of the mist-robed building, you can almost believe it, and I wonder what, if they are still there, those priests have been doing all this time. I imagine them as etiolated, black-clad figures, their ancient eyes ever searching for a future that will never come.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Taiwan</strong></h2> <p>One of the best meals of my life was the platter of food that I ate in a Taipei hospital after I gave birth to my son last year. There was tofu braised in five-spice, shiitake mushrooms, steamed cauliflower with diced carrot, and sauteed spinach with ginger. It was paired with plenty of liquid: rice porridge, black sesame soup, and vegetable broth peppered with daikon.</p> <p>I had just had an emergency C-section, and the anaesthesia had yet to wear off. But I was ravenous. I devoured every morsel in front of me. I hadn\u2019t eaten a&nbsp;proper meal in days.</p> <p>In retrospect, the hospital food was bland and underseasoned, which is typical of hospital food in Taiwan. Hefty amounts of spice, sugar and salt are frowned upon; they are believed to irritate the gut. But the meal was exactly what I needed after major surgery. I&nbsp;didn\u2019t even notice that there was no meat. I was at Adventist hospital in Taipei, a privately owned Christian hospital, where all the food is vegetarian and low in fat, salt and sugar.</p> <p>What distinguishes all hospital food in Taiwan is the diversity of textures, colours, ingredients and flavours. \u201cWe need to ensure that the food is nutritionally balanced,\u201d says Lin Shu-chi, head of nutrition at Adventist.</p> <p>Meals are modified based on a&nbsp;patient\u2019s condition. I wasn\u2019t given cold foods like fruit or raw vegetables as, according to traditional Chinese food therapy principles, these would impair recovery. Instead, I was fed soft, warm dishes like scrambled eggs. \u201cIn western countries they might serve more bread and dairy products, while in Asian countries we prefer rice and hot dishes,\u201d says Lin. \u201cOur cooking methods also differ. We prefer steaming, boiling and stir-frying.\u201d</p> <p>I wiped clean every dish during my three days in hospital. It wasn\u2019t because the food was especially tasty. It was that my body needed nourishment after nine months of gestating a tiny human. And this time, all the food I&nbsp;ate was just for me. <em>Clarissa Wei</em></p> <h2><strong>Kenya</strong></h2>    <p>Meals at Kenyan hospitals are much like those in homes across the country. From a typical breakfast of bread or porridge with tea to the maize meal staple <em>ugali</em><em> </em>served with sauteed greens and beef stew, it\u2019s comfort food familiar to many.</p> <p>But pressure on public hospitals to cut costs means tasty food is at the bottom of the priority list. For breakfast, the porridge can be lumpy and the tea watered down, but it tends to be the patients\u2019 favourite meal of the day, since things go downhill from there.</p> <p>The afternoon and dinner menus are a throwback to life in Kenya\u2019s public boarding schools: meals that are easy to cook in bulk and affordable, like rice, cabbage and beans, sometimes served in sectioned silver metallic plates.</p> <p>In paediatric units, or private wards and clinics, food is tastier, served more beautifully, and usually accompanied by fruit, such as watermelon slices. In public wards, it is dull and unappealing. The vegetables are limp, the <em>ugali</em> grainy and the meat sparse. Some patients pick at their food before going to the canteen for packaged snacks or the teatime favourite <em>mandazi</em>, a sweet fried bread.</p> <p>Hospital nutritionists say that the bland food is a deliberate choice: it is low in fat, sugars and oil, and caters to a broad range of health needs. Staff usually avoid the food served to patients and eat at local restaurants.</p> <p>Some patients manage by holding out for home-cooked meals brought by their families. \u201cMy husband brings chapati. He knows it\u2019s my favourite,\u201d says 28-year-old maternity patient Winfred Mbithe, adding that the meals keep her fuelled as she cares for herself and her newborn. \u201cIt\u2019s my best time of the day.\u201d <em>Caroline Kimeu</em></p> <h2><strong>UK</strong></h2>    <p>Picture a hospital meal. If you\u2019re British, you\u2019ll probably be imagining something beige, encased in microwavable plastic. In 2019, a bad batch of sandwiches <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5fbd0f898fa8f559e9ea363e/2019-05-Listeria-CC8-Outbreak-Report.pdf\">killed seven patients</a> in several hospitals in England, cementing the UK\u2019s reputation for truly dreadful hospital food. Actual poisoning is thankfully rare, but every few months an unappetising dish will go viral on social media. Earlier this year, a man in Glasgow was served a plate of turkey and potatoes so hideous that the local NHS health board was moved to issue a public apology.</p> <p>This August, I visited St Thomas\u2019 hospital in south London, where the chefs are trying to serve more tempting food. Unlike most British hospitals, where the catering staff bulk-buy frozen ready meals and warm them up, St Thomas\u2019 cooks make meals on site \u2013 2,933 of them every day. Philip Shelley, a senior operational manager for NHS England, showed me round the kitchen, where everything is supersized. A&nbsp;bolognese was bubbling away in a pan so big it looked like a bathtub. I walked past a chef stirring a basin of bechamel sauce with a 2ft-long whisk.</p> <p>Friday is fish and chips day, and the portion I&nbsp;tasted was comforting, but didn\u2019t look that nutritious. And while the food had been cooked on site, I was told it was made three days previously, then sealed in plastic and frozen. Apparently all NHS meals at the hospital are batch-cooked ahead of time to make juggling thousands of meals a day easier. St Thomas\u2019 fee-paying patients, however, eat food cooked from scratch. On my tour, I&nbsp;spotted an area where a lone chef was plating up trays of smoked salmon and melon for the private ward. The contrast appeared stark.</p> <p>Very few UK hospitals serve fresh, made-to-order food to non-paying patients. Alder Hey children\u2019s hospital in Liverpool is the only hospital in the UK to have a chef in every ward, so a&nbsp;child can order pancakes, or feta and tomato pasta, and have it cooked from scratch and served within minutes. Shelley would like to see kitchens like Alder Hey\u2019s installed on every hospital ward in the UK, but estimates that such a transition would take a decade.</p> <p>Part of the problem, he says, is a&nbsp;tendency in the UK to undervalue food. \u201cThe average British high street has much worse food than one in Spain or France.\u201d But while scratch-cooking and quality ingredients may seem indulgent, the irony is that improving hospital food could save the NHS money. Cooking fresh food on site is cheaper than buying ready meals from outside catering companies (which cost the NHS about&nbsp;\u00a32.10 to buy in). Inedible meals also end up wasting taxpayers\u2019 money. Last year, 3,600 tonnes of NHS food was thrown away as plate waste \u2013 if hospital food gets better, less of it will&nbsp;end up in the bin. <em>Kitty Drake</em></p> <h2><strong>Spain</strong></h2>    <p>The Germans Trias i Pujol hospital is a&nbsp;vast complex in Badalona, a satellite town north of Barcelona. Here, 1,500 meals a day are prepared in-house by a&nbsp;contract catering firm supervised by facilities manager Yolanda Fern\u00e1ndez and dietician Elisabeth Llorens.</p> <p>They offer about 40 menus a day, taking into account the patients\u2019 condition and religion (Badalona is one of Spain\u2019s most multicultural cities), not to mention the growing number of allergies and intolerances.</p> <p>\u201cThe hospital has a double function,\u201d says Fern\u00e1ndez. \u201cRecovery and teaching people to eat better. But as the average stay is seven days, we\u2019re limited in what we can do.\u201d</p> <p>The hospital follows a Mediterranean diet, with special dishes prepared for local festivals. Breakfast is likely to be wholemeal bread, yoghurt, ham, cheese and fruit, with omelette, cereal or brioche. For lunch and dinner, patients have three options per course. First course lunch choices include soups, salad, pasta and rice dishes. For the main course, vegetable goulash, roast chicken, tuna escabeche or meatballs. The hospital follows the Spanish tradition of serving paella or other rice dishes on Thursday, and fish on Fridays.</p> <p>Starters on the dinner menu include green bean and potato salad, spinach with pine nuts and raisins, potato omelette and mushroom soup. Main course choices include salmon with almond cream and rice, hake with pistou, pork sausage with onions and green beans, and a hamburger or chicken with cheese and raisins. Dessert is usually fruit and yoghurt.</p> <p>The food sounds appetising, but the Spanish have high expectations when it comes to cuisine \u2013 ones that are hard to meet when making 500 meals at a&nbsp;time. <em>Stephen Burgen</em></p> <h2><strong>Japan</strong></h2>    <p>The dinner served to patients at Kobe Red Cross hospital would not be out of place at a decent Japanese restaurant.</p> <p>The centrepiece is a bowl of <em>taki</em><em>komi gohan</em> \u2013 steamed rice with chicken, <em>kinoko</em> mushrooms, strips of deep-fried carrot, seasonal herbs and green peas. It\u2019s accompanied by grilled fish with grated radish, tofu balls with okra and carrot in a light soy-based dressing, spinach and <em>shimeji</em> mushrooms, a mug of cold wheat tea and a slice of butter-free <em>matcha</em> cake with a sweet-bean filling.</p> <p>The menu changes every week, with an emphasis on traditional Japanese cuisine, according to Hiroko Komada, head of nutrition at the hospital, in a&nbsp;nod to older patients who may not be familiar with more \u201cexotic\u201d food.</p> <p>\u201cThe patients are feeling anxious as it is \u2013 especially if they are due to have an operation or a major examination \u2013 so we try to reflect what they would eat at home,\u201d says Komada, who plans the menus a month in advance with input from medical colleagues.</p> <p>The hospital is not alone in Japan in enjoying a reputation for above-average meals, partly due to the success of its insurance-based universal healthcare coverage and a&nbsp;cultural emphasis on simple food cooked from scratch. In recent years, several foreign residents have drawn attention to how much better they have eaten during hospital stays in Japan than in their home countries. One woman\u2019s photos of the beautifully arranged meals she ate during her stay at a maternity ward \u2013 full of mouth-watering combinations such as <em>omuraisu</em> (rice omelette), macaroni salad, chicken soup, squid rings, fruit and green tea \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.boredpanda.com/hospital-food-japan-birth/\">went viral</a>.</p> <p>Komada says that the food is not to everyone\u2019s liking, with some patients dissatisfied about modest portion sizes and a lack of fast-food favourites such as ramen and fried chicken. \u201cFor the most part, though, they eat everything with no complaints,\u201d she says. <em>Justin&nbsp;McCurry</em></p> <h2><strong>Sweden</strong></h2>    <p>Six years ago, catering at S\u00f6dersjukhuset, or S\u00f6s, one of Stockholm\u2019s largest hospitals, underwent a&nbsp;culture change. They got rid of their longtime supplier, built their own kitchen and created a&nbsp;new system. Today, they cook and rapidly chill meals on-site, ready to be heated in the wards as and when they are needed \u2013 they last for up to 10 days without losing taste or texture. </p> <p>Dishes such as bean chilli with rice and fried vegetables, chicken tikka masala, and meatballs with cream sauce, mashed potato and steamed vegetables are served with the aim of making them look as appetising as possible. Lighter meals include broccoli and pea soup, omelette, salad, fruit and blueberry cheesecake. Any leftovers are sold to staff at a discount. Under the new regime, patient satisfaction has shot up and food waste has been cut by 70%.</p> <p>\u201cWe try to make very simple food,\u201d says cook and dietician Linda Hagdahl, who is head of meal service, during a&nbsp;tour of the kitchen.</p> <p>They make as much as possible from scratch, including pancakes, bread and meatballs, but avoid anything too fussy. \u201cIt should be tasty and nice, but not too much, because then it\u2019s hard for the wards to work with it.\u201d</p> <p>Patients tell Hagdahl that the arrival of food is the highlight of the day (having recently given birth at S\u00f6s, I can attest to this). \u201cThere is a lot of worry in the walls here,\u201d she says. \u201cSo mealtime is maybe the only thing you can feel is normal.\u201d</p> <p>Across Sweden, there is a heightened focus on hospital meals and the importance of food to recovery. The Swedish Food Agency\u2019s 2022 guidelines say that a&nbsp;good meal served in an attractive way contributes to wellbeing and should be a \u201cprioritised part of&nbsp;care\u201d.</p> <p>At S\u00f6s, Hagdahl wants to implement a digital ordering system so that patients can take more control over what they eat. \u201cWithout energy in the body, it\u2019s hard to recover,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get up and move around and recover. It\u2019s a part of the medical treatment.\u201d <em>Miranda Bryant</em></p> <h2><strong>Australia</strong></h2>    <p>Harry Iles-Mann has spent more than 50 weeks in one of Sydney\u2019s major public hospitals after two liver transplants and various complications. During that time he became used to eating \u201cfood served in a puddle\u201d.</p> <p>The 29-year-old\u2019s experience reflects the generally poor reputation of hospital food in Australia. Many states contract out their food preparation services to private companies to produce meals in bulk and deliver them frozen to hospitals. Many hospital kitchens no longer have the ability or the equipment to cook food, only to reheat it.</p> <p>The process not only leaves meals swimming in water from condensation as a result of reheating, but also affects the texture and taste. It makes meat and vegetables rubbery, flavourless and difficult to cut. Different menus are offered to patients, depending on their needs, and food has to meet nutritional and safety standards.

      "bodyText": "Taiwan One of the best meals of my life was the platter of food that I ate in a Taipei hospital after I gave birth to my son last year. There was tofu braised in five-spice, shiitake mushrooms, steamed cauliflower with diced carrot, and sauteed spinach with ginger. It was paired with plenty of liquid: rice porridge, black sesame soup, and vegetable broth peppered with daikon. I had just had an emergency C-section, and the anaesthesia had yet to wear off. But I was ravenous. I devoured every morsel in front of me. I hadn\u2019t eaten a proper meal in days. In retrospect, the hospital food was bland and underseasoned, which is typical of hospital food in Taiwan. Hefty amounts of spice, sugar and salt are frowned upon; they are believed to irritate the gut. But the meal was exactly what I needed after major surgery. I didn\u2019t even notice that there was no meat. I was at Adventist hospital in Taipei, a privately owned Christian hospital, where all the food is vegetarian and low in fat, salt and sugar. What distinguishes all hospital food in Taiwan is the diversity of textures, colours, ingredients and flavours. \u201cWe need to ensure that the food is nutritionally balanced,\u201d says Lin Shu-chi, head of nutrition at Adventist. Meals are modified based on a patient\u2019s condition. I wasn\u2019t given cold foods like fruit or raw vegetables as, according to traditional Chinese food therapy principles, these would impair recovery. Instead, I was fed soft, warm dishes like scrambled eggs. \u201cIn western countries they might serve more bread and dairy products, while in Asian countries we prefer rice and hot dishes,\u201d says Lin. \u201cOur cooking methods also differ. We prefer steaming, boiling and stir-frying.\u201d I wiped clean every dish during my three days in hospital. It wasn\u2019t because the food was especially tasty. It was that my body needed nourishment after nine months of gestating a tiny human. And this time, all the food I ate was just for me. Clarissa Wei Kenya Meals at Kenyan hospitals are much like those in homes across the country. From a typical breakfast of bread or porridge with tea to the maize meal staple ugali served with sauteed greens and beef stew, it\u2019s comfort food familiar to many. But pressure on public hospitals to cut costs means tasty food is at the bottom of the priority list. For breakfast, the porridge can be lumpy and the tea watered down, but it tends to be the patients\u2019 favourite meal of the day, since things go downhill from there. The afternoon and dinner menus are a throwback to life in Kenya\u2019s public boarding schools: meals that are easy to cook in bulk and affordable, like rice, cabbage and beans, sometimes served in sectioned silver metallic plates. In paediatric units, or private wards and clinics, food is tastier, served more beautifully, and usually accompanied by fruit, such as watermelon slices. In public wards, it is dull and unappealing. The vegetables are limp, the ugali grainy and the meat sparse. Some patients pick at their food before going to the canteen for packaged snacks or the teatime favourite mandazi, a sweet fried bread. Hospital nutritionists say that the bland food is a deliberate choice: it is low in fat, sugars and oil, and caters to a broad range of health needs. Staff usually avoid the food served to patients and eat at local restaurants. Some patients manage by holding out for home-cooked meals brought by their families. \u201cMy husband brings chapati. He knows it\u2019s my favourite,\u201d says 28-year-old maternity patient Winfred Mbithe, adding that the meals keep her fuelled as she cares for herself and her newborn. \u201cIt\u2019s my best time of the day.\u201d Caroline Kimeu UK Picture a hospital meal. If you\u2019re British, you\u2019ll probably be imagining something beige, encased in microwavable plastic. In 2019, a bad batch of sandwiches killed seven patients in several hospitals in England, cementing the UK\u2019s reputation for truly dreadful hospital food. Actual poisoning is thankfully rare, but every few months an unappetising dish will go viral on social media. Earlier this year, a man in Glasgow was served a plate of turkey and potatoes so hideous that the local NHS health board was moved to issue a public apology. This August, I visited St Thomas\u2019 hospital in south London, where the chefs are trying to serve more tempting food. Unlike most British hospitals, where the catering staff bulk-buy frozen ready meals and warm them up, St Thomas\u2019 cooks make meals on site \u2013 2,933 of them every day. Philip Shelley, a senior operational manager for NHS England, showed me round the kitchen, where everything is supersized. A bolognese was bubbling away in a pan so big it looked like a bathtub. I walked past a chef stirring a basin of bechamel sauce with a 2ft-long whisk. Friday is fish and chips day, and the portion I tasted was comforting, but didn\u2019t look that nutritious. And while the food had been cooked on site, I was told it was made three days previously, then sealed in plastic and frozen. Apparently all NHS meals at the hospital are batch-cooked ahead of time to make juggling thousands of meals a day easier. St Thomas\u2019 fee-paying patients, however, eat food cooked from scratch. On my tour, I spotted an area where a lone chef was plating up trays of smoked salmon and melon for the private ward. The contrast appeared stark. Very few UK hospitals serve fresh, made-to-order food to non-paying patients. Alder Hey children\u2019s hospital in Liverpool is the only hospital in the UK to have a chef in every ward, so a child can order pancakes, or feta and tomato pasta, and have it cooked from scratch and served within minutes. Shelley would like to see kitchens like Alder Hey\u2019s installed on every hospital ward in the UK, but estimates that such a transition would take a decade. Part of the problem, he says, is a tendency in the UK to undervalue food. \u201cThe average British high street has much worse food than one in Spain or France.\u201d But while scratch-cooking and quality ingredients may seem indulgent, the irony is that improving hospital food could save the NHS money. Cooking fresh food on site is cheaper than buying ready meals from outside catering companies (which cost the NHS about \u00a32.10 to buy in). Inedible meals also end up wasting taxpayers\u2019 money. Last year, 3,600 tonnes of NHS food was thrown away as plate waste \u2013 if hospital food gets better, less of it will end up in the bin. Kitty Drake Spain The Germans Trias i Pujol hospital is a vast complex in Badalona, a satellite town north of Barcelona. Here, 1,500 meals a day are prepared in-house by a contract catering firm supervised by facilities manager Yolanda Fern\u00e1ndez and dietician Elisabeth Llorens. They offer about 40 menus a day, taking into account the patients\u2019 condition and religion (Badalona is one of Spain\u2019s most multicultural cities), not to mention the growing number of allergies and intolerances. \u201cThe hospital has a double function,\u201d says Fern\u00e1ndez. \u201cRecovery and teaching people to eat better. But as the average stay is seven days, we\u2019re limited in what we can do.\u201d The hospital follows a Mediterranean diet, with special dishes prepared for local festivals. Breakfast is likely to be wholemeal bread, yoghurt, ham, cheese and fruit, with omelette, cereal or brioche. For lunch and dinner, patients have three options per course. First course lunch choices include soups, salad, pasta and rice dishes. For the main course, vegetable goulash, roast chicken, tuna escabeche or meatballs. The hospital follows the Spanish tradition of serving paella or other rice dishes on Thursday, and fish on Fridays. Starters on the dinner menu include green bean and potato salad, spinach with pine nuts and raisins, potato omelette and mushroom soup. Main course choices include salmon with almond cream and rice, hake with pistou, pork sausage with onions and green beans, and a hamburger or chicken with cheese and raisins. Dessert is usually fruit and yoghurt. The food sounds appetising, but the Spanish have high expectations when it comes to cuisine \u2013 ones that are hard to meet when making 500 meals at a time. Stephen Burgen Japan The dinner served to patients at Kobe Red Cross hospital would not be out of place at a decent Japanese restaurant. The centrepiece is a bowl of takikomi gohan \u2013 steamed rice with chicken, kinoko mushrooms, strips of deep-fried carrot, seasonal herbs and green peas. It\u2019s accompanied by grilled fish with grated radish, tofu balls with okra and carrot in a light soy-based dressing, spinach and shimeji mushrooms, a mug of cold wheat tea and a slice of butter-free matcha cake with a sweet-bean filling. The menu changes every week, with an emphasis on traditional Japanese cuisine, according to Hiroko Komada, head of nutrition at the hospital, in a nod to older patients who may not be familiar with more \u201cexotic\u201d food. \u201cThe patients are feeling anxious as it is \u2013 especially if they are due to have an operation or a major examination \u2013 so we try to reflect what they would eat at home,\u201d says Komada, who plans the menus a month in advance with input from medical colleagues. The hospital is not alone in Japan in enjoying a reputation for above-average meals, partly due to the success of its insurance-based universal healthcare coverage and a cultural emphasis on simple food cooked from scratch. In recent years, several foreign residents have drawn attention to how much better they have eaten during hospital stays in Japan than in their home countries. One woman\u2019s photos of the beautifully arranged meals she ate during her stay at a maternity ward \u2013 full of mouth-watering combinations such as omuraisu (rice omelette), macaroni salad, chicken soup, squid rings, fruit and green tea \u2013 went viral. Komada says that the food is not to everyone\u2019s liking, with some patients dissatisfied about modest portion sizes and a lack of fast-food favourites such as ramen and fried chicken. \u201cFor the most part, though, they eat everything with no complaints,\u201d she says. Justin McCurry Sweden Six years ago, catering at S\u00f6dersjukhuset, or S\u00f6s, one of Stockholm\u2019s largest hospitals, underwent a culture change. They got rid of their longtime supplier, built their own kitchen and created a new system. Today, they cook and rapidly chill meals on-site, ready to be heated in the wards as and when they are needed \u2013 they last for up to 10 days without losing taste or texture. Dishes such as bean chilli with rice and fried vegetables, chicken tikka masala, and meatballs with cream sauce, mashed potato and steamed vegetables are served with the aim of making them look as appetising as possible. Lighter meals include broccoli and pea soup, omelette, salad, fruit and blueberry cheesecake. Any leftovers are sold to staff at a discount. Under the new regime, patient satisfaction has shot up and food waste has been cut by 70%. \u201cWe try to make very simple food,\u201d says cook and dietician Linda Hagdahl, who is head of meal service, during a tour of the kitchen. They make as much as possible from scratch, including pancakes, bread and meatballs, but avoid anything too fussy. \u201cIt should be tasty and nice, but not too much, because then it\u2019s hard for the wards to work with it.\u201d Patients tell Hagdahl that the arrival of food is the highlight of the day (having recently given birth at S\u00f6s, I can attest to this). \u201cThere is a lot of worry in the walls here,\u201d she says. \u201cSo mealtime is maybe the only thing you can feel is normal.\u201d Across Sweden, there is a heightened focus on hospital meals and the importance of food to recovery. The Swedish Food Agency\u2019s 2022 guidelines say that a good meal served in an attractive way contributes to wellbeing and should be a \u201cprioritised part of care\u201d. At S\u00f6s, Hagdahl wants to implement a digital ordering system so that patients can take more control over what they eat. \u201cWithout energy in the body, it\u2019s hard to recover,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get up and move around and recover. It\u2019s a part of the medical treatment.\u201d Miranda Bryant Australia Harry Iles-Mann has spent more than 50 weeks in one of Sydney\u2019s major public hospitals after two liver transplants and various complications. During that time he became used to eating \u201cfood served in a puddle\u201d. The 29-year-old\u2019s experience reflects the generally poor reputation of hospital food in Australia. Many states contract out their food preparation services to private companies to produce meals in bulk and deliver them frozen to hospitals. Many hospital kitchens no longer have the ability or the equipment to cook food, only to reheat it. The process not only leaves meals swimming in water from condensation as a result of reheating, but also affects the texture and taste. It makes meat and vegetables rubbery, flavourless and difficult to cut. Different menus are offered to patients, depending on their needs, and food has to meet nutritional and safety standards. However, Iles-Mann, whose experiences have led him to become a health consumer advocate, says: \u201cThe nutrition is predicated on the patient putting that food in their mouth, and that\u2019s where the problem is. The food is so unappetising, no patient wants to eat it.\u201d A typical hospital meal could consist of chicken, gravy, mashed potatoes and steamed carrots, but the way it tastes and is presented can vary greatly \u2013 in public hospitals it might be tough and rubbery owing to being reheated, and could be served in a single-use plastic dish covered with a plastic dome, with plastic cutlery and even any accompanying fruit placed in its own separate plastic container. However, that meal in a private hospital, and some other public hospitals, could be made fresh and served on china plates with metal cutlery. There is increasing pressure to improve the quality of meals in public hospitals as malnutrition has been linked to worse patient outcomes, according to Adrienne Young, a dietician at Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s hospital and a researcher at the University of Queensland. Queensland does not have a contract outsourcing meal preparation, so public hospitals like Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s are able to prepare meals in their in-house kitchen that have been designed by hospital dietitians. In future, the hospital plans to introduce a \u201cmeals on demand\u201d service, allowing patients to place their order when they feel like eating, similar to hotel room service. This model has already been implemented in some of Australia\u2019s private hospitals. As \u201csomeone who has spent way too much time in hospital, eaten far more of this food than I care to admit, and thrown away even more of it than I am comfortable with\u201d, Iles-Mann warmly welcomes the changes.

Egyptian is a language that is no longer spoken, like Latin. The official language of modern Egypt is Arabic, but the ancient Egyptians spoke their language for 4,000 years \u2013 although it evolved a lot over that time., 2:D - Angkor Wat is a big stone temple, and considered to be the biggest religious structure in the world. It is in Cambodia and is a Hindu-Buddhist temple, built between the 9th and 12th centuries., 3:B - Scientists aren\u2019t 100% sure why bats hang upside down, but this is the most likely theory. Bats need to fall in order to take off. They hang upside down when they\u2019re resting so that when they need to fly, they just drop off their perch, open their wings and fly off., 4:C - The moon\u2019s diameter is about 3,500 kilometres. The Earth is about four times wider than the moon, or, to put it another way, the moon is a quarter of the size of Earth in width., 5:B - There are roughly 650 muscles in the human body. They work with bones to help you move.</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"6\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"5\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">5 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"4\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">4 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"3\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">3 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"2\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">2 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"0\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">0 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"1\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">1 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n    </ol>\n   </div> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.mollyoldfield.co.uk/\">Molly Oldfield</a> hosts <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/everything-under-the-sun/id1442273607?mt=2\">Everything Under the Sun</a>, a podcast answering children\u2019s questions.

This is what voters told me time and again, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/06/kamala-harris-us-elections-donald-trump-victory\">why so many did vote for Trump</a>.</p> <p>The first type of voter I encountered as a volunteer on the Harris phone bank was the one focused purely on the economy. It is hard for people on the European side of the Atlantic to grasp that soaring growth rates and low unemployment in the US would not be seen positively in the eyes of an American voter. But it was clear in my conversations that the Trump campaign was extremely effective at countering that story. Wages may well be rising at all levels, but everyday inflation was more discernible to voters.</p> <p>Very often, I spoke to small business owners who would talk about the price of gas or bread, rendering any attempted explanation of global pressures responsible for that ineffective at best, and at worst condescending. Often, they would also tell me that everyone they knew was doing badly, even if they were just fine themselves. Was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/08/democrats-harris-election\">poor messaging</a> to blame? That didn\u2019t seem obvious. Democrats tried to tell the story of average wages being higher and unemployment being at an historic low, but people just seemed to believe Trump more often than they believed Harris and Tim Walz. There was no easy way to counter that, especially in a campaign lasting barely 100 days.</p> <p>The next group was extremely focused on Harris as a candidate. She was as baggage-free as a vice-president could have been, and many voters spoke of how much they admired her. But there were too many others. Multiple times, I was told that Harris was a \u201ccommunist\u201d, \u201cclueless\u201d and that she had \u201cthrown black men in jail for carrying one blunt\u201d. One Latin American voter told me at length that she had \u201cseen it all before in South America\u201d.</p> <p>Harris\u2019s perceived failures on border security did come up too, but mainly the criticisms came straight from the mouth of the Trump campaign. Some spoke of Harris\u2019s tough stance on crime as the district attorney of San Francisco. Others, very often of Latino origin, would tell me that she was soft on law and order. Quite remarkably, the Trump campaign successfully <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/article/2024/sep/05/communism-meaning-republicans\">branded Harris as both a communist</a> \u2013 lax on law and order \u2013 and simultaneously too tough on crime. To many, she was both an ineffective vice-president and one who had her hands all over the Biden administration. Voters held these facts in their heads at once \u2013 and would not be persuaded otherwise.</p> <p>I started calling voters five weeks ago and especially then, many voters said they didn\u2019t know who Harris was or what she stood for. It is said that an open primary process would have given Harris the chance to separate herself from Biden, but not a single person I spoke to suggested that they would have preferred a different candidate.</p> <p>But gender did play a role. Time and again, voters, very often women themselves, told me that they just didn\u2019t think that \u201cAmerica is ready for a female president\u201d. People said they couldn\u2019t \u201csee her in the chair\u201d and asked if I \u201creally thought a woman could run the country\u201d. One person memorably told me that she couldn\u2019t vote for Harris because \u201cyou don\u2019t see women building skyscrapers\u201d. Sometimes, these people would be persuaded, but more often than not it was a red line. Many conversations would start with positive discussions on policy and then end on Harris and her gender. That is an extraordinary and uncomfortable truth.</p> <p>You should know what I didn\u2019t hear during the hours speaking to US voters. I can only think of one occasion when someone mentioned stricter taxes on billionaires or any similar policies. The atrocities being committed by Israel in Gaza only came up six times in more than 1,000 calls. The idea that Harris was not leftwing enough seems false: the majority of the country just voted for the complete opposite.</p> <p>After all those conversations, I think the main reason that Harris and Walz lost this campaign is simple: Trump. Ultimately, he was simply too much of a pull again. Despite the gaffes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/07/trump-women-misogynist-hatred-american-bodies\">despite his views on women</a>, despite his distaste for democracy and despite an insurrection, voters just didn\u2019t care.</p> <p>For reasons that I\u2019m sure will be studied for decades, when he speaks, people listen.

Vida was about to start a long-awaited bone marrow transplant at a major London hospital, a process requiring an intensive chemotherapy programme that would affect her appetite and ability to eat. We needed to prioritise her weight over healthy eating, said the dietitian. It was mission Calories Over Carrot Sticks. In normal times, this would worry me profoundly.</p> <p>Looking at that tray, it struck me that the food here would probably force anyone to take a nutritional holiday, bone marrow transplant or not. There was a plate of soggy battered fish and some cardboard-looking chips, long\u2011life apple juice, a bag of Quavers, Ambrosia custard, a KitKat and a token easy peeler. Vida wasn\u2019t due to start chemo until the following day, but the fish and chips went untouched. For her first few weeks as an inpatient, I would order her the most basic offerings available in the hospital \u2013 an anaemic-looking omelette, overcooked pasta that collapsed on your tongue, a chicken breast so tough that it could have taken down a man \u2013 but Vida never tried more than a mouthful before pushing the food away.</p> <p>British hospitals are not known for their food, and I know this all too well. Vida was born with a chronic blood disorder which required us to spend a couple of days in hospital for blood transfusions every month for four years, then to live there for six weeks during her bone marrow transplant in 2023, before spending at least two days a week there for almost a year after that. We have learned to have low expectations of the food in the (several) hospitals we use. Unlike many of the families with whom we shared the ward, we live in London, so during the inpatient stay, my husband could easily bring in food in Tupperware to heat up in the microwave; often, too, we\u2019d resort to M&amp;S. We were lucky to have these options.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In Swedish hospitals, food is cooked, often from scratch, on site, and \u2013 refreshingly \u2013 is considered to be \u2018a prioritised part of care\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The UK is not alone in dishing up disappointing meals to hospital patients. As the pictures and stories on these pages show: from Australia to Brazil, Kenya to Spain, the food served in state hospitals, where resources are squeezed, follows a common theme \u2013 unappetising, often bland, and made without the care that any cooking requires, but especially cooking for people whose health is compromised. And yet, it is possible. The simple but delicious offerings at the Kobe Red Cross hospital in Japan are restaurant quality, among them steamed rice with tofu balls or grilled fish with grated radish. In Taiwan, menus change weekly and meals are tailored to the patient, often following the principles of Chinese medicine \u2013 congee, warming soups, steamed vegetables. Meanwhile, in Swedish hospitals, food is cooked, often from scratch, on site, and \u2013 refreshingly \u2013 is considered to be \u201ca prioritised part of care\u201d.</p> <p>There is something wrong with patients being served nutritionally dubious, unappetising meals at the very time they need good food most. It is such a no-brainer to feed people well in hospital. Isn\u2019t good food a health intervention? Well, yes, but as Henry Dimbleby, who led the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jul/15/food-strategy-calls-for-3bn-sugar-and-salt-tax-to-improve-uks-diet\">national food strategy in 2021</a>, told me last month, \u201cquite a lot of the relationship between food and health is chronic\u201d; eating healthily is to some extent a preventive measure, and needs to be woven into the fabric of someone\u2019s lifestyle.</p> <p>\u201cThe NHS is fundamentally drug and intervention based, and not at all prevention based,\u201d Dimbleby says, and in a reactive healthcare system, by the time someone typically reaches hospital, a square meal won\u2019t make much difference \u2013 unlike a prescription or an operation. The exception here is patients like my daughter, who are required to spend prolonged periods in hospital. Ours is a minority cohort. Unlike other examples of institutional catering, like school or prison meals, to which children and inmates are exposed most if not every day, people typically have a fleeting brush with hospital food before returning to their normal routine. It is inexcusably bad, but a novelty, and, like aeroplane food, something to chuckle about later.</p> <p>Dimbleby thinks the dire state of British hospital food is \u201ca reflection of our broader food culture\u201d. He says that while the quality of British food <em>is</em> improving overall \u2013 witness the success of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/14/i-was-overeating-the-zoe-nutrition-app-founders-on-diet-raising-millions-and-the-perfect-microbiome\">Tim Spector\u2019s Zoe app</a>, increased awareness of ultra-processed foods, and more consideration of food sourcing \u2013 there is still a long way to go and, on the whole, institutions are way behind wider society. The government, says Dimbleby, \u201cis very happy to be quite firm about maths in schools, or to advise on hygiene standards in hospitals\u201d, but it is reticent about food, as its immediate benefits are harder to measure. \u201cWe know there are two things that are needed for good health: food and exercise,\u201d says Dimbleby, \u201cbut food is still seen as a woolly thing. Many more people die of <a href=\"https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-leading-causes-of-death\">diet-related disease than from car crashes</a>.\u201d</p>    <p>Naomi Duncan, the CEO of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/sep/20/the-restaurant-chefs-transforming-school-meals-lockdown-coronavirus-challenges#:~:text=It's%20the%20first%20Monday,lunch%20for%20the%20primary%20kids.\">Chefs in Schools</a>, a charity that has set out to revolutionise school catering with \u201cmind-opening, society-changing food\u201d, agrees. She says that across the public sector, we are measuring the wrong things. The key performance indicators, she says, are usually cost, timekeeping and hygiene \u2013 things that are easier to measure than how nourished a meal makes patients feel, or its freshness, or how much love has gone into making it. \u201cWe\u2019re placing markers like health and safety above the nutrition of the food,\u201d she says, \u201crather than measuring the other side, which is the patient looking at the food and thinking: \u2018I can\u2019t eat this.\u2019\u201d In many cases, it might be too late for a single meal to make a difference medically, but comfort food \u2013 a hot plate of something you really want to eat \u2013 brings immeasurable benefits. As Dr Tamal Ray, an NHS anaesthetist and former Great British Bake Off contestant, tells me, \u201cThe psychological side of recovery is a huge part of the physical side. It\u2019s pretty miserable being in hospital, and good food can bring joy and interest.\u201d</p> <p>I am confident that everything I ordered for Vida in hospital met the requisite health and safety standards. Likewise, I\u2019m sure the meals came within budget. But by any other measure, this was not successful catering. It did not nourish her, it did not satisfy her, and while I know someone spent time preparing it, it was hardly made with love. But how could it be when it was almost exclusively outsourced and made by a large catering company? \u201cThere are a small handful of catering companies big enough to handle these huge hospital contracts,\u201d says Duncan, \u201cand if they are willing to take all the financial and health and safety risks, but also have full control of menus and sourcing, that can probably seem like a good deal for hospitals. The problem is, this means hospital leadership don\u2019t think the catering has anything to do with them.\u201d Dimbleby agrees with Duncan that hospitals \u201cdon\u2019t think of food as being part of their service\u201d.</p> <p>Both Duncan and Dimbleby are adamant that good hospital food is possible if those steering the ship make it a priority and work alongside the kitchen to deliver it. The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, a specialised cancer service, operates a tailor-made approach to food for its paediatric patients. \u201cWe have a team of specialist dieticians, on-site chefs and ward-based catering staff, so we can provide bespoke, freshly cooked food for children during their time here,\u201d says Eleanor Bateman, divisional director for cancer services. She tells me about their homemade chicken dippers, the Halloween-inspired drinks, making their own pizza and fruit kebabs, and the hospital\u2019s beloved ice-cream cart, adding, \u201cThe team delight in finding ways to make food fun and ensure patients receive the right diet and nutrition during their cancer journey.\u201d Appetites may well be compromised during and after chemotherapy, but I have no doubt that strategies like these, which engage patients with their food imaginatively and emotionally, and include them in the act of preparing it, accelerate their return to eating \u2013 and their discharge.</p> <p>Dimbleby and Duncan agree that it is very difficult to make decent margins on food. But, as anyone struggling with the cost of living who likes to cook from scratch will know, it is not impossible to make good food cheaply. When food writer Diana Henry was an inpatient at the Whittington hospital in London earlier this year, she posted several photos of her NHS meals on Instagram, often with glowing captions: \u201cMoroccan vegetable tagine and it is delicious,\u201d reads one, \u201cI met the head of catering today \u2026 When he was dealing with teenage cancer sufferers he was able to knock two weeks off their stays in Great Ormond Street because they loved the food. They got better quicker and put on weight. There they had a state-of-the-art kitchen and 15 chefs. Here, he has nothing like that, but he has big plans to improve everything within his resources.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Ideally, we\u2019d do without freezing, but at least it\u2019s being controlled in-house, real ingredients are going in, made by humans into tasty food</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And gold standard hospital food <em>can </em>be profitable, as shown by facilities management consultancy Neller Davies, which has overhauled the food at several hospital trusts since the pandemic \u2013 notably at Ashford and St Peter\u2019s hospitals in Surrey. Prices for staff food dropped by 15%, salads and healthy options became available for \u00a32 or less, and sales increased from \u00a3450,000 a year to a total of over \u00a32m in the first three years. The hospitals are about to roll out a scheme for patient food, too, using small and medium enterprise suppliers. Meanwhile, the new patient catering facility at St Richard\u2019s hospital in Chichester, West Sussex, saw Neller Davies collaborate with the trust\u2019s dietitians to produce up to 6,000 meals a day on site using fresh ingredients, for a range of dietary requirements. These are then frozen. Orders are taken two hours before a meal and heated up slowly. A good measure of the reception this has received is the 50% reduction in food waste. Prue Leith, who was an adviser to the government\u2019s hospital food review, declared it \u201cthe best institutional food [she had] ever eaten\u201d. Duncan says: \u201cIdeally, we\u2019d do without the \u2018freeze\u2019 bit, but at least it\u2019s being controlled in-house, real ingredients are going in, made by humans into tasty food.\u201d Not perfect, maybe, but a far cry from the reheated mini-trays of ready-meals with an orchestra of E numbers.</p> <p>One of the best meals I have eaten this year was at Woodmansterne school in south London; Vida had been readmitted to hospital for a week, and I left her with her dad so I could meet Duncan to see and taste what chef Jake Taylor could do with his sub-\u00a31 food budget for each meal (significantly less than the food budget per meal at most hospitals). I ate a Thai curry with vegetables and bean curd, rice, flatbread, winter leaf salad and ginger cake, and it was all the kind of comfort food I needed after several days on a paediatric ward. What if, I thought, we were able to get food like this at our hospital? It would have changed so much \u2013 and not only for patients, but families, visitors and, importantly, staff. Woodmansterne had its own sizeable kitchen, although not all schools do; similarly, not every hospital has its own catering facilities. This doesn\u2019t need to be an issue, says Duncan, who is piloting a central production model for schools that don\u2019t have a kitchen. It\u2019s just about knowing what travels well.</p> <p>\u201cAcross the public sector, we see food as a risk to be managed \u2013 a safety risk, a financial risk \u2013 not as a tool for health and education,\u201d says Duncan. On this point, I have often thought that most hospital catering is a missed opportunity to introduce patients to how delicious and exciting healthy food can be, irrespective of how long they have to stay. For a nation with <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5901/ldselect/ldmfdo/19/1905.htm\">2.8 million people out of work due to four conditions</a> \u2013 cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, musculoskeletal problems and mental health, \u201cthe first three linked to bad diet and the other exacerbated by it\u201d, says Dimbleby \u2013 people\u2019s captive exposure to institutional catering is a chance to model a new way to eat.</p> <p>Vida\u2019s transplant meant replacing her bone marrow (or \u201cblood factory\u201d) with her brother\u2019s donated stem cells, and involved many potent medications over many months. Her<strong> </strong>\u201cnutritional holiday\u201d involved intravenous feeds, a special milk fed to her through a nasogastric tube, and a lot of marshmallow bribes. She was immunosuppressed and isolated at home for nearly a year, but is now, finally, a happy schoolgirl. Having spent her first five years feeling below par at best, and with very little interest in food, she now has quite the appetite. Her growing love of food is wonderful to see, but also hard work: I often feel we are undoing some of the messages she received about eating in hospital. Perhaps she is no different from other five-year-olds in thinking that her hunger can be satisfied with Haribo sweets, or that chips <em>and</em> crisps followed by ice-cream is a balanced meal, yet I can\u2019t help but feel that her treatment has gone some way to distort her perception of what constitutes healthy food. The memory of those meals doesn\u2019t keep me up at night \u2013 I\u2019m just happy my daughter is here and well \u2013 but the fact that it is possible to do so much more with so little gives me a rumbling dissatisfaction that will not be sated by a bag of Quavers. </p>",

Vida wasn\u2019t due to start chemo until the following day, but the fish and chips went untouched. For her first few weeks as an inpatient, I would order her the most basic offerings available in the hospital \u2013 an anaemic-looking omelette, overcooked pasta that collapsed on your tongue, a chicken breast so tough that it could have taken down a man \u2013 but Vida never tried more than a mouthful before pushing the food away.

And yet, it is possible. The simple but delicious offerings at the Kobe Red Cross hospital in Japan are restaurant quality, among them steamed rice with tofu balls or grilled fish with grated radish. In Taiwan, menus change weekly and meals are tailored to the patient, often following the principles of Chinese medicine \u2013 congee, warming soups, steamed vegetables.

It is inexcusably bad, but a novelty, and, like aeroplane food, something to chuckle about later. Dimbleby thinks the dire state of British hospital food is \u201ca reflection of our broader food culture\u201d. He says that while the quality of British food is improving overall \u2013 witness the success of Tim Spector\u2019s Zoe app, increased awareness of ultra-processed foods, and more consideration of food sourcing \u2013 there is still a long way to go and, on the whole, institutions are way behind wider society. The government, says Dimbleby, \u201cis very happy to be quite firm about maths in schools, or to advise on hygiene standards in hospitals\u201d, but it is reticent about food, as its immediate benefits are harder to measure. \u201cWe know there are two things that are needed for good health: food and exercise,\u201d says Dimbleby, \u201cbut food is still seen as a woolly thing. Many more people die of diet-related disease than from car crashes.\u201d Naomi Duncan, the CEO of Chefs in Schools, a charity that has set out to revolutionise school catering with \u201cmind-opening, society-changing food\u201d, agrees. She says that across the public sector, we are measuring the wrong things. The key performance indicators, she says, are usually cost, timekeeping and hygiene \u2013 things that are easier to measure than how nourished a meal makes patients feel, or its freshness, or how much love has gone into making it. \u201cWe\u2019re placing markers like health and safety above the nutrition of the food,\u201d she says, \u201crather than measuring the other side, which is the patient looking at the food and thinking: \u2018I can\u2019t eat this.\u2019\u201d In many cases, it might be too late for a single meal to make a difference medically, but comfort food \u2013 a hot plate of something you really want to eat \u2013 brings immeasurable benefits. As Dr Tamal Ray, an NHS anaesthetist and former Great British Bake Off contestant, tells me, \u201cThe psychological side of recovery is a huge part of the physical side. It\u2019s pretty miserable being in hospital, and good food can bring joy and interest.\u201d I am confident that everything I ordered for Vida in hospital met the requisite health and safety standards. Likewise, I\u2019m sure the meals came within budget. But by any other measure, this was not successful catering. It did not nourish her, it did not satisfy her, and while I know someone spent time preparing it, it was hardly made with love. But how could it be when it was almost exclusively outsourced and made by a large catering company? \u201cThere are a small handful of catering companies big enough to handle these huge hospital contracts,\u201d says Duncan, \u201cand if they are willing to take all the financial and health and safety risks, but also have full control of menus and sourcing, that can probably seem like a good deal for hospitals. The problem is, this means hospital leadership don\u2019t think the catering has anything to do with them.\u201d Dimbleby agrees with Duncan that hospitals \u201cdon\u2019t think of food as being part of their service\u201d. Both Duncan and Dimbleby are adamant that good hospital food is possible if those steering the ship make it a priority and work alongside the kitchen to deliver it. The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, a specialised cancer service, operates a tailor-made approach to food for its paediatric patients. \u201cWe have a team of specialist dieticians, on-site chefs and ward-based catering staff, so we can provide bespoke, freshly cooked food for children during their time here,\u201d says Eleanor Bateman, divisional director for cancer services. She tells me about their homemade chicken dippers, the Halloween-inspired drinks, making their own pizza and fruit kebabs, and the hospital\u2019s beloved ice-cream cart, adding, \u201cThe team delight in finding ways to make food fun and ensure patients receive the right diet and nutrition during their cancer journey.\u201d Appetites may well be compromised during and after chemotherapy, but I have no doubt that strategies like these, which engage patients with their food imaginatively and emotionally, and include them in the act of preparing it, accelerate their return to eating \u2013 and their discharge. Dimbleby and Duncan agree that it is very difficult to make decent margins on food. But, as anyone struggling with the cost of living who likes to cook from scratch will know, it is not impossible to make good food cheaply. When food writer Diana Henry was an inpatient at the Whittington hospital in London earlier this year, she posted several photos of her NHS meals on Instagram, often with glowing captions: \u201cMoroccan vegetable tagine and it is delicious,\u201d reads one, \u201cI met the head of catering today \u2026 When he was dealing with teenage cancer sufferers he was able to knock two weeks off their stays in Great Ormond Street because they loved the food. They got better quicker and put on weight. There they had a state-of-the-art kitchen and 15 chefs. Here, he has nothing like that, but he has big plans to improve everything within his resources.\u201d And gold standard hospital food can be profitable, as shown by facilities management consultancy Neller Davies, which has overhauled the food at several hospital trusts since the pandemic \u2013 notably at Ashford and St Peter\u2019s hospitals in Surrey. Prices for staff food dropped by 15%, salads and healthy options became available for \u00a32 or less, and sales increased from \u00a3450,000 a year to a total of over \u00a32m in the first three years. The hospitals are about to roll out a scheme for patient food, too, using small and medium enterprise suppliers. Meanwhile, the new patient catering facility at St Richard\u2019s hospital in Chichester, West Sussex, saw Neller Davies collaborate with the trust\u2019s dietitians to produce up to 6,000 meals a day on site using fresh ingredients, for a range of dietary requirements. These are then frozen. Orders are taken two hours before a meal and heated up slowly. A good measure of the reception this has received is the 50% reduction in food waste. Prue Leith, who was an adviser to the government\u2019s hospital food review, declared it \u201cthe best institutional food [she had] ever eaten\u201d. Duncan says: \u201cIdeally, we\u2019d do without the \u2018freeze\u2019 bit, but at least it\u2019s being controlled in-house, real ingredients are going in, made by humans into tasty food.\u201d Not perfect, maybe, but a far cry from the reheated mini-trays of ready-meals with an orchestra of E numbers. One of the best meals I have eaten this year was at Woodmansterne school in south London; Vida had been readmitted to hospital for a week, and I left her with her dad so I could meet Duncan to see and taste what chef Jake Taylor could do with his sub-\u00a31 food budget for each meal (significantly less than the food budget per meal at most hospitals). I ate a Thai curry with vegetables and bean curd, rice, flatbread, winter leaf salad and ginger cake, and it was all the kind of comfort food I needed after several days on a paediatric ward. What if, I thought, we were able to get food like this at our hospital? It would have changed so much \u2013 and not only for patients, but families, visitors and, importantly, staff. Woodmansterne had its own sizeable kitchen, although not all schools do; similarly, not every hospital has its own catering facilities. This doesn\u2019t need to be an issue, says Duncan, who is piloting a central production model for schools that don\u2019t have a kitchen. It\u2019s just about knowing what travels well. \u201cAcross the public sector, we see food as a risk to be managed \u2013 a safety risk, a financial risk \u2013 not as a tool for health and education,\u201d says Duncan. On this point, I have often thought that most hospital catering is a missed opportunity to introduce patients to how delicious and exciting healthy food can be, irrespective of how long they have to stay. For a nation with 2.8 million people out of work due to four conditions \u2013 cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, musculoskeletal problems and mental health, \u201cthe first three linked to bad diet and the other exacerbated by it\u201d, says Dimbleby \u2013 people\u2019s captive exposure to institutional catering is a chance to model a new way to eat. Vida\u2019s transplant meant replacing her bone marrow (or \u201cblood factory\u201d) with her brother\u2019s donated stem cells, and involved many potent medications over many months. Her \u201cnutritional holiday\u201d involved intravenous feeds, a special milk fed to her through a nasogastric tube, and a lot of marshmallow bribes. She was immunosuppressed and isolated at home for nearly a year, but is now, finally, a happy schoolgirl. Having spent her first five years feeling below par at best, and with very little interest in food, she now has quite the appetite. Her growing love of food is wonderful to see, but also hard work: I often feel we are undoing some of the messages she received about eating in hospital. Perhaps she is no different from other five-year-olds in thinking that her hunger can be satisfied with Haribo sweets, or that chips and crisps followed by ice-cream is a balanced meal, yet I can\u2019t help but feel that her treatment has gone some way to distort her perception of what constitutes healthy food. The memory of those meals doesn\u2019t keep me up at night \u2013 I\u2019m just happy my daughter is here and well \u2013 but the fact that it is possible to do so much more with so little gives me a rumbling dissatisfaction that will not be sated by a bag of Quavers.",

You tell yourself you\u2019re lucky. The work can be fun. We\u2019re hardly junior doctors, we\u2019re not in a war zone. But working through breakfast, lunch and dinner. Rewriting scripts until the early hours, back on set at 8am. Having zero down time. Well, it\u2019s not right, is it?</p> <p>The industry relies on the work ethic and passion of freelancers \u2013 it would not exist without us \u2013 and we\u2019re bullied into fearing for future employment opportunities if we complain.</p> <p>Our show has been massively underbudgeted. We don\u2019t have enough staff. We don\u2019t have anywhere near enough time to do anything properly. But as seems to be the case with every broadcaster these days, expectations aren\u2019t budging, and our commissioner is dogged.</p> <p>I get emails at all hours of the day and night. On weekends. Constantly told how disappointed our commissioner is that the show we have made for 50p doesn\u2019t look like a Hollywood blockbuster. Refusing to sign off on creative decisions until the very last minute, despite knowing the repercussions on working hours for the team. But it\u2019s not like I wasn\u2019t expecting it \u2013 they are well known as a tyrant, and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with others like them for other channels over the years.

OK, I get the occasional day off; but I\u2019m working 14\u2013 to 16-hour days for months on end (still no overtime!). I don\u2019t have a big enough team. We aren\u2019t being given enough time. I\u2019m doing the job of three people. And we\u2019re still facing the full force of the commissioner when things aren\u2019t perfect \u2013 and <em>of course</em> they\u2019re not perfect, given the circumstances.

      "bodyText": "\u201cHave chest pains. If I die, these are the stats: I have worked 16 days in a row and worked every waking minute for 18 hours of every day. Sue the fuck out of the BBC.\u201d These are the words I text to my partner, whil taking yet another deep breath, trying not to panic, attempting to remain focused on the job in hand \u2013 leading a large cast and crew shooting a new BBC series for a leading independent production company. The irony that my role as a senior member of the production team includes a drummed-in responsibility for the duty of care of cast and crew is not lost on me. We have to \u2013 quite rightly \u2013 work around strict working hours for minors among the cast. The crew manning heavy equipment \u2013 quite rightly \u2013 need regular breaks. The big-name presenter has \u2013 quite cleverly \u2013 had working hour conditions attached to their bumper contract. But the rest of us: freelance producers, researchers, production managers, production coordinators, well the buck stops with us. If we don\u2019t put the hours in, the show doesn\u2019t get made. We can\u2019t just clock off. We ignore all health and safety responsibilities when it comes to ourselves. And we don\u2019t get paid overtime. It\u2019s just the way it\u2019s always been. But against a backdrop of an advertising downturn, budget cuts, higher costs, fewer shows being commissioned, and greater competition from streamers and social media channels, the situation is getting worse. Having worked in the TV industry for more than 20 years, I\u2019m used to the brutal hours of work. You tell yourself you\u2019re lucky. The work can be fun. We\u2019re hardly junior doctors, we\u2019re not in a war zone. But working through breakfast, lunch and dinner. Rewriting scripts until the early hours, back on set at 8am. Having zero down time. Well, it\u2019s not right, is it? The industry relies on the work ethic and passion of freelancers \u2013 it would not exist without us \u2013 and we\u2019re bullied into fearing for future employment opportunities if we complain. Our show has been massively underbudgeted. We don\u2019t have enough staff. We don\u2019t have anywhere near enough time to do anything properly. But as seems to be the case with every broadcaster these days, expectations aren\u2019t budging, and our commissioner is dogged. I get emails at all hours of the day and night. On weekends. Constantly told how disappointed our commissioner is that the show we have made for 50p doesn\u2019t look like a Hollywood blockbuster. Refusing to sign off on creative decisions until the very last minute, despite knowing the repercussions on working hours for the team. But it\u2019s not like I wasn\u2019t expecting it \u2013 they are well known as a tyrant, and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with others like them for other channels over the years. At least my bosses at the production company appreciate we\u2019re working miracles \u2013 although they clearly don\u2019t appreciate it enough to take the financial hit of extending our schedule. Postproduction (the edit) is even worse than the shoot. OK, I get the occasional day off; but I\u2019m working 14\u2013 to 16-hour days for months on end (still no overtime!). I don\u2019t have a big enough team. We aren\u2019t being given enough time. I\u2019m doing the job of three people. And we\u2019re still facing the full force of the commissioner when things aren\u2019t perfect \u2013 and of course they\u2019re not perfect, given the circumstances. I\u2019m good at my job. I\u2019ve been nominated for and won major industry awards. I know how to make a good show. I also know when the odds are not in our favour. If there\u2019s one thing you really need when you\u2019re abandoning your family, risking physical and mental health for the job, it\u2019s a bit of appreciation. To instead get a kick in the teeth, is well, a kick in the teeth.

These days it can also come with a hefty price&nbsp;tag.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the cost of drinks or dinner to consider. Before you\u2019ve even got to the awkward, age-old dance of who is going to foot the bill, you might have already forked out hundreds of pounds on a dating site to be in with the shot for a date.</p> <h2>What do the apps cost?</h2> <p>While some dating services are free, many now include tempting extra features that they claim will help you find more compatible connections, get noticed sooner and go on more dates. All for a small fee, of course. We looked at what the main ones offer.</p> <p><strong>Tinder</strong></p>    <p>It is free but you can upgrade to the paid version \u201cfor an enhanced Tinder experience\u201d, its website says.</p> <p>Tinder\u2019s press team wouldn\u2019t share exact figures, but told us prices start at \u00a37 and go up to about \u00a350 a month.</p> <p>There are three subscription tiers offered at different prices: plus, gold or platinum. In 2021, the plus option ranged from \u00a34.99 to \u00a319.94 a month, gold was found to cost between \u00a313.99 to \u00a329.49, and platinum \u00a318.14 to \u00a336.49.</p> <p>Previously different users have been charged different prices based on <a href=\"https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/tinders-unfair-pricing-algorithm-exposed-adCwG8b7VRYo\">factors including their age</a>, as an investigation by the consumer group Which? found.</p> <p>Age-based pricing was eliminated by Tinder in 2022 and the company says that its promotional rates now vary based on factors like location or length of subscription.</p> <p><strong>Hinge<br></strong>With the regular, free version of the app, you can send eight likes a day and message someone you have matched. It claims you\u2019ll go on at least twice as many dates with its two paid-for subscriptions.</p> <p>Hinge+ costs \u00a314.99 for a week, \u00a324.99 for one month, \u00a349.99 for three months and \u00a374.99 for six months.</p> <p>One week of HingeX costs \u00a324.99, a month is \u00a344.99, three months \u00a389.99 and six months comes in at \u00a3129.99. </p>    <p><strong>Muzz<br></strong>There are more than 1.5 million monthly active users on Muzz, the marriage and dating app aimed at Muslim singles claims. About 90% don\u2019t pay. Some opt for the gold membership to try to increase their chances of finding someone they\u2019re compatible with. It costs \u00a329 a month, or \u00a369 for three months.</p> <p>It takes, on average, six months for people to find a partner and leave the site. With gold membership, the average is about three months. That comes in at \u00a369 if you buy the three-month package, or \u00a387 if you stick to the monthly rolling plan.</p> <p><strong>Eharmony<br></strong>The basic membership is free, and gets you unlimited matches, but your messaging is limited.</p> <p>Eharmony wouldn\u2019t say how much premium membership options cost, so we set up an account to get an idea.

      "bodyText": "Putting yourself out there always comes at a cost: you have to be vulnerable, open yourself up and risk rejection. These days it can also come with a hefty price tag. It\u2019s not just the cost of drinks or dinner to consider. Before you\u2019ve even got to the awkward, age-old dance of who is going to foot the bill, you might have already forked out hundreds of pounds on a dating site to be in with the shot for a date. What do the apps cost? While some dating services are free, many now include tempting extra features that they claim will help you find more compatible connections, get noticed sooner and go on more dates. All for a small fee, of course. We looked at what the main ones offer. Tinder It is free but you can upgrade to the paid version \u201cfor an enhanced Tinder experience\u201d, its website says. Tinder\u2019s press team wouldn\u2019t share exact figures, but told us prices start at \u00a37 and go up to about \u00a350 a month. There are three subscription tiers offered at different prices: plus, gold or platinum. In 2021, the plus option ranged from \u00a34.99 to \u00a319.94 a month, gold was found to cost between \u00a313.99 to \u00a329.49, and platinum \u00a318.14 to \u00a336.49. Previously different users have been charged different prices based on factors including their age, as an investigation by the consumer group Which? found. Age-based pricing was eliminated by Tinder in 2022 and the company says that its promotional rates now vary based on factors like location or length of subscription. Hinge With the regular, free version of the app, you can send eight likes a day and message someone you have matched. It claims you\u2019ll go on at least twice as many dates with its two paid-for subscriptions. Hinge+ costs \u00a314.99 for a week, \u00a324.99 for one month, \u00a349.99 for three months and \u00a374.99 for six months. One week of HingeX costs \u00a324.99, a month is \u00a344.99, three months \u00a389.99 and six months comes in at \u00a3129.99. Muzz There are more than 1.5 million monthly active users on Muzz, the marriage and dating app aimed at Muslim singles claims. About 90% don\u2019t pay. Some opt for the gold membership to try to increase their chances of finding someone they\u2019re compatible with. It costs \u00a329 a month, or \u00a369 for three months. It takes, on average, six months for people to find a partner and leave the site. With gold membership, the average is about three months. That comes in at \u00a369 if you buy the three-month package, or \u00a387 if you stick to the monthly rolling plan. Eharmony The basic membership is free, and gets you unlimited matches, but your messaging is limited. Eharmony wouldn\u2019t say how much premium membership options cost, so we set up an account to get an idea. The premium light subscription is a six-month plan with a \u00a325.99 monthly cost. Premium plus is a 12-month plan, and offers the same features, but costs \u00a313.90 a month. Premium extra is a 24-month plan, and comes in at \u00a39.90 a month. Our profile was offered 50% off all the above options for the first three months. Match.com It\u2019s free to join and you can create a profile and access a selection of profiles without a paid-for subscription. However, you can only send and receive messages if you are a subscriber. Match wouldn\u2019t give the Guardian a breakdown of membership costs, but according to its website, it starts at \u00a39.99 a month and memberships are available in three-, six- and 12-month options. On an online chatroom, one member said a six-month membership cost them about \u00a310 a month (\u00a359.99), whereas it is \u00a330 for one month. Jdate This online dating service is aimed at Jewish singles. For one month, it costs \u00a339.99, three months comes in at \u00a389.97 (\u00a329.99 a month), and six months costs \u00a3119.94 (\u00a319.99 a month). According to James Jones, the head of consumer affairs at the credit reference company Experian, having a clear view of what is affordable when it comes to dating apps is important. \u201cIf you know a free app or basic version of a popular app is sufficient for your needs, then don\u2019t feel pressurised into paying for a premium service that you might not need,\u201d he says.

      "bodyText": "MPs with experience in mental health have urged the government to introduce statutory regulation for all psychotherapists and counsellors, warning that the current system is leaving people vulnerable to harm. Unlike most other healthcare roles, \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d and \u201ccounsellor\u201d are not protected titles nor statutorily regulated professions in the UK. Only art therapists and art psychotherapists, drama therapists and music therapists are protected titles. This means that anyone can set themselves up as a therapist without qualifications, and can continue to practise after misconduct. MPs with personal experience of mental ill-health told the Guardian that appropriate regulation was more important than ever given the growing demand for mental health support. The Labour MP Chris Webb said he backed statutory regulation as a result of his experiences as a former mental health charity trustee and supporting a family member through a breakdown. \u201cI\u2019ve seen from individuals that have come to our charity, and since come into my casework bag, where they\u2019ve gone to organisations across our town, and people who said they\u2019re able to give that kind of mental health support, but weren\u2019t regulated, have made things worse,\u201d he said. While sometimes this could be predatory, in most case the problem was \u201cpeople wanting to help\u201d but not having the training to do so, he said. He added that statutory regulation was vital to ensure protection was in place for vulnerable people. Webb said that in his constituency of Blackpool South there had been problems with doctors informally referring patients to charities because waiting lists were so long. The patients then found out \u201cthe support they\u2019re going to get is not up to scratch and can\u2019t deal with the problems they have\u201d. At the charity where he was a trustee, Counselling in the Community, people assumed they were an \u201cextension of the NHS\u201d. Webb will be an officer on the all-party parliamentary group on mental health when it is reconstituted, and said statutory regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors would be one of the first items of business. Rachael Maskell, the former co-chair of the APPG on mental health, has laid the groundwork for this by writing to the secretary of state, who has not yet responded. The Labour MP Nadia Whittome, who has spoken out about her experience of post-traumatic stress disorder, urged the government to \u201clegislate to ensure that all psychotherapists are regulated\u201d. \u201cAnyone who has undergone psychotherapy will know just how affecting a process it can be,\u201d she said, adding that recent lawsuits and complaints demonstrated the dangers. \u201cWhile most people will have a positive experience, the fact that the profession is not subject to statutory regulation leaves people vulnerable to malpractice, misconduct and abuse,\u201d she said. Several professional bodies, including the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP), operate a voluntary register, requiring a minimum level of training on recognised courses, and offer complaints processes. Danny Chambers, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for mental health, said it was \u201cdeeply distressing\u201d that the system appears to have resulted in an increase in the number of vulnerable people being taken advantage of by unregulated therapists. \u201cThose seeking mental health support should be able to trust that their therapists meet a minimum safe standard of practice. The public must be assured that their wellbeing is in the hands of qualified, ethical professionals. \u201cThe government must act swiftly, in collaboration with regulatory bodies and accredited mental health professionals, to ensure abusers are not permitted to continue practising and that patients are protected from rogue actors,\u201d he said. Helen Morgan, the Lib Dem health spokesperson, said this \u201cisn\u2019t something we should be seeing in a country that has well-regarded structures in place for other types of medical professional, and it\u2019s really essential that we regulate in a sensible way this type of provision\u201d. She called for a \u201cclampdown\u201d on people posing as therapists without appropriate credentials, adding that the government \u201cneeds to act swiftly in order to make sure people aren\u2019t able to continue practising where they\u2019ve caused harm, and that patients are protected\u201d. While most psychotherapy and counselling bodies want to see the detail of any statutory regulation before backing it, and are concerned it could hamper practitioners\u2019 freedom to develop relationships with their patients, other mental health professional associations have also backed calls for greater regulation. Meg Moss, the head of policy at the National Counselling and Psychotherapy Society, said statutory regulation could do significant harm to \u201ccounselling provision and diversity\u201d, and that abusers could move \u201cfrom regulated to unregulated titles with ease\u201d. She suggested the easiest solution would be \u201cto enact legislation that allows for protection of title via accredited registers\u201d, such as the NCPS and BACP. Mike Wang, the chair of the Association of Clinical Psychologists, said the organisation was \u201chighly supportive of greater regulation of practitioners within mental health\u201d. Prof John Crichton, the treasurer of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said it supported regulation \u201cin the same way that doctors are overseen by the General Medical Council, nurses by the Nursing and Midwifery Council and practitioner psychologists and arts therapists by the Health and Care Professions Council\u201d. A government spokesperson said: \u201cTaking advantage of someone who is seeking help while at their most vulnerable is reprehensible and we would urge anyone affected to come forward so those responsible can face justice. \u201cAnyone seeking therapy deserves to have confidence and trust in their healthcare professional, which is why we urge the use of qualified practitioners accredited by the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care. To meet the standards for PSA accreditation, an organisation must have a focus on public protection and robust processes for handling complaints against practitioners.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In 1964 the new US president was angry about European trade. Specifically about chickens. In response to Europe\u2019s poultry trade barriers, Lyndon B Johnson imposed a 25% tariff on light trucks.</p> <p>That \u201cchicken tax\u201d is still in place 60 years later. The rules have contributed to the Ford\u2019s F-Series pickup truck\u2019s <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2023/12/28/ford-f-series--america-s-best-selling-truck-for-47-years-and-cou.html\">unbroken 42-year run</a> as the bestselling vehicle in the US, and have locked European manufacturers out of a hugely profitable market for two generations. The chicken tax could also serve as a model for Donald Trump\u2019s second term in the White House.</p> <p>The US president-elect\u2019s promise of imposing baseline tariffs of 10% on all goods imports has already sent shivers around the world\u2019s manufacturers. Few industries are more exposed than Germany\u2019s carmakers: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/06/german-carmakers-shares-slump-fear-trump-tariffs\">the share prices of Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche have dropped</a> by between 4% and 7% since it became clear on Wednesday morning that Trump would win the US presidency.</p> <p>Tariffs are applied on the cost of goods when imported. If a 10% tariff were then passed on to American buyers, Audi\u2019s US bestseller, the Q5 SUV, would cost about $3,500 extra on top of its $45,400 starting price.</p> <p>But just when German industry needs a strong advocate, its government has fallen into turmoil. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/08/germany-coalition-odd-throuple-fiscal-policy-squabble\">coalition led by the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, collapsed</a> on Wednesday after three years in power, casting doubt over who will lead Europe\u2019s largest economy as the EU prepares for trade negotiations with Trump.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s love of tariffs is no secret. He recently told Bloomberg: \u201cTo me the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff.\u201d And he has been categorical about his intentions to slap tariffs on EU imports.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t take our cars, they don\u2019t take our farm products, don\u2019t take anything. You have a $312bn deficit with the EU. You know, the EU is a mini \u2013 but not so mini \u2013 is a mini-China,\u201d Trump said during his campaign.</p> <p>The German car industry would immediately be affected by tariffs, compounding an already dire situation for the likes of VW which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/03/volkswagen-cuts-plan-sends-shock-through-the-detroit-of-east-germany\">wrestling with deep cost cuts.</a> The US is VW\u2019s second largest export market after China; the group sold 713,000 vehicles in the US in 2023 of which 243,000 were manufactured in Germany, primarily premium and luxury vehicles.</p>    <p>Hildegard M\u00fcller, the president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), said the US remained \u201cvery important for Germany as a production location\u201d.</p> <p>However, she noted that the US \u201chas been increasingly focusing on its own interests for several years now, and this trend will probably continue\u201d.</p> <p>M\u00fcller called on Berlin and Brussels to \u201cbuild on their joint strengths with the US in economic policy\u201d to create prosperity between allies on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>In the same way as China has begun investing in Europe \u2013 particularly in Hungary \u2013 Germany has been investing in the US as it became more protectionist under Trump 1.0 and Joe Biden. Last year a record 908,000 German-branded vehicles were manufactured in the US, half of which were exported.</p> <p>Carmakers\u2019 responses to tariffs will depend to a certain extent on their factory footprints. The BMW chief executive, Oliver Zipse, shrugged off the tariff threat on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cIn the United States, I would think we almost have a perfect setup for the time to come,\u201d he said, arguing that BMW already made its most popular US-market cars there. \u201cThere is some natural cover up against possible tariffs or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the German car manufacturers\u2019 existing factories in the US do not appear to have readily available spare capacity to simply absorb production shifted from Germany to avoid tariffs.</p> <p>Volkswagen had capacity for another 20,000 cars on top of the 160,000 produced last year at its sole US car plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, according to the automotive data company MarkLines.</p> <p>Mercedes-Benz has about the same spare capacity in Alabama, where it made 280,000 cars in 2023. BMW might be able to produce another 40,000 in South Carolina on top of last year\u2019s production level of 410,000.</p>    <p>Even if carmakers can shift production to the US \u2013 to the likely delight of Trump \u2013 it would horrify many Germans. About 780,000 people are employed in the politically powerful German automotive industry. They will not let work move abroad without a fight.</p> <p>\u201cIt will lead to shifts in production,\u201d said Rico Luman, an economist at ING, an investment bank. \u201cIt may get more regionalised also from a strategic point of view. That\u2019s not good news for the sector in Germany.\u201d</p> <p>The tariff threat could hardly come at a worse time for German workers, with manufacturers across the world complaining of falling profits, and Europe dealing with a flood of electric vehicles from China. Volkswagen \u2013 already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/28/volkswagen-shut-three-factories-cut-thousands-jobs-union\">planning to close German factories</a> for the first time ever \u2013 is particularly vulnerable.</p> <p>Its Audi and Porsche subsidiaries have big US sales but no factories there, and VW imports thousands of its smaller, cheaper cars from Germany. Morningstar DBRS, a credit rating agency, said starting more American production was \u201ca transition that would likely be costly and take years to become operational\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s victory has therefore rattled German trade unions.

      "bodyText": "In 1964 the new US president was angry about European trade. Specifically about chickens. In response to Europe\u2019s poultry trade barriers, Lyndon B Johnson imposed a 25% tariff on light trucks. That \u201cchicken tax\u201d is still in place 60 years later. The rules have contributed to the Ford\u2019s F-Series pickup truck\u2019s unbroken 42-year run as the bestselling vehicle in the US, and have locked European manufacturers out of a hugely profitable market for two generations. The chicken tax could also serve as a model for Donald Trump\u2019s second term in the White House. The US president-elect\u2019s promise of imposing baseline tariffs of 10% on all goods imports has already sent shivers around the world\u2019s manufacturers. Few industries are more exposed than Germany\u2019s carmakers: the share prices of Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche have dropped by between 4% and 7% since it became clear on Wednesday morning that Trump would win the US presidency. Tariffs are applied on the cost of goods when imported. If a 10% tariff were then passed on to American buyers, Audi\u2019s US bestseller, the Q5 SUV, would cost about $3,500 extra on top of its $45,400 starting price. But just when German industry needs a strong advocate, its government has fallen into turmoil. The coalition led by the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, collapsed on Wednesday after three years in power, casting doubt over who will lead Europe\u2019s largest economy as the EU prepares for trade negotiations with Trump. Trump\u2019s love of tariffs is no secret. He recently told Bloomberg: \u201cTo me the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff.\u201d And he has been categorical about his intentions to slap tariffs on EU imports. \u201cThey don\u2019t take our cars, they don\u2019t take our farm products, don\u2019t take anything. You have a $312bn deficit with the EU. You know, the EU is a mini \u2013 but not so mini \u2013 is a mini-China,\u201d Trump said during his campaign. The German car industry would immediately be affected by tariffs, compounding an already dire situation for the likes of VW which is wrestling with deep cost cuts. The US is VW\u2019s second largest export market after China; the group sold 713,000 vehicles in the US in 2023 of which 243,000 were manufactured in Germany, primarily premium and luxury vehicles. Hildegard M\u00fcller, the president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), said the US remained \u201cvery important for Germany as a production location\u201d. However, she noted that the US \u201chas been increasingly focusing on its own interests for several years now, and this trend will probably continue\u201d. M\u00fcller called on Berlin and Brussels to \u201cbuild on their joint strengths with the US in economic policy\u201d to create prosperity between allies on both sides of the Atlantic. In the same way as China has begun investing in Europe \u2013 particularly in Hungary \u2013 Germany has been investing in the US as it became more protectionist under Trump 1.0 and Joe Biden. Last year a record 908,000 German-branded vehicles were manufactured in the US, half of which were exported. Carmakers\u2019 responses to tariffs will depend to a certain extent on their factory footprints. The BMW chief executive, Oliver Zipse, shrugged off the tariff threat on Wednesday. \u201cIn the United States, I would think we almost have a perfect setup for the time to come,\u201d he said, arguing that BMW already made its most popular US-market cars there. \u201cThere is some natural cover up against possible tariffs or whatever.\u201d Yet the German car manufacturers\u2019 existing factories in the US do not appear to have readily available spare capacity to simply absorb production shifted from Germany to avoid tariffs. Volkswagen had capacity for another 20,000 cars on top of the 160,000 produced last year at its sole US car plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, according to the automotive data company MarkLines. Mercedes-Benz has about the same spare capacity in Alabama, where it made 280,000 cars in 2023. BMW might be able to produce another 40,000 in South Carolina on top of last year\u2019s production level of 410,000. Even if carmakers can shift production to the US \u2013 to the likely delight of Trump \u2013 it would horrify many Germans. About 780,000 people are employed in the politically powerful German automotive industry. They will not let work move abroad without a fight. \u201cIt will lead to shifts in production,\u201d said Rico Luman, an economist at ING, an investment bank. \u201cIt may get more regionalised also from a strategic point of view. That\u2019s not good news for the sector in Germany.\u201d The tariff threat could hardly come at a worse time for German workers, with manufacturers across the world complaining of falling profits, and Europe dealing with a flood of electric vehicles from China. Volkswagen \u2013 already planning to close German factories for the first time ever \u2013 is particularly vulnerable. Its Audi and Porsche subsidiaries have big US sales but no factories there, and VW imports thousands of its smaller, cheaper cars from Germany. Morningstar DBRS, a credit rating agency, said starting more American production was \u201ca transition that would likely be costly and take years to become operational\u201d. Trump\u2019s victory has therefore rattled German trade unions. IG Metall, which will play a key role in the VW negotiations, said the US election was \u201ca clear message to Germany and Europe to further develop their own strengths, resilient relationships with each other and with other countries\u201d. The union said Germany\u2019s government needed to invest to strengthen industry \u2013 a distant prospect, with its own election likely in March. It is not just German carmakers who will be watching Trump nervously, with a threat of 100% tariffs on imports to the US from its free-trade partner Mexico. The three big carmakers in Detroit are General Motors, Ford and the Chrysler owner Stellantis (which also imports cars from European brands such as Peugeot and Fiat).

      "bodyText": "There is a \u201cstrong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas\u201d of the northern Gaza Strip, a committee of global food security experts warned on Friday, as Israel claims to be pursuing a military offensive against Palestinian militant group Hamas in the area. \u201cImmediate action, within days not weeks, is required from all actors who are directly taking part in the conflict, or have influence on its conduct, to avert and alleviate this catastrophic situation,\u201d the independent Famine Review Committee (FRC) said in a rare alert. The warning comes just days ahead of a US deadline for Israel to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which the UN said almost a year ago had been made \u201cuninhabitable\u201d by Israeli attacks, or face potential restrictions on US military aid. The Biden administration has previously demanded that Israel allow in more aid but done little to enforce its requests, even reportedly ignoring its own agencies after they concluded that Israel had deliberately blocked deliveries of food and medicine to Gaza. US law requires that weapons shipments be cut off to countries that prevent the delivery of US-backed aid. Israel\u2019s mission to the UN in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Reuters reported. \u201cIf no effective action is taken by stakeholders with influence, the scale of this looming catastrophe is likely to dwarf anything we have seen so far in the Gaza Strip since 7 October 2023,\u201d the FRC committee said. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates there are between 75,000 and 95,000 people still in northern Gaza. The Famine Review Committee said it could be \u201cassumed that starvation, malnutrition, and excess mortality due to malnutrition and disease, are rapidly increasing\u201d in north Gaza. \u201cFamine thresholds may have already been crossed or else will be in the near future,\u201d the global hunger monitor said. The US has said it is watching to ensure that its ally\u2019s actions on the ground show it does not have a \u201cpolicy of starvation\u201d in the north, parts of which Israel has placed under a tight siege as part of what it claims is a military push against Hamas. However, Palestinians as well as Israeli human rights groups and some Israel Defence Forces soldiers say Israel is putting into practice a blueprint known as the \u201cgenerals\u2019 plan\u201d, a \u201csurrender or starve\u201d campaign aimed at depopulating northern Gaza. Israel denies it is carrying out the plan, but earlier this week a military official told reporters it had \u201cno intention\u201d of allowing Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has suggested that the ethnic cleansing of Gaza by Israel had been prevented until now only by its people\u2019s refusal to succumb to the intense pressure to flee their homes and by Arab resolve not to accept mass population transfers. And while resettling or permanently reoccupying Gaza is not official Israeli policy, senior Israeli defence officials recently told the Israeli daily Haaretz that with no other alternatives on the table, the government is aiming to annex large parts of the territory. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on hospitals, school and homes sheltering already displaced people in the area, which many have been unable to flee. More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza, according to local health officials, though experts say the true figure is likely to be much higher. Thousands are believed to remain buried under the rubble and tens of thousands more have been wounded. It is not possible to verify the death toll independently as Israel does not allow foreign journalists in but according to a UN analysis of verified deaths released on Friday, nearly 70% of the people killed in the war in Gaza have been women and children. At least 14 civilians were killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza late on Friday and early on Saturday, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. At least nine people were killed when Israeli fighter jets bombed tents housing displaced people in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. Al Jazeera reported that women and children were among the dead and that the tents were in the al-Mawasi area, which Israel has designated a \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d although it has repeatedly attacked it. Another five were killed and others wounded when Israeli forces targeted a school housing displaced people in Gaza City. Al Jazeera reported two journalist siblings, Ahmad Abu Sakhil and Zahra Abu Sakhil, were among the dead together with their father, Muhammad. It also reported that a \u201cdensely populated house\u201d was hit in Beit Lahiya with at least one dead and others injured. The FRC used an internationally recognised standard known as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) in its findings. The IPC defines famine as when at least 20% of people in an area are suffering extreme food shortages, with at least 30% of children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease. The IPC is an initiative involving UN agencies, national governments and aid groups that sets the global standard on measuring food crises. The IPC warned last month that the entire Gaza Strip was at risk of famine, while top UN officials last week described the northern Gaza Strip as \u201capocalyptic\u201d and said everyone there was \u201cat imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence\u201d. The amount of aid entering Gaza has plummeted to its lowest level in a year, according to UN data, and the UN has repeatedly accused Israel of hindering and blocking attempts to deliver aid, particularly to Gaza\u2019s north. Israel\u2019s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, told the security council last month that the issue in Gaza was not a lack of aid, claiming more than a million tons had been delivered during the past year. He accused Hamas of hijacking the assistance. Hamas has repeatedly denied Israeli allegations that it was stealing aid and says Israel is to blame for shortages. Israel has repeatedly attacked aid convoys and aid workers as well as people waiting to receive food aid. \u201cThe daily average number of trucks entering Gaza in late October was about 58 per day,\u201d Jean-Martin Bauer, the UN World Food Programme\u2019s director of food security and nutrition analysis, said on Friday. \u201cWe were getting about 200 a day in September and August, so that\u2019s really a big, big decline.\u201d Aid agencies have previously said at least 600 trucks a day are needed to avert famine.

Huge stretches of outback across northern Australia had been warned by the Bureau of Meteorology to expect heatwave conditions stretching into next week. A severe heatwave warning was current for much of inland Queensland, with extreme and severe heatwave conditions affecting Richmond, Longreach, Roma and Charleville. Temperatures had hit 43C at Richmond as of midday Saturday, 42C at Mount Isa, 44C at Longreach and 43C at Boulia. Much of the area would see high temperatures stretch all the way up to Friday, with Mount Isa expected to reach maximums above 39C all week. Brisbane was now experiencing a \u201clow intensity\u201d heatwave, with a maximum of 30C expected on Saturday and to remain until Friday. In the Northern Territory, heatwave conditions were affecting Timber Creek, which was due to hit 43C, and Katherine, where the mercury could top out at 42C. In Western Australia, much of the north coast was gripped by the heatwave, with Broome and Derby feeling the worst temperatures. Broome was due to see temperatures rise to 34C, while Derby was forecast to see a maximum of 38C. The weather was stretching over to inland New South Wales as well, with Tibooburra, Bourke and Coonamble all expected to reach maximums of above 32C.

They are also preparing for the possibility that he may change rules to be able to fire scores of career civil servants. On the campaign trail, Trump has mulled sending the military after his political enemies, and also to turn back migrants at the southern border. US law generally prohibits active-duty troops from being deployed for law enforcement purposes. There are also fears he could gut the civil service in the Pentagon, and replace fired staff with employees selected for their loyalty to him. Meanwhile two states \u2013 the swing states of Nevada and Arizona \u2013 have yet to be called for either Harris or Trump. Should the Republicans win the electoral college votes from both states, it would mean they had a clean sweep of all seven swing states in the election.

Robert F Kennedy Jr, the former independent presidential candidate turned Trump surrogate, is reviewing candidate resumes for the top jobs at the US government\u2019s health agencies in Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, a former Kennedy aide and a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.

Ukrainian authorities made no acknowledgment that the village had fallen into Russian hands, while noting that fighting on the eastern front was heaviest around Kurakhove and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/21/russians-pokrovsk-ukrainian-city-families-agonise-residents-leave\">Pokrovsk, a major logistics centre</a> to the north-west. \u201cThe Kurakhove direction and the Pokrovsk direction are the most challenging right now,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. \u201cThe military command and brigade command are working on strengthening positions.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>Elon Musk reportedly made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/08/elon-musk-trump-ukraine-call-zelenskyy\">surprise guest appearance</a> on a call between Donald Trump and Zelenskyy, solidifying the Tesla chief executive\u2019s role as the most influential civilian in the US come January</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Russian forces were moving closer to capturing a major town on the eastern front in the war in Ukraine as part of their drive westward to capture all of the Donbas region, according to military bloggers. Bloggers on both sides reported on Friday that Russian forces had entered the village of Sontsivka and were advancing from the north-west on the city of Kurakhove. Ukrainian authorities made no acknowledgment that the village had fallen into Russian hands, while noting that fighting on the eastern front was heaviest around Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, a major logistics centre to the north-west. \u201cThe Kurakhove direction and the Pokrovsk direction are the most challenging right now,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. \u201cThe military command and brigade command are working on strengthening positions.\u201d Elon Musk reportedly made a surprise guest appearance on a call between Donald Trump and Zelenskyy, solidifying the Tesla chief executive\u2019s role as the most influential civilian in the US come January. Musk was present with Trump during the call for roughly 25 minutes, according to Axios, which first reported the call. Trump handed Musk the phone and Musk and Zelenskyy spoke briefly. On the call, Zelenskyy thanked Musk for the satellites he had been providing Ukraine through his company, Starlink, according to Agence France-Presse. Musk said he would continue to provide satellite internet connection, the report said. The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, arrived in Kyiv on Saturday to reassure Ukraine of Europe\u2019s backing in the first visit by a top Brussels official after Donald Trump\u2019s US poll win. \u201cThe message is a clear one: the Europeans will continue to support Ukraine,\u201d Borrell, who is set to leave office next month, told Agence France-Presse. \u201cWe have been supporting Ukraine since the beginning, and on this, my last visit to Ukraine, I convey the same message \u2013 we will support you as much as we can.\u201d Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has predicted Trump\u2019s new US administration will cease providing support for Ukraine. Orb\u00e1n made the comments before a summit of European leaders in Budapest where the war against Russia\u2019s invasion will be high on the agenda. The comments of Orb\u00e1n, who is close to the US president-elect and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, were a sign that Trump\u2019s election could drive a wedge among EU leaders over the war, the Associated Press reported. Russian air defences intercepted and destroyed 15 Ukrainian drones over the southern Bryansk region, the regional governor said early on Saturday. Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram that air defence units had downed a total of 15 drones. He said there was no damage or injuries. The US has decided to allow US defence contractors to work in Ukraine to maintain and repair Pentagon-provided weaponry, US officials said, in a Biden administration policy shift that aims to aid Kyiv\u2019s fight against Moscow. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the contractors would be small in number and located far from the frontlines, and would not be engaged in combat. Previously Kyiv had to move US-provided weaponry out of the country for heavy repair or rely on video-conferencing and other creative solutions to fix those systems inside the country. Nato members said the deployment of North Korean troops was a \u201cdangerous expansion\u201d of the country\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. The military alliance\u2019s 32 member countries warned in a joint statement on Friday that \u201cthe deepening military cooperation\u201d between Russia and North Korea \u201cdeeply impacts Euro-Atlantic security, with implications also for the Indo-Pacific\u201d. Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Ukraine also supported the Nato statement. Russia launched a barrage of drones and missiles at Ukraine overnight to Friday, killing one civilian and wounding more than 30 people in the country\u2019s centre, south and north-east, Ukrainian officials said. Moscow\u2019s forces launched 92 drones and five missiles at 12 Ukrainian regions, the Ukrainian air force said on Friday. Sixty-two drones and four missiles were downed and 26 drones were \u201clost\u201d, probably meaning they had been thwarted electronically. The interior ministry said one person had been killed in the Odesa region, where civilian infrastructure and homes were damaged and nine people were injured. Four people were wounded in a drone attack on the Kyiv region and at least six houses and several cars were damaged, it said. A Russian court sentenced two soldiers to life in prison for the massacre of a family of nine people in their home in occupied Ukraine, state media reported on Friday. Russian prosecutors said that in October 2023, the two Russian soldiers, Anton Sopov and Stanislav Rau, entered the home of the Kapkanets family in the city of Volnovakha and shot all the family members, including two children aged five and nine. The southern district military court in Rostov-on-Don sentenced the two men to life in prison for mass murder \u201cmotivated by political, ideological, racial, national or religious hatred\u201d, the state-run Tass news agency reported, citing a law enforcement source. Ukraine said it had received the bodies of 563 soldiers from Russian authorities, mainly troops who had died in combat in the eastern Donetsk region. Friday\u2019s announcement represents one of the largest repatriations of dead Ukrainian servicemen since the war began. Ukraine\u2019s relationship with the UK has \u201cgot worse\u201d since the Labour government took power in July, officials in Kyiv have told the Guardian, voicing frustration over Britain\u2019s failure to supply additional long-range missiles. The UK prime minister is yet to visit Ukraine four months after taking office and a frustrated Kyiv has said a trip would be worthless unless Keir Starmer committed to replenishing stocks of the sought-after long-range Storm Shadow system, Luke Harding and Dan Sabbagh report. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in his coming as a tourist,\u201d a senior figure in Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s administration said. Russian prosecutors on Friday demanded a six-year prison sentence for a paediatrician accused of criticising the Ukraine campaign during a private appointment, in a case that has revealed the extent of repression gripping Russia. Nadezhda Buyanova was reported to the police by the ex-wife of a soldier missing after fighting in Ukraine, Anastasia Akinshina, who accused her of calling the man a \u201clegal target of Ukraine\u201d. The 68-year-old was arrested in February and has been in pre-trial detention since April. Ingka Group, which runs most Ikea stores globally, has sold its last asset in Russia, a warehouse near Moscow, it said on Friday, completing its exit from the country. Ingka sold its 14 Mega-branded shopping malls in Russia to Gazprombank Group in September 2023, joining scores of western companies abandoning the Russian market after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.",

I would never claim to have all the answers about what went wrong, but I do worry that Democrats walked into the trap of defending the very institutions \u2014 the \u201cestablishment\u201d \u2014 that most Americans distrust. As a party interested in competent technocracy, we lost touch with the anger people feel at government. As a party that prizes data, we seized on indicators of growth and job creation as proof that the economy was booming, even though people felt crushed by rising costs. As a party motivated by social justice, we let revulsion at white Christian nationalism bait us into identity politics on their terms \u2014 whether it was debates about transgender athletes, the busing of migrants to cities, or shaming racist MAGA personalities who can\u2019t be shamed. As a party committed to American leadership of a \u201crules-based international order,\u201d we defended a national security enterprise that has failed repeatedly in the 21st century, and made ourselves hypocrites through unconditional military support for Israel\u2019s bombardment of civilians in Gaza.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What <strong>Donald Trump</strong> did right (and Harris misunderstood):</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Kamala Harris brought new energy and remarkable discipline to the campaign\u2019s final months, revitalizing the collaborative joy essential to Democratic politics. But her ties to an unpopular incumbent \u2014 and a global post-pandemic backlash against any incumbent \u2014 held her back. Democrats understandably have a hard time fathoming why Americans would put our democracy at risk, but we miss the reality that our democracy is part of what angers them. Many voters have come to associate democracy with globalization, corruption, financial capitalism, migration, forever wars and elites (like me) who talk about it as an end in itself rather than a means to redressing inequality, reining in capitalist systems that <em>are</em> rigged, responding to global conflict and fostering a sense of shared national identity.</p> \n   <p>Yes, this is unfair: Republican policies from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush did far more than Democrats to create this mess. But Mr. Trump\u2019s crusade against the past elites of his own party \u2014 from the Bush family to Mitch McConnell \u2014 credentialed him with a public hungry for accountability, while the Harris campaign\u2019s embrace of Dick Cheney conveyed the opposite message.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And, finally, what might work to undermine Trump over the next four years:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Out of the wreckage of this election, Democrats must reject the impulse to simply be a resistance that condemns whatever outrageous thing Mr. Trump says. While confronting Mr. Trump when we must, we must also focus on ourselves \u2014 what<em> </em>we stand for, and how we tell our story. That means acknowledging \u2014 as my Hong Kong interlocutor said \u2014 that \u201cthe narrative of liberalism and democracy collapsed.\u201d Instead of defending a system that has been rejected, we need to articulate an alternative vision for what kind of democracy comes next.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-672e1bee8f088b29b8c41cd5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-08T14:13:53.348Z\">2.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Democrats are going to spend the coming days, months and years digesting their brutal defeats in Tuesday\u2019s election.</strong></p> \n  <p>Among those pondering what happened is congresswoman <strong>Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</strong>, who appears (the Associated Press has not called it) to have won re-election in a red Washington state district, despite losses by fellow Democrats elsewhere.

      "bodyText": "Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Donald Trump\u2019s incoming presidency is set to threaten millions of Americans\u2019 healthcare plans. Millions of Americans are at risk of losing health coverage in 2025 under Donald Trump\u2019s forthcoming administration. More than 20 million Americans rely on the individual private health insurance market for healthcare, private insurance which is subsidized by the federal government. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the former independent presidential candidate turned Trump surrogate, is reviewing candidate resumes for the top jobs at the US government\u2019s health agencies in Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, a former Kennedy aide and a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. A Chinese national who had been recently released from a mental hospital was ordered held Friday on trespassing charges after police say he tried to enter President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate, the Associated Press reports. That entrance was in violation of a court order that he stay away from Mar-a-Lago following previous attempts. Democratic US Representative Andrea Salinas has won reelection in Oregon\u2019s 6th congressional District, beating Republican Mike Erickson to earn a second term in Congress after outraising him by millions of dollars. Oregon\u2019s newest congressional district, the 6th was seen as leaning more toward Democrats, according to the Cook Political Report. That gave a slight advantage to the freshman Democratic incumbent, who also defeated Erickson in the 2022 election. Women have won 60 seats in the New Mexico Legislature to secure the largest female legislative majority in US history, stirring expressions of vindication and joy among candidates who knocked on doors and found voters were ready. A federal judge on Friday overturned Illinois\u2019 ban on semiautomatic weapons, leaning on recent US supreme court rulings that strictly interpret the second amendment right to keep and bear firearms. Judge Stephen P McGlynn issued the lengthy finding in a decree that he said applied universally, not just to the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit challenging the ban. Speaking to the New York Times, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic former House speaker who played a major role in the pressuring Joe Biden not to seek re-election, said she believed the president waited too long to exit the race, and erred in immediately endorsing Kamala Harris. \u201cHad the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race,\u201d Pelosi said. Officials at the Pentagon are having informal discussions about what to do if Donald Trump were to give an illegal order, such as deploying the military domestically, CNN reports. They are also preparing for the possibility that he may change rules to be able to fire scores of career civil servants. Just hours after Donald Trump\u2019s election win on Tuesday, Black people across the US reported receiving racist text messages telling them that they had been \u201cselected\u201d to pick cotton and needed to report to \u201cthe nearest plantation\u201d. While the texts, some of which were signed \u201ca Trump supporter\u201d, varied in detail, they all conveyed the same essential message about being selected to pick cotton. Some of the messages refer to the recipients by name. Donald Trump, during a call with Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, handed the phone to Elon Musk, the New York Times is also reporting, confirming an earlier Axios story. It is not clear what the three men discussed or whether they touched on any change in US policy toward Ukraine in the wake of Trump\u2019s election victory, the Times said. The Biden administration has decided to allow US defense contractors to work in Ukraine to maintain and repair Pentagon-provided weaponry, Reuters is reporting, citing US officials. The contractors would be small in number and located far from the frontlines and will not be engaged in combat, an official told the news agency. The judge overseeing Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 election interference case has granted a request from the special counsel\u2019s office to pause proceedings in his trial on charges related to trying to overturn the 2020 election. As we reported earlier, Jack Smith asked judge Tanya Chutkan to pause the case against the president-elect to \u201cassess the unprecedented circumstances\u201d in which the office finds itself. This live coverage is ending now, thanks for following along. Democratic US Representative Andrea Salinas has won reelection in Oregon\u2019s 6th congressional District, beating Republican Mike Erickson to earn a second term in Congress after outraising him by millions of dollars. Oregon\u2019s newest congressional district, the 6th was seen as leaning more toward Democrats, according to the Cook Political Report. That gave a slight advantage to the freshman Democratic incumbent, who also defeated Erickson in the 2022 election. Salinas and Chavez-DeRemer became the first Latina members of Congress to represent Oregon when they were elected in the 2022 midterms. This was Erickson\u2019s fourth time running for Congress. As of late October, federal campaign finance records showed Salinas had raised nearly $4.8m compared to Erickson\u2019s roughly $460,000. The boundaries of the 6th District were created during redistricting after the 2020 census. The district includes the state capital Salem and parts of Portland\u2019s affluent southwestern suburbs. And while it also spans rural areas across a broad swath of the Willamette Valley, President Joe Biden would have carried it by about 13 points in 2020. The New York Times reports that Trump\u2019s transition team is relying on two cabinet leaders and fossil fuel lobbyists to reshape the agencies that protect air, water, climate and pubic land. The paper cites six sources familiar with the matter. It reports that, \u201cpeople working on the transition have already prepared a slate of executive orders and presidential proclamations on climate and energy. They include withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement, eliminating every office in every agency working to end the pollution that disproportionately affects poor communities and shrinking the size of national monuments in the West to allow more drilling and mining on public lands.\u201d Howard Lutnick, co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition team, told CNN before Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, however, that Kennedy was \u201cnot getting a job for HHS.\u201d Bigtree said Trump wanted to see Kennedy\u2019s ideas for reducing chronic illness produce results within two years, especially in US children. Kennedy last week said he would recommend fluoride be removed from public water supplies, falsely claiming on X the chemical is associated with numerous health issues including bone fractures and cancer. The American Dental Association says the decades-old intervention reduces tooth decay by more than 25% in adults and children. \u201cPresident Trump is giving him two years to show success,\u201d Bigtree said. \u201cPresident Trump is keenly interested in the selections that Bobby Kennedy thinks would get the job done.\u201d Kennedy will recommend scientists and doctors who \u201cdon\u2019t have any conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry when it comes to the departments that are going to be dealing with drugs and vaccines,\u201d Bigtree said. Bigtree, an anti-vaccine activist, is chief executive of MAHA Action, a new organization named after Kennedy\u2019s Make America Healthy Again pledge that Bigtree said would also propose appointees to Kennedy. Kennedy is being assisted by daughter-in-law Amaryllis Fox Kennedy, his former campaign manager, and investor Omeed Malik, the source familiar with the matter said. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the former independent presidential candidate turned Trump surrogate, is reviewing candidate resumes for the top jobs at the US government\u2019s health agencies in Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, a former Kennedy aide and a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. Kennedy, of the famed political family, has been asked to recommend appointees for all regulatory health agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration, said Del Bigtree, who was director of communications for Kennedy\u2019s campaign and remains close to the former candidate. A source familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified, echoed that Kennedy had taken on that role. Trump\u2019s transition team did not respond to a request for comment. In August, Kennedy, an environmental lawyer who has spread misinformation about vaccines, ended his presidential campaign and endorsed Trump in exchange for a role in Trump\u2019s administration focused on public health. Kennedy says he is not anti-vaccine but for more rigorous testing of vaccines. While he is looking for individuals to fill administration jobs, Kennedy could himself still take an official position in Trump\u2019s administration or serve in an advisory capacity, according to Bigtree. The two men formed the 2nd Amendment Militia and then in the summer and fall of 2022 tried to recruit others to join them, prosecutors said. In September 2022, O\u2019Dell\u2019s home became a staging site as the two men collected firearms, ammunition, paramilitary gear and other supplies, according to the government\u2019s evidence. Prosecutors said Perry posted a TikTok video in September saying that their militia group was going to \u201cgo protect this country\u201d, and another in early October saying the group would be \u201cout huntin\u2019\u201d. Prosecutors said the two men viewed US Border Patrol agents as traitors for allowing immigrants to cross into Texas. The day before they planned to leave for Texas, an FBI team using an armored vehicle served a search warrant on O\u2019Dell\u2019s home, and prosecutors said Perry fired 11 rifle shots at them. O\u2019Dell and his girlfriend surrendered, but after exiting the house, Perry fought with agents. Two men who co-founded a militia group have been convicted of attempting to murder federal agents ahead of a trip to Texas where they intended to shoot people attempting to cross the US-Mexico border. Jonathan S O\u2019Dell, 34, of Warsaw, Missouri, and Bryan C Perry, 39, of Clarksville, Tennessee, also planned to shoot any federal agents who tried to stop them as they targeted migrants, according to the prosecution. A jury at the US district court in Missouri deliberated for more than two hours before finding them guilty of more than 30 felony counts each, the chief federal prosecutor for western Missouri, Teresa Moore, announced Friday. They both face at least 10 years in prison, and possibly life. Incoming female legislators in New Mexico include a crusading Republican advocate for crime victims, Republican Nicole Chavez, and Democrat Heather Berghmans, who defeated men in the general election and the primary against an incumbent senator accused of sexual harassment. Berghmans, 36, of Albuquerque said people in her district appeared eager to hear from a new generation of female candidates. She will join the Senate as its youngest member after winning 60% of the general election vote. \u201cI did hear a lot of people at the doors who told me to my face that they were willing to vote for me just because I was a young woman,\u201d said Berghmans, who campaigned on solutions to surging homelessness and the housing affordability crisis. \u201cI think that people are excited to see new ideas and new faces and that women have been the ones to step up to run.\u201d Chavez won her state House seat in a relatively affluent Albuquerque neighborhood. She expressed pride in contributing to the new female legislative majority \u2014 and as her district\u2019s first Latina legislator-elect. But Chavez also said she campaigned to ensure a diversity of political values in preserving her party\u2019s control of the only Republican-held House district in Albuquerque, amid a growing urban-rural partisan divide. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in just recruiting women,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we should have diversity of all values.\u201d Women have won 60 seats in the New Mexico Legislature to secure the largest female legislative majority in US history, stirring expressions of vindication and joy among candidates who knocked on doors and found voters were ready. New Mexico voters are sending 11 additional women \u2013 Democrats and Republicans \u2013 to bump up female representation in the 112-member Legislature. Female state senators will still hold a minority of seats \u2013 16 out of 42. Women have made slow, steady advances in statehouse representation across the country, with one notable surge in the 2018 election cycle almost entirely among Democrats in a trend associated with the #MeToo movement and political engagement linked to the election of Donald Trump as president. In 2018, Nevada became the first state to elect a female legislative majority, later expanding it to more than 60% of seats with majorities in the state Assembly and Senate. Female legislators in New Mexico will hold a 54% majority \u2013 though with many more seats. The share of women in all state legislatures combined roughly tripled from about 11% in 1980 to 33% going into the November election, when women held 2,424 seats nationwide, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. A federal judge on Friday overturned Illinois\u2019 ban on semiautomatic weapons, leaning on recent US supreme court rulings that strictly interpret the second amendment right to keep and bear firearms. Judge Stephen P McGlynn issued the lengthy finding in a decree that he said applied universally, not just to the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit challenging the ban. The Protect Illinois Communities Act, signed into law in January 2023 by Democratic Governor JB Pritzker, took effect on 1 January. It bans AR-15 rifles and similar guns, large-capacity magazines and a wide assortment of attachments largely in response to the 2022 Independence Day shooting at a parade in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park. McGlynn\u2019s order doesn\u2019t take effect for 30 days. \u201cSadly, there are those who seek to usher in a sort of post-constitution era where the citizens\u2019 individual rights are only as important as they are convenient to a ruling class,\u201d McGlynn, who was appointed by Donald Trump during his first term, wrote in his opinion. \u201cThe oft-quoted phrase that \u2018no right is absolute\u2019 does not mean that fundamental rights precariously subsist subject to the whims, caprice, or appetite of government officials or judges.\u201d Here is the video clip of Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate, Tim Walz, saying on Friday that the 2024 US election outcome is \u201chard to understand\u201d. The governor of Minnesota vowed to \u201ckeep fighting\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201chateful agenda\u201d. Walz appeared to choke up during the speech in his home state. Harris and Walz lost by a landslide. A veteran California politician was caught up in last year\u2019s Los Angeles city council racism scandal but refused to resign. Kevin de L\u00e9on has now been voted out, replaced by a younger progressive candidate, Ysabel Jurado. Ysabel Jurado, a 34-year-old queer single mother who grew up in the neighborhood she will now represent, joins an expanding wing of young progressives on the Los Angeles city council. She will be the first Filipino American on the council. Jurado won out over de Le\u00f3n despite being targeted with a reported half million dollars in attack ads from the Los Angeles police union. Late in the campaign, she was recorded saying \u201cF the police,\u201d which she said was a reference to the song lyric, during a meeting with local college students. The Los Angeles Times later reported that the student who asked Jurado the question that prompted her answer worked for Kevin de Le\u00f3n. Nebraska Republican Don Bacon won a fifth term representing the Omaha-centered US House district on Friday, the Associated Press reports. Bacon\u2019s win edges Republicans closer to the 218 seats they need for control of the US House of Representatives, which would give them The current tally is 212 Republican seats to 199 Democratic seats, according to the Associated Press. If the Republicans win the House after winning the Senate and the presidency, they will have unified party control of the federal government. Bacon defeated Democrat Tony Vargas, a state lawmaker, in a hard-fought rematch of their 2022 race. Unlike other GOP candidates in the solidly Republican state, Bacon had emphasized his bipartisan credentials and highlighted his vote for the Biden administration\u2019s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Joe Biden won the second district\u2019s vote in the Electoral College in 2020, making it a top target as Democrats attempt to win back the House majority. More context here: The Associated Press has more context on a series of people who have been arrested over the past few years after incidents at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate. In January 2020, two Palm Beach sheriff\u2019s deputies opened fire on a Connecticut opera singer who sped through a checkpoint outside Mar-a-Lago while having a mental breakdown. She was not hit and was arrested nearby. She was later found not guilty by reason of insanity. She had been charged with aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer, fleeing arrest and resisting an officer without violence. In March 2019, Chinese national Yujing Zhang gained access to Mar-a-Lago while carrying a laptop, phones and other electronic gear. That led to initial speculation that the Shanghai businesswoman might be a spy, but she was never charged with espionage. Text messages she exchanged with a trip organizer indicated she was a fan of the president and wanted to meet him or his family to discuss possible deals. She was found guilty of trespassing and deported. In December 2019, the club\u2019s security officers confronted another Chinese national, Jing Lu, then 56, for trespassing and told her to leave, but she returned to take photos. Lu was charged with loitering and resisting an officer without violence. She was later acquitted of trespassing but found guilty of resisting arrest. On Thanksgiving weekend 2018, a University of Wisconsin student visiting the area with his parents walked into Mar-a-Lago by mingling with a group that was entering. He was arrested and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. A Chinese national who had been recently released from a mental hospital was ordered held Friday on trespassing charges after police say he tried to enter President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate, the Associated Press reports. That entrance was in violation of a court order that he stay away from Mar-a-Lago following previous attempts. Zijie Li, 39, is being held without bond at the Palm Beach County Jail after being arrested Thursday when he arrived at Mar-a-Lago\u2019s entrance gate in an Uber, the latest in series of contacts he has had with police and Secret Service agents at or near the estate since July. Li, who lives in suburban Los Angeles on a student visa, had just been released from a mental health hospital, where he had been placed in late October after police found him found near the estate. He is now facing two counts of misdemeanor trespassing. Donald Trump\u2019s incoming presidency is set to threaten millions of Americans\u2019 healthcare plans. Marina Dunbar reports for the Guardian: Millions of Americans are at risk of losing health coverage in 2025 under Donald Trump\u2019s forthcoming administration. More than 20 million Americans rely on the individual private health insurance market for healthcare, private insurance which is subsidized by the federal government. These subsidies, programs that help lower the cost of health insurance premiums, increased the amount of assistance available to people who want to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare as a signature piece of legislation during Barack Obama\u2019s administration. For the full story, click here: In a statement on X, Illinois\u2019s Democratic governor JB Pritzker vowed that his state will \u201calways be a refuge for those whose rights are denied elsewhere.\u201d Pritzker\u2019s statement come as various marginalized communities including BIPOC and LGBTQ+ groups as well as advocacy organizations, worry about Donald Trump\u2019s incoming rightwing administration and the president-elect\u2019s repeated pledges to deny their rights. Martin Pengelly reports for the Guardian on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s comments that Joe Biden\u2019s delay in withdrawing from the race blew Democrats\u2019 chances of winning: Joe Biden\u2019s slowness in exiting the 2024 presidential election cost the Democrats dearly, the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi said, days after Kamala Harris was beaten by Donald Trump. \u201cWe live with what happened,\u201d Pelosi said. Pelosi was speaking to the Interview, a New York Times podcast, in a conversation the newspaper said would be published Saturday in full. \u201cHad the president gotten out sooner,\u201d Pelosi remarked, \u201cthere may have been other candidates in the race. The anticipation was that, if the president were to step aside, that there would be an open primary. For the full story, click here: Here\u2019s a look at where things stand: Speaking to the New York Times, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic former House speaker who played a major role in the pressuring Joe Biden not to seek re-election, said she believed the president waited too long to exit the race, and erred in immediately endorsing Kamala Harris. \u201cHad the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race,\u201d Pelosi said. Officials at the Pentagon are having informal discussions about what to do if Donald Trump were to give an illegal order, such as deploying the military domestically, CNN reports. They are also preparing for the possibility that he may change rules to be able to fire scores of career civil servants. Just hours after Donald Trump\u2019s election win on Tuesday, Black people across the US reported receiving racist text messages telling them that they had been \u201cselected\u201d to pick cotton and needed to report to \u201cthe nearest plantation\u201d. While the texts, some of which were signed \u201ca Trump supporter\u201d, varied in detail, they all conveyed the same essential message about being selected to pick cotton. Some of the messages refer to the recipients by name. Donald Trump, during a call with Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, handed the phone to Elon Musk, the New York Times is also reporting, confirming an earlier Axios story. It is not clear what the three men discussed or whether they touched on any change in US policy toward Ukraine in the wake of Trump\u2019s election victory, the Times said. The Biden administration has decided to allow US defense contractors to work in Ukraine to maintain and repair Pentagon-provided weaponry, Reuters is reporting, citing US officials. The contractors would be small in number and located far from the frontlines and will not be engaged in combat, an official told the news agency. The judge overseeing Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 election interference case has granted a request from the special counsel\u2019s office to pause proceedings in his trial on charges related to trying to overturn the 2020 election. As we reported earlier, Jack Smith asked judge Tanya Chutkan to pause the case against the president-elect to \u201cassess the unprecedented circumstances\u201d in which the office finds itself. Donald Trump yesterday announced that his campaign co-chair Susie Wiles will be his chief of staff in the White House. He\u2019s expected to announce more appointments to prominent administration positions soon. The Guardian\u2019s Lorenzo Tondo took a look at who might be in the running: Officials at the Pentagon are having informal discussions about what to do if Donald Trump were to give an illegal order, such as deploying the military domestically, CNN reports. They are also preparing for the possibility that he may change rules to be able to fire scores of career civil servants. On the campaign trail, Trump has mulled sending the military after his political enemies, and also to turn back migrants at the southern border. US law generally prohibits active-duty troops from being deployed for law enforcement purposes. There are also fears he could gut the civil service in the Pentagon, and replace fired staff with employees selected for their loyalty to him. Here\u2019s more, from CNN: Trump has suggested he would be open to using active-duty forces for domestic law enforcement and mass deportations and has indicated he wants to stack the federal government with loyalists and \u201cclean out corrupt actors\u201d in the US national security establishment. Officials are now gaming out various scenarios as they prepare for an overhaul of the Pentagon. \u201cWe are all preparing and planning for the worst-case scenario, but the reality is that we don\u2019t know how this is going to play out yet,\u201d one defense official said. Trump\u2019s election has also raised questions inside the Pentagon about what would happen if the president issued an unlawful order, particularly if his political appointees inside the department don\u2019t push back. \u201cTroops are compelled by law to disobey unlawful orders,\u201d said another defense official. \u201cBut the question is what happens then \u2013 do we see resignations from senior military leaders? Or would they view that as abandoning their people?\u201d Nancy Pelosi also said she disagreed with Bernie Sanders, the progressive independent senator who said Democrats had \u201cabandoned working-class people\u201d after Kamala Harris\u2019s election loss. \u201cBernie Sanders has not won,\u201d Pelosi said in her interview with the New York Times. \u201cWith all due respect, and I have a great deal of respect for him, for what he stands for, but I don\u2019t respect him saying that the Democratic party has abandoned the working-class families.\u201d The former speaker instead blamed cultural issues for Harris\u2019s loss to Donald Trump. \u201cGuns, God and gays \u2013 that\u2019s the way they say it,\u201d Pelosi told the Times. \u201cGuns, that\u2019s an issue; gays, that\u2019s an issue, and now they\u2019re making the trans issue such an important issue in their priorities; and in certain communities, what they call God, what we call a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d Speaking to the New York Times, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic former House speaker who played a major role in the pressuring Joe Biden not to seek re-election, said she believed the president waited too long to exit the race, and erred in immediately endorsing Kamala Harris. \u201cHad the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race,\u201d Pelosi said. Shortly after announcing in July that he would end his bid for a second term, Biden endorsed Harris, setting the stage for her to become the Democratic nominee. Harris went on to lose the presidential election to Donald Trump on Tuesday, and in the interview conducted two days later, Pelosi said Democrats would have benefited from a primary to choose their candidate. \u201cThe anticipation was that, if the president were to step aside, that there would be an open primary,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd as I say, Kamala may have, I think she would have done well in that and been stronger going forward. But we don\u2019t know that. That didn\u2019t happen. We live with what happened. And because the president endorsed Kamala Harris immediately, that really made it almost impossible to have a primary at that time. If it had been much earlier, it would have been different.\u201d Donald Trump has attacked California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, who yesterday called the state legislature into a special session to enact laws intended to counter the Republican president-elect\u2019s agenda. \u201cGovernor Gavin Newscum is trying to KILL our Nation\u2019s beautiful California. For the first time ever, more people are leaving than are coming in. He is using the term \u2018Trump-Proof\u2019 as a way of stopping all of the GREAT things that can be done to \u2018Make California Great Again,\u2019 but I just overwhelmingly won the Election,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. He also restated his support for voting laws that could make it more difficult to cast ballots: \u201cAlso, as an \u2018AGENT\u2019 for the United States of America on Voting &amp; Elections, I will be DEMANDING THAT VOTER I.D., AND PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP, ARE A NECESSARY PART AND COMPONENT OF THE VOTING PROCESS!\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s transition team could announce additional White House positions as early as today, CNN is reporting. As we reported earlier, Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner is not expected to return to a new Trump administration but could advise on Middle East policy. The Financial Times is reporting that the North Dakota governor, Doug Burgum, is being tapped to be Trump\u2019s new \u201cenergy tsar\u201d. Burgum is Trump\u2019s preferred candidate for the role, the paper writes, adding that former energy secretary Dan Brouillette is also a contender. Just hours after Donald Trump\u2019s election win on Tuesday, Black people across the US reported receiving racist text messages telling them that they had been \u201cselected\u201d to pick cotton and needed to report to \u201cthe nearest plantation\u201d. While the texts, some of which were signed \u201ca Trump supporter\u201d, varied in detail, they all conveyed the same essential message about being selected to pick cotton. Some of the messages refer to the recipients by name. Black people in states including Alabama, South Carolina, Georgia, New York, New Jersey, Nevada, the DC area and elsewhere reported receiving the messages. The messages were sent to Black adults and students, including to high schoolers in Massachusetts and New York, and students at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), such as Alabama State University and other schools, including ones across Ohio, Clemson University, the University of Alabama and Missouri State. At least six middle school students in Pennsylvania received the messages, according to the AP. Authorities including the FBI and attorneys general are investigating the messages. Jim Banks, the Republican Indiana senator-elect, said he hopes that every undocumented immigrant who came to the US illegally under the Biden administration will be deported once Donald Trump is in office. \u201cIt\u2019s my hope that we deport every single one of them that we can, and it starts with deporting violent criminals who are in the United States who came here illegally who have committed violent crimes,\u201d Banks told CNN on Friday. \u201cI think once you do that, President Trump is committed to making that his first and top priority when it comes to mass deportation.\u201d Asked how those plans would be carried out, Banks said he didn\u2019t think it would be \u201cthat complicated\u201d. He said the American people had given Trump and the Republicans \u201ca mandate to do everything that we can.\u201d \u201cThe goal should be to deport every illegal in this country that we can find,\u201d he added. Donald Trump, during a call with Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, handed the phone to Elon Musk, the New York Times is also reporting, confirming an earlier Axios story. It is not clear what the three men discussed or whether they touched on any change in US policy toward Ukraine in the wake of Trump\u2019s election victory, the Times said. The tone of the call was described as \u201cpositive\u201d, a source told the paper. The Biden administration has decided to allow US defense contractors to work in Ukraine to maintain and repair Pentagon-provided weaponry, Reuters is reporting, citing US officials. The contractors would be small in number and located far from the frontlines and will not be engaged in combat, an official told the news agency. \u201cHaving small numbers of contractors in Ukraine conducting maintenance away from the front lines will help ensure U.S.-provided equipment can be rapidly repaired when damaged and be provided maintenance as needed,\u201d the US official said. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan suggested on Friday that a second term for Donald Trump could provide an opportunity to resolve the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, Lebanon and Gaza. Erdo\u011fan said he called Trump on Wednesday, while in Budapest for the European Political Community summit, in which he congratulated him on his election victory. During a speech in Istanbul, Erdo\u011fan said he now expects Trump to \u201cabandon the erroneous policies of the previous administration\u201d on Gaza and bring the war there to an end. \u201cYou know Trump has promised to end the conflicts initiated by Israel. We want that promise to be fulfilled and for Israel to be told stop\u201d, Erdo\u011fan said. On Ukraine, Erdo\u011fan called for more diplomacy, adding that Turkey-US cooperation could get a breakthrough. \u201cMore weapons, more bombs, more chaos, and conflict will not end this war,\u201d he warned. Ankara has previously played a key role in facilitating dialogue between Kyiv and Moscow. The judge overseeing Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 election interference case has granted a request from the special counsel\u2019s office to pause proceedings in his trial on charges related to trying to overturn the 2020 election. As we reported earlier, Jack Smith asked judge Tanya Chutkan to pause the case against the president-elect to \u201cassess the unprecedented circumstances\u201d in which the office finds itself. In a filing earlier on Friday, Smith said that \u201cas a result of the election\u201d the prosecution \u201crespectfully requests that the Court vacate the remaining deadlines in the pretrial schedule to afford the Government time to assess this unprecedented circumstance.\u201d Smith\u2019s team said it would inform the judge of \u201cthe result of its deliberations\u201d by 2 December. Donald Trump seems set to evade federal prosecution for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2020 election, with special counsel Jack Smith asking a judge to pause proceedings in the case. Separately, the justice department unveiled charges against a member of an Iranian paramilitary for allegedly plotting to kill the president-elect prior to his victory on Tuesday. We have also been getting more of a sense of who might serve in a second Trump administration, and what it\u2019s priorities may be. Elon Musk reportedly took part in a call with Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which the Ukrainian president found to be more reassuring than he expected. And on Fox News, the House majority leader Steve Scalise said Republican lawmakers would be focusing on extended tax cuts, allowing more oil and gas production and stopping migrants. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: We still do not know the winners of Arizona and Nevada\u2019s electoral votes or Senate races. Trump is expected to win the former, while Democratic candidates appear to have advantages in the latter. Bob Casey, Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic senator, lost his bid for re-election yesterday, the Associated Press confirmed. But he has not conceded, and a prominent Democratic election attorney has indicated there may be a fight over ballot counting brewing. Million of Americans may lose health insurance coverage next year, if Congress does not decide to extend subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. With Donald Trump headed back to the White House, NBC News reports that special counsel Jack Smith has asked a federal judge to pause proceedings in his trial on charges related to trying to overturn the 2020 election. Continuing the case appeared untenable after Trump won Tuesday\u2019s election, since justice department policy prohibits the prosecution of sitting presidents \u2013 something Trump will soon be, once again. NBC News reports that, in his filing, Smith said that \u201cas a result of the election\u201d he \u201crequests that the Court vacate the remaining deadlines in the pretrial schedule to afford the Government time to assess this unprecedented circumstance.\u201d Earlier this week, the Guardian reported that Smith will end both the election interference case against Trump, and a separate prosecution for allegedly taking and hiding classified documents. Neither case had gone to trial prior to Trump\u2019s election victory on Tuesday: Signs that Iran was trying to assassinate Donald Trump increased in the run-up to the election, leading his campaign to reportedly request extraordinary security accommodations. Here\u2019s a look back at those, from the Guardian\u2019s Victoria Bekiempis: Donald Trump\u2019s team has asked for officials to provide him with a dramatic array of military protections as the presidential campaign wraps, including travel in military aircraft and vehicles, according to reports. Trump\u2019s campaign has also requested ramped-up flight restrictions around his residences and rallies, and \u201cballistic glass pre-positioned in seven battleground states\u201d for his team\u2019s use, the Washington Post reported, citing internal emails and sources familiar with the requests. The New York Times first reported on these requests. The demands were both \u201cextraordinary and unprecedented\u201d, the Post noted, as not a single recent presidential nominee has been shuttled in military aircraft before an election. A source told the Times that these sorts of high-level, classified military resources are used solely for sitting presidents. Trump\u2019s asks followed intelligence provided to his campaign staff that Iran is seeking to assassinate him and after his team expressed worry about drones and missiles targeting him. Trump was shot during a failed assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on 13 July, and a man was arrested in an alleged assassination attempt on 15 September; neither gunman is believed to have had Iranian ties. The justice department has brought charges against a member of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards paramilitary group for plotting to assassinate Donald Trump prior to Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, the Associated Press reports. On the campaign trail in the lead-up to his election win, Trump survived two assassination attempts, but authorities do not believe either were linked to Iran, a longtime foe of the United States. According to the AP, the complaint unsealed in a Manhattan federal court says an unnamed official of the guard, which is formally known as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, instructed a contact in September to create a plan to surveil and kill Trump. Signs are continuing to mount that Elon Musk will be involved in Donald Trump\u2019s administration. But the Guardian\u2019s Dan Milmo reported earlier this week that even if he decides to stay out of politics, Musk appears set to gain from the Republican\u2019s return to the White House: Hours before it became official that Donald Trump had returned to the White House, his biggest supporter was already inside the Oval Office. Elon Musk, who has been a key backer of Trump\u2019s return to the presidency, was in his default wind-up mode as he used his X platform to post a superimposed picture of himself \u2013 holding a sink \u2013 inside the seat of US power. \u201cLet that sink in,\u201d he wrote. It was amateurish but Musk\u2019s contribution to Trump\u2019s victory has been serious and will reap benefits for the world\u2019s richest person. Trump acknowledged Musk in his victory speech on Wednesday, even if it required prompting from the audience, and indicated that Musk will be well treated under his administration. \u201cWe have to protect our geniuses, we don\u2019t have that many of them,\u201d said Trump. Musk, who is worth $264bn (\u00a3205bn), can easily afford the more than $100m he has given to the fellow billionaire\u2019s campaign via his Super Pac. In yet another sign of Elon Musk\u2019s clout with the second Trump administration, Axios reports that he was on the line when Donald Trump called Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy after his election win. Two sources knowledgable about the call said Zelenskyy was \u201csomewhat reassured\u201d by what Trump told him. On the campaign trail, the president-elect promised to end the war in Ukraine in \u201c24 hours\u201d after taking office, which raised concerns he would broker a deal that would benefit Russia. According to Axios, the call between Trump and Zelensky lasted about 25 minutes, and \u201cthe president-elect said he will support Ukraine, but didn\u2019t go into details.\u201d \u201cThree sources briefed on the call all told Axios that Zelensky felt the call went well and that it did not increase his anxiety about Trump\u2019s victory. One source said it \u2018didn\u2019t leave Zelensky with a feeling of despair,\u201d Axio said. As for Musk, Axios said he \u201cweighed in during the call to say he will continue supporting Ukraine through his Starlink satellites, the sources said. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.\u201d Steve Scalise, the Republican House majority leader, said that if the party maintains its control of the chamber, their top priorities will be passing legislation to extend tax cuts implemented during Donald Trump\u2019s first term, making good on his promise to crack down on migrants, and increasing oil and gas production. Saying the Republicans would pass a bill using the budget reconciliation process, which would allow them to circumvent a filibuster by Senate Democrats, Scalise said: There are a lot of things you could put in that. We laid it out as a first 100-day agenda. And we would put things like renewing the Trump tax cuts, many of those which expired that we passed in 2017. We want to renew those cuts so that families don\u2019t see a tax increase. He also made clear that the House was ready to approve proposals by Trump to stop people from crossing into the United States from Mexico, as well as ways to increase America\u2019s already high oil production: The ability to produce more energy in our country, it will lower costs for things like gasoline and food for families who are struggling. And it really takes leverage away from countries like Russia, like Iran, like Venezuela. So geopolitically has a lot of benefits, too. Finally, Scalise signaled that Trump would indeed get billionaire Elon Musk involved in his administration somehow, saying: Let\u2019s rightsize government. Elon Musk is going to be very involved in that. Here\u2019s the full interview: EU leaders are gathering in Budapest for an informal summit on the bloc\u2019s ailing competitiveness \u2013 a task given added urgency by the threat of protectionist \u201cAmerica first\u201d trade policies promised by the US president-elect Donald Trump. \u201cDon\u2019t ask what the US can do for you, ask what Europe should do for itself,\u201d the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said as the meeting got under way. \u201cEurope must find a balance. We know what we have to do.\u201d European officials are alarmed by Trump\u2019s impending return not just because of his hostility to Nato and ambivalence towards Ukraine, but also the economic consequences of his threat to make the EU \u201cpay a big price\u201d for not buying enough US imports. In one of the first statements he has made on social media since winning the presidential election, Donald Trump says he has no intention of selling Truth, the X-like network that has become one of his prime means of communication since leaving the White House. He made the announcement in a post on Truth itself, in his signature style: There are fake, untrue, and probably illegal rumors and/or statements made by, perhaps, market manipulators or short sellers, that I am interested in selling shares of Truth. THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SELLING! I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements, and who may have done so in the past, be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities. Truth is an important part of our historic win, and I deeply believe in it. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The president-elect made the foray into social media in the run-up to his successful campaign to return to the White House, but Truth Social has yet to become as big as X, Facebook and other social media mainstays, with Trump being its most prominent user. Share of his company Trump Media have in recent days seen heavy volatility in trading, but are up by about 8.5% as of 10.53 am ET: Democrats have managed to hang on to their majority in Pennsylvania\u2019s house of representatives by a single seat, the Associated Press reports, despite losing the state\u2019s electoral votes to Donald Trump and failing to re-elect their US senator. The party had won control of the chamber two years ago, also with only a one-seat margin, but had hoped to expand their majority further. That said, the GOP did keep their majority in Pennsylvania\u2019s senate, denying Democratic governor Josh Shapiro the trifecta needed to fully implement his agenda. Here\u2019s more on the Democratic victory in the Keystone State, from the AP: The win by incumbent Rep. Frank Burns is the final House race to be called in a year when none of the 203 districts are changing hands. It gave Democrats a 102-101 margin and dashed Republican hopes of returning to control after two years in the minority. Burns beat Republican Amy Bradley, chief executive of the Cambria Regional Chamber of Commerce and a former television news anchor and reporter. Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee President Heather Williams said retaining the House majority was \u201cone of the most challenging yet important priorities of the cycle,\u201d and that her party will be \u201ca critical check on Republican extremism.\u201d Burns, a conservative Democrat who supports gun rights and opposes abortion, has regularly found himself voting against his fellow House Democrats. He has long been an electoral target of Republicans, while many other similarly situated western Pennsylvania districts long ago flipped to the GOP. The district includes Johnstown and a wide swath of Cambria County. Burns\u2019 win is some consolation to Democrats in what has otherwise been a banner electoral year in Pennsylvania for the Republican Party. Former President Donald Trump won in the state, Dave McCormick beat Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, two Democratic congressional seat were flipped and Republican candidates won all three of the state row offices. The Washington Post reports that, in addition to setting up a customary post-election win meeting with him at the White House, Joe Biden will attend Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration: Staffers for Biden and Trump are working to schedule a meeting between the two leaders, something that did not occur four years ago when it was Trump who was leaving the White House and Biden who was coming in. Biden\u2019s aides say he will attend Trump\u2019s inauguration, something Trump also refused to do when Biden took the oath of office, breaking a long-standing tradition. Trump did not attend Biden\u2019s inauguration, after spending weeks fruitlessly trying to prevent him from taking office by propagating baseless claims of fraud in 2020. Neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris have public appearances scheduled today. The president will come near reporters briefly in the afternoon as he travels to Delaware for the weekend, but there\u2019s no telling if he will speak to them. Harris is in Washington DC and holding undisclosed meetings. Yesterday, Biden spoke from the White House, and pledged a smooth transfer of power to Donald Trump: Also writing in the New York Times, Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national security advisor to Barack Obama, shared his views on what went wrong for Democrats: Now Mr. Trump has decisively won back the presidency. I would never claim to have all the answers about what went wrong, but I do worry that Democrats walked into the trap of defending the very institutions \u2014 the \u201cestablishment\u201d \u2014 that most Americans distrust. As a party interested in competent technocracy, we lost touch with the anger people feel at government. As a party that prizes data, we seized on indicators of growth and job creation as proof that the economy was booming, even though people felt crushed by rising costs. As a party motivated by social justice, we let revulsion at white Christian nationalism bait us into identity politics on their terms \u2014 whether it was debates about transgender athletes, the busing of migrants to cities, or shaming racist MAGA personalities who can\u2019t be shamed. As a party committed to American leadership of a \u201crules-based international order,\u201d we defended a national security enterprise that has failed repeatedly in the 21st century, and made ourselves hypocrites through unconditional military support for Israel\u2019s bombardment of civilians in Gaza. What Donald Trump did right (and Harris misunderstood): Kamala Harris brought new energy and remarkable discipline to the campaign\u2019s final months, revitalizing the collaborative joy essential to Democratic politics. But her ties to an unpopular incumbent \u2014 and a global post-pandemic backlash against any incumbent \u2014 held her back. Democrats understandably have a hard time fathoming why Americans would put our democracy at risk, but we miss the reality that our democracy is part of what angers them. Many voters have come to associate democracy with globalization, corruption, financial capitalism, migration, forever wars and elites (like me) who talk about it as an end in itself rather than a means to redressing inequality, reining in capitalist systems that are rigged, responding to global conflict and fostering a sense of shared national identity. Yes, this is unfair: Republican policies from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush did far more than Democrats to create this mess. But Mr. Trump\u2019s crusade against the past elites of his own party \u2014 from the Bush family to Mitch McConnell \u2014 credentialed him with a public hungry for accountability, while the Harris campaign\u2019s embrace of Dick Cheney conveyed the opposite message. And, finally, what might work to undermine Trump over the next four years: Out of the wreckage of this election, Democrats must reject the impulse to simply be a resistance that condemns whatever outrageous thing Mr. Trump says. While confronting Mr. Trump when we must, we must also focus on ourselves \u2014 what we stand for, and how we tell our story. That means acknowledging \u2014 as my Hong Kong interlocutor said \u2014 that \u201cthe narrative of liberalism and democracy collapsed.\u201d Instead of defending a system that has been rejected, we need to articulate an alternative vision for what kind of democracy comes next. Democrats are going to spend the coming days, months and years digesting their brutal defeats in Tuesday\u2019s election. Among those pondering what happened is congresswoman Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, who appears (the Associated Press has not called it) to have won re-election in a red Washington state district, despite losses by fellow Democrats elsewhere. In a Q&amp;A with the New York Times, she shared some thoughts on how she has managed to hold on to her seat in what is otherwise hostile territory for her party: You were considered the most vulnerable House Democrat, and yet you are set to win by a fairly comfortable margin in a very difficult political environment. How did that happen, and what can Democrats learn from you? I just refused to let this race be nationalized. It\u2019s not about the message. It\u2019s about my loyalty to my community. The messenger is the message in a lot of ways. My awareness of my community has been durable, and it\u2019s reflective in my vote record. That is a huge asset. The fundamental mistake people make is condescension. A lot of elected officials get calloused to the ways that they\u2019re disrespecting people. \u2026 How do you think Democratic lawmakers have been disrespecting people? I was talking to a woman who runs one of the largest labor and delivery wards. She said 40 percent of the babies there have at least one parent addicted to fentanyl. What is empathetic \u2014 to tell them that\u2019s their problem, or to take border security seriously? People are putting their groceries on their credit card. No one is listening to anything else you say if you try to talk them out of their lived experiences with data points from some economists. Last night, the Associated Press reported that Republican David McCormick had unseated Pennsylvania\u2019s longtime Democratic senator Bob Casey. But the incumbent has not conceded. Instead, he posted a message saying that there are still ballots to count: Meanwhile, Marc Elias, a prominent Democratic election law attorney who has worked for Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaigns, appeared to suggest that there may be a court fight brewing over ballots in the race: Whether all this will affect the outcome remains to be seen. While it was always viewed as difficult for Democrats to keep their Senate majority beyond this year due to the three red state seats they would have to defend to do so, Casey\u2019s seat was viewed as winnable for the party. His defeat appears tied to Donald Trump\u2019s sweep of Pennsylvania\u2019s electoral votes. We still do not know which candidate won Nevada and Arizona\u2019s electoral votes, with ballot counting ongoing in both western states, and the Associated Press yet to determine a winner. Donald Trump is ahead in both states thus far, but even if he slips, it would not change the outcome of the presidential election. The real races to watch in the states are for its Senate seats, which also have not yet been called by the AP. Democratic incumbent Jacky Rosen seems to have the edge over her Republican challenger Sam Brown in Nevada, with 96% of the ballots counted. In Arizona, Democrat Ruben Gallego has a lead over Republican Kari Lake, though only 76% of results have been reported. Even if both Democrats win, it will not prevent the GOP from taking control of the Senate next year. Their victories in West Virginia, Ohio and Montana, along with Trump\u2019s re-election, ensured their majority. Trump\u2019s share of Jewish votes \u2014 about 30%, according to the AP\u2019s VoteCast \u2014 resembled the 2020 outcome, when 68% of Jewish voters backed Biden and 31% backed Trump. The CEO of one of the nation\u2019s largest Jewish organizations, Ted Deutch of the American Jewish Committee, said the AJC looked forward to working with Trump and his administration on policies that would bolster Israel\u2019s security and combat antisemitism. Deutch also urged the incoming administration to \u201cincrease unity among the American people and repair partisan divides.\u201d The CEO of a left-of-center advocacy group, Amy Spitalnick of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, issued a statement saying Trump\u2019s victory is \u201cterrifying for so many communities who have been consistently threatened and demonized by his campaign.\u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s embrace of anti-democratic, antisemitic, xenophobic, and racist conspiracy theories seeks to pit communities against one another and sow distrust in our democratic institutions, while making all of us less safe,\u201d Spitalnick said. The UK foreign secretary David Lammy has suggested that Donald Trump may be invited to the UK for a state visit \u2013 but not next year. Asked about the prospect of a state visit, in an interview with BBC\u2019s Newscast, Lammy said that organizing one for 2025 might be \u201ca bit of a tall order\u201d because of the time needed to prepare. But he said the UK would want to be \u201cgenerous with our American friends\u201d. A state visit is the most prestigious category of visit that a foreign head of state can make to the UK. There are normally only about two a year, and they involve almost all the royal and ceremonial trappings the UK is able to lay on. Theresa May was criticised when she was prime minister for inviting Trump to the UK on a state visit only seven days after his inauguration. The offer was seen as premature and ingratiating, although it seems to have played a role in enabling May to become the first foreign leader to visit Trump in the White House. At a joint press conference in Washington in January 2017 May said the state visit would come later that year. But Trump later told May he did not when to come if there were going to protests, and the state visit did not take place until 2019. There were other visits before then, including one featuring a reception at Blenheim Palace that was almost as grand as a state visit event. Asked if Trump would be offered a state visit in 2025, Lammy said: State visits take a while to organise. So in the next year, I\u2019ve got to tell you, I think that would be a bit of a tall order. But [Trump] was genuine in his respect and his affection for the royal family. Asked if a state visit might be offered later, Lammy said the government would \u201cwant to be generous with our American friends as they will be, I imagine, with us, particularly in a second term\u201d. Donald Trump won over more Catholics in the 2024 presidential election than he did when he lost to Joe Biden in 2020, an AP analysis suggests. Among religious voters as a whole, the president-elect faired roughly as well as he did during the previous election. But 54% of Catholic voters lent him their support this year, while Kamala Harris was backed by 44%. That compares to a split of 50% pro-Trump and 49% for Biden, a church-going Catholic, in 2020, according to AP\u2019s VoteCast. VoteCast also documented a racial divide. About six in 10 white Catholics supported Trump, and about four in 10 supported Harris. By contrast, about six in 10 Latino Catholics supported Harris, and about four in 10 supported Trump. Archbishop Thomas Wenski, of Miami, who has worked closely with migrant and refugee communities in South Florida and beyond, sounded a note of \u201ccautious optimism\u201d about a second Trump term, believing that the reality of migrants\u2019 contributions to the US economy will matter more than the \u201chyperbole\u201d about mass deportations. \u201cIf he wants to accomplish \u2018the greatest economy ever,\u2019 he\u2019s going to have to work on some type of accommodation on the immigration issues,\u201d Wenski said. David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, said in an interview that he had expected Donald Trump to win the presidential election \u201cfor some time\u201d. He told the Newscast podcast that when he met people from the Republican campaign in the spring he was impressed by how organized they were and he said: \u201cI felt in my bones that there could be a Trump presidency.\u201d He also said he was surprised the Democrats did not focus more on the economy in their campaign. He said: Because we had just come out of a campaign effectively, as the British Labour party having won an election, I was a little bit surprised that the Democrats had made a decision not to centre particularly the economy in their approach to the election. We obviously had been really clear about growth for us. We knew that cost of living crisis, that\u2019s where the public\u2019s [attention was]. When the US election result pushed shares in the artificial intelligence chip giant Nvidia to a record high and did the same to the price of bitcoin cryptocurrency, the market gave its verdict on what Trump redux means for at least parts of the technology world \u2013 a boom. Stock in the electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla surged by nearly 15%, which must have cheered its boss, Elon Musk, whom Trump called a \u201csuper genius\u201d on Wednesday. But what about the people who do not own stock in Silicon Valley firms, but do use their products? Tens of millions of users of Musk\u2019s social media platform, X, will now have to decide if they are willing to post in a place owned by a figure who looks set to be a central part of Trump\u2019s administration. Musk could be tasked with \u201cmaking recommendations for drastic reforms\u201d aimed at the efficiency and performance of \u201cthe entire federal government\u201d, Trump had said. This could grant him huge power over the agencies that regulate his and other tech companies. X had already become, according to the independent tech analyst Benedict Evans, \u201ca coordinating site for misinformation\u201d and many felt its amplification of false claims polluted the election. Might a Trump administration then do anything about misinformation on social media? \u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d said Evans. \u201cHe likes misinformation. There is a widespread view in tech that content moderation got out of hand and we need to pull back on this. At most you might need to think about amplification [of misinformation] but not deleting stuff.\u201d So expect a wilder ride on social platforms, perhaps, as they pitch towards the right. Millions of Americans could lose health insurance after Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election. Subsidies that helped many pay for insurance are due to expire at the end of 2025 \u2013 and it is up to the new Congress and president whether they are extended. The subsidies were part of the 2021 American Rescue Plan, and Trump and Republicans have signaled they don\u2019t support extending the measure, according to a report on NBC News. \u201cIf Republicans end up winning the House, in addition to the Senate and White House, having a GOP sweep, I think the odds are less than 5% they get extended,\u201d Chris Meekins, who was a senior HHS official in Trump\u2019s first term, told NBC. In 2024, more than 20 million people got health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, official figures show. Without the financial support, estimates show health insurance could be out of reach for nearly 4 million people. Trump\u2019s campaign did not comment on the report. Guardian columnist Marina Hyde has written this piece on the Democrats\u2019 failure to learn the lessons of 2016 \u2013 and how both sides look set to forget any lessons learned from Trump 2.0: My husband knows masses more about US politics than me, so do imagine how much he enjoyed me spending the best part of the past two years telling him \u201cTrump\u2019s going to win\u201d simply because I felt it in my vibes. However, earlier this year, he started to agree with me, which I had to concede meant a lot because he was basing it on actual information, and had the first clue what he was talking about. Scrolling back through my text messages to him, I am reading things such as: \u201cSorry, Harris is \u2018selling joy\u2019???? Please tell me the election anywhere in history that was won on joy because I would LOVE to hear about it.\u201d (Sidenote: I can see from reviewing the data that I\u2019ve really over-leaned into the sassy question mark this year.) Anyway, there\u2019s plenty more in this vein. \u201cI don\u2019t believe all this polling, I just think it\u2019s all some massive cope?\u201d Yet when I was asked on the afternoon of election day who I predicted would win it, I promptly said \u201cKamala Harris?\u201d Later that night, on the phone, my husband wondered mildly why I had abandoned the conviction of long months of kitchen rants and annoyingly punctuated text messages. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I replied. \u201cI guess I just \u2026 forgot?\u201d Forgetting is a very seductive thing. But then, irrational behaviour so often is. I can only say that I did want the opposite of the thing I forgot to be true. Right now, the Democratic party should be looking back at the past few months and wondering how a lot of stuff slipped their minds. Picture their trip down memory lane. \u201cWe should definitely run a coastal elite woman against Trump and call his supporters weird. I forget how that goes for us. We should definitely go heavy on the culture war stuff. I forget how that goes for us. We should definitely present the choice as being between darkness/fear/hate and moral superiority. I forget how that goes for us. We should definitely not present the choice as being between his economic plan and our clear and better one. I forget how that goes for us.\u201d Madonna has expressed outrage at the re-election of Donald Trump, describing him as \u201ca convicted felon, rapist, bigot\u201d. Writing on Instagram, she said: \u201cTrying to get my head around why a convicted felon, rapist, bigot was chosen to lead our country because he\u2019s good for the economy?\u201d She also posted a picture of a cake with the words \u201cFuck Trump\u201d etched in frosting along with the caption: \u201cStuffed my face with this cake last night!\u201d The singer has previously castigated Trump, saying at the Women\u2019s March in Washington DC in January 2017, the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration, that she\u2019d thought \u201can awful lot about blowing up the White House\u201d. After a backlash among Trump supporters, she said: \u201cI do not promote violence and it\u2019s important people hear and understand my speech in its entirety rather than one phrase.\u201d Billie Eilish has also expressed dismay in the wake of Trump\u2019s election. She told a concert audience in Nashville on Wednesday: \u201cA person who is a \u2026 let\u2019s say convicted predator, let\u2019s say that \u2026 someone who hates women so, so deeply is about to be the president of the United States of America.\u201d We\u2019ve been reporting on the possible impact of Trump\u2019s election victory on the war in Ukraine. Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n has suggested Trump will pull support for Kyiv, but Irish Taoiseach Simon Harris believes the US stance should have little impact on any EU decision. He said: The US had its election and it made its decision but that doesn\u2019t change European values, and European values around the importance of the UN Charter, the importance of territorial integrity remain. I think when it comes to the Middle East, I think we\u2019re at a very very dangerous moment and I worry about this interregnum period now and how Netanyahu responds to that. President-elect Trump is a person who professes his support for peace. I think it is so important now that the world speaks with one voice in terms of calling out the humanitarian crisis and the loss of civilian life. I know President-elect Trump references the Abraham Accords as a moment of success in his last term in office. Is that a pathway back towards getting partners in the region around a table to discuss regional stability, but part of that has to be the recognition that Palestine is a state in its own right? Artists need to \u201ckeep the flag of truth flying\u201d after Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, the legendary Scottish actor Brian Cox has said. Cox, who played Logan Roy in the hit HBO series Succession, also said the world has \u201cnever been in a more dangerous place than it is at the moment\u201d as he reflected on the US election campaign and a second impending Trump presidency. \u201cAs artists we have to bang the drum, we have to keep going,\u201d he said in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t put up with it. That\u2019s why I admire people like Mark Ruffalo [a longtime advocate for social justice]. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give up on my criticism of Trump. I think it behoves artists to not give up, to keep the flag of truth flying, because it\u2019s been so abused in recent years.\u201d Cox went viral on Tuesday night after making his disdain for Trump known during a virtual appearance on Channel 4 alongside the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson. The 78-year-old, who splits his time between London and New York, said he was \u201cacutely depressed\u201d about the election and felt like he just had to \u201cride it out\u201d. Cox said: There\u2019s probably nobody more surprised than Trump himself. I think he was expecting to talk about voter fraud. But the American people have bought into him, which I find absolutely astonishing. It\u2019s extraordinary that he has so many Catholic voters. I\u2019m not religious at all, but I was born a Catholic. So I know about the Catholic doctrine and Trump\u2019s sins are unbelievable. How can they possibly rationalise their faith in relationship to him? He added: I\u2019ve got two sons in America, I worry about what\u2019s in store for them. The only person Trump cares about is himself. It\u2019s hard to predict what he\u2019ll be like. The Associated Press reports that a federal judge has struck down a Biden administration policy that aimed to ease a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants who are married to US citizens. The program, lauded as one of the biggest presidential actions to help immigrant families in years, allowed undocumented spouses and stepchildren of US citizens to apply for a green card without first having to leave the country. The temporary relief from deportation brought a brief sense of security to some 500,000 immigrants estimated to benefit from the program before Texas-based US district judge put it on hold in August, days after applicants filed their paperwork. Barker ruled that the Biden administration had overstepped its authority by implementing the program and had stretched the legal interpretation of relevant immigration law \u201cpast its breaking point\u201d. The short-lived Biden administration initiative known as \u201cKeeping Families Together\u201d would have been unlikely to remain in place after Donald Trump took office in January. But its early termination creates greater uncertainty for immigrant families as many are bracing for Trump\u2019s return to the White House. Demonstrators in South Korea swore off heterosexual dating in protest against misogyny. Now the movement is sparking interest among young American women. So what exactly is the 4B movement going viral after Trump\u2019s win? My colleague Alaina Demopoulos has this report: Susie Wiles, who was named Donald Trump\u2019s new White House chief of staff, will be the first woman in US history to serve in the role as gatekeeper to the president, a position that typically wields great influence. The chief of staff position is usually the first appointee that a president-elect names, and may oversee the transition from one administration. Once Trump is sworn in as president, Wiles will also be in charge of all White House policy, serving as a confidante and adviser and managing day-to-day affairs. Wiles, 67, is a veteran of Florida politics. She began her career in the Washington office of New York congressman Jack Kemp in the 1970s. Following that she did stints on Ronald Reagan\u2019s campaign and in his White House as a scheduler. Wiles then headed to Florida, where she advised two Jacksonville mayors and worked for Congresswoman Tillie Fowler. After that came statewide campaigns in rough-and-tumble Florida politics, with Wiles being credited with helping businessman Rick Scott win the governor\u2019s office. After briefly managing the Utah governor Jon Huntsman\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, she ran Trump\u2019s 2016 effort in Florida, when his win in the state helped him clinch the White House. Two years later, Wiles helped get Ron DeSantis elected as Florida\u2019s governor. But the two would develop a rift that eventually led to DeSantis to urge Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign to cuts its ties with the strategist, when she was again running the then-president\u2019s state campaign. Wiles ultimately went on to lead Trump\u2019s primary campaign against DeSantis and trounced the Florida governor. Trump campaign aides and their outside allies gleefully taunted DeSantis throughout the race \u2013 mocking his laugh, the way he ate and accusing him of wearing lifts in his boots \u2013 as well as using insider knowledge that many suspected had come from Wiles and others on Trump\u2019s campaign staff who had also worked for DeSantis and had had bad experiences. Wiles joined up with Trump\u2019s third campaign and served as his \u201cde facto chief of staff\u201d over the last three years to lead his successful re-election bid and helped him work with lawyers on his various criminal and civil cases. A new book by the chief architect of Project 2025, a hugely controversial policy plan for a second Trump term, repeatedly employs imagery of fire and burning, including calling for rightwingers to \u201cburn away the rot\u201d of American institutions and organizations deemed opposed to conservative aims. The news comes after a White House address on Thursday, two days after Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in the US presidential election, when Joe Biden called on Americans to \u201cbring down the temperature\u201d after months of heated political battle. Mixing classical quotes with clich\u00e9 (\u201cit is time to fight fire with fire\u201d) and metaphors about forest fires and Smokey Bear, Kevin Roberts, president of the far-right Heritage Foundation, advocates \u201ca long, controlled burn\u201d of targets including the FBI, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the New York Times, \u201cevery Ivy League college\u201d and even the Boy Scouts of America. Meanwhile, Hungary\u2019s prime minister believes Ukraine has already lost in its fight against Russia\u2019s invasion and is predicting that Donald Trump\u2019s new administration will abandon US support for Kyiv, Reuters reports. Viktor Orb\u00e1n told state radio: If Donald Trump had won in 2020 in the United States, these two nightmarish years wouldn\u2019t have happened, there wouldn\u2019t have been a war. The situation on the front is obvious, there\u2019s been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war. Orb\u00e1n has long sought to undermine EU support for Kyiv, and routinely blocked, delayed or watered down the bloc\u2019s efforts to provide weapons and funding and to sanction Moscow for its invasion. Vladimir Putin is ready to discuss Ukraine with Donald Trump - but that does not mean Putin is willing to alter his demands and Russia\u2019s goals in Ukraine remain unchanged, the Kremlin said on Friday. On Thursday, Putin congratulated Trump on winning the election, praised him for showing courage when a gunman tried to assassinate him, and said Moscow was ready for dialogue with the Republican president-elect. Asked about a possible phone call between Trump and Putin, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was nothing concrete on it to report yet, and said it would be premature to talk of any improvement in Russia-US ties. But Putin had made it clear many times he remained open for dialogue, he said. Voters have elected a Republican majority in the Senate. They have also been electing members of the House of Representatives and state governors. You can see a full map of the results across the US here: Guardian analysis suggests Harris underperformed compared with 2020 \u2013 but in the states that mattered most it was Trump\u2019s gains that won him the White House Nationwide, the US election was primarily a story of Democratic underperformance rather than huge Republican gains compared to 2020 \u2013 but in the swing states that ultimately decided the victor, it was the opposite story, with Trump\u2019s gains far outstripping Harris\u2019s losses. Across the US, Democrats lost more total votes overall compared with 2020 than Republicans gained: Harris attracted 1.4m fewer votes than her Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, did, while Trump attracted 1.1m more than he did in the previous election. The figures were calculated by looking only at counties that have 100% of their precincts reporting and at least 95% of their estimated ballots counted, and comparing the vote in those areas to 2020. Another way of looking at the numbers is that for every 78 votes Donald Trump gained nationally compared to 2020, Kamala Harris lost 100. But in the seven swing states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 there was an inverse trend: the Democratic vote dropped very slightly but held up quite well compared to 2020, but Trump made enough gains to give him the White House. A large part of Democratic campaign spending was focused on the swing states, suggesting that this helped buoy up Democratic support \u2013 but not enough to overcome a wave of additional Trump voters. At least 24 states also saw a larger drop in Democratic votes than any movement in Republican votes compared with 2020 (looking only at areas where counting was almost complete). Read on here: The UK\u2019s deputy prime minister, meanwhile, revealed she had spoken to the vice-president elect, JD Vance, posting on X that it had been \u201cgood to speak\u201d to the Ohio senator. Like her colleague David Lammy, Angela Rayner has a record of making critical marks of Trump, previously calling him an \u201cabsolute buffoon\u201d over his handling of the Covid crisis. She had told ITV: \u201cHe has no place in the White House. He\u2019s an embarrassment and he should be ashamed of himself, especially when thousands of Americans have died.\u201d After he lost the election in 2020, she said she was \u201cso happy to see the back of Donald Trump\u201d. The awkward comments go both ways, however. In July, Vance said the UK would be an \u201cIslamist country\u201d under the new Labour government. \u201cI have to beat up on the UK \u2013 just one additional thing,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI was talking with a friend recently and we were talking about, you know, one of the big dangers in the world, of course, is nuclear proliferation, though, of course, the Biden administration doesn\u2019t care about it. \u201cAnd I was talking about, you know, what is the first truly Islamist country that will get a nuclear weapon, and we were like, maybe it\u2019s Iran, you know, maybe Pakistan already kind of counts, and then we sort of finally decided maybe it\u2019s actually the UK, since Labour just took over.\u201d In response at the time, Rayner said Vance had said \u201cquite a lot of fruity things in the past\u201d and she does not \u201crecognise\u201d his view of the UK. The British foreign secretary, David Lammy, has described his previous remarks about the US president-elect, Donald Trump, as \u201cdeluded, dishonest, xenophobic, narcissistic\u201d and a \u201cneo-Nazi sympathising sociopath\u201d as old news. Keir Starmer\u2019s government is making efforts to smooth over tensions with the incoming president, whose pledge to raise tariffs on imports into the US could hit the UK economy. Appearing on BBC Newscast, Lammy was pressed on his past critical comments but dismissed them, adding it would be a \u201cstruggle to find any politician\u201d who had not said some \u201cpretty ripe things\u201d about Trump. Asked if he apologised for remarks including calling the president-elect a \u201cneo-Nazi sympathising sociopath\u201d or if Trump brought them up when they met in New York in September, Lammy said \u201cnot even vaguely\u201d. A federal judge has struck down a Biden administration policy that aimed to ease a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants who are married to US citizens. The program, lauded as one of the biggest presidential actions to help immigrant families in years, allowed undocumented spouses and stepchildren of US citizens to apply for a green card without first having to leave the country. The temporary relief from deportation brought a brief sense of security to some 500,000 immigrants estimated to benefit from the program before Texas-based U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker put it on hold in August, days after applicants filed their paperwork. Barker ruled yesterday that the Biden administration had overstepped its authority by implementing the program and had stretched the legal interpretation of relevant immigration law \u201cpast its breaking point.\u201d The short-lived Biden administration initiative known as \u201cKeeping Families Together\u201d would have been unlikely to remain in place after Donald Trump took office in January. But its early termination creates greater uncertainty for immigrant families as many are bracing for Trump\u2019s return to the White House. CNN\u2019s latest projection of the crucial races to gain control of the House has Republicans ahead in ten of the contests, with, according to their projections, only six victories needed to tip them over the magic 218 for control. AP has called 410 of the 435 races, with the Republicans seven away from control of the House. Reuters reports that speaking in Budapest, German chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose own government is in crisis, has said \u201cWe will continue to work well with the future American president\u201d when asked about the election of Donald Trump. Scholz added \u201cthe question of how this can be achieved has been the subject of our discussion,\u201d referring to a meeting of senior European leaders held yesterday in Hungary. Writing for MSNBC, political columnist Zeeshan Aleem has pinpointed what he says is the one sentence that shows how defeated Kamala Harris misread the election. He described her telling Sunny Hostin on ABC\u2019s The View that she wouldn\u2019t have changed anything about the Biden administration\u2019s policies as \u201can act of political malpractice.\u201d He writes: Harris was in a tricky position during the campaign \u2014 she was running simultaneously as incumbent and newcomer, and it\u2019s difficult to create distance from an administration whose accomplishments one wants credit for. But it was far from an inescapable predicament: Competent politicians often get away with talking out of both sides of their mouth. Harris could\u2019ve said that she took pride in working with Biden in shepherding the US out of the Covid crisis, but that she could hear the American people say that they were still hurting, and that she stood for a sharply new perspective on the economy that was laser-focused on bringing down costs. Her limited discussion of inflation lacked a clear story or theory of society. Who was to blame for why everything became so expensive? She left hammering corporate greed on the table, and her initial broadsides against big business ebbed as she sought out the input and support of Wall Street and Silicon Valley and even chose billionaires as surrogates. The Republicans are just a handful of calls away from gaining control of the House, but House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has said he can still see a path to victory for the Democratic party. In an interview overnight, quoted by the Hill website, Jeffries said: We still have a clear pathway to taking back the majority. Of course that runs through Arizona and Oregon and five races that are flip opportunities in California that are too close to call and too early to call. You can find the latest results for the US Senate, House and governor elections here \u2026 The election of Donald Trump has far-reaching consequences for US foreign policy, including the Biden administration\u2019s long-standing support for Ukraine. This morning, Hungary\u2019s far-right prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has said he expects US funding to end. Reuters quotes Orb\u00e1n as saying \u201cThe Americans will quit this war, first of all they will not encourage the war. Europe cannot finance this war alone.\u201d In this morning\u2019s First Edition newsletter, my colleagues Archie Bland and our senior international affairs correspondent Emma Graham-Harrison discuss what Trump means for Ukraine \u2026 Our latest episode of Politics Weekly America dropped in the last couple of hours. With Donald Trump president-elect, a 6-3 conservative majority in the US supreme court, and a majority secured in the Senate, Jonathan Freedland speaks to the Washington Post reporter Marianna Sotomayor about what happens if Democrats are not victorious in the lower chamber \u2026 You can listen to it here: Can the Democrats salvage the House of Representatives? \u2013 podcast China is bracing itself for four years of volatile relations with its biggest trading partner and geopolitical rival, as the dust settles on the news that Donald Trump will once again be in the White House. On Thursday China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, congratulated Trump on his victory and said that the two countries must \u201cget along with each other in the new era\u201d, according to a Chinese government readout. \u201cA stable, healthy and sustainable China-US relationship is in the common interest of both countries and is in line with the expectations of the international community,\u201d Xi said. The Guardian\u2019s Amy Hawkins and Helen Davidson report: Jared Kushner, son-in-law of US president-elect Donald Trump, will not return to the White House, the Financial Times reported on Friday, but Kushner could advise on Middle East policy, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. President-elect Donald Trump has named Susie Wiles, the manager of his victorious election campaign, as his White House chief of staff, the first woman to hold the influential role. Wiles is widely credited within and outside Trump\u2019s inner circle for running what was, by far, his most disciplined and well-executed campaign, and was seen as the leading contender for the position. She largely avoided the spotlight, even refusing to take the mic to speak as Trump celebrated his victory early on Wednesday morning. Wiles\u2019s hire is Trump\u2019s first major decision as president-elect and one that could be a defining test of his incoming administration, as he must quickly build the team that will help run the federal government. Meanwhile the Republicans are edging closer to a House majority, after picking up two more hard-fought seats in Pennsylvania. Democrats won another seat in New York, defeating a third Republican incumbent in that state, and three US House seats in Nevada will remain under Democratic control after a sweeping win Thursday for the incumbents, but Republicans need just seven more seats to reach a majority of 218. Here are the other key recent developments: Speaking to NBC News, Donald Trump made clear that the mass deportations of undocumented immigrants that he campaigned on will be a top priority of his administration. \u201cWe obviously have to make the border strong and powerful and, and we have to \u2013 at the same time, we want people to come into our country,\u201d Trump said, adding that, \u201cI\u2019m not somebody that says, \u2018No, you can\u2019t come in.\u2019 We want people to come in\u201d The former CIA director and US defense secretary Leon Panetta predicted Trump will give Benjamin Netanyahu a \u201cblank check\u201d in the Middle East, possibly opening the way for all-out war between Israel and Iran Joe Biden, in a speech from the White House, said he will \u201censure a peaceful and orderly transition\u201d to Donald Trump, while calling on the country to \u201cbring down the temperature\u201d Biden is to focus on government funding and hurricane relief in his final weeks as president. With the clock ticking toward the end of his presidency, Joe Biden will focus on keeping the government funded and open, pass the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), rush assistance to communities battered by hurricanes Helene and Milton, as well as confirm judicial nominees The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, congratulated Donald Trump on winning the US presidential election, and said he was willing to talk to him. \u201cI would like to congratulate him on his election as president,\u201d Putin said in Sochi, a resort on the Black Sea Several key races remain to be called, including the presidential outcomes in swing states Arizona and Nevada (where Trump is tipped to win), Senate races in those two states plus Pennsylvania and, perhaps most importantly, control of the House Based on analyses of election results so far, it appears that Trump won by driving out the Republican base and making gains among certain groups that typically back Democrats. But split-ticket voters stepped up for Democratic senators and a governor in swing states, reducing their losses in what was otherwise a rough election The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates further, saying progress has been made against the wave of inflation that struck the United States during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, which was likely a major factor in voters choosing Donald Trump as the next president Trump\u2019s sentencing in his business fraud trial scheduled for later this month? Probably not happening, Politico reports Gavin Newsom, the California governor and potential presidential candidate some day, called the legislature into a special session to prepare to fight Trump Democrats aired grievances over Harris\u2019s election loss, with many pointing the finger at Biden and his aborted attempt at a second term Americans are stockpiling abortion pills as Trump\u2019s victory seems set to put foes of the procedure into positions of power Harris was unable to settle on an effective message against Trump, and was hobbled from the start by Biden\u2019s low approval ratings, a New York Times postmortem of her campaign finds",

      "bodyText": "An alliance of golf organisations has revealed an alternative plan for central Sydney\u2019s Moore Park course, after the NSW government announced plans last year to halve it to a nine-hole course, and convert 20 hectares to public park. The NSW government says nearly 700,000 people live within five km of Centennial Parklands, most in high-rise apartments with little green space. The government proposal would turn over 20 hectares \u2013 nine holes of golf \u2013 to public parklands by mid-2026. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The move has been resisted by golfers and an alliance of industry bodies \u2013 Golf Australia, PGA of Australia, Golf NSW and Moore Park golf club \u2013 has responded with its own plan to convert what it says is under-utilised land at the northern end of the course, while retaining 18 golf holes for competition. The golfing alliance plan includes a green-roofed 500-space multi-storey car park, BMX track, dog park, skate park, basketball and futsal courts, an adventure playground and three km of walking and running trails. Jared Kendler, the leader of Save Moore Park Golf said the alternative proposal aligned with the government\u2019s vision to make Moore Park more accessible for more people. \u201cBy enhancing existing infrastructure and revitalising unused and under-utilised areas, the initiative aims to create a park that caters to diverse recreational interests in a financially sustainable way that solves the many challenges in the broader precinct,\u201d Kendler said. \u201cThis exciting master plan delivers a minimum of 15 hectares of quality and connected recreational space for play, exploration, relaxing, walking and sports activities for people of all ages and as such is a win-win-win for the government, the people of Sydney and the visitor economy.\u201d The golf course would be shortened to a par 68, but remain an 18-hole course, allowing competitions to continue. There would also be a mini golf-course, practice putting green and chipping area, and a shortened driving range. Announcing the government\u2019s plan last year, premier Chris Minns said increasing density and apartment living in the suburbs of Green Square, Redfern, Zetland and Waterloo needed to be balanced by more publicly accessible green spaces. He said the proposal to turn part of the golf course over to public parklands \u201cis a good decision when you consider the very limited options when it comes to open space in our community\u201d. Sydney mayor Clover Moore said the area had undergone significant urban renewal since the golf course was established on largely industrial land in 1919. \u201cIt is really about the use of public land \u2026 into the future,\u201d Moore said. \u201cPeople that do the high density [living] really do need access to public parkland.\u201d",

On Friday, an EPA spokesperson said: \u201cThe NSW EPA never stated the balls were \u2018tar\u2019 balls. \u201cInitial testing done by UNSW for [Randwick] council did find hydrocarbons were present in samples but the EPA consistently stated that more extensive analysis was needed to confirm the makeup of the balls.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email In mid-October, Guardian Australia reported the team of scientists analysing the debris was investigating whether the balls could be linked to sewage and whether they could have come from a nearby water treatment plant. But it continued to be widely reported and understood that they were tar balls. Guardian Australia understands the regulator knew the pollutant material was consistent with human-generated waste as early as 25 October. The NSW Greens MP Sue Higginson said that should have been communicated immediately. \u201cThe EPA knew what was in the public\u2019s mind, and it was their duty to correct it as soon as they knew,\u201d Higginson said. \u201cIt is concerning that the EPA would choose to correct the public record about such a significant error of fact through a media release on one of the busiest media days of the last decade.\u201d Higginson said it was concerning that the authority had released \u201ca much more detailed analysis, which really pivots to a completely different scenario than tar balls\u201d on Wednesday. Higginson said the regulator should apologise and \u201cgive the public some form of guarantee the systems that have led to these failures will be addressed and rectified\u201d. She said concern for public health should be paramount considering the balls were \u201cpossibly highly toxic sewage products\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019ve got human faeces, you\u2019ve got methamphetamines, THC. All of these substances are harmful. They are pollutants. They are toxins. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that the point source isn\u2019t continuing to pollute in other areas.\u201d The EPA spokesperson said \u201cdue to the complex makeup of both organic and inorganic materials, we are unable to definitively pinpoint a source\u201d. \u201cAll beaches that were impacted have been cleaned up and reopened by Randwick City council and there have been no further reports of debris.\u201d A Sydney Water spokesperson said \u201cthere have been no issues with the normal operations of the Bondi or Malabar wastewater treatment plants\u201d. \u201cSydney Water acknowledges the tar balls may have absorbed wastewater discharge, which was already present in the water while forming, however, they did not form as a result of our wastewater discharges.\u201d Higginson said: \u201cI know Sydney Water has come out and said there is nothing wrong with our sewage systems. We need a further view on that.\u201d Randwick council was contacted for comment.",
