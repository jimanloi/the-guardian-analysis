The site displayed a large chance of Trump winning before the election, giving Kamala Harris a minimal one, out of line with most mainstream polls.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s discouraging that the current administration would seek a last-ditch effort to go after companies they deem to be associated with political opponents,\u201d Coplan wrote. \u201cWe are deeply committed to being non-partisan, and today is no different, but the incumbents should do some self-reflecting and recognize that taking a more pro-business, pro-startup approach may be what would have changed their fate this election.\u201d</p> <p>The Department of Justice is investigating Polymarket for allegedly allowing US-based users to bet on the site, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday evening.</p> <p>Polymarket users can place bets on the outcome of yes-or-no questions that range widely in subject. <a href=\"https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/10/30/polymarket-trump-election-crypto-wash-trading-researchers/\">Fortune</a> reported the week before the election that the site was rife with wash-trading, an illegal type of market manipulation.</p> <p>\u201cThis is obvious political retribution by the outgoing administration against Polymarket for providing a market that correctly called the 2024 presidential election,\u201d Polymarket told media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal.</p> <p>\u201cPolymarket is a fully transparent prediction market that helps everyday people better understand the events that matter most to them, including elections.\u201d</p> <p>Making bets and predictions on Polymarket is not allowed in the US, though users can and do circumvent the prohibition via virtual private networks (VPNs). A week ago, the company announced it would resume operations in the US. The company had paid a $1.4m fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2022 for failing to register with the agency as required and was forced to pause trading at the same time.</p> <p>The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>When no reason for the raid was given publicly, powerful figures in the technology industry came to Coplan\u2019s defense. The CEO of Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, decried the raid. Brian Armstrong wrote on X: \u201cThis will backfire \u2013 they just made Polymarket even more powerful.\u201d</p> <p>Elon Musk, the richest man in the world and one of the president-elect\u2019s closest advisors, wrote, \u201cThis seems messed up\u201d in response to the news.</p> <p>Coplan himself has been photographed with Donald Trump Jr, and claimed last week to have fielded calls from \u200bthe president-elect\u2019s Mar-a-Lago\u200b resort as votes were counted.\u200b</p>",

      "bodyText": "The FBI raided the home of the chief executive of the predictive betting site Polymarket and seized his phone late on Wednesday. Shayne Coplan, the 26-year-old CEO of the company, woke early on Wednesday morning in Manhattan to federal agents in his home, the New York Post first reported. Coplan himself was not arrested, the company said. On X, formerly Twitter, Coplan wrote on Wednesday evening: \u201cNew phone, who dis?\u201d Polymarket claimed the raid was retaliation for its users betting overwhelmingly that Donald Trump would win the election. The site displayed a large chance of Trump winning before the election, giving Kamala Harris a minimal one, out of line with most mainstream polls. \u201cIt\u2019s discouraging that the current administration would seek a last-ditch effort to go after companies they deem to be associated with political opponents,\u201d Coplan wrote. \u201cWe are deeply committed to being non-partisan, and today is no different, but the incumbents should do some self-reflecting and recognize that taking a more pro-business, pro-startup approach may be what would have changed their fate this election.\u201d The Department of Justice is investigating Polymarket for allegedly allowing US-based users to bet on the site, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday evening. Polymarket users can place bets on the outcome of yes-or-no questions that range widely in subject. Fortune reported the week before the election that the site was rife with wash-trading, an illegal type of market manipulation. \u201cThis is obvious political retribution by the outgoing administration against Polymarket for providing a market that correctly called the 2024 presidential election,\u201d Polymarket told media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal. \u201cPolymarket is a fully transparent prediction market that helps everyday people better understand the events that matter most to them, including elections.\u201d Making bets and predictions on Polymarket is not allowed in the US, though users can and do circumvent the prohibition via virtual private networks (VPNs). A week ago, the company announced it would resume operations in the US. The company had paid a $1.4m fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2022 for failing to register with the agency as required and was forced to pause trading at the same time. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When no reason for the raid was given publicly, powerful figures in the technology industry came to Coplan\u2019s defense. The CEO of Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, decried the raid. Brian Armstrong wrote on X: \u201cThis will backfire \u2013 they just made Polymarket even more powerful.\u201d Elon Musk, the richest man in the world and one of the president-elect\u2019s closest advisors, wrote, \u201cThis seems messed up\u201d in response to the news. Coplan himself has been photographed with Donald Trump Jr, and claimed last week to have fielded calls from the president-elect\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort as votes were counted.",

Several called for at least a 75% cut by 2035 to protect the environment and the economy.</p> <p>Amanda McKenzie, the chief executive of the Climate Council, said the UK\u2019s commitment showed action to cut emissions was in the national interest of countries across the globe.</p> <p>She said the council\u2019s scientific analysis found Australia should be reaching net zero emissions by 2035, and the world should reach this mark by 2040, if it was to meet the Paris agreement goal of limiting global heating to well below 2C since pre-industrial times. She said it would require Australia cutting emissions by 75% by 2030. \u201cThe lion\u2019s share of effort has to happen this decade,\u201d McKenzie said.</p> <p>The few countries to announce 2035 commitments at Cop29 include Brazil, the host of next year\u2019s Cop30 summit. It <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2024-11/Brazil_Second%20Nationally%20Determined%20Contribution%20%28NDC%29_November2024.pdf\">set an emissions reduction target of between 59% and 67%</a> compared with 2005 levels.</p> <p>Brazil is one of the world\u2019s 10 top emitters, but as a developing country is not expected to act as rapidly as wealthy nations.

He said Australia was better placed than many other countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions at relatively low cost as it still used a lot of coal and that could largely be replaced with renewable energy. \u201cThe UK and Australia are different economies,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia is blessed with some of the world\u2019s best and cheapest renewable energy resources and any target we put forward needs to be making sure we\u2019re taking advantage of that considerable advantage and going to the highest possible ambition.\u201d Jackson said people often viewed a climate target as an abstract commitment, but it mattered because it was \u201cessentially an investment signal\u201d. \u201cThe fundamental point is if you want to be prosperous as an economy you have to have a strong target because if you don\u2019t investors will take their capital elsewhere,\u201d he said. Alison Reeve, the Grattan Institute\u2019s deputy energy and climate change program director and previously a public servant working on climate policy, said the UK differed from Australia, in part because it has lost a lot of heavy industry. She said it could be harder for the UK to make deeper emissions cuts than Australia in parts of its economy because its climate was colder, its housing stock was older and it was more reliant on gas for heating. Reeve said an important point that some in Australia had yet to grasp was that it could not be a fossil fuel economy and a renewable energy superpower at the same time because \u201cbeing a renewable energy superpower relies on its customers stopping buying fossil fuels\u201d. She said emissions reduction targets were \u201cas much about ambition for what the future economy will look like\u201d as the number. \u201cMaybe the UK has grasped that upside \u2013 that it\u2019s also about creating new industries and capitalising on the transition,\u201d she said. The Greens and teal independent MPs have urged the major parties to announce 2035 targets before the election. Several called for at least a 75% cut by 2035 to protect the environment and the economy. Amanda McKenzie, the chief executive of the Climate Council, said the UK\u2019s commitment showed action to cut emissions was in the national interest of countries across the globe. She said the council\u2019s scientific analysis found Australia should be reaching net zero emissions by 2035, and the world should reach this mark by 2040, if it was to meet the Paris agreement goal of limiting global heating to well below 2C since pre-industrial times. She said it would require Australia cutting emissions by 75% by 2030. \u201cThe lion\u2019s share of effort has to happen this decade,\u201d McKenzie said. The few countries to announce 2035 commitments at Cop29 include Brazil, the host of next year\u2019s Cop30 summit. It set an emissions reduction target of between 59% and 67% compared with 2005 levels. Brazil is one of the world\u2019s 10 top emitters, but as a developing country is not expected to act as rapidly as wealthy nations. Campaigners said its plan was an improvement, but that more detail and deeper cuts were needed. An Australian government spokesperson said there was a process to setting UN climate commitments \u2013 known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs \u2013 that included receiving advice from the Climate Change Authority. \u201cWe\u2019re on track for our 2030 targets and we\u2019ll set 2035 targets that are in the best interest of Australia,\u201d they said. \u201cThose targets will be ambitious, but achievable.\u201d The spokesperson contrasted the government\u2019s position with the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, who has said he would abolish Labor\u2019s 2030 target (a 43% cut) \u2013 a position that would put Australia at odds with the Paris agreement \u2013 and not announce a replacement 2030 target or a 2035 target before the election. Coalition plans include slowing the rollout of large-scale renewable energy, extending the life of ageing coal plants and supporting more gas-fired power while it develops a plan to eventually build publicly owned nuclear generators. It says it could do this by 2037, but experts say creating a nuclear industry would take until after 2040. The government announced on Wednesday it would support international climate action in the region by guaranteeing up to US$200m for the Asian Development Bank to lend to Pacific and south-east Asian countries. It said it would enable the bank to make more than US$900m in additional loans for climate mitigation and adaptation projects. Climate finance \u2013 both setting a new global goal to help poor countries and working out how to reach it \u2013 is a central focus of the Cop29 summit. Developing countries want guarantees of US$1tn a year in funds by 2035 to help them cut emissions and adapt to worsening extreme weather.",

Carsley has seen nine players withdraw from his final squad in interim charge \u2013 some are clearly injured but others risk being accused of taking advantage of the situation \u2013 and Kane fears that the culture instilled by Gareth Southgate has ebbed away.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe joy to play for England \u2013 he brought that back,\u201d Kane told ITV. \u201cEvery camp people were excited to come, every camp people wanted to play for England. That\u2019s the most important thing. England comes before anything. England comes before club. England, it\u2019s the most important thing you play as a professional footballer. Gareth was hot on that.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t afraid to make decisions if that started to drift from certain players. It\u2019s a shame this week. Obviously it\u2019s a tough period of the season. Maybe there\u2019s been a little taking advantage of that. I don\u2019t really like it if I\u2019m totally honest.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite was replaced by Liverpool\u2019s Jarell Quansah after becoming the latest player to pull out on Wednesday. England had already lost Trent Alexander-Arnold, Levi Colwill, Cole Palmer, Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Bukayo Saka and Aaron Ramsdale. </p> \n<p>Kane was, however, far more positive about the appointment of Tuchel. \u201cI was surprised to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not expecting it. I worked with Thomas last year and had a really good relationship with him and expected him to go back to club football but I was pleasantly surprised and he was a big part of me going to Bayern Munich. He is an all-round great person and he will bring a lot of energy and passion to the team. You have to try to pick the best coach to win a major tournament and we are at that stage now.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe only step is to win and Thomas brings a winning mentality. Especially at tournaments, something he excels in. Tactically, he is one of the best managers there is. He had a certain way at Bayern but that was different to Chelsea so it will be interesting to see how he sees us. Tactically he has an amazing brain and he understands all the small things which matter.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kane believes that the Football Association have found the right successor for Southgate. \u201cHe is straight talking if you are doing well or bad,\u201d he said. \u201cHe treats you like an adult and on the pitch he is demanding.\u201d</p> \n<p>Carsley, meanwhile, has promised to stay true to his attacking principles against Greece and go in search of the two-goal win that will put his side back on track to return to the top tier of the Nations League. The pressure is on, with England second in Nations League Group B2. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s important we try to win the game and perform well,\u201d Carsley said. \u201cThey are the priorities. The type of team I will pick \u2013 as you can probably guess \u2013 will be quite attacking. That\u2019s the way I coach and how I want their attitudes to be, I want to attack. Hopefully that will work out well.\u201d</p> \n<p>Carsley, who could hand debuts to the Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones and the Newcastle left-back Lewis Hall, is short of options. He was forced to insist England caps have not been cheapened and he also found himself caught up in a club versus country dispute.</p> \n<p>Grealish has not played since 20 October and Pep Guardiola was not impressed to see him selected. However, the Manchester City manager\u2019s suggestion that there had been no contact from the FA\u2019s medical team drew a rebuke from Carsley.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe medical teams are constantly talking throughout squad selection, regardless of whether there are games or not,\u201d Carsley said. \u201cWe are constantly getting updates. The medical departments have brilliant communication between club and country.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was always the case we were going to get the players who were potentially going to miss out in to be assessed. Jack was one of them. He was assessed and sent back and it was as clear as that.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Harry Kane is set to be a shock omission from Lee Carsley\u2019s England team for Thursday\u2019s must-win Nations League match against Greece in Athens. The captain has travelled to the Greek capital and is not believed to have an injury, with the selection news understood to have caused surprise within a dressing room that has been undermined by a flurry of withdrawals. Carsley has been keen to try new things during his interim tenure; he started Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden as false 9s in an ultra-attacking lineup against Greece at Wembley last month \u2013 which ended in a disastrous 2-1 defeat. He is plainly undeterred and is expected to prefer Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role this time. Kane has never made any secret about England always coming first for him and, in an interview he pre-recorded with ITV on Tuesday, he worried whether some of his teammates feel the same, saying that club should never come before country. Carsley has seen nine players withdraw from his final squad in interim charge \u2013 some are clearly injured but others risk being accused of taking advantage of the situation \u2013 and Kane fears that the culture instilled by Gareth Southgate has ebbed away. \u201cThe joy to play for England \u2013 he brought that back,\u201d Kane told ITV. \u201cEvery camp people were excited to come, every camp people wanted to play for England. That\u2019s the most important thing. England comes before anything. England comes before club. England, it\u2019s the most important thing you play as a professional footballer. Gareth was hot on that. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t afraid to make decisions if that started to drift from certain players. It\u2019s a shame this week. Obviously it\u2019s a tough period of the season. Maybe there\u2019s been a little taking advantage of that. I don\u2019t really like it if I\u2019m totally honest.\u201d The Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite was replaced by Liverpool\u2019s Jarell Quansah after becoming the latest player to pull out on Wednesday. England had already lost Trent Alexander-Arnold, Levi Colwill, Cole Palmer, Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Bukayo Saka and Aaron Ramsdale. Kane was, however, far more positive about the appointment of Tuchel. \u201cI was surprised to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not expecting it. I worked with Thomas last year and had a really good relationship with him and expected him to go back to club football but I was pleasantly surprised and he was a big part of me going to Bayern Munich. He is an all-round great person and he will bring a lot of energy and passion to the team. You have to try to pick the best coach to win a major tournament and we are at that stage now. \u201cThe only step is to win and Thomas brings a winning mentality. Especially at tournaments, something he excels in. Tactically, he is one of the best managers there is. He had a certain way at Bayern but that was different to Chelsea so it will be interesting to see how he sees us. Tactically he has an amazing brain and he understands all the small things which matter.\u201d Kane believes that the Football Association have found the right successor for Southgate. \u201cHe is straight talking if you are doing well or bad,\u201d he said. \u201cHe treats you like an adult and on the pitch he is demanding.\u201d Carsley, meanwhile, has promised to stay true to his attacking principles against Greece and go in search of the two-goal win that will put his side back on track to return to the top tier of the Nations League. The pressure is on, with England second in Nations League Group B2. \u201cIt\u2019s important we try to win the game and perform well,\u201d Carsley said. \u201cThey are the priorities. The type of team I will pick \u2013 as you can probably guess \u2013 will be quite attacking. That\u2019s the way I coach and how I want their attitudes to be, I want to attack. Hopefully that will work out well.\u201d Carsley, who could hand debuts to the Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones and the Newcastle left-back Lewis Hall, is short of options. He was forced to insist England caps have not been cheapened and he also found himself caught up in a club versus country dispute. Grealish has not played since 20 October and Pep Guardiola was not impressed to see him selected. However, the Manchester City manager\u2019s suggestion that there had been no contact from the FA\u2019s medical team drew a rebuke from Carsley. \u201cThe medical teams are constantly talking throughout squad selection, regardless of whether there are games or not,\u201d Carsley said. \u201cWe are constantly getting updates. The medical departments have brilliant communication between club and country. \u201cIt was always the case we were going to get the players who were potentially going to miss out in to be assessed. Jack was one of them. He was assessed and sent back and it was as clear as that.\u201d",

Within minutes on Wednesday, Trump nominated the hawkish senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio\">Marco Rubio</a> to be his secretary of state and then chose Tulsi Gabbard \u2013 a former Hawaii House Democrat who has been accused of defending Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad and said the west provoked Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine \u2013 as his director of national intelligence (DNI).</p> <p>Like Trump\u2019s own reading of world politics, his personnel choices appear to be driven by an idiosyncratic and impulsive understanding of personal relationships and rivalries \u2013 and a preference for a certain malleability of character as well.</p> <p>\u201cClearly, these are loyalty choices in many respects, and that\u2019s that\u2019s not so unusual,\u201d said Dr Ian Lesser, distinguished fellow at the German Marshall Fund, a prominent thinktank. \u201cThere are policy lines that run through these picks, but loyalty seems to trump professional experience in some cases.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/trump-matt-gaetz-attorney-general\">Trump picks far-right congressman Matt Gaetz as attorney general</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Former allies have spoken derisively of the process. \u201cThe word loyalty is often used,\u201d said John Bolton, a former national security adviser under Trump. \u201cI think that\u2019s the wrong word. Actually, I think what Trump wants from his advisers is fealty, really a feudal sense of subservience.\u201d</p> <p>Among those who were discarded for apparent insubordination during the selection process were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pompeo\">Mike Pompeo</a>, Trump\u2019s secretary of state and CIA director, and his UN ambassador Nikki Haley, who criticised him during the campaign.</p> <p>\u201cHe may get [fealty], but I will tell you that that will not serve him well over the course of his next term \u2013 and it certainly won\u2019t serve the country well,\u201d said Bolton.</p> <p>Many, such as Rubio, hold views that are in the mainstream in Washington: they are China hawks, vocal supporters of Israel, and have hewed their skepticism of US support for Ukraine to match Trump\u2019s own.</p> <p>While not complete unknowns, Lesser said, \u201cthey\u2019re not, in a sense, from the known world, as far as the foreign security policy establishment is concerned\u201d.</p> <p>But others, such as Pete Hegseth, the military veteran and former Fox News commentator tapped by Trump for secretary of defense, pending a confirmation process, have no government experience and appear to have chosen for their theatricality and close rapport with the president-elect.</p> <p>Hegseth also appears primed to carry Trump\u2019s crusade against government efforts at inclusivity and diversity into the defense establishment. \u201cThe dumbest phrase on planet earth in the military is \u2018our diversity is our strength\u2019,\u201d Hegseth said on the Shawn Ryan Show, a podcast, earlier this month.</p> <p>Others are more conventional choices. Michael Waltz, a Florida congressman who Trump has chosen as his national security adviser, is a former Green Beret who previously served as a defense policy director for secretaries of defense Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a stark contrast between Waltz and Rubio, on the one hand, with [Pete] Hegseth on the other,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow and director of research in the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cLoyalty to Trump is a common thread. That said, he is somewhat forgiving, especially since Rubio once ran against him.\u201d</p> <p>Among establishment actors, the \u201creal concern is about Hegseth and his largely invented tirades against a supposedly woke military and chairman of the joint chiefs\u201d, said O\u2019Hanlon.</p> <p>If there is a common denominator in the new-found cabinet, then it lies mainly in Trump\u2019s own vision of an America First foreign policy: one in which his brand of economic nationalism translates into foreign policy (making China an economic and therefore strategic rival); where support for Europe may be made contingent on US commercial interests; where US support for Ukraine is seen by the real estate developer as a losing deal; and where lip service is given to ending war around the world but Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu is first told his country should do what it has to do in Gaza.</p>    <p>Most of those views sit comfortably with the conservative foreign policy set in Washington, but the litmus test for many of the appointees has been Ukraine and Nato, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/ukraine-trump-victory\">Trump\u2019s skepticism about the war</a> has moved many in his party to oppose further aid for Kyiv. Many of those selected for the cabinet had openly supported US support for Ukraine in the past.

      "bodyText": "As Donald Trump rushes to fill out his cabinet and enact his America First agenda in the United States and abroad, a clear throughline for his foreign policy and national security team has been a vocal loyalty to the president-elect \u2013 at least in this election cycle. The rapidly expanding roster includes established \u2013 and some Maga supporters would say establishment \u2013 foreign policy hawks, and a neophyte defense secretary who until this week was still a conservative commentator on Fox News. The putative team is a study in contrasts. Within minutes on Wednesday, Trump nominated the hawkish senator Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state and then chose Tulsi Gabbard \u2013 a former Hawaii House Democrat who has been accused of defending Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad and said the west provoked Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine \u2013 as his director of national intelligence (DNI). Like Trump\u2019s own reading of world politics, his personnel choices appear to be driven by an idiosyncratic and impulsive understanding of personal relationships and rivalries \u2013 and a preference for a certain malleability of character as well. \u201cClearly, these are loyalty choices in many respects, and that\u2019s that\u2019s not so unusual,\u201d said Dr Ian Lesser, distinguished fellow at the German Marshall Fund, a prominent thinktank. \u201cThere are policy lines that run through these picks, but loyalty seems to trump professional experience in some cases.\u201d Former allies have spoken derisively of the process. \u201cThe word loyalty is often used,\u201d said John Bolton, a former national security adviser under Trump. \u201cI think that\u2019s the wrong word. Actually, I think what Trump wants from his advisers is fealty, really a feudal sense of subservience.\u201d Among those who were discarded for apparent insubordination during the selection process were Mike Pompeo, Trump\u2019s secretary of state and CIA director, and his UN ambassador Nikki Haley, who criticised him during the campaign. \u201cHe may get [fealty], but I will tell you that that will not serve him well over the course of his next term \u2013 and it certainly won\u2019t serve the country well,\u201d said Bolton. Many, such as Rubio, hold views that are in the mainstream in Washington: they are China hawks, vocal supporters of Israel, and have hewed their skepticism of US support for Ukraine to match Trump\u2019s own. While not complete unknowns, Lesser said, \u201cthey\u2019re not, in a sense, from the known world, as far as the foreign security policy establishment is concerned\u201d. But others, such as Pete Hegseth, the military veteran and former Fox News commentator tapped by Trump for secretary of defense, pending a confirmation process, have no government experience and appear to have chosen for their theatricality and close rapport with the president-elect. Hegseth also appears primed to carry Trump\u2019s crusade against government efforts at inclusivity and diversity into the defense establishment. \u201cThe dumbest phrase on planet earth in the military is \u2018our diversity is our strength\u2019,\u201d Hegseth said on the Shawn Ryan Show, a podcast, earlier this month. Others are more conventional choices. Michael Waltz, a Florida congressman who Trump has chosen as his national security adviser, is a former Green Beret who previously served as a defense policy director for secretaries of defense Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates. \u201cThere is a stark contrast between Waltz and Rubio, on the one hand, with [Pete] Hegseth on the other,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow and director of research in the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cLoyalty to Trump is a common thread. That said, he is somewhat forgiving, especially since Rubio once ran against him.\u201d Among establishment actors, the \u201creal concern is about Hegseth and his largely invented tirades against a supposedly woke military and chairman of the joint chiefs\u201d, said O\u2019Hanlon. If there is a common denominator in the new-found cabinet, then it lies mainly in Trump\u2019s own vision of an America First foreign policy: one in which his brand of economic nationalism translates into foreign policy (making China an economic and therefore strategic rival); where support for Europe may be made contingent on US commercial interests; where US support for Ukraine is seen by the real estate developer as a losing deal; and where lip service is given to ending war around the world but Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu is first told his country should do what it has to do in Gaza. Most of those views sit comfortably with the conservative foreign policy set in Washington, but the litmus test for many of the appointees has been Ukraine and Nato, where Trump\u2019s skepticism about the war has moved many in his party to oppose further aid for Kyiv. Many of those selected for the cabinet had openly supported US support for Ukraine in the past. Those now chosen for his administration appear to have received the memo. In choosing Rubio, Trump appeared to nod toward the reality that he does not hold carte blanche, including over the US Congress, and repeatedly noted that Rubio had managed the \u201cWashington gridlock\u201d and would continue to do so after a likely confirmation. \u201cI have worked with Marco Rubio for more than a decade on the intelligence committee \u2026 and while we don\u2019t always agree, he is smart, talented, and will be a strong voice for American interests around the globe,\u201d said Mark Warner, a Democrat and the committee chair for the Senate intelligence committee. Rubio\u2019s reported rival was Ric Grenell, a combative and controversial former ambassador to Germany under Trump who had feuded with Angela Merkel and other leading German politicians in one of the testiest periods for transatlantic relations in recent memory. But instead of choosing a close and loyal supporter, Trump went with the more conventional choice for secretary of state. \u201cI think what these picks suggest is that the idea that we\u2019re moving towards isolationism is not correct,\u201d said Lesser. \u201cWe may be moving towards more unilateralism \u2026 but not isolationism in the classic way. You cannot hold those views about China or Israel or Iran without being, in some sense, internationally active.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 15 November 2024.

      "body": "<p>Spy Whale does exactly what it says on the tin. It\u2019s a documentary about a whale that was, in all probability \u2013 if not in all cetacean consciousness \u2013 a spy. For the Russians. In 2019, a beluga whale who would eventually be named Hvaldimir (a portmanteau of the Norwegian word for \u201cwhale\u201d and Putin\u2019s first name) approached a fishing boat off Ing\u00f8ya Island, virtually the northernmost point of Scandinavia. It was wearing a harness that was cutting into its flesh and appeared to be seeking help, as intelligent marine mammals are known to do.</p> <p>The boat\u2019s captain, Joar Hesten, radioed for help from J\u00f8rgen Ree Wiig \u2013 whose job at the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries it is to free whales who get caught up in fishing equipment \u2013 and kept Hvaldimir with the boat by feeding him fish until Wiig could travel the five hours to meet them. Together they eventually got the harness off. There is footage of their achievement, which involved Hesten risking his life by joining the distressed whale in the freezing water. \u201cPeople had put him in this situation in the first place,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to make it right.\u201d Hesten is the calmest man you will ever meet. If you were a panicking beluga whale stuck in a harness, he is the man you would want at your side. When the last buckle finally opens, \u201cit is one of the best moments of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI just wished him luck on his journey.\u201d</p> <p>But Hvaldimir didn\u2019t go far. Apparently used to people and unused to finding his own food, he stayed with Hesten\u2019s and other boats before taking himself off to Hammerfest harbour, where he did \u201ctricks\u201d and became a tourist attraction. Meanwhile, the media followed up on the harness, which had attachments that seemed once to have held cameras and buckles inscribed with \u201cEquipment of St Petersburg\u201d.</p> <p>If you think you can guess where this is going \u2013 you are quite right. Those two rather large clues, plus the fact that a drone was seen following Hvaldimir for 30 miles, makes it quite likely that the whale was part of a Russian surveillance operation. Northern Norway is near Murmansk, home of a Russian naval base where Putin is thought to have resurrected a cold war training programme for whales (and dolphins originally, but they all died because nobody \u2013 and really I do feel the Soviets should have been better at this \u2013 realised the waters would be too cold for them) that ended when the USSR collapsed.</p> <p>The bulk of the documentary is taken up with a long, yet not overly detailed or fascinating description of the US cetacean training programmes in the 1950s and 60s (they used seals too, but these don\u2019t get a look-in here. If there is a pinniped union, they should write a stiff letter at least). They were taught to swim to objects too far down for men to reach, sending camera footage back to base; trace enemy swimmers by the noise they made, and push paddles when they heard them; and to place magnetic listening devices on submarines and \u2013 theoretically at least \u2013 mines too. And they could be taken from place to place, slung under a helicopter, and set to work wherever their bosses felt they were most needed.</p> <p>There is less detail about the equivalent Russian programme, but it was largely assumed then and now to be running along the same lines. And then up pops Hvaldimir to suggest that it still is.</p> <p>All this is interspersed with footage of Hvaldimir entertaining the growing crowds at Hammerfest, and interviews with those charged with ensuring his welfare and deciding whether he should be taken to an aquarium or left to return to the wild (he learned to feed himself so it was the latter in the end). There is also additional beluga whale footage, which is nice to look at but does push the film to a very stretched-feeling 90 minutes. It was undoubtedly done to give us time to appreciate the majesty of the beast and to ponder, as Hesten gestures to at the start, man\u2019s warlike tendencies and our willingness to interfere with animals for our own ends. But it ends up feeling thin and unsatisfactory, especially when there is no new evidence about Hvaldimir or the Russian training programme. What answers there are (the buckles marked \u201cSt Petersburg\u201d are indeed Russian-made, the harness means the whale probably diverted from a surveillance mission rather than escaped from a pen) have an inescapable \u201cUh-<em>\u2019kay</em>\u201d feel about them. Sometimes less \u2013 say 30 minutes less \u2013 is more.</p> <p>\u2022 Secrets of the Spy Whale aired on BBC Two and is now on iPlayer.</p>",

It was wearing a harness that was cutting into its flesh and appeared to be seeking help, as intelligent marine mammals are known to do. The boat\u2019s captain, Joar Hesten, radioed for help from J\u00f8rgen Ree Wiig \u2013 whose job at the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries it is to free whales who get caught up in fishing equipment \u2013 and kept Hvaldimir with the boat by feeding him fish until Wiig could travel the five hours to meet them. Together they eventually got the harness off. There is footage of their achievement, which involved Hesten risking his life by joining the distressed whale in the freezing water. \u201cPeople had put him in this situation in the first place,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to make it right.\u201d Hesten is the calmest man you will ever meet. If you were a panicking beluga whale stuck in a harness, he is the man you would want at your side. When the last buckle finally opens, \u201cit is one of the best moments of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI just wished him luck on his journey.\u201d But Hvaldimir didn\u2019t go far. Apparently used to people and unused to finding his own food, he stayed with Hesten\u2019s and other boats before taking himself off to Hammerfest harbour, where he did \u201ctricks\u201d and became a tourist attraction. Meanwhile, the media followed up on the harness, which had attachments that seemed once to have held cameras and buckles inscribed with \u201cEquipment of St Petersburg\u201d. If you think you can guess where this is going \u2013 you are quite right. Those two rather large clues, plus the fact that a drone was seen following Hvaldimir for 30 miles, makes it quite likely that the whale was part of a Russian surveillance operation. Northern Norway is near Murmansk, home of a Russian naval base where Putin is thought to have resurrected a cold war training programme for whales (and dolphins originally, but they all died because nobody \u2013 and really I do feel the Soviets should have been better at this \u2013 realised the waters would be too cold for them) that ended when the USSR collapsed. The bulk of the documentary is taken up with a long, yet not overly detailed or fascinating description of the US cetacean training programmes in the 1950s and 60s (they used seals too, but these don\u2019t get a look-in here. If there is a pinniped union, they should write a stiff letter at least). They were taught to swim to objects too far down for men to reach, sending camera footage back to base; trace enemy swimmers by the noise they made, and push paddles when they heard them; and to place magnetic listening devices on submarines and \u2013 theoretically at least \u2013 mines too. And they could be taken from place to place, slung under a helicopter, and set to work wherever their bosses felt they were most needed. There is less detail about the equivalent Russian programme, but it was largely assumed then and now to be running along the same lines. And then up pops Hvaldimir to suggest that it still is. All this is interspersed with footage of Hvaldimir entertaining the growing crowds at Hammerfest, and interviews with those charged with ensuring his welfare and deciding whether he should be taken to an aquarium or left to return to the wild (he learned to feed himself so it was the latter in the end). There is also additional beluga whale footage, which is nice to look at but does push the film to a very stretched-feeling 90 minutes. It was undoubtedly done to give us time to appreciate the majesty of the beast and to ponder, as Hesten gestures to at the start, man\u2019s warlike tendencies and our willingness to interfere with animals for our own ends. But it ends up feeling thin and unsatisfactory, especially when there is no new evidence about Hvaldimir or the Russian training programme. What answers there are (the buckles marked \u201cSt Petersburg\u201d are indeed Russian-made, the harness means the whale probably diverted from a surveillance mission rather than escaped from a pen) have an inescapable \u201cUh-\u2019kay\u201d feel about them. Sometimes less \u2013 say 30 minutes less \u2013 is more. \u2022 Secrets of the Spy Whale aired on BBC Two and is now on iPlayer.",

On Capitol Hill, he has repeatedly disrupted House proceedings, including once barging into a secure facility where Democrats were holding a deposition hearing.</p> <p>In 2018, he was condemned for inviting a Holocaust denier to Trump\u2019s State of the Union address. A year later, he hired a speechwriter who had been fired by the Trump White House after speaking at a conference that attracts white nationalists.</p> <p>Months after the January 6 attack on the Capitol, Gaetz embarked on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d tour with Marjorie Taylor Greene, the hard-right Georgia congresswoman, in which they amplified the former president\u2019s false claims of fraud in the 2020 election.</p> <p>After House Republicans\u2019 worse than expected performance in the 2022 midterms, Gaetz capitalized on his conference\u2019s wafer-thin majority to extract promises of rule changes from McCarthy, who had to endure 15 rounds of voting before becoming speaker in January 2023. Nine months later, Gaetz used those rule changes to force McCarthy out of the speaker\u2019s chair.</p> <p>More recently, Gaetz has served as an adviser to Trump as the former president successfully sought a second term. According to <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-preparing-debate-matt-gaetz-tulsi-gabbard/story?id=113505132\">ABC News</a>, Gaetz helped Trump prepare for his September debate against Kamala Harris by peppering him with questions about his potential vulnerabilities, including Trump\u2019s multiple criminal indictments and his shifting stance on abortion access.</p> <p>As attorney general, Gaetz would have a powerful perch to prosecute Trump\u2019s political enemies, as the president-elect has promised to do. Gaetz may also attempt to purge the justice department of many longtime staffers, after Trump spread baseless claims that the federal government had been \u201cweaponized\u201d against him.</p> <p>But before Gaetz can take on the role, he will need the approval of the Senate, where he may face a chilly reception. With Senate Republicans\u2019 53-seat majority, Gaetz could still be confirmed, but some early warning signs appeared immediately after Trump\u2019s announcement.</p> <p>Susan Collins, a Republican senator of Maine, told reporters on Capitol Hill that she was \u201cshocked\u201d by the news.</p> <p>\u201cThat shows why the advice and consent process [of Senate confirmation] is so important,\u201d Collins said, <a href=\"https://x.com/nicholaswu12/status/1856803881889452509\">per Politico</a>. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure that there will be a lot of questions raised at his hearing.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has announced his intention to nominate Matt Gaetz, a hard-right congressman from Florida known for inflaming tensions within the House Republican conference, as attorney general. Gaetz, a longtime Trump loyalist, gained attention last year after leading the successful charge to oust his fellow Republican Kevin McCarthy as House speaker. Gaetz and seven other House Republicans joined Democrats in voting to remove McCarthy last October, kicking off a weeks-long scramble to find a new speaker. McCarthy held Gaetz personally responsible for his removal and even funded an unsuccessful primary challenge against his former colleague. McCarthy suggested Gaetz pushed for his ouster because of an ethics committee investigation into allegations that Gaetz paid for and engaged in sexual relations with an underage girl. That investigation in effect ended on Wednesday night, however, when Gaetz resigned from Congress after Trump\u2019s nomination. In February 2023, the justice department declined to bring charges of sex trafficking against Gaetz, who has denied wrongdoing since the allegations first came to light. Even before McCarthy\u2019s removal, Gaetz had cultivated a reputation as a rightwing firebrand who did not shy away from conflict with Democrats and fellow Republicans alike. \u201cFlorida Man. Built for the Battle,\u201d reads Gaetz\u2019s bio on X, formerly Twitter. Gaetz followed his father into politics more than two decades ago. After serving in the Florida statehouse, Gaetz was elected in 2016 to represent a ruby-red chunk of the Florida Panhandle. Like Trump, to whom he is fiercely loyal, Gaetz is more interested in sparring with political foes than in the dry business of governance, according to his critics. On Capitol Hill, he has repeatedly disrupted House proceedings, including once barging into a secure facility where Democrats were holding a deposition hearing. In 2018, he was condemned for inviting a Holocaust denier to Trump\u2019s State of the Union address. A year later, he hired a speechwriter who had been fired by the Trump White House after speaking at a conference that attracts white nationalists. Months after the January 6 attack on the Capitol, Gaetz embarked on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d tour with Marjorie Taylor Greene, the hard-right Georgia congresswoman, in which they amplified the former president\u2019s false claims of fraud in the 2020 election. After House Republicans\u2019 worse than expected performance in the 2022 midterms, Gaetz capitalized on his conference\u2019s wafer-thin majority to extract promises of rule changes from McCarthy, who had to endure 15 rounds of voting before becoming speaker in January 2023. Nine months later, Gaetz used those rule changes to force McCarthy out of the speaker\u2019s chair. More recently, Gaetz has served as an adviser to Trump as the former president successfully sought a second term. According to ABC News, Gaetz helped Trump prepare for his September debate against Kamala Harris by peppering him with questions about his potential vulnerabilities, including Trump\u2019s multiple criminal indictments and his shifting stance on abortion access. As attorney general, Gaetz would have a powerful perch to prosecute Trump\u2019s political enemies, as the president-elect has promised to do. Gaetz may also attempt to purge the justice department of many longtime staffers, after Trump spread baseless claims that the federal government had been \u201cweaponized\u201d against him. But before Gaetz can take on the role, he will need the approval of the Senate, where he may face a chilly reception. With Senate Republicans\u2019 53-seat majority, Gaetz could still be confirmed, but some early warning signs appeared immediately after Trump\u2019s announcement. Susan Collins, a Republican senator of Maine, told reporters on Capitol Hill that she was \u201cshocked\u201d by the news. \u201cThat shows why the advice and consent process [of Senate confirmation] is so important,\u201d Collins said, per Politico. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure that there will be a lot of questions raised at his hearing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thank you for joining me for this match. Chelsea squeak past an impressive Celtic to keep their running streak going to nine match this season across all competitions. To rehash the action have a read of the report below. We will be back next week with more Women\u2019s Champions League action, as well as WSL coverage this weekend. Bye for now. A slice of history: Celtic were impressive this evening and if they had turned in that Ashworth-Clifford chance the points may have shared this evening. In the other 8pm GMT kick-off Lyon have beaten Roma 3-0. The first yellow card for Beever-Jones was bizarre and even she looked confused by her receiving it. But the second was for that late challenge and so a red was shown. Late drama. Beever-Jones had a late challenge right at the end which means she will miss the reverse fixture of this tie next week. Despite both sides having chances in the second half, the score remains unchanged from half-time and so Chelsea make it nine wins from nine across all competitions this season. They top Group B in the Women\u2019s Champions League, while Celtic remain bottom. It\u2019s a second yellow for the Chelsea player. 90 + 3 min: Celtic make a change with Ashworth-Clifford off for McAneny. 90 + 1 min: Bronze is down here and is receiving treatment, I think she is okay. Yeah she is back to her feet but she isn\u2019t happy she wasn\u2019t given anything as it was a brutal challenge. There will be four minutes added. 89 min: Lawton gets a yellow card for a foul on Reiten and so Chelsea have a free kick in a good position. Macario and Reiten stand over it but it is the USA international who takes it. Her delivery was poor as it goes straight out of play. 87 min: Celtic do look the more likely to score at the moment and so it is no wonder Chelsea are taking time to run the ball through their backline to run down some of the clock. They do eventually unleash an attack with Kaneryd getting a shot away but Daugherty easily saves. 85 min: Ashworth-Clifford has a fantastic ball forward, it isn\u2019t worked well enough to create a chance yet but they keep coming. However, they then see it out and so Chelsea have a throw in to clear their lines. 83 min: Beever-Jones is okay to continue, though she keeps touching her face. It looked as though she attempted to head the ball but instead hit another head. Celtic are off here and Noonan takes a ount at goal but Musovic saves, Beever-Jones then looks so confused as she is shown a yellow card \u2013 it\u2019s not clear why. 81 min: What a save from Daugherty, I thought Chelsea were in there. A great cross in from Reiten saw Kaneryd and Jean-Francios combine but the keeper is a safe pair of hands. Beever-Jones is down in the area now, it looks like she hit her head, she is receiving treatment. 80 min: Chelsea settling down now as the Celtic momentum dies down slightly, the Blues are running the ball through the team in some patient buld-up. Kaneryd is found in the box but Clark muscles her off the ball and clears. 78 min: Some of the play at the back from Chelsea has been really risky, a back pass from Bronze just now was so loose and it left Musovic so vulnerable. The keeper managed to control but this performance has not been a clean one from the visitors. 76 min: Reiten is ruled offside again, twice so far from the replacement. Celtic have another chance with Ashworth-Clifford but Musovic collects her cross. 74 min: I held my breath there, Celtic were so close. Ashworth-Clifford made a great run and crossed in a good ball which beat Musovic but no one was there to tap it home. That was the chance. 72 min: Chelsea continue to rain down chances on the Celtic goal but somehow the hosts are keeping them out. The latest comes from Bjorn which is straight over the bar. 70 min: Chelsea again weaving into the box and it\u2019s Macario who takes a shot but it\u2019s wide. Barclais is winded and she needs some treatment. During that Celtic make a change with Ross, Gallacher and Agnewoff for Cavanagh, Noonan and Cross. Barclais is okay to continue. 68 min: Celtic push Chelsea back to their halfway line but they do work it back into the box, a shot comes in but Daugherty blocks and then it\u2019s cleared. 67 min: The delivery was good and Musovic punches clear. Ashworth-Clifford sends it back in but it has too much on it and it\u2019s out for a goal kick. A good spell for Celtic. 65 min: A period of some scrappy play has ensued but Celtic have done really well defensively to prevent Chelsea from scoring in this half. They are throwing everything at them. And here they go on a good attack, Ashworth-Clifford sent a ball in but Perisset clears, almost turning it into her own goal. Corner to come. 63 min: Reiten was down for a prolonged period there but she doesn\u2019t need treatment and is back to her feet. 61 min: Kaneryd sent a beautiful ball in but it bounces between her teammates and so comes to nothing. Celtic make a change with Hayes off for Bruna Costa. 59 min: Manchester City will also be watching this game with a keen eye as they play Chelsea this weekend in the WSL. They will feel encouraged by how exposed Chelsea are on the counter, even with the new players on the pitch it feels like a real weakness. Chelsea make another change with Macario on for Hamano. 57 min: Reiten is pinged for offside as Chelsea set up yet another attack. It feels a question of when not if Chelsea will score again. 55 min: Celtic\u2019s performance is an improvement on their other games they have played so far in this competition, if they play like this in their final matches they could manage to sneak through. Though, admittedly, it would be tricky. 53 min: Chelsea are like a wasp in the summer when you have a sweet snack or drink, they won\u2019t leave you alone and will just keep buzzing. They get into the box again but Reiten\u2019s effort is over the bar. 51 min: McGregor again being a stonewall in defence, she has been Celtic\u2019s standout player this evening. Chelsea do eventually work it into the box but it is repelled and out for a throw in. The visitors start yet another attack and it ends with a corner. It\u2019s taken short but eventually sent goalward a goalline clearance from McGregor. 49 min: If you are wondering who the Chelsea captain is now Cuthebert is off, it is Reiten. Some back and forth from both teams but no chances to note. 47 min: Chelsea start the second half well with some play around the box but the final pass can\u2019t be found for now. So can Celtic restore their lead? Or will Chelsea see this out? All to come. It looks like Reiten, Kaneryd and Bronze are all ready to come on, not bad subs to use are they. Baltimore, Cuthbert and Lawrence are all off. In the other 8pm GMT kick-off Lyon are beating Roma 2-0 thanks to two goals by Melchie Dumornay. The goals from the game so far: Celtic broke the deadlock with a fantastic counterattack goal from Agnew but Chelsea immediately responded with two goals from Hamano and Lawrence. Chelsea, overall, have looked the better team but Celtic have proved they can strike at any time. All to play for. 45 + 1 min: There will be three minutes added. 45 min: Ashworth-Clifford takes a shot with no support and Musovic easily collects. 44 min: Chelsea again with a lot of the ball, it\u2019s put into the box and it pinballs almost to Beever-Jones\u2019 feet but Daugherty collects. 42 min: The corner is taken short, it comes into the box and to Cuthbert who sends it over the bar. The Chelsea captain wants another corner but it is ruled an goal kick. 41 min: Agnew is hobbling slightly but she isn\u2019t calling for treatment and so we play on. Chelsea then win a corner after a Baltimore shot is deflected out. 39 min: Chelsea have had a long time on the ball and it ends with Cuthbert taking a shot but Daugherty easily collects. 37 min: Chelsea win yet another corner, which has not proved to be a great part of their game this evening, and Baltimore takes it once again. She sends it in but it is well handled by Lawton. 36 min: Are Chelsea going to be in for their third here? Not yet. Hamano sees it in but it\u2019s easily cleared. They come again but Cuthbert\u2019s effort is saved by Daugherty. 34 min: My word, I was writing about an almost chance for Celtic and then Chelsea score. Agnew almost beat Musovic but Chelsea worked it quickly, peppering the goal with chances until Lawrence turned it home. Chelsea are ahead. 32 min: That will be frustrating for Celtic as they did have all the momentum. Chelsea are on the hunt for a second with a long ball from Lawrence into the box but no one is there to pick it up. 30 min: Beever-Jones works it into the box and finds Hamano, who is unmarked. Hamano immediately goes into the goal to retrieve the ball, showing Chelsea\u2019s intent tonight. Chelsea respond. 28 min: The delivery is good but a foul on Musovic sees Chelseable to clear. 27 min: Chelsea have yet another corner and this time Baltimore is the taker. She sends it in but it\u2019s headed clear. Celtic look to counter but Chelsea do well to thwart the attack but eventually Celtic get it into the box and they win a corner. Chelsea slightly shaken here. 25 min: Well who would have predicted this? Chelsea were so vulnerable on the counter and Celtic absolutely carved them open. Celtic manager Sadiku went crazy in celebration, what a moment for Agnew. 24 min: It all started with McGregor on the counter, she fed a lovely ball to Agnew and Musovic wasn\u2019t set. Game on, the ground is bouncing. HUGE! 22 min: Baltimore is playing some beautiful football out there tonight, she keeps getting it into the box from impossible positions but none of her teammates have turned it goalward yet. But the French international is a huge threat so far. 20 min: Celtic are a tricky team to breakdown and McGregor is making Chelsea\u2019s life that much harder so far, she has been great for the hosts. 18 min: Daugherty is okay to continue, maybe a tactical break there but of course we will never know for sure. 17 min: Celtic only have a few passes before Chelsea win it back. Daugherty is down injured at the moment, she is receiving treatment. 16 min: Cuthbert wins a free kick from a foul by Ross. Hamano takes it short to Lawrence but she can\u2019t even get it in the box before Celtic are all over it. Chelsea need to sort their set pieces out. 14 min: There is a lot of patient build-up play for Chelsea but their final moves on plays just aren\u2019t coming together at the momet, thanks in part to some good Celtic defence. 12 min: Baltimore passes a beautiful ball ti Kaptein but McGregor puts in a well-timed tackle to send it out for a corner. Chelsea use the same set piece play and again it doesn\u2019t work, the Blues need to rethink if they get another in this match, which seems likely. 10 min: Smith is okay to continue and so we resume with the corner. Hamano takes it short and Baltimore sends it in but it\u2019s easily cleared. 9 min: Chelsea have another corner with McGregor putting it out of play but before the set piece is taken Smith needs some treatment, it looks to be a calf issue. 8 min: Kaptein wins the ball back in a good place and she fires a shot but Daugherty saves easily. 7 min: A lot of play in their own half from Celtic. they are finding it tricky to get out of their own half at the moment. Possession exchanging hands quite frequently also as both settle into this one. 5 min: The atmosphere in the Celtic Park is incredible. There must be at least 15,000in this evening. 4 min: Baltimore has a lovely ball inside and a few passes later it comes to Cuthbert but Lawton heads out for a corner. Hamano takes it short and Baltimore sees it in but Bjorn heads over the bar. 2 min: Chelsea have had all the possession so far but Celtic\u2019s defence is aggressive with high press at the moment. Here we go then. Some huddles delaying kick-off slightly but we are underway now. There looks to be a good crowd at Celtic Park with a light show to boot before kick-off. The players will be out on the pitch shortly. Can Chelsea keep their unbeaten run going? Or will Celtic cause an upset? All to come. The two earlier kick-offs today have finished up and it has seen Real Madrid beat FC Twente, the two teams in Chelsea and Celtic\u2019s group, 7-0 including two goals from Maria Mendez. While Wolfsburg have beaten Galatasaray 5-0 which saw Rebecka Blomqvist score a hat-trick. The I\u2019m a Celeb line-up has been announced for this year\u2019s competition and it got me thinking about who would be a good fit from women\u2019s football. Of course Jill Scott won in 2022 but I\u2019d love to know who else you think would do a good job. I think Erin Cuthbert would be a good shout. Email me to get in touch and let me know. Here are how the other two British clubs in the competition got on yesterday: Celtic boss Elena Sadiku said: \u201cThis experience has taught us that this is just a normal game. The occasion is huge, but we still need to do what we can do which is playing football the way we play. We knew it would be tough, but we are going to learn, we are going to grow and we are going to get stronger as a team from playing here.\u201d Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor has said of tonight\u2019s opposition: \u201cWe are focusing on ourselves. We have a lot of quality, but of course, we expect them to come and be really motivated and try to make it hard for us.\u201d The team news is in. Celtic have named a strong side with a fully loaded bench including the Carstens sisters. Celtic: Daugherty, Barclais, N Ross, Gallacher, Smith, Agnew, McGregor, Clark, Ashford-Clifford, Lawton, Bruna Costa. Subs: Logan, Rodgers, Richardson, S Carstens, M Carstens, Cavanagh, Cross, Hayes, Noonan, Munoz, McAney Chelsea, meanwhile, opt for some squad rotations with Zecira Musovic in goal and ERin Cuthbert is captain with Millie Bright not in the squad. Chelsea: Musovic, Perisset, Bjorn,Mpome, Lawrence, Cuthbert, Kaptein. Jean-Francios, Baltimore, Hamano, Beever-Jones. Subs: Hampton, Cox, Bronze, Bartel, Reiten, Kaneryd, Macario Hello and welcome back to our coverage of the Women\u2019s Champions League where tonight we will be focusing on Celtic v Chelsea. Chelsea travel to Scotland as an unbeaten side across all competitions so far this season. They have won every single match they have played under new manager Sonia Bompastor and it will be difficult for Celtic to be the ones to halt their winning run. Celtic, who are currently fourth in the Scottish Premiership, have not won a game in the WCL yet and sit at the bottom of the group table with no points. A win over Chelsea, though unlikely, would resuscitate their campaign. We will take a look at what has been said in the build-up to the game shortly but first let\u2019s take a peek at the team news before kick-off at 8pm GMT.",

The idea is that retirement funds can then invest larger sums into a wider range of riskier and long-term assets such as infrastructure, startups and private equity, while saving on fees paid to bankers, lawyers and advisers.</p> <p>In the chancellor\u2019s inaugural Mansion House speech she will also confirm plans to combine smaller defined-contribution schemes across the country into pools of \u00a325bn to \u00a350bn.</p> <p>If the programme is successful, the government claims that it will be part of the \u201cbiggest pension reforms in decades\u201d while saving money on fees for councils and boosting investment for local areas and national infrastructure.</p> <p>However, Reeves\u2019s announcements echo those made by previous Conservative governments. In 2015, David Cameron, then prime minister, tried to push local funds into eight larger pools.

      "bodyText": "Rachel Reeves will announce plans to merge local government retirement schemes into \u201cmegafunds\u201d as she tries to revive long-running efforts to overhaul the public pension system. She will tell an audience of City leaders and chief executives on Thursday that she will introduce a pensions bill next year aimed at pooling assets from the 86 separate local government pension schemes (LGPS) in England and Wales into eight funds, worth about \u00a350bn, by 2030. Grouped together, the LGPS represents one of the world\u2019s largest defined-benefit schemes, with 6.5 million members and \u00a3360bn in assets. The decision is meant to mirror similar setups in Australia and Canada, where public-sector pension schemes have been consolidated into larger funds that are managed in-house by professional investors. The idea is that retirement funds can then invest larger sums into a wider range of riskier and long-term assets such as infrastructure, startups and private equity, while saving on fees paid to bankers, lawyers and advisers. In the chancellor\u2019s inaugural Mansion House speech she will also confirm plans to combine smaller defined-contribution schemes across the country into pools of \u00a325bn to \u00a350bn. If the programme is successful, the government claims that it will be part of the \u201cbiggest pension reforms in decades\u201d while saving money on fees for councils and boosting investment for local areas and national infrastructure. However, Reeves\u2019s announcements echo those made by previous Conservative governments. In 2015, David Cameron, then prime minister, tried to push local funds into eight larger pools. But his changes failed to set a deadline for consolidation \u2013 which has so far only resulted in about 39% of LGPS assets being pooled into larger funds \u2013 and the process itself came under fire for adding further layers of costs for individual schemes. Last autumn, the former Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt also hinted at further consolidation, saying that by 2040 all local government pension fund assets would be invested in vehicles worth \u00a3200bn or more, leading many to speculate that he wanted to cut groupings down into two or three pools. The Treasury said the government would soon consult on plans to \u201ctake advantage of pension fund size and improve their governance\u201d. The consultation will include plans to have each administering authority set targets for investment in their local economies. The Treasury claims that a 5% target for local investment could secure \u00a320bn for communities. The government said the process would involve independent reviews to ensure each of the 86 administering authorities was \u201cfit for purpose\u201d. However, the chancellor is now under pressure to add green targets to her pension reforms, after leading British actors including Mark Rylance, Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch called for an increase investment in clean energy. Members of the performing arts union Equity have written an open letter to Reeves before her Mansion House speech, asking her to follow through on a key manifesto pledge of requiring financial institutions to adopt science-based plans for limiting global heating. Equity says this means pension funds, banks and insurers could no longer do business with companies expanding fossil fuels. The letter also asks the government to update fiduciary duty law, so that acting in savers\u2019 \u201cbest interests\u201d means taking the effects of the climate crisis and damage to nature into account. Reeves\u2019s Mansion House address is also expected to include plans to shake up the Financial Ombudsman Service. She is also expected to push ahead with another Conservative party plan for a hybrid stock market \u2013 known as the Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System (Pisces) \u2013 that will allow private companies to trade shares at intervals, in an attempt to revive the UK\u2019s flagging IPO market. \u201cLast month\u2019s budget fixed the foundations to restore economic stability and put our public services on a firmer footing. Now we\u2019re going for growth,\u201d Reeves said in a statement. \u201cThat starts with the biggest set of reforms to the pensions market in decades to unlock tens of billions of pounds of investment in business and infrastructure, boost people\u2019s savings in retirement and drive economic growth so we can make every part of Britain better off.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 November 2024.

Dozens of demonstrators, some with Palestinian flags, chanted \u201cAmsterdam is saying no to genocide\u201d and \u201cFree Palestine\u201d. Police in riot gear encircled the group and they were detained and put on buses. Police with expanded stop-and-search powers in the Dutch capital have detained or removed hundreds of demonstrators since last week\u2019s clashes under emergency measures imposed until Thursday. \u201cWe say: Free Palestine. Stop killing innocent people. Stop killing the children,\u201d said one demonstrator, Max van den Berg, 32, calling on the Netherlands to halt its support for Israel. Israel denies genocide in Gaza. It says that forces combating Palestinian Hamas militants that attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, do not target civilians. More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza, according to health officials there, and much of the territory has been destroyed. Amsterdam\u2019s police department said Maccabi fans attacked a taxi and burned a Palestinian flag and were chased down and beaten by anti-Israeli gangs on scooters after an online appeal to taxi drivers. Five people were treated for injuries and discharged from hospitals. Police escorted hundreds of Maccabi fans to their hotels. Israeli and Dutch politicians have denounced the attacks as antisemitic and recalled persecution of Jews during the second world war. Pro-Palestinians countered that they responded to an attack by the Maccabi supporters and provocative anti-Arab chants. Four out of 62 suspects detained during the violence, which included 10 Israelis, remain in custody. Police are still looking for suspects. A detailed report published this week by the city\u2019s mayor, Femke Halsema, concluded that the violence was sparked by \u201ca toxic cocktail of antisemitism, football hooliganism and anger over the war in Palestine and Israel and other parts of the Middle East\u201d. The Netherlands has seen a rise in antisemitic incidents since the Gaza war began in October last year. Under 1% of Amsterdam\u2019s population is Jewish after the Holocaust, while about 15% is Muslim, mostly second- and first-generation immigrants from north Africa and the Middle East.

      "bodyText": "South Korean police have arrested 215 people on suspicion of stealing 320bn won ($228.4m) in the biggest cryptocurrency investment scam in the country. Gyeonggi Nambu provincial police said on Wednesday that the arrests included the alleged mastermind of the organised crime group accused of selling 28 types of virtual tokens to about 15,000 people by promising high returns. Referred to as Mr A, he had fled to Australia but was arrested and extradited. Police have confiscated 22 bitcoins from his accounts and have applied to seize some $34m more. Just 12 people of the 215 remain in custody, according to Yonhap. Police said the group had issued six of the 28 tokens on overseas crypto exchanges and were managing a team of market makers to push up prices. Police described the tokens as \u201cworthless\u201d. Members of the alleged criminal ring are also accused of using personal information garnered through both digital advertising, including nearly 9m phone numbers, and theft to take out fraudulent loans. The group had set up investment consulting companies and sales teams to sell the virtual assets to people who had subscribed to a YouTube channel that had accrued hundreds of thousands of subscribers, the police statement said. They allegedly preyed on middle-aged and elderly victims.",

The Irish media regulator, Coimisi\u00fan na Me\u00e1n, said it issued the ruling after its investigations determined that the social media networks were \u201cexposed to terrorist content\u201d due to weak processes. Such rulings come when a network is subjected to at least two removal orders from EU competent authorities, usually the police, but sometimes a regulator, in the preceding 12 months. Orders under the EU terrorist content online regulation usually require the removal of content within an hour of the order. The Irish media commission gave the social media platforms 12 weeks to make \u201ceffective, targeted and proportionate\u201d measures to stop terrorist content while at the same time respecting freedom of speech rights. \u201cTikTok, X and Meta (in respect of Instagram) will be obliged to take specific measures to protect their services from being used for the dissemination of terrorist content, and to report to Coimisi\u00fan na Me\u00e1n on the specific measures taken within three months from the receipt of the decision,\u201d it said in a statement. Among the measures they must take are the inclusion in their terms and conditions of use provisions to address misuse of the platforms. If the Irish commission deems the measures are not sufficient it can impose fines of up to 4% of global revenue. The European Commission has opened a range of investigations into online platforms since the new Digital Services Act relating to online harms came into force but Ireland\u2019s media regulator plays a particularly important role given the tech companies\u2019 EU headquarters are all sited in Dublin. The scale of the problem facing European regulators was highlighted in May when the European home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, revealed that more than 550 removal orders had been issued since the counter-terrorist online regulation came into force. Concern about terrorist content across many social media platforms has been heightened after the Hamas attacks on Israel last October and arrests in Germany relating to an alleged coup plot. In September the Irish media commission said it had concerns that people were having difficulty reporting illegal content to online platforms and it would be launching a formal review of the reporting processes available to the public.",

Introducing Trump as both a former president and now president-elect, Biden congratulated him on his victory.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to having, like we said, a smooth transition. We\u2019ll do everything we can to make sure you\u2019re accommodated, what you need, and we\u2019re going to get a chance to talk about some of that today,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWelcome back.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/biden-trump-transition-white-house\">\u2018Donald, congratulations\u2019: Biden plays nice as Trump returns to White House</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Despite Trump\u2019s many excoriating comments toward Biden over the years, he thanked the president for the warm reception he received at the White House.</p> \n<p>\u201cPolitics is tough, and it\u2019s, in many cases, not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today, and I appreciate very much a transition that\u2019s so smooth. It\u2019ll be as smooth as it can get. And I very much appreciate that, Joe,\u201d Trump said.</p> \n<p>Reporters attempted to shout questions at Biden and Trump, but both men ignored the queries. The meeting continued for roughly two hours<strong> </strong>after journalists were escorted out of the Oval Office.</p> \n<p>The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, offered few specifics about the meeting, but she noted that Biden described Trump as \u201cgracious\u201d and prepared with \u201ca detailed set of questions\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was indeed very cordial, very gracious and substantive,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cNational security was discussed. Domestic policy issues were discussed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Before meeting with Biden, Trump addressed House Republicans on Capitol Hill, celebrating his party\u2019s victories up and down the ballot last week while suggesting he might seek a third term as president.</p> \n<p>\u201cI suspect I won\u2019t be running again, unless you say, \u2018He\u2019s good, we got to figure something else,\u2019\u201d Trump said, sparking laughter from fellow Republicans in the room.</p> \n<p>Trump has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/18/trump-at-nra-convention-floats-a-three-term-presidency-00158786\">floated</a> the idea of extending his tenure, even though the US constitution bars presidents from serving a third term.</p> \n<p>Introducing Trump on Wednesday, the Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, praised the president-elect as a \u201csingular figure in American history\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ce034755-a195-4341-887e-33c755db67df\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_BKz_rfyXt0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThey used to call Bill Clinton the comeback kid.

On Tuesday, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/trump-elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy\">named</a> Musk and the former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy as co-leaders of a new Department of Government Efficiency. The announcement intensified concerns over how Trump and Musk, known for his slash-and-burn approach to cutting company expenses, might overhaul the federal workforce. Also on Tuesday, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/pentagon-stunned-after-trump-picks-pete-hegseth-for-defence-secretary\">named</a> Pete Hegseth, a veteran and Fox News host with no political experience, to lead the Department of Defense.</p> \n<p>Trump continued his series of cabinet announcements on Wednesday with the news that Marco Rubio, a Republican senator of Florida, would be nominated as secretary of state. He also named Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman, as director of national intelligence and Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman of Florida, as attorney general. All three nominations are subject to Senate approval, and Gabbard and Gaetz specifically may face numerous hurdles to confirmation.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/pompeo-kennedy-and-musk-who-could-be-in-trumps-new-administration\">Trump\u2019s cabinet picks and likely contenders \u2013 so far</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As of Wednesday, Republicans had already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/senate-elections-republicans-win\">won</a> a majority in the Senate, but the House remained up for grabs as ballot-counting continued in 12 uncalled races. However, House Republicans appear poised to capture a narrow majority.</p> \n<p>Trump has already tapped at least three House Republicans for senior roles in his administration. In addition to Gaetz, Elise Stefanik will be nominated as ambassador to the United Nations and Mike Waltz, a Florida representative, will serve as his national security adviser. Republicans currently hold a razor-thin four-seat majority in the House, and if the outcome of vote counts remains as it stands today, a Republican speaker in 2025 would also have a four-seat majority.</p> \n<p>Johnson has said<strong> </strong>he expects Republicans to end up with a larger majority. But each Republican appointment or resignation from the House \u2013 as Governor-elect Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota must do \u2013 diminishes that majority.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have an embarrassment of riches,\u201d Johnson said on Tuesday. \u201cWe have a really talented Republican conference. We\u2019ve got really competent, capable people here. Many of them could serve in really important positions in the new administration, but President Trump fully understands and appreciates the math here, and it\u2019s just a numbers game.\u201d</p> \n<p>The meeting between Biden and Trump on Wednesday reflected a return to a traditional transfer of power, after the custom was somewhat abandoned in 2020. Underscoring<strong> </strong>the acrimony of the 2020 election, Trump eschewed the meeting after being defeated by Biden.</p> \n<p>Melania Trump was also invited to meet with the first lady, Jill Biden, but she declined the invitation. According to the White House, the first lady offered Trump\u2019s team \u201ca handwritten letter of congratulations for Mrs Trump, which also expressed her team\u2019s readiness to assist with the transition\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump met with Joe Biden on Wednesday and promised a transfer of power that is \u201cas smooth as it can get\u201d, as the outgoing US president pledged his administration\u2019s every possible resource to pave the way for his successor. The two men, longtime political rivals who must now work together again to pass the reins of power, shook hands as they met in the Oval Office. Introducing Trump as both a former president and now president-elect, Biden congratulated him on his victory. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to having, like we said, a smooth transition. We\u2019ll do everything we can to make sure you\u2019re accommodated, what you need, and we\u2019re going to get a chance to talk about some of that today,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWelcome back.\u201d Despite Trump\u2019s many excoriating comments toward Biden over the years, he thanked the president for the warm reception he received at the White House. \u201cPolitics is tough, and it\u2019s, in many cases, not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today, and I appreciate very much a transition that\u2019s so smooth. It\u2019ll be as smooth as it can get. And I very much appreciate that, Joe,\u201d Trump said. Reporters attempted to shout questions at Biden and Trump, but both men ignored the queries. The meeting continued for roughly two hours after journalists were escorted out of the Oval Office. The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, offered few specifics about the meeting, but she noted that Biden described Trump as \u201cgracious\u201d and prepared with \u201ca detailed set of questions\u201d. \u201cIt was indeed very cordial, very gracious and substantive,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cNational security was discussed. Domestic policy issues were discussed.\u201d Before meeting with Biden, Trump addressed House Republicans on Capitol Hill, celebrating his party\u2019s victories up and down the ballot last week while suggesting he might seek a third term as president. \u201cI suspect I won\u2019t be running again, unless you say, \u2018He\u2019s good, we got to figure something else,\u2019\u201d Trump said, sparking laughter from fellow Republicans in the room. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of extending his tenure, even though the US constitution bars presidents from serving a third term. Introducing Trump on Wednesday, the Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, praised the president-elect as a \u201csingular figure in American history\u201d. \u201cThey used to call Bill Clinton the comeback kid. [Trump] is the comeback king,\u201d Johnson said. Elon Musk joined Trump at the meeting with House Republicans, sitting in the first row, according to attenders. On Tuesday, Trump named Musk and the former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy as co-leaders of a new Department of Government Efficiency. The announcement intensified concerns over how Trump and Musk, known for his slash-and-burn approach to cutting company expenses, might overhaul the federal workforce. Also on Tuesday, Trump named Pete Hegseth, a veteran and Fox News host with no political experience, to lead the Department of Defense. Trump continued his series of cabinet announcements on Wednesday with the news that Marco Rubio, a Republican senator of Florida, would be nominated as secretary of state. He also named Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman, as director of national intelligence and Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman of Florida, as attorney general. All three nominations are subject to Senate approval, and Gabbard and Gaetz specifically may face numerous hurdles to confirmation. As of Wednesday, Republicans had already won a majority in the Senate, but the House remained up for grabs as ballot-counting continued in 12 uncalled races. However, House Republicans appear poised to capture a narrow majority. Trump has already tapped at least three House Republicans for senior roles in his administration. In addition to Gaetz, Elise Stefanik will be nominated as ambassador to the United Nations and Mike Waltz, a Florida representative, will serve as his national security adviser. Republicans currently hold a razor-thin four-seat majority in the House, and if the outcome of vote counts remains as it stands today, a Republican speaker in 2025 would also have a four-seat majority. Johnson has said he expects Republicans to end up with a larger majority. But each Republican appointment or resignation from the House \u2013 as Governor-elect Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota must do \u2013 diminishes that majority. \u201cWe have an embarrassment of riches,\u201d Johnson said on Tuesday. \u201cWe have a really talented Republican conference. We\u2019ve got really competent, capable people here. Many of them could serve in really important positions in the new administration, but President Trump fully understands and appreciates the math here, and it\u2019s just a numbers game.\u201d The meeting between Biden and Trump on Wednesday reflected a return to a traditional transfer of power, after the custom was somewhat abandoned in 2020. Underscoring the acrimony of the 2020 election, Trump eschewed the meeting after being defeated by Biden. Melania Trump was also invited to meet with the first lady, Jill Biden, but she declined the invitation. According to the White House, the first lady offered Trump\u2019s team \u201ca handwritten letter of congratulations for Mrs Trump, which also expressed her team\u2019s readiness to assist with the transition\u201d.",

Mayor Eric Adams has expressed skepticism about Fare, saying he is concerned it could hurt small property owners. \u201cWe got to get it right, make sure that we reach the goals that we\u2019re looking for, and at the same time don\u2019t hurt small property owners and try to get some relief to some of those who are trying to live in the city,\u201d Adams said on Tuesday during a news conference. \u201cI think the bill has the right intention, but sometimes good intentions do not get the results you\u2019re looking for.\u201d But property owners are far outnumbered by renters in the bustling metropolitan city. 69% of New York City households rent their homes, according to a report by the office of the city comptroller, Brad Lander. Lander, who is running against Adams in the 2025 mayoral race, said in June that the move would be a \u201ccommonsense element of fairness that the party that chooses the broker should pay the fee. Where tenants hire a broker to help them find an appropriate unit, of course they should foot the bill. But where landlords are the ones to identify and hire, they should pay for the broker they have chosen.\u201d State assemblyman Zohran Mamdani pushed back on Adams\u2019s message on X. \u201cNo surprise that Mayor Adams is repeating the talking points of his real estate donors,\u201d said Mamdani, who is also running for mayor. He added that he was grateful to the council member Oss\u00e9 for getting Fare across the finish line.",

They thought the American nightmare was over.</p> \n<p>Then, like in the movies, Democrats woke up in a cold sweat only to realise it wasn\u2019t a dream after all. Instead they are doomed to be supporting players in a sequel. Trump: The Revenge. <em>This time, it\u2019s personal.</em></p> \n<p>On Wednesday, Trump made a triumphant who\u2019s-got-the-last-laugh-now return to Washington, probably the least Trumpy place in the nation: Kamala Harris got 92.5% of the vote here compared to his 6.7%. One of his most recent visits was to appear in court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/04/trump-court-arraignment-power-dynamics-january-6\">as a criminal defendant</a> accused of an attempted coup.</p> \n<p>But hey, who cares about that now? Sporting his red tie, Trump was back in the sacred space where Pelosi, Liz Cheney and others swore he must never foot again: the Oval Office. The 45th and soon-to-be 47th president was hosted by Biden, the 46th, to discuss the presidential transition, a courtesy he never extended to the man who beat him in 2020.</p> \n<p>The pair sat on cream armchairs before a roaring log fire \u2013 the flames licking high and lustily as if to evoke Christopher Marlowe\u2019s line, \u201cWhy, this is hell, nor am I out of it.\u201d Behind Biden was the bust of Robert Kennedy, a former Democratic senator whose son, Robert Kennedy Jr, helped deliver the White House to the Republican Trump.</p> \n<p>\u201cWell, Mr President-elect and former president \u2026 ,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/11/13/remarks-by-president-biden-and-president-elect-trump-in-a-meeting/\">Biden began</a>, shaking the right hand of Trump, whose left hand didn\u2019t quite know what to do as he breathed: \u201cThank you very much, Joe.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/trump-republicans-biden-transfer-of-power\">Trump meets with Biden and promises \u2018smooth as it can get\u2019 transfer of power</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Biden settled on, \u201cDonald, congratulations\u201d \u2013 the first time he had used his rival\u2019s first name since the attempted assassination of Trump in July.</p> \n<p>\u201cThank you very much,\u201d Trump repeated.</p> \n<p>Biden, hands on knees, continued: \u201cAnd looking forward to having a, like we said, smooth transition. Do everything we can to make sure you\u2019re accommodated, what you need. And we\u2019re going to get a chance to talk about some of that today. Welcome. Welcome back.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was doubtless the right and only dignified thing to do, showing the world that the America is still in the business of a peaceful transfer of power despite the stink of 6 January 2021. Yet there is still something jarring about Democrats, who 10 days ago were proclaiming Trump a fascist and an existential threat to American democracy, now treating him like just another politician.

      "bodyText": "Nancy Pelosi once said Donald Trump would be \u201cfumigated out\u201d of the Oval Office if he lost the 2020 presidential election. Joe Biden relished describing him as \u201cthe former guy\u201d and \u201closer\u201d. They thought the American nightmare was over. Then, like in the movies, Democrats woke up in a cold sweat only to realise it wasn\u2019t a dream after all. Instead they are doomed to be supporting players in a sequel. Trump: The Revenge. This time, it\u2019s personal. On Wednesday, Trump made a triumphant who\u2019s-got-the-last-laugh-now return to Washington, probably the least Trumpy place in the nation: Kamala Harris got 92.5% of the vote here compared to his 6.7%. One of his most recent visits was to appear in court as a criminal defendant accused of an attempted coup. But hey, who cares about that now? Sporting his red tie, Trump was back in the sacred space where Pelosi, Liz Cheney and others swore he must never foot again: the Oval Office. The 45th and soon-to-be 47th president was hosted by Biden, the 46th, to discuss the presidential transition, a courtesy he never extended to the man who beat him in 2020. The pair sat on cream armchairs before a roaring log fire \u2013 the flames licking high and lustily as if to evoke Christopher Marlowe\u2019s line, \u201cWhy, this is hell, nor am I out of it.\u201d Behind Biden was the bust of Robert Kennedy, a former Democratic senator whose son, Robert Kennedy Jr, helped deliver the White House to the Republican Trump. \u201cWell, Mr President-elect and former president \u2026 ,\u201d Biden began, shaking the right hand of Trump, whose left hand didn\u2019t quite know what to do as he breathed: \u201cThank you very much, Joe.\u201d Biden settled on, \u201cDonald, congratulations\u201d \u2013 the first time he had used his rival\u2019s first name since the attempted assassination of Trump in July. \u201cThank you very much,\u201d Trump repeated. Biden, hands on knees, continued: \u201cAnd looking forward to having a, like we said, smooth transition. Do everything we can to make sure you\u2019re accommodated, what you need. And we\u2019re going to get a chance to talk about some of that today. Welcome. Welcome back.\u201d It was doubtless the right and only dignified thing to do, showing the world that the America is still in the business of a peaceful transfer of power despite the stink of 6 January 2021. Yet there is still something jarring about Democrats, who 10 days ago were proclaiming Trump a fascist and an existential threat to American democracy, now treating him like just another politician. The normalisation has begun. Trump, fingers pressed together, rejoined: \u201cThank you very much. And politics is tough. And it\u2019s, many cases, not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today. And I appreciate it very much \u2013 a transition that\u2019s so smooth it\u2019ll be as smooth as it can get. And I very much appreciate that, Joe.\u201d Biden replied: \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d The last meeting of these men, combined age 159, in effect ended Biden\u2019s political career.

Chenery wrote the will across two food packaging boxes: one that had contained Young\u2019s frozen fish, and the other Mr Kipling mince pies.</p> <p>The charity\u2019s claim was challenged because the informal will was spread across two separate pieces of packaging. The details written on the fish fillets box, specifying that the house and contents should go to the charity, could not automatically be read as being part of the same document.</p> <p>However, a high court judge ruled that the unconventional document was valid in accordance with the requirements of the 1837 Wills Act and could be entered into probate.</p> <p>Chenery, who killed himself at an unknown age, wrote the will shortly before his death in 2021, with neighbours having witnessed only the signing of the second page.</p>    <p>Sam Chandler, the barrister representing the charity, called upon the judge, Katherine McQuail, to rule that the will could be entered into probate and the money claimed. \u201cThe principal question for the court is whether these pieces of cardboard can be admitted to probate in solemn form,\u201d Chandler told the judge.</p> <p>He said the charity\u2019s claim to the bequest was uncontested and had the \u201csupport of family members\u201d. \u201cVarious family members have explained that diabetes runs in the family,\u201d Chandler said in court.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe two pages are written in the same pen. That seems to indicate they were made at the same time. There is overlapping subject matter.\u201d</p> <p>Chandler said the charity\u2019s position was that \u201cthe court should have no hesitation in proclaiming in favour of this document\u201d as an \u201cintestacy would frustrate the testator\u2019s intentions in light of what the family say about his intentions\u201d. He also told the judge that there was \u201ca longstanding principle that the court should lean against intestacy\u201d.</p> <p>Reaching conclusion in support of Diabetes UK, the judge ruled that it was presumed Chenery \u201chad not intended to die intestate\u201d. Judge McQuail added that she was \u201csatisfied that the two documents should be admitted in solemn form to probate as the last will of the deceased\u201d.</p> <p>Chenery\u2019s unusual way of imparting his final wishes is the latest in a long line of curiously curated wills.

Chenery wrote the will across two food packaging boxes: one that had contained Young\u2019s frozen fish, and the other Mr Kipling mince pies. The charity\u2019s claim was challenged because the informal will was spread across two separate pieces of packaging. The details written on the fish fillets box, specifying that the house and contents should go to the charity, could not automatically be read as being part of the same document. However, a high court judge ruled that the unconventional document was valid in accordance with the requirements of the 1837 Wills Act and could be entered into probate. Chenery, who killed himself at an unknown age, wrote the will shortly before his death in 2021, with neighbours having witnessed only the signing of the second page. Sam Chandler, the barrister representing the charity, called upon the judge, Katherine McQuail, to rule that the will could be entered into probate and the money claimed. \u201cThe principal question for the court is whether these pieces of cardboard can be admitted to probate in solemn form,\u201d Chandler told the judge. He said the charity\u2019s claim to the bequest was uncontested and had the \u201csupport of family members\u201d. \u201cVarious family members have explained that diabetes runs in the family,\u201d Chandler said in court. He added: \u201cThe two pages are written in the same pen. That seems to indicate they were made at the same time. There is overlapping subject matter.\u201d Chandler said the charity\u2019s position was that \u201cthe court should have no hesitation in proclaiming in favour of this document\u201d as an \u201cintestacy would frustrate the testator\u2019s intentions in light of what the family say about his intentions\u201d. He also told the judge that there was \u201ca longstanding principle that the court should lean against intestacy\u201d. Reaching conclusion in support of Diabetes UK, the judge ruled that it was presumed Chenery \u201chad not intended to die intestate\u201d. Judge McQuail added that she was \u201csatisfied that the two documents should be admitted in solemn form to probate as the last will of the deceased\u201d. Chenery\u2019s unusual way of imparting his final wishes is the latest in a long line of curiously curated wills. The billionaire hotelier Leona Helmsley, who died in 2007, left instructions for her $4bn (\u00a32.5bn) fortune to be spent caring for dogs. Her nine-year-old Maltese, Trouble, received $12m (\u00a38m) in the will, with her grandchildren either cut out or ordered to visit their father\u2019s grave annually in order to inherit their share. Trouble\u2019s inheritance was later cut to $2m (\u00a31.2m) by a judge. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, will on Thursday announce the first 30 locations where 50 vending machines will be installed as part of the pilot program, which also includes the Melbourne Immigration Museum, three Northern Health campuses, the Royal Women\u2019s hospital in Parkville and the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. \u201cPads and tampons are not a luxury \u2013 they\u2019re a necessity. And women and girls should be able to access them whenever and wherever they need them,\u201d Allan said. Eleven libraries and 10 Tafes across Melbourne\u2019s suburbs will also receive 32 vending machines, stocked with products designed to last women and girls several days. Fifty machines will begin operating between Thursday and 20 January. By the end of 2025, it is expected there will be 1,500 machines across 700 locations, which will include other public places such as courts and train stations, and possibly shopping centres and sports grounds and facilities. Making free pads and tampons available in public places was a key election commitment the Labor government took to the 2022 state election and is expected to cost $23m to roll out. While the announcement prompted outraged from some men on social media and scorn from conservative commentators, it was popular with women and young voters. The minister for women, Natalie Hutchins, said the initiative would \u201cease cost-of-living pressures for Victorian women\u201d and prevent them from having to choose between buying period products and other necessities. She pointed to not-for-profit organisation Share the Dignity\u2019s Big Bloody Survey, published in August, which found three in five respondents, or 64%, struggled to afford period products. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Nearly one in five (19%) respondents had to improvise on period products due to cost, with some resorting to items such as tea towels, tote bags, toilet paper or socks instead. \u201cWomen spend thousands of dollars over their lifetime on these basic necessities \u2013 this nation-leading program provides cost-of-living relief for women while providing them the basic dignity they deserve,\u201d Hutchins said. Affinity Outdoor has been selected as the government\u2019s official supplier of the vending machines after an expressions-of-interest process.

The Victorian government has made pads and tampons free at government schools since 2020, distributing more than 6.5m in total. Similar vending machines with free period products have been funded by at least one council \u2013 with public toilets in Sydney\u2019s inner-west local government area supplied with them \u2013 while the charity Share the Dignity has also provided pads and tampons from machines across the country. In Scotland, pads and tampons must be made available to anyone who needs them under laws introduced in 2020, while Seoul, in South Korea, has seen free period products distributed in 10 public places as part of a pilot program in 2018. \u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 14 November 2024 to reflect that similar vending machines have been supplied by at least one council and a charity, and Victoria\u2019s scheme is not the first in Australia, as it previously suggested.",

Urfan Sharif also admitted strangling Sara and beating her with a cricket bat while her ankles and wrists were bound with packing tape in the weeks before she was killed. Sharif told jurors he accepted everything that he had told police in a 999 call and a handwritten confession after his daughter\u2019s death. During cross-examination by Caroline Carberry KC, the barrister for his wife, Beinash Batool, he was asked: \u201cDid you kill your daughter by beating?\u201d He replied: \u201cYes, she died because of me.\u201d He admitted he beat Sara \u201cseverely\u201d over a number of weeks because he had been angry the schoolgirl had started soiling herself and vomiting. Sharif, 42, Batool, 30, and Sharif\u2019s brother Faisal Malik, 29, are on trial accused of carrying out a violent \u201ccampaign of abuse\u201d before Sara was found dead in a bunk bed at the family home in Surrey on 10 August 2023. The defendants allegedly killed Sara on 8 August before fleeing to Pakistan, from where Sharif called police to say he had \u201cbeat her up too much\u201d. He had left a handwritten \u201cconfession\u201d near her fully clothed body saying: \u201cI swear to God that my intention was not to kill her. But I lost it.\u201d A postmortem examination found Sara had fractures and 71 external injuries, including burns and human bite marks. Sharif had repeatedly denied responsibility for Sara\u2019s death as he gave evidence at the Old Bailey. But as he was to be cross-examined for the third day, he said: \u201cI want to say something.\u201d He went on to say: \u201cI want to admit that it\u2019s all my fault. I want the court to consider my full note and confession. That I admit what I said in my phone call and my written note, every single word.\u201d Carberry asked: \u201cIn the weeks before she died, she suffered multiple fractures to her body, didn\u2019t she, and it was you who inflicted those injuries, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Sharif replied: \u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d but he denied inflicting burns and bite marks and causing bruising to the head and face. When asked by Carberry if it would help to look at a graphic of the injuries, Sharif said: \u201cNo. I can\u2019t look at that.\u201d He admitted to using a cricket bat and a white metal pole to inflict multiple fractures and other visible marks on Sara\u2019s body, but denied knowledge of a neck injury that broke the schoolgirl\u2019s hyoid bone.

      "body": "<p>The actor Timothy West, whose career ranged from Shakespeare, Ibsen and Pinter on stage to TV appearances in Brass, EastEnders and Great Canal Journeys (with his wife, Prunella Scales), has died aged 90.</p> <p>His children, Juliet, Samuel and Joseph West, said in a statement: \u201cAfter a long and extraordinary life on and off the stage, our darling father, Timothy West, died peacefully in his sleep yesterday evening. He was 90 years old.</p> <p>\u201cTim was with friends and family at the end. He leaves his wife, Prunella Scales, to whom he was married for 61 years, a sister, a daughter, two sons, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. All of us will miss him terribly.</p> <p>\u201cWe would like to thank the incredible NHS staff at St George\u2019s hospital, Tooting, and at Avery Wandsworth for their loving care during his last days.\u201d</p>    <p>Hugely popular, with a commanding stage presence but unassuming personal manner, West toured the UK\u2019s regional theatres with the same adventurous spirit with which he travelled its waterways.</p> <p>\u201cI feel more useful when I\u2019m on the road, touring this country and others, playing in different theatres, exploring different places, meeting different people,\u201d he wrote in his witty 2001 memoir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/apr/15/biography.theatre\">A Moment Towards the End of the Play</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s no way to get rich, or famous, and it drives my agent mad, but I love it.\u201d</p> <p>There were many tributes paid to West after news of his death. The writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth posted on Instagram: \u201cA marvellous man \u2013 a marvellous actor, husband, father, friend. On stage, on screen, on a canal boat, on the end of a pier (he loved a seaside pier!), in the garden with a glass of wine, he was just the best. The great Timothy West has died at 90: what a worthwhile, well-filled life.\u201d</p> <p>West played leading roles in Uncle Vanya, Death of a Salesman, The Master Builder, Long Day\u2019s Journey into Night, Macbeth and, on four occasions, King Lear. He also became known for portraying real-life characters on stage and screen, such as the designer William Morris and conductor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,3605,468909,00.html\">Thomas Beecham</a>, as well as political figures including Mikhail Gorbachev, Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill. West\u2019s films included The Day of the Jackal (1973) and Cry Freedom (1987).</p> <p>A regular presence on television since the 1960s, he played the eponymous king in Edward the Seventh in 1975, was the beekeeper in a sticky situation in Royal Jelly (one of Roald Dahl\u2019s Tales of the Unexpected) in 1980 and had roles in adaptations of Charles Dickens\u2019s novels Hard Times, Oliver Twist and Bleak House. Hard Times, broadcast in 1977, was parodied in the 1983 TV series Brass, where West played the self-made northern businessman Bradley Hardacre. He was made a CBE in 1984.</p> <p>Perhaps his greatest TV success <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/21/great-canal-journeys-timothy-west-prunella-scales-narrowboat\">came with Great Canal Journeys</a>, a funny and moving series that was steered by his family\u2019s passion for narrowboats. Starring West and Scales, the programme was notable for exploring how the pair navigated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/04/prunella-scales-suffering-mild-alzheimers\">Scales\u2019s experiences of dementia</a>. \u201cShe can\u2019t remember things very well, but you don\u2019t have to remember things on the canal,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can just enjoy things as they happen \u2013 so it\u2019s perfect for her.\u201d</p>    <p>Paying tribute to West on Times Radio, the broadcaster and Alzheimer\u2019s campaigner Angela Rippon<strong> </strong>said his death was \u201ca huge loss to everybody\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think between them, Timothy and Pru did an amazing, amazing job of convincing people that dementia was not something that you should be always afraid of, but something that you could embrace and live with and live with well.\u201d </p> <p>West had a daughter, Juliet, with his first wife, Jacqueline Boyer. He and Scales had two sons, Samuel and Joseph. Samuel starred alongside his father on several occasions on stage and screen.</p> <p>Born in Bradford in 1934 to Lockwood West and Olive Carleton-Crowe, both actors, West had an itinerant early childhood.</p> <p>During the second world war the family settled in Bristol, where West\u2019s father joined the war reserve police, and West\u2019s stage debut was opposite his parents in the constabulary\u2019s 1943 panto. He often played truant and was expelled from school, but regularly attended performances at the Little theatre in Bristol.</p>    <p>After directing an award-winning student production of Thornton Wilder\u2019s Our Town in Bristol, he left his job as a quality control engineer at EMI to become an assistant stage manager at Wimbledon theatre in London; he was soon taking to the stage in gradually bigger roles.</p> <p>In the 1960s, he appeared with the Royal Shakespeare Company and, for Prospect theatre company, played Samuel Johnson (opposite Julian Glover as James Boswell). He also starred in The Tempest for Prospect, playing Prospero.</p> <p>On a later Prospect tour he had the roles of Bolingbroke in Shakespeare\u2019s Richard II and Mortimer in Marlowe\u2019s Edward II, with both title roles played by Ian McKellen.</p> <p>It was with Prospect that West first played Lear, aged 37. His fourth time in the role came in 2016 during the EU referendum \u2013 fitting for a play about \u201ctearing up the map, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/02/actors-careers-sian-phillips-timothy-west-janet-henfrey\">old people making a disastrous decision</a> and letting the younger people sort it out\u201d, he said.</p> <p>In 2013 West had a small role in Coronation Street and in 2014 he first appeared on EastEnders as Stan Carter, a character he played for more than a year. His recent TV credits included Gentleman Jack.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 13 November 2024.

      "bodyText": "The actor Timothy West, whose career ranged from Shakespeare, Ibsen and Pinter on stage to TV appearances in Brass, EastEnders and Great Canal Journeys (with his wife, Prunella Scales), has died aged 90. His children, Juliet, Samuel and Joseph West, said in a statement: \u201cAfter a long and extraordinary life on and off the stage, our darling father, Timothy West, died peacefully in his sleep yesterday evening. He was 90 years old. \u201cTim was with friends and family at the end. He leaves his wife, Prunella Scales, to whom he was married for 61 years, a sister, a daughter, two sons, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. All of us will miss him terribly. \u201cWe would like to thank the incredible NHS staff at St George\u2019s hospital, Tooting, and at Avery Wandsworth for their loving care during his last days.\u201d Hugely popular, with a commanding stage presence but unassuming personal manner, West toured the UK\u2019s regional theatres with the same adventurous spirit with which he travelled its waterways. \u201cI feel more useful when I\u2019m on the road, touring this country and others, playing in different theatres, exploring different places, meeting different people,\u201d he wrote in his witty 2001 memoir A Moment Towards the End of the Play. \u201cIt\u2019s no way to get rich, or famous, and it drives my agent mad, but I love it.\u201d There were many tributes paid to West after news of his death. The writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth posted on Instagram: \u201cA marvellous man \u2013 a marvellous actor, husband, father, friend. On stage, on screen, on a canal boat, on the end of a pier (he loved a seaside pier!), in the garden with a glass of wine, he was just the best. The great Timothy West has died at 90: what a worthwhile, well-filled life.\u201d West played leading roles in Uncle Vanya, Death of a Salesman, The Master Builder, Long Day\u2019s Journey into Night, Macbeth and, on four occasions, King Lear. He also became known for portraying real-life characters on stage and screen, such as the designer William Morris and conductor Thomas Beecham, as well as political figures including Mikhail Gorbachev, Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill. West\u2019s films included The Day of the Jackal (1973) and Cry Freedom (1987). A regular presence on television since the 1960s, he played the eponymous king in Edward the Seventh in 1975, was the beekeeper in a sticky situation in Royal Jelly (one of Roald Dahl\u2019s Tales of the Unexpected) in 1980 and had roles in adaptations of Charles Dickens\u2019s novels Hard Times, Oliver Twist and Bleak House. Hard Times, broadcast in 1977, was parodied in the 1983 TV series Brass, where West played the self-made northern businessman Bradley Hardacre. He was made a CBE in 1984. Perhaps his greatest TV success came with Great Canal Journeys, a funny and moving series that was steered by his family\u2019s passion for narrowboats. Starring West and Scales, the programme was notable for exploring how the pair navigated Scales\u2019s experiences of dementia. \u201cShe can\u2019t remember things very well, but you don\u2019t have to remember things on the canal,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can just enjoy things as they happen \u2013 so it\u2019s perfect for her.\u201d Paying tribute to West on Times Radio, the broadcaster and Alzheimer\u2019s campaigner Angela Rippon said his death was \u201ca huge loss to everybody\u201d. \u201cI think between them, Timothy and Pru did an amazing, amazing job of convincing people that dementia was not something that you should be always afraid of, but something that you could embrace and live with and live with well.\u201d West had a daughter, Juliet, with his first wife, Jacqueline Boyer. He and Scales had two sons, Samuel and Joseph. Samuel starred alongside his father on several occasions on stage and screen. Born in Bradford in 1934 to Lockwood West and Olive Carleton-Crowe, both actors, West had an itinerant early childhood. During the second world war the family settled in Bristol, where West\u2019s father joined the war reserve police, and West\u2019s stage debut was opposite his parents in the constabulary\u2019s 1943 panto. He often played truant and was expelled from school, but regularly attended performances at the Little theatre in Bristol. After directing an award-winning student production of Thornton Wilder\u2019s Our Town in Bristol, he left his job as a quality control engineer at EMI to become an assistant stage manager at Wimbledon theatre in London; he was soon taking to the stage in gradually bigger roles. In the 1960s, he appeared with the Royal Shakespeare Company and, for Prospect theatre company, played Samuel Johnson (opposite Julian Glover as James Boswell). He also starred in The Tempest for Prospect, playing Prospero. On a later Prospect tour he had the roles of Bolingbroke in Shakespeare\u2019s Richard II and Mortimer in Marlowe\u2019s Edward II, with both title roles played by Ian McKellen. It was with Prospect that West first played Lear, aged 37. His fourth time in the role came in 2016 during the EU referendum \u2013 fitting for a play about \u201ctearing up the map, old people making a disastrous decision and letting the younger people sort it out\u201d, he said. In 2013 West had a small role in Coronation Street and in 2014 he first appeared on EastEnders as Stan Carter, a character he played for more than a year. His recent TV credits included Gentleman Jack. This article was amended on 13 November 2024. In an earlier version, Angela Rippon\u2019s comments were mistakenly attributed to Joanna Lumley.",

It\u2019s a very clear proposition to me \u2013 if you do not protect [the female] category, or you are in any way ambivalent about it for whatever reason, then it will not end well for women\u2019s sport. I come from a sport where that is absolutely sacrosanct.\u201d The issue became a major story at the Paris Olympics boxing tournament with Algeria\u2019s Imane Khelif and Taiwan\u2019s Lin Yu-ting both winning gold medals after being banned from the 2023 world championships. The International Boxing Association (IBA), which ran the event, said it had tested both fighters and their \u201cDNA was that of a male consisting of XY chromosomes\u201d. However the IOC decided that Khelif and Lin should be allowed to fight in Paris as it said they were female on their passports. It also accused the IBA of violating medical and ethical norms by leaking the test results. Asked whether he winced when he saw the boxing in Paris, Coe replied: \u201cI was uncomfortable.\u201d Earlier this year, World Athletics introduced a $50,000 prize for all gold medallists in Paris. And Coe made it clear that he wanted the policy expanded to all sports in future Games given the IOC could afford it. \u201cI have always talked about the wherewithal and the wellbeing of the athletes and giving them financial skin in the game,\u201d said Coe. \u201cI think that can be done in a way that is respectful of the Olympic philosophy but I have to accept we\u2019re in a different landscape.\u201d Coe has earned plaudits at World Athletics for tackling doping by introducing the Athletics Integrity Unit, banning Russia and ensuring a gender equal board. But he insisted that his best attribute was being a consensus builder. \u201cOne of my strengths is being good at building teams,\u201d he said. \u201cI did it in London. I did it at the National Olympic Committee. I did it at World Athletics. And I do, genuinely, work by consensus. But that doesn\u2019t mean that on occasions I\u2019m not prepared to make tough decisions.\u201d Asked whether the IOC needed to let the air in and be more democratic, Coe nodded. \u201cYou have got to give the members more voice. We\u2019ve got exceptional people sitting in that membership, and I want to make sure that they are absolutely utilised to the best of their ability. \u201cThere are people in the movement that would be first pick on any international board. And I\u2019m not just talking about commercial people \u2013 we\u2019ve got cultural leaders, film-makers, educationalists, coaches, athletes, media owners, royal families and politicians. Coe also made it clear he believed he could be a catalyst for change. \u201cI have been in training for this for most of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I can make a difference, and I do have a plan and a vision for what that difference looks like. \u201cI think change is necessary, but in a respectful and sensible and thoughtful way, not at the risk of destabilising. We\u2019re in a fast-changing landscape, and change is absolutely crucial. I have a passion for the Olympic movement. It\u2019s been my life.\u201d",

The floods, which are the worst natural disaster in Spain\u2019s recent history, have led to confrontations between the regional and local authorities, as well as a huge protest over the weekend. Growing public anger over the authorities\u2019 handling of the emergency brought 130,000 people on to the streets of the city of Valencia on Saturday evening to call for the resignation of the regional president, Carlos Maz\u00f3n, who is overseeing the relief effort. Maz\u00f3n, a member of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP), is under mounting pressure after it emerged he had a three-hour lunch with a journalist on 29 October, the day the torrential rains hit the region, and did not arrive at the emergency command centre until 7.30pm that evening. Much of the anger also stems from the fact that Maz\u00f3n\u2019s administration waited almost 14 hours before sending emergency civil protection messages to people\u2019s mobile phones on 29 October, despite the series of weather warnings issued by Aemet early that morning and the previous evening.

Police then diverted the ambulance to a public hospital, where \u201claw enforcement officers and members of a self-defence group surrounded the ambulance, slashed the tires, and teargassed MSF staff inside the vehicle to force them out\u201d. The wounded patients were taken a short distance away and at least two were executed, the group said. MSF said its staff members were \u201cviolently attacked, insulted, teargassed, threatened with death, and held against their will for more than four hours before being allowed to leave\u201d. The MSF ambulance was damaged and put out of service in the attack. \u201cThe act is a shocking display of violence and it seriously calls into question MSF\u2019s ability to continue delivering essential care to the Haitian people,\u201d said Christophe Garnier, MSF\u2019s head of mission. The MSF emergency clinic was last year briefly forced to close after a severely wounded patient suspected of being a gang member was dragged from an ambulance outside, beaten and shot dead. MSF is one of the last international humanitarian aid groups still operating in Haiti, which has plunged deeper into turmoil since the president, Jovenel Mo\u00efse, was murdered in his mansion in 2021. Thousands of people have died amid fighting between security forces, self-defence vigilante groups and a coalition of politically connected gangs called Viv Ansanm (Living Together). The humanitarian crisis has been compounded by the fact that several clinics and hospitals have been forced to close because of the violence, including the biggest public hospital, the General hospital. The arrival of a Kenyan-led international policing mission in June prompted a brief lull in the bloodshed, but recent weeks have seen a renewed surge in violence as the heavily armed gangs push on with an attempt to seize total control of the country\u2019s capital. The United States on Tuesday banned all civilian flights to Haiti for a month, a day after three jetliners approaching or departing from Port-au-Prince were hit by gunfire.",

He easily saw off the rightwing opposition leader \u2013 or, rather, both of them.</p> \n  <p>The hit on Nigel Farage was the neatest, and the funniest. The Reform UK leader, who on the basis of today\u2019s interventions also doubles up as MP for Mar-a-Lago, not MP for Clacton, asked a perfectly reasonable question about proscribing the IRRG, but Starmer shot him down with a joke. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/13/wes-streeting-nhs-hospital-league-tables-starmer-badenoch-pmqs-uk-politics-live?page=with:block-67349aef8f08ab632f8ec92b#block-67349aef8f08ab632f8ec92b\">12.30pm</a>.) It was slighly hypocritical, given that Starmer is fast approaching the point where an MP at PMQs is going to welcome the fact that he\u2019s making a rare visit to the UK (a gag told about Tony Blair, when his globetrotting went too far). But the putdown was genuinely funny, and so that did not matter.</p> \n  <p>In the past Starmer has sometimes seemed a bit wary of treating Farage with disdain in the chamber. But maybe he has decided it is safe to hit him hard after all.</p> \n  <p>Starmer also won quite comfortably against Kemi Badenoch, although that probably was more to do with her performance, rather than his. PMQs is not easy, and the new Tory leader seems a long way off working out how to use it to embarrass or unsettle the PM. Labour MPs were heckling her at one point for using a script, but there is nothing wrong with having questions written down. What is important, though, it to work out how to use a question, to either lure the PM into a response that will open them up to criticism, or to make their refusal to engage look weak and weasly. Badenoch did not really manage this with any of her questions, and so all we were left with was a broad-brush shouting match. Starmer did best because his payoff line was the more persuasive partly, again, because humour was involved. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/13/wes-streeting-nhs-hospital-league-tables-starmer-badenoch-pmqs-uk-politics-live?page=with:block-673497a68f08ab632f8ec8e0#block-673497a68f08ab632f8ec8e0\">12.14pm</a>.)

Measuring good and bad performance is actually surprisingly complicated, especially since we\u2019ve merged so many hospitals.</p> \n   <p>Back in 2001 each individual hospital had its own performance, and that could be publicly reported.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019re now in a very different situation where lots of hospitals have merged into what we call multi-site trusts, and this makes it really complicated to try and decide who\u2019s performing.

On the Today programme he was asked about Adrian Boyle, President of the <strong>Royal College of Emergency Medicine</strong>, who told the programme in an early interview that league tables could \u201cdemoralise staff\u201d. Asked to respond to these comments, <strong>Streeting</strong> replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There\u2019s nothing more demoralising than going to work, busting a gut for your patients, and knowing that despite your best efforts you\u2019re letting them down because you\u2019re not given the tools to do the job, and you\u2019re working in a context where \u2026 you\u2019ve got poor leadership.</p> \n   <p>On urgent and emergency care, for example, there is a wide variation across NHS performance, ranging from 83% of people in one trust being seen within four hours in type 1 A&amp;Es right down to 38.2%. That\u2019s over 44 percentage points difference.</p> \n   <p>And what we need to understand, in those poorest performing areas, is that because of wider contextual challenges, wider system challenges? And if so, let\u2019s provide the national support in to fix those fundamental problems in the system, so we don\u2019t keep on in that doom loop of underperformance.</p> \n   <p>But where we have poorly performing senior managers, I\u2019ll make no apology for managing those people out. Because people know \u2013 and this is the guilty secret of the NHS \u2013 there are very senior managers, who are paid on average \u00a3145,000 pounds a year, who are managed out, given a payoff in one trust and then reincarnate in another NHS trust.</p> \n   <p>And those might be the rotten apples \u2013 and I want to recognise that there are some outstanding leaders right across the NHS \u2013 but those rotten apples are unacceptable and give the rest of the profession a bad name, so we\u2019ve got to manage those out.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>I will post more from Streeting\u2019s interview round soon.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>9.15am:</em> Louise Haigh, the transport secretary, gives evidence to the Commons transport committee about the work of her department.</p> \n  <p><em>9.30am:</em> Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, gives evidence to the Commons transport committee about the work of her department.</p> \n  <p><em>10.25am:</em> Wes Streeting, the health secretary, gives a speech to the NHS Providers conference in Liverpool.</p> \n  <p><em>Noon:</em> Keir Starmer faces Kemi Badenoch at PMQs.</p> \n  <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line or message me on social media.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Doughty, a Foreign Office minister, has dismissed a claim by Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, that the incoming Trump administration feels \u201coutright hostility\u201d towards the government\u2019s deal with Mauritius giving it sovereignty of the Chagos Islands. Speaking in the Commons, Doughty said that, when they were briefed on the details, their concerns would be allayed. (See 1.47pm and 2.07pm.) Civil servants are looking at the extra costs that assisted dying would impose on the NHS amid a warning from Wes Streeting that some services may be cut to fund expanded end-of-life care. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has said there are \u201clots\u201d of poor managers in the NHS. The Conservatives have dismissed a speech he gave on NHS reform as just a \u201crehashed press release\u201d. (See 9.26am and 5.53pm.) The chair of the government\u2019s equality watchdog, who was appointed by Liz Truss and investigated after a series of complaints by staff members, has been given a 12-month extension in the role, ministers have announced. The Conservatives claim Wes Streeting did not set out proper plans for NHS reform in his speech this morning. (See 11.39am.) In a response to the speech, Edward Argar, the shadow health secretary, said: The prime minister said that there would be \u2018no more money without reform\u2019, yet all Labour has delivered is an extra \u00a322bn for the NHS without any detail of how it will be used or productivity reforms in return. We will support reforms that genuinely deliver better care for patients, better value for money for taxpayers, and that ensure our health and care systems are fit to meet the challenges of the future. But instead we see a government reheating old ideas, or announcing things that are already happening \u2013 what was needed was a plan; what we got from the health secretary was effectively a rehashed press release. According to Harry Horton from ITV, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has asked his officials to work out how much assisted dying legislation might cost his department. (See 10.40am.) Horton says: Wes Streeting has asked the Dept for Health to look at the costs of implementing assisted dying. MPs won\u2019t be told what the potential costs are before the bill becomes law. Earlier, Streeting suggested a new assisted dying law would come at the expense of other NHS services Liz Kendall has said she sees \u201cno tension\u201d in government over plans to make savings from restricting winter fuel payments to vulnerable pensioners and an increase in people securing pension credit, Aletha Adu reports. Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, has won a victory over the Treasury spin machine. He has managed to get officials to remove a post on X that claimed the budget did not increase national insurance contributions (NICs) \u2013 even though it did increase employers\u2019 NICs by \u00a325bn. Stride complained about the advert in a letter to James Bowler, permanent secretary at the Treasury, describing it as \u201cmisleading\u201d. He has now released the reply he\u2019s received, in which Bowler said that the fact employers\u2019 NICs went up in the budget was \u201cwell documented\u201d and that the post referred to employees\u2019 NICS. Bowler went on: Nonetheless, for the avoidance of any doubt, the post has been taken down. Stride says: It is right that the Treasury have taken down their misleading post on the Chancellor\u2019s National Insurance hike. Given this response, I hope all Government ministers will now correct the record accordingly Keir Starmer has been condemned by his predecessor as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign for an answer he gave during PMQs about whether Israel\u2019s policy in Gaza amounts to genocide. (See 12.26pm.) In a post on social media, Corbyn said: Today, my independent colleague @AyoubKhanMP asked the PM for his definition of genocide. His response \u2014 which shows a blatant disregard for Palestinian suffering and international law \u2014 is disgraceful. We will keep demanding: stop the genocide in Gaza. And Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said: Keir Starmer prefers to deny that genocide is taking place rather than take any meaningful action to stop the mass slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza. For more than a year he has defended Israel\u2019s well-documented war crimes, initially including the use of starvation as a weapon of war and cutting off fuel, water, and medical supplies. The Genocide convention imposes duties on all states to act to prevent genocide whenever a risk exists. Right now, Israel is on trial for genocide at the International Court of Justice but Starmer, to his eternal shame, continues to allow the export of weapons used to carry out these atrocities. He has once again shown his despicable indifference to Palestinian life. Ayoub Khan, who asked the question, is one of the five Independent Alliance MPs who were all elected in Labour-supporting constituencies after campaigning wholly or partly on a pro-Palestinian platform. He asked: Article 2 of the United Nations genocide convention makes it explicit that genocide is not about numbers; it is about intent. The intent of the Israeli Government and the Israel Defence Forces has been explicit in words and actions over the past 400 days, with more than 45,000 innocent men, women and children killed. On 28 October, the foreign secretary denied that a genocide was even taking place and suggested that the Israeli army had not yet killed enough Palestinians to constitute a genocide. Last week at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, the prime minister stated that he has never referred to the atrocities happening in Gaza as a genocide. Will he share his definition of genocide with the house and state what further action he is prepared to take to save the lives of desperate and starving men, women and children, given that we now hold the presidency of the UN security council? And Starmer replied: It would be wise to start a question like that by a reference to what happened in October of last year. I am well aware of the definition of genocide, and that is why I have never described this or referred to it as genocide. The Post Office is \u201cfar from perfect\u201d and needs \u201csignificant cultural change\u201d alongside work to address commercial challenges, a minister has said. Gareth Thomas, a business minister, made the comment in the Commons during a statement on the Post Office\u2019s plans to offload more than 100 of the crown post offices that it currently owns, seeking alternative businesses to take them over. He said doing nothing about the network was \u201csimply not an option\u201d. Thomas told MPs: We have to recognise that the Post Office is far from perfect. We have seen this from evidence given at the [Post Office Horizon IT] inquiry. It\u2019s clear there needs to be significant cultural change at the Post Office to ensure it genuinely prioritises the needs of postmasters and delivers customers\u2019 needs far into the future. It\u2019s also clear more needs to be done to rebuild trust within the business and with the public who depend on their services. It\u2019s no secret too that the business is facing commercial challenges \u2013 nearly half of its branches are not profitable or only make a small profit from the Post Office business. Postmaster pay hasn\u2019t increased materially for a decade. The company has a high cost base and needs to transform its IT system.\u201d Referring to the proposals from Nigel Railton, the chair of the Post Office, Thomas said no final decisions had been taken yet. The Post Office will continue to deliver on the 11,500 minimum branches requirement set by government. We have made clear to the Post Office that we expect them to consult with postmasters, trade unions and other stakeholders before any individual decisions are taken. Aspects of the plan are also subject to government funding and outcomes of the upcoming spending review. He said the government would publish a green paper on the future of the Post Office. And he added: Doing nothing at the Post Office is simply not an option. There is more work to be done but there has to be change. During the UQ on the Chagos Islands, Priti Patel said the Conservative party was opposed to the deal transferring sovereignty to Mauritius. In her first Commons outing as shadow foreign secretary, Patel said: The world is a more dangerous place than ever before in our lifetimes, and this government has agreed to give away a key strategic asset in the Indian Ocean ending more than 200 years of British sovereignty. It is a wrong decision, and we stand by that completely. A month is now gone since the government\u2019s announcement, but we\u2019re still in the dark about exactly what the government has agreed and this is simply not acceptable. We have no treaty and vital questions remain unanswered. That is unacceptable, and the minister needs to put that right today. We cannot afford for our military base on Diego Garcia to be compromised in this way. Lord Ashcroft, the billionaire former Tory deputy chairman who has become a much more enthusiastic supporter of the party again since Kemi Badenoch became leader, has offered to fund a legal challenge against the decision. He posted this on social media. I am on to financially support any legal action to reverse the shameful giveaway of the Chagos Islands. I have been there and understand why UK sovereignty is imperative\u2026 Speaking at the Agricultural Industries Confederation conference this morning, Daniel Zeichner, the farming minister, said the government will not change the plan to subject some farms to inheritance tax. Thousands of people plan to descend on Westminster next week in a protest against the changes which they say will cause family farms to be sold off to pay inheritance tax bills. Amazon Prime star Jeremy Clarkson is due to speak at the event as are some political figures yet to be confirmed. \u201cWe are not going to see any change to the budget,\u201d Zeichner said. But he also said the government was looking into why the Treasury\u2019s figures say only 28% of farms will be affected by the new rules, while figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs imply 66% could be. On Bexit and the trade with the EU, Zeichner also played down suggestions that the UK could reduce trade friction by aligning with EU standards. He explained: This government has said that we want to renegotiate or improve our relationship with our near neighbours, the European Union. But quite a lot of the regulatory systems we have inherited are now beginning to diverge and just not through choice, but just because time is passing. And I very much appreciate the fact that for exporters that poses potential challenges. Now, without going over the debate from the past, we are where we are, but I am charged by Keir Starmer with working with others to try and negotiate an improved veterinary agreement, and we will be trying to achieve that. We must also respect the choice of British people made the referendum. It wasn\u2019t my choice but that choice was made, and there are advantages, as we\u2019ve seen, in terms of the fact that we\u2019ve been able to move much more quickly on precision breeding. These are from Theo Bertram, a former Labour adviser in No 10 under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, on social media on Kemi Badenoch\u2019s performance at PMQs. Badenoch is still learning at PMQs. I am sure she will get better. There was one small rookie error and one major strategic blunder. The small, rookie error: on the third question, she spoke before she stood up so her first words were missed by the mic. Stand first. Slow down. The strategic mistake: Starmer wants to paint her as opposing the difficult choices to do the popular things. He baited her twice on this &amp; the second time, she took it. Starmer: if she\u2019s against those things she should say so Badenoch: I\u2019m not against any of those things It\u2019s hard to earn credibility in opposition. It\u2019s reasonable for the Tories to take time to figure out how they will balance the books but in the meantime Badenoch needs a better line when challenged on spending commitments &amp; to resist being baited. The Labour party is also criticising Badenoch for saying she supports all the budget measures, but not the employers\u2019 national insurance contributions (NICs) rise that funds them. The party issued this statement after PMQs from Ellie Reeves, the Labour chair. Kemi Badenoch is trying to have her cake and eat it. Labour\u2019s budget is fixing the foundations to deliver on the promise of change. The Tories want all of the benefits of the budget, yet they voted against it and they have no plan to pay for it. It\u2019s the same old Tories, they haven\u2019t listened, and they\u2019ve learned nothing. It\u2019s time they told the public where they would find the money to pay for more investment in schools and the NHS. For the record, this is what Keir Starmer asked Badenoch during PMQs. We produced a budget which does not increase tax on working people, nothing in the payslip, investing in our NHS, investing in our schools, so every child could go as far as their talent will take them, investing in the houses of the future. If she is against those things, she should say so. And this is Badenoch\u2019s reply. I\u2019m not against any of those things, of course not, none of us are against any of those things. Stephen Doughty, a Foreign Office minister, was replying to Nigel Farage about the Chagos Islands. He said that, if the UK had not negotiated an agreement with Mauritius, \u201ca legally binding decision against the UK [on sovereignty] seemed inevitable\u201d. He said: I fundamentally disagree with what [Farage] has had to say. Let me be absolutely clear, this government inherited a situation where the long-term secure operation of this crucial military base [Diego Garcia] was under threat International courts were reaching judgments. International organizations were taking steps not to undermine Mauritian sovereignty, and this threatened the secure and effective operation of the base. And, in the absence of a negotiated solution, a legally binding decision against the UK seemed inevitable. This would have threatened the secure and effective operation of the base and that was not sustainable. He also said that he looked forward to working with the incoming Trump administration and that he was confident that, when they were briefed on the details, they would realise it was not a threat to security. We\u2019re looking very forward to working with [the incoming Trump administration], and I\u2019m sure that they will be being briefed on the full detail of this deal. And I am confident that the details of this arrangement will allay any concerns. Here are the main lines from Nigel Farage\u2019s UQ speech on the Chagos Islands. Farage, the Reform UK leader, said there was \u201coutright hostility\u201d in the incoming Trump administration to the UK\u2019s deal with Mauritius handing over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands. He explained: And if you say to me, \u2018Well, yes, it\u2019s OK, the United States are fully in favour [of the sovereignty deal],\u2019 really? I can tell you that the incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, has form on this, right back to when [James Cleverly, the then foreign secretary] was doing his best to give away the sovereignty of the Chagos islands. Indeed, he wrote to Secretary of State Blinken at the time. [See 11.51am.] There is, I can assure you, having been in America last week, knowing also the incoming defense secretary [Pete Hegseth] very well, there is outright hostility to this deal. Whatever is said about a lease agreement, as we saw with Hong Kong, these agreements can very, very easily be broken. Diego Garcia was described to me by a senior Trump adviser as the most important island on the planet as far as America was concerned. So you\u2019re going to outright hostility [to the deal from the Trump administration] \u2026 There is no basis for this agreement to continue what it is, and if you do, you will be at conflict with a country without which we would be defenseless. He claimed there was \u201cno legal reason\u201d why the UK had to give sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. He said Mauritius did not have a historical claim to the islands, which are 1,300 miles away, and he said the Internationl Court of Justice\u2019s ruling saying Mauritius should have sovereignty was only advisory. He said the Chagossian people were also opposed to the deal. And by the way, when it comes to the Chagossian people, yes, of course, what happened to them was truly awful. They do not wish to live \u2013 they\u2019re unanimous in this \u2013 they do not wish to live under Mauritian rule. They want to live under British rule because they actually trust us. That was a good PMQs for Keir Starmer. He easily saw off the rightwing opposition leader \u2013 or, rather, both of them. The hit on Nigel Farage was the neatest, and the funniest. The Reform UK leader, who on the basis of today\u2019s interventions also doubles up as MP for Mar-a-Lago, not MP for Clacton, asked a perfectly reasonable question about proscribing the IRRG, but Starmer shot him down with a joke. (See 12.30pm.) It was slighly hypocritical, given that Starmer is fast approaching the point where an MP at PMQs is going to welcome the fact that he\u2019s making a rare visit to the UK (a gag told about Tony Blair, when his globetrotting went too far). But the putdown was genuinely funny, and so that did not matter. In the past Starmer has sometimes seemed a bit wary of treating Farage with disdain in the chamber. But maybe he has decided it is safe to hit him hard after all. Starmer also won quite comfortably against Kemi Badenoch, although that probably was more to do with her performance, rather than his. PMQs is not easy, and the new Tory leader seems a long way off working out how to use it to embarrass or unsettle the PM. Labour MPs were heckling her at one point for using a script, but there is nothing wrong with having questions written down. What is important, though, it to work out how to use a question, to either lure the PM into a response that will open them up to criticism, or to make their refusal to engage look weak and weasly. Badenoch did not really manage this with any of her questions, and so all we were left with was a broad-brush shouting match. Starmer did best because his payoff line was the more persuasive partly, again, because humour was involved. (See 12.14pm.) Other opposition leaders have used wit to great effect at PMQs, but humour doesn\u2019t seem to be one of Badenoch\u2019s strong points. Otherwise, PMQs was interesting \u2013 or depressing \u2013 because it provided fresh evidence that this intake of government backbenchers is worse than previous ones when it comes to asking soft, planted questions. Here is my colleague Peter Walker making this point. Two thoughts on #PMQs. Felt like another win for Starmer. It takes time to get the hang of it &amp; Badenoch still felt a bit unfocused (&amp; slightly patronising). Also, while planting obsequious questions with governing party backbenchers isn\u2019t new, under Labour they are *ubiquitous*. Kate McCann from Times Radio noticed this too. One of the worst PMQs sessions I\u2019ve been to in some time. Lots of planted questions, no real answers\u2026 MPs also voting with their feet and leaving early. Definitely less packed than in recent weeks. As an MP, if you had the opportunity to ask the PM a question why would you read out something handed to you by whips? (A planted question). There must be hundreds of issues and awful cases raised by constituents - have always thought it\u2019s such a waste. In the Commons Stephen Doughty, a Foreign Office minister, is now responding to the urgent question on the Chagos Islands. It was tabled by Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, and he said that from his time in the US last week, talking to Donald Trump\u2019s team, he says they regard the deal with Mauritius, giving it sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, with \u201coutright hostility\u201d. He says Diego Garcia, the main island in the Chagos Island and the home of a UK/US military base, was described to him as \u201cthe most important island on the planet\u201d for US security. He claimed the deal would pose a threat to its future. I will post more from the UQ after my PMQs snap verdict. Alec Shelbrooke (Con) says the assisted dying bill will be one of the most consequential pieces of legislation considered by MPs. He is worried about the short period of time set aside for the debate. Will the PM commit to giving the Commons two days to debate the bill on the floor of the house at report stage \u2013 \u201c16 hours of protected time'\u201d - so the issues can be considered in full. He says, without that assurance, \u201cpeople like myself may decline a second reading over fear that we may not get to debate these issues in full\u201d. Starmer says it will be a free vote. Every MP needs to decide how they will vote. He says he thinks \u201csufficient time\u201d has been allocated to the bill. And that is the end of PMQs. Jo White (Lab) asks if the government will continue to smash the people smuggling gangs. Yes, says Starmer. He says the government has returned 9,400 people with no right to be here. He goes on: They talked about getting the flights off. We\u2019ve got the flights off deportation flight. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing another \u00a375m pounds in the smashing the gangs. We\u2019re absolutely determined to give a serious response for a serious question, not a gimmick that achieved absolutely nothing. Alex Brewer (Lib Dem) asks about chalkstream rivers in her constituency, and how to protect them from river pollution. Starmer says the government has taken immediate action to improve water quality, including setting up a water commission. James McMurdock (Reform UK) asks about the interest rate councils have to pay for borrowing. He asks for it to be cut. Starmer says the government has decided to cut a premium borrowing fee imposed on councils. Juliet Campbell (Lab) asks about flood prevention in Broxtowe. Starmer says the last government left flood defences in their worst state on record. This goverment is increasing investment in them, he says. Nigel Farage (Reform UK) says the PM will want to congratulate Donald Trump on his victory last week. (Starmer did \u2013 last week) Farage goes on. Will the UK proscribe the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which would mend fences with the Trump administration \u201cgiven that the whole of his cabinet have been so rude about him over the last few year\u201d. Starmer starts with a joke. I\u2019m glad to see the honorable member making a rare appearance back here. He\u2019s spent so much time in America recently I was half expecting to see all the immigration statistics. He goes on to say Farage has made a serious point about Iran. Ayoub Khan (Ind) asks what Starmer\u2019s definition of genocide is. Starmer says it would have been wise to start a question like this with a reference to what happened on 7 October last year. He knows what has happened, which is why he has never called what is happening in Gaza genocide, he says. Lincoln Jopp (Con) asks Starmer to confirm that Sue Gray saying she won\u2019t take the job as envoy to the nations and the regions shows Starmer invented a job for one of his cronies. And, if he did not, will he appoint a new one? Starmer says it wasn\u2019t a crony job. Catherine Fookes (Lab) ask Starmer to condemn Tories who have criticised the level of the national living wage. Starmer is happy to do so, saying the government is proudly on the side of working people. Neil Shastri-Hurst (Con) says more schools are closing because of the introduction of VAT on private school fees. Starmer says he understands the concerns of people who save to send their children to private schools. But all parents want the best for their children, he says. He says he won\u2019t tolerate state schools not being able to afford teachers. Jacob Collier (Lab) says his constituency has the best pubs in the country. Will the PM ensure pubs have a seat at the table when business rates are reformed. Starmer says pubs are an important part of our community. The budget cut duty on beer by 1p a pint, he says. Gavin Robinson (DUP) asks about a constituent whose son has been taken away from her and is in Lebanon. Starmer says this is a complex situation. He will set up a meeting for Robinson, he says. Starmer says child poverty went up under the Tories. Under the budget, working people won\u2019t pay a penny extra through their payslips, or at the petrol pumps. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, asks if GPs, pharmacies and other healthcare provides will be exempt from the national insurance rise. Starmer says the government will ensure GPs get the resources they need. The funding arrangements will be set out later this year, he says. Davey says Donald Trump Jnr has posted on Instagram saying Ukraine will lose its allowance. If the US does withdraw support, will the UK and its allies step up, using frozen Russian assets. Starmer says the UK has been resolute in supporting Ukraine. He says he has been discussing how to put it in the strongest possible position with allies. Badenoch asks why the government is approving a four-day week for councils. That is the same pay for less work, he says. Starmer says questions based on what the government is actually doing are better. He goes on: What did they deliver in 14 years? Low growth, stagnant economy, a disastrous mini-budget, a \u00a322bn black hole, and now she wants to give me advice on running the economy. No, thank you very much. Badenoch asks about Kelly, who runs an after school club business. She says the NI rise in the budget will cost her \u00a310,000. Starmer says he would tell Kelly the government is fixing the mess left by the previous administration. Badenoch says Starmer does not know what is going on. She asks if Starmer was told about the \u00a32.4bn black hole in council budgets. Starmer says the Tories want all the benefits from the budget, but none of the costs. He says Badenoch has learned nothing. Badenoch asks how much councils wil need for social care. Starmer says he covered this in his first answer \u2013 \u00a3600m. Badenoch criticises the budget, and says the government did not realise what the impact of the NI increase would be on councils. Starmer says the government has put more money into councils than the Tories did in 14 years. Kemi Badenoch says at Cop29 the PM made unilateral commitments that would make life more expensive for everyone. Will the PM confirm that he will keep the cap on council tax? Starmer says he is proud of the fact that he is restoring leadership on the climate. And on Monday he announced an order into blades for offshore wind for Hull. On council tax, he says MPs \u201cwill know what the arrangements are\u201d. Lloyd Hatton (Lab) asks Starmer about Kemi Badenoch\u2019s \u201cdamaging\u201d policy positions. Starmer says the government has given people a pay rise, This government has given millions of people a pay rise \u2026 with strengthened parental leave, with better rights for parents, huge investment into our schools and NHS whilst ensuring that payslips of working people have not been affected. Christine Jardine (Lib Dem) asks about the impact of the national insurance rise on GP practices. Will they get extra support? Starmer says the budget has an extra \u00a325.6bn for the NHS and for social care. He says the government \u201cwill ensure that GP practices have the resources that we need\u201d. Keir Starmer says he was honoured to join President Macron in Paris on Monday for Armistice Day. And he attended the Cop29 summit, he says. He says it is Islamophobia awareness month. The government is against racism in all forms, he says. Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, says his counterpart from Somalia is in the gallery watching today. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question at PMQs. Nigel Farage is on the list, so the Commons will be hearing from him twice this afternoon. PMQs is starting soon. And after PMQs Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has an urgent question on the government\u2019s decision to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. This may not be an issue of huge concern to his constituents in Clacton, but Farage\u2019s friend Donald Trump is said to be opposed to the move. As the Daily Mail reports, Mike Waltz, Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, has in the past said transferring sovereignty of the Chagos Islands could help China. Wes Streeting has now delivered his speech to the NHS Providers conference in Liverpool, and it is being described as a potential turning point in his time as health secretary. Here is a verdict from Shaun Lintern, the Sunday Times\u2019 health editor. Bullish, specific. Streeting is beginning to move from era of \u201creviews\u201d to actual starting to direct the NHS on what Govt wants And this is from Dave West from the Health Service Journal. Wes Streeting at @NHSProviders conference gives a clear message and mission for ICBs and ICB leaders - you are a strategic commissioner and will lead the transformation to neighbourhood care Very good news to have a clear mission As mentioned earlier, this was a speech that had been very well trailed in advance, both in news releases and in Streeting\u2019s interviews. Here are some new, or newish, lines from what he said. Streeting said the NHS was too hierarchical. As the Telegraph reports, he said: The NHS in 2024 is more hierarchical than almost any other organisation that I can think of. Even our armed forces \u2026 are less locked and centralised into command and control. Streeting said that he wanted to give local managers more freedom but that he would take back power if they were underperforming. If performance dips I reserve the right to take those freedoms away and for those judged to be persistently failing, we will act, going from zero consequences for failure to zero tolerance. He said that he wanted a culture of honesty in the NHS, and that a culture that that \u201cstifles inconvenient truths \u2026 ultimately puts patient safety at risk\u201d. He criticised the health thintanks that have complained about the settlement for health in the budget. He said the NHS had been living on borrowed time. The NHS is already living on borrowed time and if a Labour government can\u2019t improve the NHS then it simply won\u2019t survive. But if we get this right we can look back on our time with pride and say we were the generation that took the NHS from the worst crisis in its history, got it back on its feet and made it fit for the future. He said the 10-year plan for the NHS would be published in May. In a column for the i, Kitty Donaldson suggests the assisted dying bill looks increasingly unlikely to become law. Here is an excerpt. Analysis by i a month ago, when the idea was being debated only in principle, found 54 per cent of MPs currently expressing a degree of support for the legislation, while 35 per cent were opposed and 11 per cent were undecided. But since the bill was published this week more MPs are expressing their doubts about the legislation, with many citing the concern that although private members\u2019 bills are subject to the same stages as any other legislation, less time is allocated to them in parliament, meaning they are often discussed in significantly less detail before a vote \u2026 Whether [Keir] Starmer\u2019s support in principle means he will end up voting for the bill is another matter. \u201cIt\u2019s a big political risk for the PM when his justice and health secretaries aren\u2019t in favour,\u201d one MP told i. \u201cHow does it interplay with the NHS? What if it goes wrong? How can he be the one to oversee it? I\u2019d be very surprised if he ended up voting in favour \u2013 he can tell the world he helped facilitate the vote and say parliament made its decision to block it.\u201d Wes Streeting has been urged to provide \u201curgent clarity\u201d on whether the hospice sector who have been hit by the rise in national insurance will receive extra funding. The health secretary vowed to make an announcement before Christmas on whether the sector will recieve more money, and noted he \u201crecognised the pressures\u201d they were facing. It comes after the Guardian reported on Sunday the government could offer a financial lifeline to the hospice sector amid fears end-of-life care providers are at risk of closure due to the double blow of the employers\u2019 national insurance rise and higher wage bills. Officials were said to have been looking at the options for providing more funding to hospices and other end-of-life care through the NHS partly to offset the impact of the national insurance rise, which the sector believes could cost it \u00a330m a year. Streeting told the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today: One of the reasons that I haven\u2019t yet announced the allocation for hospices is I\u2019m looking very carefully at what we can do through the hospice grant to recognise that pressure. We\u2019ll make an announcement on the hospice grant before Christmas because I recognise that people need to be able to make decisions about the next financial year, but the hospice grant will continue. Sources in the end of life care sector said they were hopeful after Streeting\u2019s comments but still worried about whether the help extended would cover the whole extent of the national insurance rise and other pressing financial pressures. Liberal Democrats health spokesperson Helen Morgan said: We need urgent clarity on what extra funding hospices will receive and whether it will fully cover the cost of the national insurance tax hike. Many hospices are already on the brink and this tax hike risks pushing them over the edge. The simplest thing would be for the government to listen to hospices and exempt them from this tax rise. David Blunkett has warned the UK could \u201cend up with Nigel Farage as prime minister\u201d unless the government improves people\u2019s lives in a way that matters to them. The Labour peer and former cabinet minister said the lesson of Donald Trump\u2019s victory and Joe Biden\u2019s loss in the US was that \u201ctinkering\u201d was not enough and that \u201csmall change isn\u2019t enough\u201d. Blunkett, who served as home secretary, education secretary and work and pensions secretary, said: We\u2019ve got to start thinking differently. We\u2019ve got to be able to talk with people about the things that matter to them while you\u2019re doing the big macro stuff. It\u2019s not one or the other. You\u2019ve got to do both. But if you don\u2019t do the little things, you\u2019ll end up with Farage as prime minister. It\u2019s not beyond the bounds of possibility. Reform came second to Labour in 89 seats. Nevermind the ones they were close to in terms of Conservative seats. We\u2019ve got to get real, basically. We\u2019ve got time but not a lot of time to readjust to a different world. Blunkett told an Institute for Government event yesterday that No 10 and departments had about six months to embark on reforms or the government may \u201crun out of momentum\u201d. I think they\u2019ve probably got six months. I heard somebody rather stupidly in the spring \u2026 from a policy angle brief that Labour\u2019s policies were all ready, they\u2019d all been signed off. It was a load of baloney. They had signed off generalities and macro but not the details of what was going to happen. Bringing people in very quickly which Wes [Streeting] has been doing, the review of curriculum \u2026 those are important early moves that will have to lead to very rapid change because otherwise the government will run out of momentum. It just happens. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has said that passing a bill to allow assisted dying would limit the ability of the NHS to provide other services. In comments that mark a significant escalation of his opposition to the bill, the health secretary told Times Radio this morning: [Assisted dying] would be a big change. There would be resource implications for doing it. And those choices would come at the expense of other choices. When it was put to him that, if the assisted dying bill passes, the NHS would have to \u201cfind the money from somewhere else\u201d, Streeting replied: Yep. To govern is to choose. If parliament chooses to go ahead with assisted dying, it is making a choice that this is an area to prioritise for investment. And we\u2019d have to work through those implications. At a press conference yesterday Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP promoting the private member\u2019s bill that would allow assisted dying, said she expected only a few hundred people a year to use the legislation if it passes. In the past Streeting said he was torn over whether or not to support assisted dying, saying that he could see compelling arguments both for and against. But last month he told a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party that he had decided to oppose the bill because he did not believe palliative care services in the NHS were good enough to justify assisted dying being made legal as an alternative. But arguing that the bill would also impose unreasonable costs on the NHS (a proposition for which there is little or no evidence) shows Streeting is ramping up his attack on the proposals. MPs are unsure what will happen when the Commons debates the plans, with a free vote, on Friday 29 November. But, given what Streeting has said in public about the plan, it would be awkward for him as health secretary if the legislation were to pass and he may be increasingly keen to kill it off. In the past Keir Starmer has been in favour of an assisted dying law, with safeguards. But in comments this week he has refused to commit himself to voting in favour of the bill \u2013 perhaps because he does not want to be associated with the side that will lose. The Labour MP Diane Abbott has suggested that Wes Streeting\u2019s attacks on NHS managers are a pretext for further privatisation. She posted these on social media this morning. Wes Streeting\u2019s cascade of abuse of NHS managers and medics is a pretext for further and faster privatisation. Just yesterday NHS chiefs told Streeting they have not been given sufficient resources to meet his waiting list targets. They are right - they have not. Demanding unreachable targets when funds are inadequate will just deepen the crisis in the NHS. Here is more on the criticism of the hospital league table plan from Adrian Boyle, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine. Boyle was interviewed on the Today programme this morning and his arguments were put to Wes Streeting. (See 8.52am.) Boyle raised three objections to the plan. Boyle said trying to compare the performance of NHS trusts in league tables was \u201csurprisingly complicated\u201d. He explained: League tables is an interesting idea. Measuring good and bad performance is actually surprisingly complicated, especially since we\u2019ve merged so many hospitals. Back in 2001 each individual hospital had its own performance, and that could be publicly reported. We\u2019re now in a very different situation where lots of hospitals have merged into what we call multi-site trusts, and this makes it really complicated to try and decide who\u2019s performing. So, for example, you might have a trust which runs three emergency departments, one with long waits, one with short waits, one with waits that are in the middle. He said league tables could incentivise \u201cshort-term target chasing\u201d, leading to less attention being paid to long-term reforms that are needed, such as integrating health and social care. He said league tables could demoralise staff and harm recruitment. There\u2019s good and bad managers right across the NHS. It is good to have some form of accountability, because accountability is something which everybody within the NHS struggles to try and measure. So I think the right to try and do that. There\u2019s a difference between the intent and the way they do it. And there is a risk that this will demoralise stuff, and you will see that in poorly performing areas, recruitment and retention of staff, and that will go right down to clinical staff, will become even harder. In an interview with LBC Wes Streeting claimed there were \u201clots\u201d of poor managers in the NHS. Asked about opposition to his plans, he said\u201d Look, I know it\u2019s not going to be popular with everyone in the system. I think people would rather sometimes that I got everyone around the campfire to sing Kumbaya and hailed the great religion of the National Health Service and how wonderful it is. But when it\u2019s going through the worst crisis in its history, I think we need to drive serious change. That does mean more support for leaders, and today I\u2019m not only talking about more freedoms and autonomy for our best performing leaders, but investment in leadership, development and training. But it does also have to come with accountability. It is not entirely surprising to me that people who represent leaders in the NHS are a bit nervous about that. But to be honest, I think that there are lots of people in leadership roles in the NHS at all levels, from middle management to senior management, who are \u2026 giving the rest of the profession a bad name. Asked if he was worried that league tables could lead to an Ofsted-type tragedy, Streeting replied: I\u2019m not interested in humiliating individuals. What I am interested in is performance, managing poor leaders on and out of the NHS. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an unreasonable thing when the average very senior managers play is \u00a3145,000 a year. The level of responsibility they carry is enormous. They\u2019re responsible for a vital public service, and if they\u2019re not up to it in a very professional way, we need to manage people onto another future. Guardian readers with long memories will notice something familiar about Wes Streeting\u2019s announcement this morning about league tables for hospitals. Here is a story we ran a while back. And it starts like this: The government has revealed the performance ratings of every major hospital in England, naming and shaming a dozen trusts as the worst performers in the NHS. All 170 acute trusts in the country have been ranked on indicators such as waiting times, staff vacancy rates, patient satisfaction and cleanliness, producing the first ever NHS performance league table. Amol Rajan quoted this on the Today programme this morning. He pointed out that it was from 2001, when Labour was last in power. Alan Miliburn was health secretary at the time. But he left two years later; Gordon Brown fought his plans for NHS reform aggressively, and the league table plan was dropped. But Miliburn is now back. At the weekend it was announced that he has been appointed as the lead non-executive member on the board of the Department of Health and Social Care. Welcoming the appointment, Wes Streeting, the current health secretary, said: As secretary of state, Alan made the reforms which helped deliver the shortest waiting times and highest patient satisfaction in the history of the NHS \u2026 His unique expertise and experience will be invaluable and he has an outstanding track record of delivering better care for patients. Good morning. Wes Streeting, the health secretary (for England), is giving his first major speech on NHS reform, and there has been almost as much advance pitch-rolling for what he is going to say as you get for a budget. The Department of Health and Social Care has already press released three stories about what Streeting will say, starting on Monday. \u201cTrusts could be banned from using agencies to cover gaps in entry level positions, and agencies could be banned from re-introducing NHS workers that leave permanent jobs,\u201d the DHSC said on Monday, in its first announcement about the reform package. Pay arrangements for NHS trust chief executives will be changed so they are linked to performance, with \u201cno more rewards for failure\u201d, Streeting said in another press release about his plans. \u201cNHS league tables will be introduced to help tackle the NHS crisis\u201d, the DHSC said last night, in a briefing ahead of the speech today. Denis Campbell has written this up for the Guardian overnight. As he reports, the plan for a league table of best and worst-performing hospitals has already provoked a backlash from NHS leaders. Streeting has been doing an interview round this morning and he has been defending his plans. On the Today programme he was asked about Adrian Boyle, President of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, who told the programme in an early interview that league tables could \u201cdemoralise staff\u201d. Asked to respond to these comments, Streeting replied: There\u2019s nothing more demoralising than going to work, busting a gut for your patients, and knowing that despite your best efforts you\u2019re letting them down because you\u2019re not given the tools to do the job, and you\u2019re working in a context where \u2026 you\u2019ve got poor leadership. On urgent and emergency care, for example, there is a wide variation across NHS performance, ranging from 83% of people in one trust being seen within four hours in type 1 A&amp;Es right down to 38.2%. That\u2019s over 44 percentage points difference. And what we need to understand, in those poorest performing areas, is that because of wider contextual challenges, wider system challenges? And if so, let\u2019s provide the national support in to fix those fundamental problems in the system, so we don\u2019t keep on in that doom loop of underperformance. But where we have poorly performing senior managers, I\u2019ll make no apology for managing those people out. Because people know \u2013 and this is the guilty secret of the NHS \u2013 there are very senior managers, who are paid on average \u00a3145,000 pounds a year, who are managed out, given a payoff in one trust and then reincarnate in another NHS trust. And those might be the rotten apples \u2013 and I want to recognise that there are some outstanding leaders right across the NHS \u2013 but those rotten apples are unacceptable and give the rest of the profession a bad name, so we\u2019ve got to manage those out. I will post more from Streeting\u2019s interview round soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.15am: Louise Haigh, the transport secretary, gives evidence to the Commons transport committee about the work of her department. 9.30am: Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, gives evidence to the Commons transport committee about the work of her department. 10.25am: Wes Streeting, the health secretary, gives a speech to the NHS Providers conference in Liverpool. Noon: Keir Starmer faces Kemi Badenoch at PMQs. If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line or message me on social media. I can\u2019t read all the messages BTL, but if you put \u201cAndrew\u201d in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. I\u2019m still using X and I\u2019ll see something addressed to @AndrewSparrow very quickly. I\u2019m also trying Bluesky (@andrewsparrowgdn) and Threads (@andrewsparrowtheguardian). I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can\u2019t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.",

      "body": "<p>Mia Mottley, the climate-championing prime minister of Barbados, has invited Donald Trump to a face-to-face meeting where she would seek \u201ccommon ground\u201d and persuade him that climate action was in his own interests.</p> <p>\u201cLet us find a common purpose in saving the planet and saving livelihoods,\u201d she told the Guardian at the UN\u2019s Cop29 climate summit in Azerbaijan. \u201cWe are human beings and we have the capacity to meet face-to-face, in spite of our differences. We want humanity to survive. And the evidence [of the climate crisis] we are seeing almost weekly now.\u201d</p> <p>Only by personal meetings among world leaders can the massive changes needed on climate action be achieved, she believes. \u201cPresident Trump has been very clear about the importance of that kind of face-to-face conversation in the things that he believes that he can solve as well.\u201d</p> <p>Mottley, the prime minister who took Barbados out of the Commonwealth realm to be a republic, has been an electrifying presence at recent UN climate summits since she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/01/digging-our-own-graves-world-leaders-speak-cop26\">took to the stage at Cop26 in Glasgow</a> in 2021 with an impassioned speech demanding world leaders \u201ctry harder\u201d to avoid passing a death sentence on her country. Since then, she has gained a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/10/whos-who-at-cop29-the-world-leaders-and-others-who-will-attend\">global reputation</a> as a formidable champion of the developing countries most affected by climate breakdown.</p> <p>She has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/23/how-imf-aims-to-attract-private-firms-to-invest-in-green-energy-for-poor-nations\">led a movement among developing and some developed countries to change the global financial system</a> to generate the funds needed to shift the world to a low-carbon economy.</p> <p>The re-election of Trump has thrown a deep shadow over Cop29, which kicked off on Monday in Baku. Scores of world leaders flew in for the summit, but the heads of government of most of the world\u2019s biggest economies stayed away.</p> <p>Delegates fear Trump will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, dismantle regulations and climate targets, and push forward with plans to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d for more fossil fuels. Scientists have warned that if he follows through on his campaign promises the world has little hope of limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial temperatures.</p> <p>Argentinian negotiators representing the government of climate science denier Javier Milei were ordered on Wednesday to withdraw from Cop29 after just three days, adding to concerns about the stability of the Paris agreement.</p> <p>But Trump had shown a willingness to deal with crises before, Mottley noted. \u201cI think that there are possibilities for discussion. The same warp speed that President Trump addressed the issue of vaccines and the development of a vaccine is the same warp speed that we want to encourage him and others to look at for decarbonising technology,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She also believes she could show Trump that the US would benefit economically from tackling the climate crisis.</p> <p>For instance, she pointed to the flaring of methane from oil and gas production sites. Installing relatively simple equipment to catch and use the methane instead would be profitable, according to the International Energy Agency, which should appeal to Trump.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would you want to flare gas and lose money, when you can use gas and earn money?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>She also pointed to climate migration. \u201cIf I can\u2019t live because I can\u2019t farm because I don\u2019t have access to water, or floods are now coming with an intensity and a regularity that makes it impossible for me to sustain my way of life, I\u2019m going to shift where I\u2019m living from.</p> <p>\u201cOr if I have no ability to access insurance, and insurance is critical to my ability to get a loan, I\u2019m going to have to move from where I\u2019m operating. So the volume of climate migration hopefully will wake up those who have been slow to see that this must be a win-win.\u201d</p> <p>Mottley argued Trump would also find it hard to fully reverse the Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivises clean energy, because many formerly depressed areas around the US, including traditionally Republican-voting ones, had seen new jobs and industries spring up because of it.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had four years of municipalities, states and the private sector all making significant investments [in a low-carbon economy] in the US,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are unlikely to see a U-turn on everything in as bald a way as some people fear.\u201d</p> <p>Cop29 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/08/cop29-climate-talks-what-would-a-good-outcome-look-like\">is focused on the issue of climate finance</a>, with the aim of setting out a new global goal that would deliver at least $1tn a year to developing countries, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate-driven extreme weather.</p> <p>Developed countries, however, are likely to pledge as little as a third of that in public finance from their overseas aid budgets and through the World Bank and similar institutions.</p> <p>Mottley recognises rich countries will not stump up enough cash from their own budgets, though she argues they ought to do far more than they are now pledging. She has a set of proposals, known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/18/countries-are-drowning-climate-expert-calls-for-urgent-rethink-on-scale-of-aid-for-developing-world\">Bridgetown agenda</a> after the capital of Barbados, that would generate more than $1tn a year in climate finance.</p> <p>First off are reforms to the World Bank that would help free up hundreds of billions more in cash, and make loans cheaper and easier to access for the poorest and most vulnerable countries. Mottley says these moves are already under way, and have been successful so far.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/cop29-which-climate-finance-ideas-are-most-likely-to-work\">Cop29: which climate finance ideas are most likely to work?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She also wants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/cop29-which-climate-finance-ideas-are-most-likely-to-work\">new sources of revenue</a>, called \u201cglobal solidarity levies\u201d \u2013 ways of raising money, particularly from polluting activities, that can go towards climate finance. These include a compulsory levy on business and first class flights, with a voluntary charge on economy flights that passengers could choose to pay (\u201cbecause the agency of individuals matters\u201d); a charge on international shipping; a charge on fossil fuel extraction that could reap $210bn a year; and a 0.1% levy on financial transactions that would raise $480bn a year.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that global public goods need dedicated sources of global financing. And if we were to extend the polluter-pays principle, then those who contribute to the problem should help carry some of the burden. And those who make profit egregiously should also leave a little something on the table,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the one issue for sure that binds us all, because without a planet there will be no life that we can sustain.\u201d</p> <p>Mottley also favours a wealth tax on billionaires, which has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/28/brazil-radical-plan-tax-global-super-rich-tackle-climate-crisis\">proposed by Brazil</a>. \u201cWhen you took the [Covid] vaccine injection, you didn\u2019t even feel it. The super wealthy, if asked to leave a little something on the table, will not feel it.\u201d</p> <p>It is beyond the scope of Cop29, or the UN, to impose such levies, and they do not form part of the formal discussions in Azerbaijan. However, a special taskforce including Barbados, France, Spain, Kenya and others \u2013 but not, so far, the UK \u2013 is working to bring the proposals to reality.</p> <p>One vitally important action that she hopes Cop29 will take is to focus on methane. Emissions of this gas \u2013 which comes from fossil fuel exploration, agriculture and waste, and is many times more powerful than CO<sub>2</sub> in heating the planet \u2013 have been rising, but efforts to control them have so far had little impact.</p> <p>\u201cThere needs to be a global methane agreement,\u201d she said. Scientists have said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/06/reduce-methane-or-face-climate-catastrophe-scientists-warn\">controlling methane could prevent 0.5C of heating</a> in the short term. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Mottley said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mia Mottley, the climate-championing prime minister of Barbados, has invited Donald Trump to a face-to-face meeting where she would seek \u201ccommon ground\u201d and persuade him that climate action was in his own interests. \u201cLet us find a common purpose in saving the planet and saving livelihoods,\u201d she told the Guardian at the UN\u2019s Cop29 climate summit in Azerbaijan. \u201cWe are human beings and we have the capacity to meet face-to-face, in spite of our differences. We want humanity to survive. And the evidence [of the climate crisis] we are seeing almost weekly now.\u201d Only by personal meetings among world leaders can the massive changes needed on climate action be achieved, she believes. \u201cPresident Trump has been very clear about the importance of that kind of face-to-face conversation in the things that he believes that he can solve as well.\u201d Mottley, the prime minister who took Barbados out of the Commonwealth realm to be a republic, has been an electrifying presence at recent UN climate summits since she took to the stage at Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021 with an impassioned speech demanding world leaders \u201ctry harder\u201d to avoid passing a death sentence on her country. Since then, she has gained a global reputation as a formidable champion of the developing countries most affected by climate breakdown. She has also led a movement among developing and some developed countries to change the global financial system to generate the funds needed to shift the world to a low-carbon economy. The re-election of Trump has thrown a deep shadow over Cop29, which kicked off on Monday in Baku. Scores of world leaders flew in for the summit, but the heads of government of most of the world\u2019s biggest economies stayed away. Delegates fear Trump will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, dismantle regulations and climate targets, and push forward with plans to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d for more fossil fuels. Scientists have warned that if he follows through on his campaign promises the world has little hope of limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial temperatures. Argentinian negotiators representing the government of climate science denier Javier Milei were ordered on Wednesday to withdraw from Cop29 after just three days, adding to concerns about the stability of the Paris agreement. But Trump had shown a willingness to deal with crises before, Mottley noted. \u201cI think that there are possibilities for discussion. The same warp speed that President Trump addressed the issue of vaccines and the development of a vaccine is the same warp speed that we want to encourage him and others to look at for decarbonising technology,\u201d she said. She also believes she could show Trump that the US would benefit economically from tackling the climate crisis. For instance, she pointed to the flaring of methane from oil and gas production sites. Installing relatively simple equipment to catch and use the methane instead would be profitable, according to the International Energy Agency, which should appeal to Trump. \u201cWhy would you want to flare gas and lose money, when you can use gas and earn money?\u201d she asked. She also pointed to climate migration. \u201cIf I can\u2019t live because I can\u2019t farm because I don\u2019t have access to water, or floods are now coming with an intensity and a regularity that makes it impossible for me to sustain my way of life, I\u2019m going to shift where I\u2019m living from. \u201cOr if I have no ability to access insurance, and insurance is critical to my ability to get a loan, I\u2019m going to have to move from where I\u2019m operating. So the volume of climate migration hopefully will wake up those who have been slow to see that this must be a win-win.\u201d Mottley argued Trump would also find it hard to fully reverse the Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivises clean energy, because many formerly depressed areas around the US, including traditionally Republican-voting ones, had seen new jobs and industries spring up because of it. \u201cWe\u2019ve had four years of municipalities, states and the private sector all making significant investments [in a low-carbon economy] in the US,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are unlikely to see a U-turn on everything in as bald a way as some people fear.\u201d Cop29 is focused on the issue of climate finance, with the aim of setting out a new global goal that would deliver at least $1tn a year to developing countries, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate-driven extreme weather. Developed countries, however, are likely to pledge as little as a third of that in public finance from their overseas aid budgets and through the World Bank and similar institutions. Mottley recognises rich countries will not stump up enough cash from their own budgets, though she argues they ought to do far more than they are now pledging. She has a set of proposals, known as the Bridgetown agenda after the capital of Barbados, that would generate more than $1tn a year in climate finance. First off are reforms to the World Bank that would help free up hundreds of billions more in cash, and make loans cheaper and easier to access for the poorest and most vulnerable countries. Mottley says these moves are already under way, and have been successful so far. She also wants new sources of revenue, called \u201cglobal solidarity levies\u201d \u2013 ways of raising money, particularly from polluting activities, that can go towards climate finance. These include a compulsory levy on business and first class flights, with a voluntary charge on economy flights that passengers could choose to pay (\u201cbecause the agency of individuals matters\u201d); a charge on international shipping; a charge on fossil fuel extraction that could reap $210bn a year; and a 0.1% levy on financial transactions that would raise $480bn a year. \u201cThe reality is that global public goods need dedicated sources of global financing. And if we were to extend the polluter-pays principle, then those who contribute to the problem should help carry some of the burden. And those who make profit egregiously should also leave a little something on the table,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the one issue for sure that binds us all, because without a planet there will be no life that we can sustain.\u201d Mottley also favours a wealth tax on billionaires, which has been proposed by Brazil. \u201cWhen you took the [Covid] vaccine injection, you didn\u2019t even feel it. The super wealthy, if asked to leave a little something on the table, will not feel it.\u201d It is beyond the scope of Cop29, or the UN, to impose such levies, and they do not form part of the formal discussions in Azerbaijan. However, a special taskforce including Barbados, France, Spain, Kenya and others \u2013 but not, so far, the UK \u2013 is working to bring the proposals to reality. One vitally important action that she hopes Cop29 will take is to focus on methane. Emissions of this gas \u2013 which comes from fossil fuel exploration, agriculture and waste, and is many times more powerful than CO2 in heating the planet \u2013 have been rising, but efforts to control them have so far had little impact. \u201cThere needs to be a global methane agreement,\u201d she said. Scientists have said that controlling methane could prevent 0.5C of heating in the short term. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Mottley said.",

      "bodyText": "New evidence has emerged to suggest that an undercover police officer set fire to a high street department store while posing as a committed animal rights activist, causing damage worth \u00a3340,000, a public inquiry has heard. The accusation against Bob Lambert, who also fathered a child while undercover and later became a senior police officer, is contained in testimony from one of the conspirators in the arson plot. At the undercover policing inquiry on Wednesday, Paul Gravett, an activist, admitted for the first time that he was part of the coordinated plot, even though he has never been prosecuted for his role in it. Gravett has been given immunity from future prosecution in exchange for describing the alleged involvement of Lambert in the clandestine plot to set fire to Debenhams stores in protest against the fur trade in 1987. Questions had previously been raised in parliament about Lambert\u2019s involvement in the arson attack \u2013 which he has always denied. Gravett\u2019s testimony, after years of silence, has been described by David Barr, the inquiry\u2019s barrister, as \u201cparticularly striking\u201d. Four other witnesses have alleged to the inquiry that Lambert participated in the conspiracy. One of the inquiry\u2019s most significant tasks is to decide whether Lambert, while a police officer, caused huge criminal damage to a well-known high street store. Insurers calculated in 1987 that the fire caused \u00a3340,000 of damage. The inquiry, led by the retired judge John Mitting, is examining the conduct of about 140 undercover police officers who spied on more than 1,000 political groups over more than four decades. Lambert is a key, and controversial, figure in the covert operations. He fathered a child with an activist, known as Jacqui, during his covert deployment, then disappeared from her life and left her to bring up their son alone. Jacqui discovered the truth more than two decades later, leaving her devastated and traumatised. While undercover in the 1980s, Lambert had at least three other intimate relationships with women without disclosing that he was part of a secret Scotland Yard unit that infiltrated political campaigns. Lambert\u2019s managers saw his deployment as an outstanding success: he was awarded a commendation for gathering information to arrest campaigners. In the 1990s, he helped run the secret unit while many of its undercover officers deceived women into relationships. Gravett described Lambert as a credible spy who could be charming. He said he and other activists never doubted Lambert\u2019s campaigning credentials as he had carried out other criminal acts to promote the Animal Liberation Front. Gravett said that in spring 1987 Lambert instigated the plot by proposing that the activists escalate their protests on a \u201cvastly different scale\u201d. Lambert, Gravett, and two other activists \u2013 Geoff Sheppard and Andrew Clarke \u2013 decided to place incendiary devices in four Debenhams stores in and around London, with the aim of triggering the sprinkler system and flooding the stores, he said. The idea was to place the devices in the stores just before closing time and use timers to ignite them hours later. Gravett testified that at midday on Saturday 11 July 1987, he went to a house in Haringey, north London to pick up the incendiary devices. He said Lambert collected two devices along with himself, Sheppard and Clarke, and they each left to plant them at their designated store. Lambert was allocated the branch of Debenhams in Harrow, north-west London, Gravett said. Gravett said his target was the branch in Reading. But his train from London was delayed. He alleges that because he realised he would not get there before the branch closed, he threw his devices into a canal. At another store, in Luton, the sprinkler system had been turned off to be repaired so the fire was not doused. The damage to that store was calculated to be at least \u00a36m. Lambert is credited by his bosses as the source of the information that later led to the arrests of Sheppard and Clarke, who were jailed. Sheppard previously told the inquiry Lambert was integral to the plot and set fire to the Harrow branch. Lambert is due to give evidence to the inquiry in December.",

      "bodyText": "On balance, Keir Starmer can probably live with this. The first four months of his time in office may not have been quite as straightforward as he would have liked \u2013 he must have been hoping for a six-month honeymoon period \u2013 but at least he can tick off prime minister\u2019s questions as something he doesn\u2019t have to worry much about. Kemi Badenoch is turning out to be the gift that keeps on giving \u2026 to the Labour party. Put simply, the more you get to see of her the less there appears to be. Behind her rather patronising, condescending facade there\u2019s a largely empty interior. She is riddled with levitas. Her self-confidence is in inverse proportion to her abilities. She\u2019s not nearly as bright as she thinks she is and quite where she got the idea she is a brilliant performer in the Commons is anyone\u2019s guess. It\u2019s Liz Truss levels of delusion. Kemi clearly thought that being leader of the opposition was going to be a doddle. That all she had to do was turn up, sneer a bit and ask her six questions and that Starmer would dissolve in front of her eyes. Cue thunderous cheers from the Conservative benches. It turns out that PMQs is a lot more difficult than it looks. It takes detailed preparation, pitch-perfect timing and a razor-sharp mind. None of which she has yet demonstrated. To be kind, one could say this is early days. KemiKaze is only a couple of weeks into her new job. But to make the necessary improvements will require a level of humility. The grace to admit she has been a disappointment. The grace to admit she\u2019s looked out of her depth. But grace and Kemi are not natural companions. So you can see the concern on the Tory benches. Realising too late that they have been conned. It\u2019s not yet a catastrophe for them. But it might well be soon if it goes on for much longer. Meanwhile, Keir is living his best life in the Commons. Maybe it\u2019s something about being in government. Or maybe it\u2019s just knowing that nothing his opponent may say can wrongfoot him. As leader of the opposition, there was something a bit wooden about his performance at the dispatch box. Those \u201cLego man\u201d jibes hurt because there was a kernel of truth. But now Starmer is a changed man. Full of energy, quick-witted and often surprisingly funny. Who knew? It helps that Kemi is her own worst enemy. She began by making a snippy remark about Starmer\u2019s attendance at Cop29 in Azerbaijan. This may play well with the right of her own party but it doesn\u2019t land well with most of the country. Floods and droughts in many parts of the world are a genuine concern. Just not to KemiKaze. The empathy bypass was on full view. Is this really the new caring Tory party? The rest of the exchanges were no better. Kemi thinking she was on to a winner only to realise she had set herself a trap. She huffed and puffed about a council tax increase that was entirely her own invention and then tried to pick holes in the budget while admitting she was thoroughly in favour of all Labour\u2019s spending priorities.

Kemi sat down with a wide grin, seemingly oblivious to the self-inflicted disaster. Her shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, took her by the arm and whispered, \u201cYou were fab.\u201d A lie. Thereafter there was a litany of planted questions from Labour backbenchers that turned the Commons into a pointless echo chamber, before we got to the unofficial leader of the opposition.

      "body": "<p>In John Harris\u2019s article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/10/donald-trump-the-left-social-media-rightwing-propaganda-progressives-woke\">From Trump\u2019s victory, a simple, inescapable message: many people despise the left, 10 November</a>) there is a nugget of text that best describes the abominable mess the \u201cleft\u201d (a catch-all descriptor which is in itself part of the problem) finds itself in, because it beautifully expresses both the problem and solution for those of a progressive bent in one fell swoop \u2013 albeit he delivers them in reverse.</p> <p>It came when Harris spoke of an agenda often \u201cexpressed with a judgmental arrogance, and based on behavioural codes \u2013 to do with microaggressions, or the correct use of pronouns ...\u201d. That rings true with many people who aren\u2019t that fussed with identity politics (or politics in general) and feel alienated by those who are.</p> <p>But then Harris continues with a clanger I could barely believe he put on paper: \u201c\u2026 that are very hard for people outside highly educated circles to navigate\u201d. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not&nbsp;intentional, but surely such a coda, in its implication, falls foul of&nbsp;the same jaundiced thinking: you are too dumb to understand what \u201cprogress\u201d is.</p> <p>On the contrary, it\u2019s not that people don\u2019t understand the need to be respectful to or tolerant of others who are different; outside of political extremes, I\u2019d say even socially conservative people have a code of \u201clive and let live\u201d. No, it\u2019s more that many people are tired of being told how backwards they are if they don\u2019t play along with the priggishness of signs, flags, symbols and linguistic rules.</p> <p>When the latter stance hardens into an ideology that brooks no dissent, the result at the ballot box will be somewhat inevitable \u2013&nbsp;however ghastly it may be to some of us. The irony is that the growing solipsism at the heart of so much progressive politics seems to be occupying both the ivory tower and&nbsp;the bunker at the same time. Maybe leaving both those places is&nbsp;how to start the comeback. <br><strong>Colin Montgomery</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris recognises that there are many reasons why Trump won, but then reverts to a view of a progressive left despised by a reactionary right and a muddled middle. The last 50 years have seen extraordinary changes in society: changes in behavioural norms, in attitudes towards female equality, different ethnicities, sexual orientation, behaviour and religion. But societies are heterogeneous, and many people feel uncomfortable with some changes.</p> <p>Inequality of wealth and income is less accepted as fair, necessary or inevitable, with a growing gap between aspirations and achievement. The left underestimated the difficulty of creating widespread acceptance of the changes that they have introduced and campaign for, making it easy for those we call populists to call us the \u201cliberal elite\u201d and to gain votes for \u201ctraditional values\u201d.</p> <p>Societal problems are complex. Complex problems never have simple solutions, and most people have no time, desire or ability to wrestle with the complexities.<br><strong>Martyn Thomas</strong><br><em>Tunbridge Wells, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris has once again proved he is the smartest writer the Guardian has. The left has become elitist, snobbish and tone deaf to its old voting base in the working class. If you continue to campaign on feelings and \u201cvibes\u201d rather than promises kept and economic reality, you will keep losing. Keir Starmer won an election on promises and lost support instantly by breaking them.<br><strong>Dan Rainey</strong><br><em>Hull</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

      "bodyText": "In John Harris\u2019s article (From Trump\u2019s victory, a simple, inescapable message: many people despise the left, 10 November) there is a nugget of text that best describes the abominable mess the \u201cleft\u201d (a catch-all descriptor which is in itself part of the problem) finds itself in, because it beautifully expresses both the problem and solution for those of a progressive bent in one fell swoop \u2013 albeit he delivers them in reverse. It came when Harris spoke of an agenda often \u201cexpressed with a judgmental arrogance, and based on behavioural codes \u2013 to do with microaggressions, or the correct use of pronouns ...\u201d. That rings true with many people who aren\u2019t that fussed with identity politics (or politics in general) and feel alienated by those who are. But then Harris continues with a clanger I could barely believe he put on paper: \u201c\u2026 that are very hard for people outside highly educated circles to navigate\u201d. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not intentional, but surely such a coda, in its implication, falls foul of the same jaundiced thinking: you are too dumb to understand what \u201cprogress\u201d is. On the contrary, it\u2019s not that people don\u2019t understand the need to be respectful to or tolerant of others who are different; outside of political extremes, I\u2019d say even socially conservative people have a code of \u201clive and let live\u201d. No, it\u2019s more that many people are tired of being told how backwards they are if they don\u2019t play along with the priggishness of signs, flags, symbols and linguistic rules. When the latter stance hardens into an ideology that brooks no dissent, the result at the ballot box will be somewhat inevitable \u2013 however ghastly it may be to some of us. The irony is that the growing solipsism at the heart of so much progressive politics seems to be occupying both the ivory tower and the bunker at the same time. Maybe leaving both those places is how to start the comeback. Colin Montgomery Edinburgh \u2022 John Harris recognises that there are many reasons why Trump won, but then reverts to a view of a progressive left despised by a reactionary right and a muddled middle. The last 50 years have seen extraordinary changes in society: changes in behavioural norms, in attitudes towards female equality, different ethnicities, sexual orientation, behaviour and religion. But societies are heterogeneous, and many people feel uncomfortable with some changes. Inequality of wealth and income is less accepted as fair, necessary or inevitable, with a growing gap between aspirations and achievement. The left underestimated the difficulty of creating widespread acceptance of the changes that they have introduced and campaign for, making it easy for those we call populists to call us the \u201cliberal elite\u201d and to gain votes for \u201ctraditional values\u201d. Societal problems are complex. Complex problems never have simple solutions, and most people have no time, desire or ability to wrestle with the complexities. Martyn Thomas Tunbridge Wells, Kent \u2022 John Harris has once again proved he is the smartest writer the Guardian has. The left has become elitist, snobbish and tone deaf to its old voting base in the working class. If you continue to campaign on feelings and \u201cvibes\u201d rather than promises kept and economic reality, you will keep losing. Keir Starmer won an election on promises and lost support instantly by breaking them. Dan Rainey Hull \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

I\u2019ll explain what that means and why it is both good and bad news.</p> \n  <p>As well as the key issue of the trillion dollar goal for climate finance at Cop29, getting countries to pledge much bigger cuts in emissions is critical too. We learned this morning that far from \u201ctransitioning away from fossil fuels\u201d as promised last year at Cop28, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/13/no-sign-of-promised-fossil-fuel-transition-as-emissions-hit-new-high\">fossil fuel emissions will rise in 2024</a> - despite needing to fall by 43% by 2030 to have any chance of keeping to the 1.5C limit for global heating.</p> \n  <p>Emissions cuts are meant to be delivered by each country via its NDC and a new round of NDCs are due by February. Handing in NDCs early, as Brazil has done, can help push other nations to do the same - in the past, many have been late. Ambitious NDCs can also raise the collective game.</p> \n  <p>The good news then is that Brazil, which is hosting next year\u2019s Cop, has filed its NDC and in parts it is more ambitious, aiming for cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035, compared to 2005. But in the 30-minute press conference held by Brazil in Baku, fossil fuels were mentioned only in a question from a journalist. That is quite an omission, as Brazil plans a <a href=\"https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=u001.ibreQe1iIimkwHUK9y-2BRCK4jz9TIyUMpq7kv6XU6J0iD65eJwenJW-2FqoKI7QT5Td8BmSc4Gcv4g-2F-2Bcqp3Qtbr-2FLWuYJSUU0T8Qg9xb-2BXPRPu-2B4vaUgoqLSum-2F3dnlRvkq0KjcZ0vhIb-2Fz1uWPKRz1w-3D-3DWC4p_gfPvqRwRVzSilYUdMGDwGzgquwtw94tmgy4EJG0a0uTJY6yeaHEIcT-2B094VRLYEq-2BmZhMbBYlFNCkClh0LV7DI1f21GQ8AQtBdPVHrZ26kpDt35ssAy1T0vb-2FktxsD0bO-2FaKpPzDM1-2Bttyfo-2FsZVcBkrXr-2BjDzku6W7GcctZVulOAxDo-2Frgo6rBZKJPh6W9DhAJ3OZ-2FotkKPNhZ0IweDmawDAzwMF4qXnkqXjrD1sW-2FgPlcek1QSBU360Tn-2Bs3KgokUJ4-2BjVOP9MqyGSwWF-2BGUrVEl1HkTlPpy2d8tQ5tZu3itzXNfVuC7QZ9stf5zM-2B4wSUUKKM6U9QUTUj2RAkgoys2bBhSdvF5iwXO42QJZ3QqX07JXt6dmQlE7kuwiJeXO5Tg2O9oaOP0BVZIMd9gg-3D-3D\">36% increase in production</a> by 2035.</p> \n  <p>Brazilian vice-president Geraldo Alckmin answered the question by talking about biofuel - ethanol - for cars, green hydrogen, solar and wind energy - but not oil and gas. </p> \n  <p>Shady Khalil, at Oil Change International, said: \u201cBrazil\u2019s NDC demonstrates ambition in reducing emissions, but it cannot claim to be at the \u2018forefront of the global energy transition\u2019 unless it puts an immediate end to new fossil fuel projects. Brazil\u2019s increase [in oil and gas] production is ignored by the new NDC.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The justification appears to be that the oil and gas would be exported, making the emissions someone else\u2019s problem. The first of the new round of NDCs, filed by last year\u2019s Cop hosts the UEA, included the same manoeuvre.</p> \n  <p>Natalie Jones, at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, said: \u201cThe UAE claims its NDC aligns with 1.5C targets, but it sidesteps a huge chunk of emissions - those from exporting oil and gas. The science is unambiguous: new oil and gas fields have no place in a 1.5C future.\u201d</p> \n  <p>As we all live on one planet, under one atmosphere, shifting the responsibility for emissions from one country to another helps no-one, and the problem remains a central challenge in ending the climate crisis.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6734bffa8f0839ad951d7906\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-13T15:06:01.540Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Argentinian negotiators ordered to withdraw from Cop29</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This feels like a worrying development.

Tomorrow morning from about 6am we will be back again with more rolling coverage of the Cop29 talks, so be sure to swing by the Guardian website to find out the latest from the summit. In the meantime, here are the biggest news lines from day three of the talks: Azerbaijan\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev, lambasted France for its colonial \u201ccrimes\u201d in its overseas territories. \u201cThe crimes of France in its so-called overseas territories would not be complete without mentioning the recent human rights violations,\u201d said Aliyev. As a result, France\u2019s ecology minister, Agnes Pannier-Runacher, announced she was cancelling her trip to Baku to take part in the Cop29 talks. Aliyev\u2019s remarks were a \u201cflagrant violation of the code of conduct\u201d for running the UN climate talks, she said. Argentina\u2019s negotiating team were ordered home. The country\u2019s president Javier Milei has previously said that the climate crisis is a \u201csocialist lie\u201d. \u201cWe have instructions from the ministry of foreign affairs to no longer participate,\u201d the country\u2019s top environmental official said, UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said small, climate-vulnerable island states have the right to be angry with rich nations for their failure to lead on climate action. \u201cYou are on the sharp end of a colossal injustice,\u201d he said. Dr. Pa\u2019oleilei Luteru, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to exit the Paris climate agreement is \u201csomething of grave, grave concern\u201d to climate-vulnerable countries. \u201cOur survival is very much at risk,\u201d he said. Muhammad Yunus, interim leader of Bangladesh, hit out at \u201climitless consumption\u201d and called out for a new culture without waste, fossil fuels or personal profit. \u201cOur civilisation is at a great risk as we continue to promote self-destructive values,\u201d said Yunus. Yunus also hit out at the \u201chumiliating\u201d situation of poorer countries forced to beg for money to fix the problems caused by their richer counterparts in the global north. \u201cWhy should there be a negotiation? You are causing the problem, then you solve it,\u201d he said. Similar comments were made by Shehbaz Sharif, prime minister of Pakistan, who joined a chorus of leaders using their speeches to call for more money to reach their climate goals - and specifying that they need grants rather than loans that saddle them with more debt. Iran\u2019s vice-president, Shina Ansari Hamedani, said sanctions against her country were preventing it accessing the finance it needs to build a green economy. She called the sanctions \u201cunjustified and irrational\u201d, and condemned the war in Gaza by the \u201coccupying Zionist regime\u201d. Giorgia Meloni, prime minister of Italy, insisted \u201cgas, biofuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage\u201d will continue to have a role in supplying energy for a growing world population. She also cited nuclear fusion power as a potential \u201cgamechanger\u201d. Bangladesh\u2019s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, has said it is \u201chumiliating\u201d for poorer nations to be forced to beg for the money to fix the problems caused by richer ones. Yunus has made a series of outspoken remarks today, earlier condemning a culture that had promoted \u201climitless consumption\u201d, and then asking reporters from US-based news agency The Associated Press: \u201cWhy should there be a negotiation? You are causing the problem, then you solve it.\u201d Speaking this time to the French news agency AFP, Yunus said: I think that\u2019s very humiliating for nations, to come and ask for money to fix... (the) problem that others caused for them. Why should we be dragged here to negotiate? You know the problem... it\u2019s not a fish market. France\u2019s minister for ecology is to cancel a trip to Baku to attend Cop29 after Azerbaijan\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev, made a speech earlier attacking France\u2019s actions in its overseas territories. Agnes Pannier-Runacher told French lawmakers: \u201cThe comments made by President (Ilham) Aliyev at the opening of COP29 in Baku against France and Europe are unacceptable.\u201d It was a \u201cflagrant violation of the code of conduct\u201d for running United Nations climate talks, she said. And she further lashed out at Aliyev\u2019s \u201cequally unacceptable comments on fossil fuels\u201d after he described his country\u2019s vast oil and gas reserves as a \u201cgift of God\u201d. Despite her deciding not to attend in person, Pannier-Runacher said the team of French negotiators in Baku would not relent in their efforts to do a deal \u201cto protect the planet and its populations\u201d from climate change. As we reported earlier, Aliyev drew loud applause from delegates of some Pacific island nations after a speech in which he slammed Paris for its response to independence protests that rocked New Caledonia this spring. Thirteen people, mostly indigenous Kanaks, and two police officers, have been killed and nearly 3,000 people have been arrested since police in the territory launched an investigation just days after the unrest started in May. Enthusiasm for nuclear power has grown at Cop29, with six new countries joining a pledge from last year to triple global nuclear capacity by 2050. The addition of El Salvador, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kosovo, Nigeria and Turkey brings the total number of members up to 31. None of the new signatories currently use nuclear power - although there was a reactor in Aktau, across the Caspian sea from Baku, when Kazakhstan was part of the Soviet Union. Several world leaders used their speeches at Cop29 on Tuesday and Wednesday to push for the technology. Kazakhstan advertised its uranium exports, Czechia made a sales pitch for nuclear services it could provide other countries, Poland described nuclear as \u201cthe future\u201d and Slovakia boasted about its plans for \u201csmall modular reactors\u201d and recycling spent fuel. In its roadmap to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, the International Energy Agency sees global nuclear capacity doubling, rather than tripling. It says extending the lifetime of existing plants is \u201cindispensable\u201d but warned that the industry would have to deliver projects \u201con time and on budget\u201d to fulfil its role. Brazil\u2019s new climate plan, known as a \u201cnationally determined contribution\u201d, has won praise from many at Cop29. But, according to my colleague Dharna Noor, it has left young conference attendees with the organization Engajamundo unimpressed. \u201cIt\u2019s not ambitious, really,\u201d said Jar\u00ea Pinag\u00e9, 25, who travelled to the conference from the Brazilian state of Amazonas, who said the plan was \u201cweak\u201d on both adaptation and youth protections. Samantha Cosco, 25, hails from Pernambuco, Brazil. She said Brazilian officials \u201cdidn\u2019t engage with any of our recommendations.\u201d A bit of reaction coming in from delegates in Baku to the news that Argentina is to withdraw its negotiators from Cop29. The Argentinian Citizen Association for Human Rights posted on social media that it had worked with the Argentinian delegation on the gender program, adding: It is sad to see Argentina\u2019s absence from the negotiations after having led on this issue in many of the previous COPs. Another sustainability expert from Argentina posted: Argentina withdraws its delegation from #COP29 in Baku, losing its voice in climate finance negotiations. At a key moment to secure resources against the climate crisis, the country is left out, weakening its future and its ability to adapt. My colleague Patrick Greenfield will have more on this story shortly. Brazil\u2019s new emissions cutting pledge - good cop and bad cop Brazil delivered its new \u201cnationally determined contribution\u201d (NDC) to the UN today at Cop29. I\u2019ll explain what that means and why it is both good and bad news. As well as the key issue of the trillion dollar goal for climate finance at Cop29, getting countries to pledge much bigger cuts in emissions is critical too. We learned this morning that far from \u201ctransitioning away from fossil fuels\u201d as promised last year at Cop28, fossil fuel emissions will rise in 2024 - despite needing to fall by 43% by 2030 to have any chance of keeping to the 1.5C limit for global heating. Emissions cuts are meant to be delivered by each country via its NDC and a new round of NDCs are due by February. Handing in NDCs early, as Brazil has done, can help push other nations to do the same - in the past, many have been late. Ambitious NDCs can also raise the collective game. The good news then is that Brazil, which is hosting next year\u2019s Cop, has filed its NDC and in parts it is more ambitious, aiming for cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035, compared to 2005. But in the 30-minute press conference held by Brazil in Baku, fossil fuels were mentioned only in a question from a journalist. That is quite an omission, as Brazil plans a 36% increase in production by 2035. Brazilian vice-president Geraldo Alckmin answered the question by talking about biofuel - ethanol - for cars, green hydrogen, solar and wind energy - but not oil and gas. Shady Khalil, at Oil Change International, said: \u201cBrazil\u2019s NDC demonstrates ambition in reducing emissions, but it cannot claim to be at the \u2018forefront of the global energy transition\u2019 unless it puts an immediate end to new fossil fuel projects. Brazil\u2019s increase [in oil and gas] production is ignored by the new NDC.\u201d The justification appears to be that the oil and gas would be exported, making the emissions someone else\u2019s problem. The first of the new round of NDCs, filed by last year\u2019s Cop hosts the UEA, included the same manoeuvre. Natalie Jones, at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, said: \u201cThe UAE claims its NDC aligns with 1.5C targets, but it sidesteps a huge chunk of emissions - those from exporting oil and gas. The science is unambiguous: new oil and gas fields have no place in a 1.5C future.\u201d As we all live on one planet, under one atmosphere, shifting the responsibility for emissions from one country to another helps no-one, and the problem remains a central challenge in ending the climate crisis. This feels like a worrying development. My colleague Patrick Greenfield has been speaking to the Argentinian team in Baku. Argentine negotiators representing the government of Javier Milei have been ordered to withdraw from Cop29 and will no longer participate in the Baku climate summit. Speaking to the Guardian, Argentina\u2019s undersecretary for the environment Ana Lamas - the country\u2019s most senior representative on the climate and nature after Milei downgraded the ministry - confirmed the decision first reported by Climatica. \u201cIt\u2019s true. We have instructions from the ministry of foreign affairs to no longer participate. That\u2019s all I can tell you,\u201d she said. Lamas did not answer whether Argentina was planning on leaving the Paris agreement. Argentina\u2019s far right leader Milei has previously said that the climate crisis is a \u201csocialist lie\u201d. He threatened to withdraw from the Paris agreement during the election campaign last year but has since backed down. Yesterday, Javier Milei spoke with incoming US president Donald Trump, after which Milei\u2019s spokesperson said Trump told his Argentine counterpart that he was his \u201cfavourite president\u201d. We earlier reported how Muhammad Yunus, the interim leader of Bangladesh, had hit out at a culture of \u201climitless consumption\u201d and called for \u201ca new lifestyle consistent with the safety of the planet\u201d. US-based news agency The Associated Press is now carrying more remarks from him. World leaders ought not even be negotiating this year, Yunus told AP. Countries responsible for global heating should simply provide the funds to deal with the crisis. \u201cWhy should there be a negotiation? You are causing the problem, then you solve it,\u201d he told AP in an interview in Baku, Azerbaijan. \u201cWe will raise our voice and tell them it\u2019s your fault, like what we did with colonialism.\u201d Yunus said the climate negotiations can be \u201chumiliating\u201d for poor countries. He likened the talks to a \u201cfish market\u201d packed with people trying to get the best bargains. \u201cThat\u2019s a very wrong perception of the whole thing,\u201d he said. Known as the \u201cbanker to the poorest of the poor\u201d, Yunus was chosen to lead Bangladesh\u2019s interim government after deadly nationwide protests toppled its divisive prime minister Sheikh Hasina. His country is among the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change, with up to 17% of its land area at risk from rising seas. But \u201ceveryone\u2019s home is on fire,\u201d said Yunus. He said rich nations, who developed their economies by burning planet-warming coal, oil and gas, are \u201cnot safe either. So they have to act in their self-interest as well as the interest of the whole planet.\u201d In addition to faith leaders rejecting the Azerbaijan president\u2019s claim that oil and gas is a \u2018gift from God\u2019, Brazil\u2019s environment minister Marina Silva has given a puckish response: We should take care in moderation of the gifts we are given - if we eat too much sugar, we get diabetes. As diplomats wrangle over how to fund the world\u2019s adaptation to a climate in crisis, production in the industry primarily responsible for climate breakdown has hit an all-time high, according to a new analysis. According to a report by German NGO Urgewald, annual investment in oil and gas deposit exploration averaged $61.1bn (\u20ac57.5bn euros) between 2022 and 2024 \u2013 eclipsing the mere $702m so far pledged for the loss and damage fund agreed at Cop28 in Dubai last year. Based on data from companies and specialised analysis firms, Urgewald\u2019s Global Oil &amp; Gas Exit List was said to include 1,769 active companies in the oil and gas industry covering 95% of the world\u2019s hydrocarbon production. Urgewald said the listed firms produced 55.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent, the highest level on record. Nils Bartsch, the NGO\u2019s head of oil and gas research, described the findings as \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d Tinaye Mabara, of the Agape Earth Coalition, was quoted in the report as saying: It is perverse to see companies shelling out tens of billions of dollars each year to search for new oil and gas reserves that will lead to even more loss and damage in the future. 2023 was the hottest year on record. 2024 looks set to break the record. Azerbaijan\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev, has used his time on stage to lambast France for its colonial \u201ccrimes\u201d in its overseas territories, continuing a longrunning diplomatic schism between the two countries. Aliyev drew loud applause from delegates of some Pacific island nations after a speech in which he slammed Paris for its response to independence protests that rocked New Caledonia this spring. Thirteen people, mostly indigenous Kanaks, and two police officers, have been killed and nearly 3,000 people have been arrested since police in the territory launched an investigation just days after the unrest started in May. Tensions began after changes to the voting registry that Kanaks felt would favour recent arrivals to the Pacific archipelago. \u201cThe crimes of France in its so-called overseas territories would not be complete without mentioning the recent human rights violations,\u201d said Aliyev. \u201cThe regime of President (Emmanuel) Macron killed 13 people and wounded 169... during legitimate protests by the Kanak people in New Caledonia,\u201d he added. Paris has long supported Baku\u2019s regional rival Armenia, which Azerbaijan defeated in a lightning offensive last year when it retook the breakaway Armenian-populated region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Macron has has not attended Cop29. In the run-up to the summit, Azerbaijan was denounced for its human rights record and political repression. But Aliyev hit back at the European Union and the Council of Europe human rights body calling them \u201csymbols of political corruption that share responsibility with the government of President Macron for the killings of innocent people\u201d. He also said that \u201call political prisoners of France must be liberated\u201d. Campaigners have accused wealthy nations of pushing weak language in climate finance talks at the Cop29 summit to avoid properly funding poorer countries\u2019 adaptations to the climate crisis. On the third day of the climate summit in Baku, where a key aim is reaching a deal on funding to help poorer nations adapt to climate shocks and transition to cleaner energy, a draft text on climate financing goals is already under negotiation. But ActionAid International said wealthier nations are trying to push for an investment model involving \u201cloans, corporate investment, and other finance flows that could potentially do more harm than good\u201d. Teresa Anderson, ActionAid\u2019s global lead on climate justice, said: This is a sprawling and unstructured document which includes every possible idea, option, and permutation. The text reflects developing countries\u2019 need for a goal worth trillions of dollars in grant-based finance so they can cope with the climate crisis. It also includes developed countries\u2019 preferred language on an \u2018investment layer\u2019 which emphasises loans, corporate investment, and other finance flows that could potentially do more harm than good. The \u2018investment; language that rich countries are pushing hard is clearly a bare-faced pitch to avoid providing real grant-based finance, and instead use frontline countries\u2019 desperation to open up to more corporate exploitation. Cop9 negotiations would be more likely to make progress if negotiations focus on areas where there is already consensus, such as the principle that the core of the goal should be public finance. The president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, caused a stir on Tuesday, when he doubled down on a previous remark that the nation\u2019s oil and gas were a \u201cgift from God\u201d and that criticism of the Cop29 host\u2019s expansion of gas production was \u201cwell-orchestrated campaign of slander and blackmail\u201d involving \u201csome politicians, state-controlled NGOs and fake news media in some western countries\u201d. That was unconventional diplomacy, to say the least, for the country tasked with bringing the world together at the summit. Today, faith leaders rejected his comments, writes Damian Carrington, Guardian environment editor. \u201cGod calls us to take good care of the divine gifts of land, water and other resources,\u201d said Bishop Julio Murray, an Anglican from Panama, who is Moderator of the World Council of Churches\u2019 Commission on Climate Justice. \u201cThe biblical concept of Jubilee calls for the rest of the land \u2013 for the liberation of land from exploitation, extraction and drilling \u2013 to allow regeneration and renewal of our only planetary home. We know that the clock is ticking on climate change. We need to put a stop to fossil fuel extraction and production if we are to prevent the worst consequences of climate change.\u201d \u201cAccording to Genesis 2:15, the Bible tells us that God placed people in the Garden of Eden to \u2018take care of it\u2019, emphasising a role as stewards rather than exploiters of the earth,\u201d said Romario Dohmann from the Evangelical Church in the River Plate. Almost 60 faith-based organisations have signed a Call to Action, released today, that states: \u201cAll countries must prioritise the urgent phase-out of fossil fuels, which are the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d As briefly mentioned by my colleague Dharna Noor earlier, negotiators at Cop29 are welcoming a pledge by development banks to lift climate funding to poor and middle-income countries. The World Bank is among the group that on Tuesday announced a joint goal of increasing this finance to $120 billion by 2030, a roughly 60% increase on the amount in 2023. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very good sign,\u201d Eamon Ryan, Ireland\u2019s climate minister, told Reuters on Wednesday. \u201cBut that on its own won\u2019t be enough,\u201d he added, insisting countries and companies must also contribute. Ryan\u2019s view was echoed by Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation who welcomed the announcement as \u201ca shot in the arm for the climate finance discussion\u201d Securing an international climate financing agreement that ensures up to trillions of dollars for climate projects is a key aim of negotiators in Baku over the next two weeks. Developing countries are hoping for big commitments from rich, industrialised counterparts that are the biggest historical contributors to global warming, and some of which are also huge producers of fossil fuels. \u201cDeveloped countries have not only neglected their historical duty to reduce emissions, they are doubling down on fossil-fuel-driven growth,\u201d climate activist Harjeet Singh told Reuters. Christmas has come early at Cop29 with the arrival of Sustaina Claus, writes Damian Carrington, Guardian environment editor. Philip McMaster, from Canada, who has been to 10 Cops, has a particular solution to the world\u2019s climate and other problems: better childhoods to produce better leaders. \u201cMy focus is to make childhood great again \u2013 that\u2019s our little slogan\u201d he says. \u201cWhy? Because childhood produced Trump, childhood produced Biden, it produced you, it produced me. The childhood period is very informative and produces the next generation of leaders.\u201d \u201cBut if you\u2019re putting a phone up in their face, and they don\u2019t get outside and don\u2019t play, and they\u2019re over pharmaceuticalised, you\u2019re just gonna have a bunch of blobs,\u201d McMaster says. \u201cFor 600,000 years, we\u2019ve been having childhoods, feet in the ground, family relations, social relations, scrape your knees, fall down, understand how things work, physicality. \u201cBut childhood is certainly not working now. It has produced the people who are making these decisions now, and they have lost their touch with reality. They\u2019ve lost their touch with childhood.\u201d Dickon Mitchell, prime minister of Grenada, gave a powerful speech \u2013 as leaders of nations on the frontline of the climate crisis are able to do, writes Damian Carrington, Guardian environment editor. \u201cI lead a country which experienced in the first half of the year a 50 year drought. Then on the first day of the second half, we experienced the earliest category five hurricane on record,\u201d he said. \u201cThe island was devastated by flash flooding and landslides, all in a couple of hours.\u201d \u201cWe are not here to beg, or to ask for sympathy,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt is one planet. It may be small islands today, but it will be Spain tomorrow and Florida the next day.\u201d He called for a partnership with rich nations, in which Grenada shared how it is learning to cope with climate chaos. He called particularly for the finance to be provided for the Loss and Damage fund, which is for rebuilding communities after climate catastrophes: \u201cPut the money in the fund, and make it available to those who suffer.\u201d Earlier, Siaosi Sovaleni, Prime Minister of Tonga, expressed his country\u2019s support for Australia\u2019s bid to host Cop31 in 2026, and run it as the \u201cPacific Cop\u201d. He says: \u201cClimate change was, is, and will be the most existential threat to Pacific islands including Tongo.\u201d Turkey is also making a strong pitch to host that summit. The profits of oil and gas producers could pay the entire annual bill for loss and damage caused by climate breakdown, according to a new analysis. Global Witness, a climate NGO, says the world\u2019s top 30 oil and gas companies (excluding those based in poorer countries) recorded a combined average of $400bn per year in free cash flow since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015. That is the same amount researchers from Loss and Damage Collaboration said should be considered the minimum annual funding needed by lower-income countries to deal with the aftermath of climate disasters. Sarah Biermann Becker, a senior fossil fuels investigator at Global Witness, said: From super-charged hurricanes in the US to typhoons in the Philippines, ordinary people are already paying for the climate crisis. They\u2019re paying with their health, homes and livelihoods, and doing what they can to build back in the wake of disaster. But as people struggle in the wake of climate chaos, there is one sector that\u2019s raking in billions and avoiding any culpability for its role in the devastation \u2013 the fossil fuel industry. It\u2019s time to end this injustice. We need billions of dollars to deal with climate impacts, and Big Oil firms are some of the richest companies on the planet \u2013 it\u2019s time they paid their fair share to repair the damage they\u2019ve done. A fund to help poorer countries respond to the effects of climate-related disasters was set up two years ago at Cop27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. But, as pointed out by Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, yesterday, so far pledges to the fund total just $700m. Joseph Mangiben from Buenguet Province, the Philippines, said: When I was a child, strong typhoons didn\u2019t come consecutively every single year. But today they come one after the other. I feel scared and I\u2019m worried about what might happen. The ones who suffer most are poor nations like the Philippines. Ali Zaidi, climate advisor to the US president Joe Biden, has touted his country\u2019s plans to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050 as a bipartisan project that could survive Donald Trump\u2019s resuming power in January. The reelection of Trump, who has vowed to pull the US out of the Paris agreement and even questioned the reality of anthropogenic climate breakdown, has cast a long shadow over the Cop29 talks in Baku. Biden is not attending the summit, but according to AFP US officials in Baku have been trying to reassure their counterparts from other countries that Trump will be unable to halt US climate action. Speaking to delegates, Zaidi suggested the nuclear plans in particular were an example of that. He said: I would remind you that this is an area that has witnessed not only bipartisan support... but also an area where Democratic and Republican administrations have passed the baton, one to the other, to keep progress going. These targets are bold, but they are also achievable. Many nations have already said they believe growing nuclear power will be the best way to meet net-zero commitments, in spite of the heavy cost of building reactors and the fear of catastrophic accidents. Greece\u2019s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has used his statement in Baku to warn that Europe needs to devote more resources to responding to the impact of climate disasters. His country has doubled its renewable energy output since 2014, but in recent years has also struggled to recover from multiple floods and wildfires . This year, it had its hottest summer on record, after a winter with barely any rain. Addressing delegates, Mitsotakis said, according to Reuters: We cannot focus so much on 2050 that we forget 2024. We need more resources to prepare to respond in time, in order to save lives and livelihoods and to help people and communities rebuild after disaster. Europe accounted for a diminishing share of global emissions but was almost alone in defending the rules of free trade and should make sure that the energy transition will not hurt its economy, Mitsotakis said. We need to ask hard questions about a path that goes very fast at the expense of our competitiveness, and a path that goes somewhat slower but allows our industry to adapt and to thrive. It is our responsibility to weigh these trade offs carefully Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to exit the Paris climate agreement is \u201csomething of grave, grave concern\u201d to climate-vulnerable countries, Ambassador Dr. Pa\u2019oleilei Luteru, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, told the Guardian, writes Dharna Noor, fossil fuels and climate reporter for the Guardian US. In many places, climate disaster causes temporary devastation. But for small island states, the threat is existential, said Lutero, who is also the permanent representative of Samoa at the UN. \u201cOur survival is very much at risk,\u201d he said. As the world\u2019s largest economy and top contributor to historic emissions, the US has an \u201cethical responsibility\u201d to lead the climate fight, Lutero said. And without decisive climate action, the threat to other countries will also become more pronounced, Lutero said. \u201cThis is not just a crisis for small island developing states. Although we are the ones at the forefront, it will come to everyone if we do not act,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US doesn\u2019t live on a different planet.\u201d The UK should also increase its ambition on climate action, Lutero said. Britain\u2019s recent refusal to advocate for strong UN treaty language on fossil fuel phaseout has been \u201cdisappointing,\u201d he said, as have cuts to the country\u2019s development budget. UK officials have told him more aid budget cuts are possible, though they assured that they do not foresee a \u201cdrastic reduction in the amount of resources.\u201d \u201cObviously, if you going to cut the budget it\u2019s going to have an impact,\u201d he said. Cop29 negotiators must quickly set a goal for climate finance, Lutero continued \u2014 a main task for negotiators at Cop29, since an (often broken) 2009 pledge expires this year. \u201cIt\u2019s of critical importance that we agree on, or at least have a very good idea of, the quantity that we\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said. Poor nations need at least $1tn annually to cope with climate costs, and developed countries are willing to ensure about half of that comes from public money, leaving a yawning gap that countries are hoping to fill by other means. But \u201cyou can\u2019t fill the gap if you don\u2019t know what the starting point will be in terms of resources,\u201d Lutero said. In addition to making ambitious financial commitments, rich nations should help vulnerable countries employ green technologies, while pressuring the global financial institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to restructure with climate justice in mind. A multilateral approach to the climate crisis is needed, Lutero argued. \u201cIt\u2019s only when we come together that we can address global issues,\u201d he said. Fiona Harvey wrote this week about how to fill the climate finance gap: As we mentioned earlier, today global leaders have been the delegates in Baku. According to the US-based news agency AP, many were expected to detail their nations\u2019 first hand experiences of the catastrophic weather-related disasters becoming more frequent as a result of climate breakdown. Dickon Mitchell, prime minister of Grenada, told how his country had for most of the year suffered a 15-month drought, which only broke with the catastrophe of the category 5 Hurricane Beryl. He said: At this very moment, as I stand here yet again, my island has been devastated by flash flooding, landslides and the deluge of excessive rainfall, all in the space of a matter of a couple hours. It may be small island developing states today. It will be Spain tomorrow. It will be Florida the day after. It\u2019s one planet. Small island states are among those suffering the worst of the impacts of climate breakdown. Philip Edward Davis, prime minister of the Bahamas, also came with stern words for delegates, warning that progress on the climate was too often set back by changes of governments, such as in the US and Germany recently. If we leave climate action to the whims of political cycles, our planet\u2019s future becomes precarious, very precarious. The climate crisis does not pause for elections or to accommodate the way of changing political ideas or ties. It demands continuity, commitment and most of all, solidarity. Hello, this is Damien Gayle taking over the liveblog for a few hours now, with thanks to Matt for getting things going this morning. Please do send us any comments or tips, or suggestions for that matter, on things we ought to be taking a look at. You can reach the team at cop29@theguardian.com. A common theme around Cops is that climate summits are a waste of time - from the leaders of poor countries fed up with failed promises from the rich world, to activists sceptical of delegates flying to semi-petrostates, to teenagers aghast at the persistent lack of action from people who claim to care. Sigrid Karl, an Austrian youth delegate at Cop29, described feeling overwhelmed, hopeful and needing stamina. \u201cEven though it\u2019s difficult sometimes, there\u2019s so many people here really trying to fight.\u201d She said the Europeans had been willing to engage with young people perhaps more than some other delegations. Still, she added, the rhetoric around listening to young people can be \u201cfrustrating\u201d if it shifts the responsibility to solve problems. \u201cIt\u2019s not young people that are able to take these political positions.\u201d Karl said she understood people who felt disengaged with climate talks. \u201cI totally get that it seems far away, but this is a very important process to talk about these issues globally and find solutions together.\u201d Still, not everyone has to be engaged with these processes, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many things to do nationally and in your communities.\u201d As negotiations continue in Baku this piece outlining what a successful Cop29 would look like by my colleague Fiona Harvey is worth a read The Guardian\u2019s editorial published last night [and in this morning\u2019s print edition in the UK] pulls no punches, arguing for urgent action and warning the world faces a \u201cmenacing moment\u201d as signs of climate breakdown escalate around the world Simon Evans from Carbon Tracker has a useful update on the talks from Cop29 My colleague Phoebe Weston has some analysis from the UN biodiversity conference which ended in disarray earlier this month. She reports that the event held in Colombia saw a record number of lobbyists from the meat, oil and pesticides industries in attendance Small, climate-vulnerable island states have the right to be angry with rich nations for their failure to lead on climate action, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday. \u201cYou are on the sharp end of a colossal injustice, an injustice that sees the very future of your islands threatened by rising seas,\u201d he said. Guterres praised the nations for their ambitious climate pledges, saying, \u201cyou are the first responders,\u201d and urged wealthy G20 nations to take their lead. To support vulnerable islands, negotiators must finalise the creation of a loss and damage fund and boost funding for adaptation and mitigation, Guterres said. In September, the UN called for the transformation of international financial institutions to relieve debt and promote access to climate aid, the secretary-general noted. \u201cWe must push for implementation of these commitments starting here and now,\u201d he said. Transforming the architecture of financial institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund is a key priority for vulnerable, heavily-indebted nations, Ambassador Dr. Pa\u2019oleilei Luteru, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying give us free money,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying primarily is we want an even, level playing field.\u201d Away from Baku my colleague Jonathan Watts has been reporting on the real world impacts of the escalating climate crisis \u2013 this time from flood hit Spain. And he says that as the weather gets more extreme \u2013 anger is rising among the public. Mian Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, Prime Minister of Pakistan, has joined a chorus of leaders using their speeches to call for more money to reach their climate goals - and specifying that they need grants rather than loans that saddle them with more debt. \u201cWithout climate justice, there can be no real resilience,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want other countries to face the fight Pakistan faced in 2022.\u201d Pakistan was devastated by floods two years ago, shortly before Cop27. The disaster added a sense of urgency to that year\u2019s negotiations that helped pressure rich countries to set up a fund to pay for the losses and damages borne by poor countries. (You can read more on that from my colleague Nina Lakhani here.) \u201cTwo years, I warned at the top of my voice that the future would never forgive our inaction,\u201d said Sharif. \u201cToday, I echo the same warning with greater urgency and fullest energy at my command.\u201d 25 countries have announced a commitment to swift and ambitious climate action. \u201cToo much is at stake for anything other than a race to the top,\u201d said Hilda Heine, the president of the Republic of the Marshall Islands at a Wednesday press conference. The statement from the \u201chigh ambition coalition,\u201d formed in the lead up to the 2015 Paris Climate Accord negotiations, called for Cop29 negotiators to increase their climate finance commitments, promote accessibility to aid, and push for the transformation of international financial institutions to promote climate and development goals. \u201cAddressing debt and the high cost of capital is also key,\u201d Heine said The diverse list of signatories, including the Marshall Islands, Antigua and Barbuda, Germany, Spain, and Chile, additionally called for mitigation pledges in line with a 1.5 degree rise in temperature and increased efforts to adapt to the climate crisis. The rights of women and girls are also essential, the statement said. On Tuesday, multilateral development banks issued a joint agreement to boost financial support for climate aid \u2014 a \u201ccrucial\u201d step, said Chile\u2019s Minister for the Environment Maisa Rojas. \u201cWe really needed that so that that [climate] ambition really translates into action,\u201d she said. In the US \u2014 which joined the high ambition coalition in 2021 \u2014 Donald Trump has pledged to pull the country from the Paris Agreement when he takes office next year. This will be a \u201cregressive step\u201d from the world\u2019s largest historical emitter, said Gaston Browne, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda. The United States has an obligation, a moral obligation, perhaps more so than any other, to provide leadership and climate funding,\u201d he said. But Trump\u2019s re-election will not derail climate progress, said Heine. \u201cI think already policies are already in place to move this work forward,\u201d she said. The by the Marshall Islands in the lead up to the 2015 Paris Climate Accord negotiations, the \u201chigh ambition coalition\u201d aims to push the world to make swifter cuts on greenhouse gas emissions. Edi Rama, Prime Minister of Albania, has gone off-script - he said he left behind his \u201cwell-prepared speech\u201d after watching yesterday\u2019s leaders make their statements on silent screens above comfortable couches in an adjoining room at the Cop29 venue in Baku yesterday. \u201cPeople there eat, drink, meet and take photos together - while images of voiceless leaders play on and on and on in the background,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, this seems exactly like what happens in the real world every day. Life goes on, with its old habits, and our speeches - full of good words about fighting climate change - change nothing.\u201d He pointed to the UN Secretary-General\u2019s statement yesterday highlighting that carbon emissions increased between the last Cop and this one, a finding that my colleague Damian Carrington has broken down here. \u201cWhat does it mean for the future of the world if the biggest polluters continue as usual?\u201d asked Rama. \u201cWhat on earth are we doing in this gathering, over and over and over, if there is no common political will on the horizon to go beyond words and unite for meaningful action?\u201d Muhammad Yunus, chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh, has hit out at \u201climitless consumption\u201d and called out for a new culture without waste, fossil fuels or personal profit. \u201cOur civilisation is at a great risk as we continue to promote self-destructive values,\u201d said Yunus, an economist and Nobel laureate. \u201cWe have chosen a lifestyle that works against the environment. We justify this with an economic framework that is considered as natural as the planetary system.\u201d Yunus became the caretaker head of Bangladesh\u2019s interim government in August, after the nation\u2019s longtime prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled abroad in the face of violent unrest against her rule. Yunus called for a counter culture based on different values, but said the lifestyle would be chosen by young people, rather than imposed on them. \u201cIt can be done,\u201d said Yunus. \u201cAll we need to do is accept a new lifestyle consistent with the safety of the planet and all who live on it.\u201d Justice was the theme in a strong speech from Gaston Browne, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, whose islands bear the brunt of the climate-supercharged hurricanes. \u201cFor nations like mine, [climate change] is no longer a warning, but a daily, devastating reality. We can\u2019t wait any longer for empty pledges.\u201d He says rich nations must deliver the trillion dollar finance deal that is the key issue at Cop29. \u201cTo those who bear the greatest responsibility, I say this: the time for moral responsibility is now - justice demands promises are enforced.\u201d He calls for grants, not loans, which could worsen debt levels. Browne also says his nation supports Vanuatu\u2019s initiative at the International Court of Justice calling for an opinion on the legal obligations all states have in relation to climate change. \u201cIf voluntary promises remain broken, international law will be our path to justice.\u201d Giorgia Meloni, Prime Minister of Italy, is now speaking at the leaders\u2019 event, reports my colleague Damian Carrington, having \u201carrived late and a little out of breath.\u201d Meloni points out that the world population will be 8.5bn by 2030 and global GDP much higher, all bringing more demand for energy. As well as renewables, she says \u201cgas, biofuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage\u201d all have a role, though scientists are clear all fossil fuels must be phased out. She also cites nuclear fusion as a potential \u201cgamechanger\u201d, though the joke that fusion is always 40 years away is not showing much sign of getting old. Large scale power from nuclear fusion is very unlikely to arrive in time to stop the global heating aleady wrecking communities around the world. After a largely technical speech, Meloni finishes on a personal note: \u201cI\u2019m a mother, and as a mother, nothing gives me more satisfaction that when I work for policies that will enable my daughter and her generation to live in a better world.\u201d My colleague Damian Carrington has more from today\u2019s leaders\u2019 summit at Cop29 \u2013 and news that one of the few G7 world leaders to attend has missed their speaking slot. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has missed her slot at the leaders summit part of Cop29. Meloni and the UK\u2019s Keir Starmer are the only G7 leaders to attend. Meanwhile, the Crown Prince of Kuwait, Sabah Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah, pledges to cut his nation\u2019s carbon emissions by 80% by 2040, which sounds very impressive but is very unlikely to include the state\u2019s substantial oil and gas production. Cardinal Pietro Parolin, representing the Vatican, focuses on the trillion dollar finance for developing countries that is the key issue in Baku. He says these countries must not be put into further debt with loans for climate action: \u201cEcological debt and environmental debt are two sides of the same coin.\u201d Petr Fiala, Prime Minister of Czechia basically makes a sales pitch for his nation\u2019s nuclear power industry. \u201cI strongly believe nuclear power is needed to meet sustainability goals.\u201d He says Czechia has 50 years of experience and is \u201cready to assist any countries which wishes to use it in the future\u201d. Nuclear power is \u201cclean and very safe\u201d, he says. Critics say it is far more expensive than renewable energy and much slower to build. The first national leader to speak at Cop29 on Wednesday was Shina Ansari Hamedani, Vice President of Iran, and her speech was a heady mix of climate policy and geopolitics. Her key point was that the \u201cillegal and unilateral\u201d international sanctions against Iran prevent it accessing the finance to build a green economy. In this she included nuclear power, the development of which is a key reason for the sanctions. She also called the sanctions \u201cunjustified and irrational\u201d, before also condemning the war in Gaza calling Israel the \u201coccupying Zionist regime\u201d. Her final point struck a milder note as she appealed for global action: \u201cOur shared environment is a common bond.\u201d Iran is both heavily dependent on oil for revenue and very vulnerable to climate impacts, including droughts and deadly humid heatwaves. As we are waiting for things to get going in Baku today this is a useful refresher on all things Cop from my colleague Fiona Harvey It\u2019s day three of Cop29 here in Baku and more global leaders will take to the stage, including Italy\u2019s Giorgia Meloni and Pakistan\u2019s Shehbaz Sharif. The aim is to spur negotiators towards a strong deal by setting out the stark impacts of the climate crisis and the \u201cterrible truth\u201d brought by Spain\u2019s Pedro S\u00e1nchez and by Mohamed Muizzu from the Maldives did just that. The president of host nation Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev took a different tack and said his nation\u2019s oil and gas was a \u201cgift from God\u201d. But all countries are today facing a disastrous report card on climate action in the publication of this year\u2019s Global Carbon Budget report. This finds that emissions from fossil fuels, the overwhelming cause of global heating, will rise in 2024 to another record high. That is a stark contrast to the agreement at the last summit, Cop28, to \u201ctransition away from fossil fuels\u201d, which was hailed as a landmark for the simple but astonishing reason that no previous summit agreement had mentioned fossil fuels. It is also a stark contrast to the reality that emissions must plunge by 43% by 2030 to have any chance of keeping global temperature rise below 1.5C and limiting the climate carnage. \u201cThe impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly dramatic, yet we still see no sign that burning of fossil fuels has peaked,\u201d says Prof Pierre Friedlingstein, at the University of Exeter, who led the report. So the negotiators have their work cut out to ensure that the next round of national climate commitments, due by February, deliver a step change. Tuesday did see a positive moment when the UK announced a strong commitment, pledging to cut emissions by 81% by 2035, a move that was widely welcomed in Baku. Wednesday will also see events backed by the Cop29 presidency on advancing the effort to triple nuclear energy and address the challenges for small island developing states, who face literal extinction from the rising seas.",

Research by Four Paws, which is campaigning to shut down South Africa\u2019s big cat industry, found 103 places in the country where tigers were kept in captivity in 2023 or 2024 or had been kept during the previous three years. Several facilities were breeding tigers to sell their body parts to China or Vietnam for use in traditional medicine, the report said, identifying three networks it said were known or suspected to be involved. Members of one network of \u201cinterlinked criminal syndicates\u201d posted photos on social media advertising \u201ctiger products\u201d, which the report said were suspected to be tiger bone glue. In another photo that the report included in anonymised form, network members claimed they were cooking tigers somewhere in South Africa. Tigers are classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which estimated in 2021 that about 5,574 were left in the wild, scattered across 13 Asian countries. That was a 40% increase in the population since 2021 but it still represents a huge drop from 100,000 about a century ago. The commercial trade in live tigers and their body parts has been banned globally since 1975, under the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (Cites). However, it \u201cremains one of the greatest threats to wild tiger populations\u201d, according to the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF). There were 626 tigers in captivity in South Africa, according to a government report in February 2024. But the study did not get data from two South African provinces: KwaZulu-Natal, the country\u2019s second most populous province, and Mpumalanga. Lion bones were also being exported illegally from South Africa to be sold in Asia as tiger bones, the Four Paws report said. South Africa allows commercial breeding of lions, including for trophy hunting, and they can be sold abroad alive or as carcasses. However, exporting lion bones has been banned since 2019. The environment minister, Dion George, said he had \u201ctaken a clear and decisive stance against captive lion breeding\u201d, in a speech in October marking 100 days in office.

Charles was told in a letter by the exiles: \u201cIt is personally difficult for us to view this honour as anything other than a betrayal of victims who have suffered at the hands of King Hamad and his brutal regime.\u201d Buckingham Palace had been accused of \u201cburying\u201d the news that Charles had bestowed the Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) on King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa. It was the Gulf state\u2019s official news agency that announced on Tuesday that Charles had made the award, which was covered on the front pages of Bahrain\u2019s newspapers. However, Bahraini exiles in the UK and supporters have questioned why no mention was made of the award in Buckingham Palace\u2019s own announcement that Charles had hosted Bahrain\u2019s king at Windsor Castle. The awarding of the honour was announced by Buckingham Palace in a press release issued on Wednesday evening. The Bahraini government has in effect silenced political opposition, banned independent media and subjected internal opponents to brutal treatment including torture and denial of medical care, according to Human Rights Watch. One of the signatories to the letter to Charles was Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, who was granted refugee status in the UK in 2012 and described himself in it as a \u201cvictim of King Hamad\u2019s regime\u201d and a survivor of torture. \u201cWe sincerely hope that the extent and gravity of our suffering is conveyed through this letter and provides sufficient reason for Your Majesty to urgently reconsider the decision and rescind the award to Bahrain\u2019s king,\u201d Charles was told in the letter. Bahraini newspapers have covered the award prominently on their front pages, including with pictures of Charles and King Hamad. Alastair Long, the British ambassador to Bahrain, said in a post on Instagram that Charles held a dinner in honour of King Hamad\u2019s silver jubilee and \u201cappreciated that King Hamad\u2019s rule has been guided by concern and care for his people\u201d. However, Brian Dooley, a senior adviser to the activist group Human Rights First, said: \u201cIt\u2019s startling to see King Hamad being rewarded with social honours when his unelected government has been guilty of so many crimes, including the torture of human rights activists, for so many years. \u201cHe is not a figurehead, he is in charge of \u2013 and responsible for \u2013 his government\u2019s actions. Why any self-respecting country would want to associate with him is baffling.\u201d The UK has deep trade and defence ties to Bahrain, which gained independence from Britain in 1971 and has served as a base for British naval operations.",

      "bodyText": "Samantha Harvey very nearly gave up on her novel Orbital, which last night won this year\u2019s Booker prize. Set on the International Space Station (ISS) 250 miles from Earth, Orbital follows the day-to-day lives of four astronauts and two cosmonauts as they hurtle through the universe at 17,500mph. She was a few thousand words in and suddenly lost her nerve. She felt she was trespassing in space. \u201cI am so spectacularly not an astronaut,\u201d she laughs, when we meet for coffee the morning after the Booker ceremony. \u201cI\u2019m so unadventurous, so unaudacious, so impractical, cowardly, anxious. I would be terrible.\u201d After a few months of dabbling with other ideas, she opened the abandoned word document on her computer by mistake. When she read it she found it had an integrity and pulse that drew her more than any of the other projects she was working on. \u201cI thought, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be afraid of this. If I can do it in a way that\u2019s different to the way astronauts write about their time in space, then maybe there\u2019s something here.\u201d So she climbed back in and achieved lift-off. Described as both \u201cthis generation\u2019s Virginia Woolf\u201d and \u201ca kind of Melville of the skies\u201d, Harvey was the only British author on this year\u2019s Booker shortlist. Orbital, her fifth novel, is a beautiful, powerful and utterly original work of fiction. It takes place over one day, but time is different in space, where \u201cthe whipcrack of morning arrives every ninety minutes\u201d and the sun is \u201cup-down-up-down like a mechanical toy\u201d. Each of the 16 chapters records a single orbit of Earth. Mundane tasks \u2013 vacuuming the capsule, monitoring mice and microbes \u2013 are set against the munificence of the universe. One of the toilets is always blocked. A super-typhoon is gathering over the Philippines. Each of the six characters are given only slivers of backstory: Chie\u2019s mother has died; Anton has fallen out of love with his wife; Shaun longs for his. While it might be set in space, its subject is Earth. It is a 136-page love letter to our troubled planet \u2013 she calls it \u201cspace pastoral\u201d, a kind of nature writing of the universe. \u201cI wanted to write a celebration of the Earth\u2019s beauty, but with a sense of sorrow or a pang of loss because of what we\u2019re doing to it,\u201d she says. Softly spoken, with a cloud of fair hair and delicate features, Harvey has an ethereal, otherworldly quality. She doesn\u2019t have a mobile phone, dumb or otherwise, let alone a social media account. She lives in a 16th-century house in a village on the Wiltshire-Somerset borders. \u201cI could always retreat more,\u201d she jokes. For years, she has been taking life-sculpture classes and there is a lifesize statue of her partner (who is 6ft 2in), which she has tried to hide behind bushes in the back garden.

She is as serious, sincere and slightly strange \u2013 in a good way \u2013 as her fiction, with such a gentle and unassuming manner as to never seem preachy. Although Harvey isn\u2019t religious herself, she does return to faith in her fiction (only glancingly in Orbital). \u201cNow that we live in such a secular society,\u201d she says, \u201cwhere do we get our big philosophical ideas from? Where do we find meaning?\u201d From a retired architect\u2019s descent into Alzheimer\u2019s in her acclaimed 2009 first novel The Wilderness, to \u201cthe medieval murder mystery\u201d of The Western Wind in 2018, Harvey has explored philosophical questions of being, time, faith and memory in her fiction, which also includes All Is Song (2012) and Dear Thief (2014).

I think that\u2019s one of the issues MPs are wrestling with as they decide how to cast their vote.\u201d</p> <p>He said MPs weighing up their stance on the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill should not necessarily vote against it because of that potential competition for resources within the NHS, and should consider all the arguments about assisted dying.</p> <p>But, referencing the tightness of public finances, he again stressed the potential dilemmas facing the NHS if legalisation happened, saying: \u201cWe do need to be in the business of making choices.\u201d</p> <p>Interviewed on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme earlier, Streeting said the NHS could ramp up the palliative care system in order for it to take on the responsibilities assisted dying would entail. He has previously stated that palliative care was not \u201cwhere it needs to be to give people a real choice\u201d.</p> <p>Streeting plans to vote against the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater\u2019s bill when it comes before parliament on 29 November, in what will be the first House of Commons vote on the issue since 2015.</p> <p>Downing Street would not be drawn into saying whether the health secretary was right to raise the spectre of assisted dying law coming at the expense of other NHS services.</p> <p>Asked about Streeting\u2019s remarks, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cUltimately, this is a matter for parliament to decide and that is why it is going to be a free vote, and parliament will debate the principles and merits of assisted dying and the issues surrounding the bill.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "Civil servants are looking at the extra costs that assisted dying would impose on the NHS amid a warning from Wes Streeting that some services may be cut to fund expanded end-of-life care. The health secretary has asked officials at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to analyse potential implications for NHS services if the right to die is legalised in England and Wales. Their work is under way amid an increasing focus on how the NHS would cope with helping what the MP spearheading the push for assisted dying believes would be hundreds of people a year who have just six months or less to live to end their life early. DHSC officials have already begun examining the costs of the practicalities involved, which could include expanding the services provided by hospitals or district nurses, for example. The disclosure comes after Streeting made clear his view that legalisation could force the health service to make difficult decisions about funding some existing services. \u201cThere would be resource implications for doing it. And those choices would come at the expense of other choices,\u201d he told Times Radio on Wednesday. Asked if he would have to find the money to fund an extension of palliative care from elsewhere in the NHS budget, Streeting replied: \u201cYep. To govern is to choose.

Any new service comes at the expense of other competing pressures and priorities.\u201d Streeting \u2013 who plans to vote against assisted dying \u2013 voiced his fear that it could lead to some people with a terminal diagnosis choosing to end their lives early as a way of saving the NHS money. \u201cYou do touch on the slippery slope argument, which is the potential for cost savings if people choose to opt for assisted dying rather than stay in the care of the care providers or the NHS,\u201d he said in answer to a question. \u201cI think that is a chilling slippery slope argument, and I would hate for people to opt for assisted dying because they think they\u2019re saving someone somewhere money, whether that\u2019s relatives or the NHS. I think that\u2019s one of the issues MPs are wrestling with as they decide how to cast their vote.\u201d He said MPs weighing up their stance on the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill should not necessarily vote against it because of that potential competition for resources within the NHS, and should consider all the arguments about assisted dying. But, referencing the tightness of public finances, he again stressed the potential dilemmas facing the NHS if legalisation happened, saying: \u201cWe do need to be in the business of making choices.\u201d Interviewed on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme earlier, Streeting said the NHS could ramp up the palliative care system in order for it to take on the responsibilities assisted dying would entail. He has previously stated that palliative care was not \u201cwhere it needs to be to give people a real choice\u201d. Streeting plans to vote against the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater\u2019s bill when it comes before parliament on 29 November, in what will be the first House of Commons vote on the issue since 2015. Downing Street would not be drawn into saying whether the health secretary was right to raise the spectre of assisted dying law coming at the expense of other NHS services. Asked about Streeting\u2019s remarks, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cUltimately, this is a matter for parliament to decide and that is why it is going to be a free vote, and parliament will debate the principles and merits of assisted dying and the issues surrounding the bill.\u201d",

The Skripals survived but Sturgess died after spraying novichok, contained in a fake perfume bottle, over herself in nearby Amesbury.</p> <p>MK26 was the lead Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) adviser to the police, based at Porton Down in Wiltshire, during both investigations.</p> <p>The scientist said \u201cmany hundreds\u201d of DSTL staff were involved. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this level of activity any time before or since. I hope I never do again,\u201d the witness said.</p> <p>\u201cIt felt very personal. It was very close to Porton Down. Many of our staff were living around Salisbury and Amesbury. When Dawn Sturgess sadly passed away, it highlighted for us how dreadful it had been.\u201d</p> <p>MK26 said \u201cmany lethal doses\u201d were applied to the door handle of Skripal\u2019s home. The witness said the agent was \u201cvery persistent\u201d. It was 12 days before the handle was tested and it had rained and snowed, but there were still \u201cvery high\u201d levels of the substance on it. There were also high levels on the door below the handle and at the base of the door.</p> <p>The witness said the perfume bottle contained \u201cthousands of lethal doses\u201d and an amount as small as a sixth of a grain of salt could kill.</p> <p>MK26 said the novichok was \u201ca very high level of purity\u201d, adding: \u201cIt indicates whoever made it was very sophisticated. It was an almost pure compound with very small amounts of contaminating chemicals.\u201d</p> <p>The witness was asked about <a href=\"https://london.mid.ru/upload/iblock/e37/a4r5bcl91a2uk14kilvfekq3fs6zkspm.pdf\">claims from the Russian embassy</a> that any modern chemical laboratory was capable of making novichok.</p> <p>MK26 accepted a modern lab would be capable of synthesising it \u2013 but not safely. The scientist said they did not believe that a \u201cnon-state actor\u201d \u2013 such as a terrorist group \u2013 would be able to make such pure novichok and deliver it. But the witness said they would be able to go into more detail when closed sessions were held next year.</p> <p>MK26 was asked about claims made in a book by the journalist Mark Urban that in the 1990s the UK obtained chemical agents developed in the Soviet Union, and Porton Down got the chance to study and synthesise them.</p> <p>The scientist was asked if DSTL was capable of producing novichok, if it had done so and, if so, in what quantities \u2013 and also if it was possible that novichok produced at Porton Down could have been involved in the Wiltshire poisonings. MK26 said there was nothing they could say about this in the open part of the inquiry.</p> <p>MK26 also said they could not address in the open session whether novichok could be detected by British airport detection equipment.</p> <p>The scientist was also asked about extremely faint traces of novichok found in a toilet in a park, the Queen Elizabeth Gardens, in Salisbury. The park is close to where the two Russian agents suspected of carrying out the attack on Skripal disappeared from CCTV cameras during what has been described as a \u201cmissing half-hour\u201d.</p> <p>MK26 said one \u201cscenario\u201d was that the agents had been in the area after applying novichok to Skripal\u2019s door handle. But the witness said the trace was so low that it could also have been unknowingly carried in by a member of the public.</p> <p>MK26 said it was believed the \u201csame specific novichok agent\u201d poisoned the Skripals and Sturgess \u2013 from one batch, prepared at the same time using the same precursor chemicals. The witness said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d Sturgess was exposed to \u201cmany lethal doses\u201d.</p> <p>The scientist also said it was a \u201crealistic possibility\u201d that the fake perfume bottle containing the novichok that Sturgess sprayed on her skin had also been used to apply nerve agent to Skripal\u2019s door handle.

      "bodyText": "A \u201cminuscule\u201d amount of the nerve agent used in the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal \u2013 as small as a sixth of a grain of salt \u2013 could have been enough to prove fatal, a government scientist has told an inquiry. The scientist, an expert in chemical and biological weapons, said \u201cmany lethal doses\u201d of novichok were daubed on the handle of the former Russian spy\u2019s front door in Salisbury and it was so pure that it must have been manufactured by a sophisticated laboratory. Members of the public were not allowed into the hearing room for the evidence of the scientist, who can be identified only by the cipher MK26. An order is in place banning even the scientist\u2019s gender from being reported. Skripal, his daughter, Yulia, and a Wiltshire woman, Dawn Sturgess, were contaminated by novichok in 2018. The Skripals survived but Sturgess died after spraying novichok, contained in a fake perfume bottle, over herself in nearby Amesbury. MK26 was the lead Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) adviser to the police, based at Porton Down in Wiltshire, during both investigations. The scientist said \u201cmany hundreds\u201d of DSTL staff were involved. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this level of activity any time before or since. I hope I never do again,\u201d the witness said. \u201cIt felt very personal. It was very close to Porton Down. Many of our staff were living around Salisbury and Amesbury. When Dawn Sturgess sadly passed away, it highlighted for us how dreadful it had been.\u201d MK26 said \u201cmany lethal doses\u201d were applied to the door handle of Skripal\u2019s home. The witness said the agent was \u201cvery persistent\u201d. It was 12 days before the handle was tested and it had rained and snowed, but there were still \u201cvery high\u201d levels of the substance on it. There were also high levels on the door below the handle and at the base of the door. The witness said the perfume bottle contained \u201cthousands of lethal doses\u201d and an amount as small as a sixth of a grain of salt could kill. MK26 said the novichok was \u201ca very high level of purity\u201d, adding: \u201cIt indicates whoever made it was very sophisticated. It was an almost pure compound with very small amounts of contaminating chemicals.\u201d The witness was asked about claims from the Russian embassy that any modern chemical laboratory was capable of making novichok. MK26 accepted a modern lab would be capable of synthesising it \u2013 but not safely. The scientist said they did not believe that a \u201cnon-state actor\u201d \u2013 such as a terrorist group \u2013 would be able to make such pure novichok and deliver it. But the witness said they would be able to go into more detail when closed sessions were held next year. MK26 was asked about claims made in a book by the journalist Mark Urban that in the 1990s the UK obtained chemical agents developed in the Soviet Union, and Porton Down got the chance to study and synthesise them. The scientist was asked if DSTL was capable of producing novichok, if it had done so and, if so, in what quantities \u2013 and also if it was possible that novichok produced at Porton Down could have been involved in the Wiltshire poisonings. MK26 said there was nothing they could say about this in the open part of the inquiry. MK26 also said they could not address in the open session whether novichok could be detected by British airport detection equipment. The scientist was also asked about extremely faint traces of novichok found in a toilet in a park, the Queen Elizabeth Gardens, in Salisbury. The park is close to where the two Russian agents suspected of carrying out the attack on Skripal disappeared from CCTV cameras during what has been described as a \u201cmissing half-hour\u201d. MK26 said one \u201cscenario\u201d was that the agents had been in the area after applying novichok to Skripal\u2019s door handle. But the witness said the trace was so low that it could also have been unknowingly carried in by a member of the public. MK26 said it was believed the \u201csame specific novichok agent\u201d poisoned the Skripals and Sturgess \u2013 from one batch, prepared at the same time using the same precursor chemicals. The witness said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d Sturgess was exposed to \u201cmany lethal doses\u201d. The scientist also said it was a \u201crealistic possibility\u201d that the fake perfume bottle containing the novichok that Sturgess sprayed on her skin had also been used to apply nerve agent to Skripal\u2019s door handle. But MK26 could not exclude the possibility that there was a second container, which had not been found. MK26 was asked about claims by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, that the Skripals would have died \u201con the spot\u201d if they had been targeted by a military-grade nerve agent. The witness said they had expected the Skripals to die. \u201cThe recovery of the Skripals was beyond what any of us had expected. We \u2026 believed they would die.\u201d The inquiry continues.",

Instead, it took until the following afternoon for confirmation that their match against Rayo Vallecano and Real Madrid\u2019s visit to Mestalla would not be played while the rest of the week\u2019s first division\u2019s fixtures went ahead, a decision that was universally criticised and that the former Leicester striker considers inconceivable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/04/spain-valencia-floods-la-liga\">With Spain still mourning Valencia\u2019s flood victims, why did La Liga play on? | Sid Lowe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>P\u00e9rez believes that while players might have lacked the collective voice or power to refuse to play, they should not even have needed one. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have reached the point that coaches and players had to come out and give their opinion, because ultimately it\u2019s so clear,\u201d the Villarreal forward said. \u201cWhen the circumstances are so, so hard, we should not have to reach a conclusion that\u2019s obvious. We\u2019re talking about a catastrophe. The decision should have been taken in minutes; what we all thought [that we should not play] was the most normal thing in the world. We had to be at Valencia\u2019s side. Football comes second, or third. What mattered was all those people affected.\u201d</p> \n<p>The following weekend, Villarreal returned to action against Alav\u00e9s, which also felt wrong: playing all in black, a silence and an emptiness was obvious. \u201cThe minute\u2019s silence was very emotional,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. \u201cVillarreal is so close to Valencia that we were so conscious that it was not the best conditions in which to play a game.

Villarreal players have been among those helping out in the areas worst hit.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were coming back from Mallorca when it happened. We stayed the night there because of the bad weather and flew the next morning. And that image, what I saw \u2026\u201d P\u00e9rez recalled, pausing. \u201cThat had such an impact on me, it\u2019s still there. We were coming down to land, and you looked out of the windows of the plane and it was like a film, a catastrophe of such a magnitude that the picture remains in your mind. You start to understand even more clearly the extent of it, how bad the situation is.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese have been very, very hard days. When you live so close to it, it\u2019s another reality. Everyone is conscious of it, we have all seen videos that make your heart ache but living it so close, you feel it. I live in Valencia. Thank God, I didn\u2019t lose [people] but it\u2019s inevitable that you see terrible situations; there has been a lot of damage, a lot of people affected.

      "bodyText": "On the morning after the worst flood in Spain\u2019s history killed 223 people and devastated the Valencia region, Villarreal flew back into the city from a Copa del Rey tie in Mallorca, the scale of the devastation laid out below them so great that Ayoze P\u00e9rez insists all football should have been postponed immediately. Instead, it took until the following afternoon for confirmation that their match against Rayo Vallecano and Real Madrid\u2019s visit to Mestalla would not be played while the rest of the week\u2019s first division\u2019s fixtures went ahead, a decision that was universally criticised and that the former Leicester striker considers inconceivable. P\u00e9rez believes that while players might have lacked the collective voice or power to refuse to play, they should not even have needed one. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have reached the point that coaches and players had to come out and give their opinion, because ultimately it\u2019s so clear,\u201d the Villarreal forward said. \u201cWhen the circumstances are so, so hard, we should not have to reach a conclusion that\u2019s obvious. We\u2019re talking about a catastrophe. The decision should have been taken in minutes; what we all thought [that we should not play] was the most normal thing in the world. We had to be at Valencia\u2019s side. Football comes second, or third. What mattered was all those people affected.\u201d The following weekend, Villarreal returned to action against Alav\u00e9s, which also felt wrong: playing all in black, a silence and an emptiness was obvious. \u201cThe minute\u2019s silence was very emotional,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. \u201cVillarreal is so close to Valencia that we were so conscious that it was not the best conditions in which to play a game. The decision was not in our hands; we had to play, and so we did. But we all agreed that we shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d The rest of the first and second division teams in the Valencia region also played with only the city\u2019s two clubs, Valencia and Levante, yet to return. Spain\u2019s next two fixtures, against Denmark in Copenhagen and Switzerland in Tenerife, for which P\u00e9rez has been called up, will be used to raise funds. Villarreal players have been among those helping out in the areas worst hit. \u201cWe were coming back from Mallorca when it happened. We stayed the night there because of the bad weather and flew the next morning. And that image, what I saw \u2026\u201d P\u00e9rez recalled, pausing. \u201cThat had such an impact on me, it\u2019s still there. We were coming down to land, and you looked out of the windows of the plane and it was like a film, a catastrophe of such a magnitude that the picture remains in your mind. You start to understand even more clearly the extent of it, how bad the situation is. \u201cThese have been very, very hard days. When you live so close to it, it\u2019s another reality. Everyone is conscious of it, we have all seen videos that make your heart ache but living it so close, you feel it. I live in Valencia. Thank God, I didn\u2019t lose [people] but it\u2019s inevitable that you see terrible situations; there has been a lot of damage, a lot of people affected. What we have to do now is use the voice we have, these games coming up, to help in any way we can. Our focus is Valencia.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe\u2019re all people, we\u2019re conscious of the reality. It\u2019s a catastrophe, something very hard to live through and to still be living through many days later. You have to help, be united. Everything else is secondary now; Valencia has to be our focus, we have to be continuously helping, finding ways to support them, to help them get back to \u2018normality\u2019 as soon as possible.\u201d \u201cThat week we trained with the uncertainty about whether you are going to play or not,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. \u201cOur game was postponed. Others were played although we all agreed [that they shouldn\u2019t have] and you could feel that there was something missing. People were not fully engaged, their heads were not in it; they were where they had to be. But the person whose decision it was to play \u2013 or not \u2013 decided to play. And in the end, it was played, mistakenly.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Although Timothy West, who has died aged 90, never played the greatest stage roles at the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, he took on many of them \u2013 Falstaff (twice), King Lear (four times), Uncle Vanya, Willy Loman, Ibsen\u2019s Solness \u2013 in regional reps and on tour, in a career that spanned seven<strong> </strong>decades and established him as one of the most recognisable, popular and substantial actors of his day.</p> <p>On television he was a notable interpreter of leading political and institutional figures, portraying Horatio Bottomley, Edward VII, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/30/mikhail-gorbachev-obituary\">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, Winston Churchill and Thomas Beecham, and he completed a double in soap history in 2013 by appearing in Coronation Street and EastEnders within one year: as Eric Babbage, a short-lived fiance to Sue Johnston\u2019s Gloria in the first, and as Stan Carter, a former Billingsgate fishmonger drawn into Albert Square life by his publican son in the second.</p> <p>This range and versatility carried right through to his involvement with theatres and companies beyond the stage itself, as director, manager and board member. With his second wife, the actor Prunella Scales, whom he married in 1963, and their first son, the actor and director Samuel West, he formed a dynastic bulwark that was not grand or high-flown, but practical and participatory. He believed in the cause of regional theatre, serving on the Arts Council drama panel, and on the board of Bristol Old Vic, spent 17 years as a director and trustee of the National Student Drama festival and, from 2003 until 2018, was president of the London drama school Lamda.</p>    <p>West was a popular and convivial figure in his profession, and a stalwart of several important initiatives in the theatre of the last century: the touring Prospect Theatre Company that catapulted Ian McKellen to stardom in 1969 (he was Bolingbroke to McKellen\u2019s Richard II, Mortimer to his Edward II); <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/09/charles-marowitz\">Charles Marowitz</a>\u2019s Open Space (in 1974, he played a man who eats himself to death in BS Johnson\u2019s Down Red Lane); a tricky interim period at the Old Vic; and a fine Theatre Night series of plays on BBC TV, which included Joe Orton\u2019s What the Butler Saw, John Galsworthy\u2019s Strife and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/27/david-storey-obituary\">David Storey</a>\u2019s The Contractor.</p> <p>Always solid, four-square, with a crooked grimace and a light, sarcastic touch where appropriate, West was ideal as the marquee boss in Storey\u2019s play, as he was in the 1980s TV comedy series Brass, a send-up of all things northern, from DH Lawrence to Love on the Dole, as a ghastly old mill owner, or in JB Priestley\u2019s When We Are Married, as the textile magnate and town councillor Albert Parker, in a superb 1986 West End revival directed by Ronald Eyre.</p> <p>West was indeed a plausible gruff Yorkshireman. He was born in Bradford, while his father, the actor Lockwood West, was on tour there. But his parents \u2013 his mother was the actor Olive Carleton-Crowe \u2013 who had met, also on tour, in The Ghost Train in 1927, settled in Bristol. The family moved to South Ruislip in London after the second world war (but not before Timothy was expelled from Bristol grammar prep school), and he attended the John Lyon school in Harrow and took his A-levels at Regent Street Polytechnic (now part of the University of Westminster).</p>    <p>This led to work as a recording engineer and furniture salesman, a stint in the box office at Frinton rep, and a growing enthusiasm for amateur dramatics. His association with the student drama festival began with his production of Thornton Wilder\u2019s Our Town. </p> <p>Encouraged by the critic Harold Hobson, he made his professional stage debut at Wimbledon theatre in 1956 as a farmer in Summertime; he also married an art student he had met at the polytechnic, Jacqueline Boyer (the marriage ended in divorce in 1961). After seasons in rep at Salisbury and Hull, he made his West End bow in a farce, Caught Napping, at the Piccadilly theatre in 1959.</p> <p>In the 1960s, he was in and out of the RSC, a member of the BBC radio drama rep and appeared in <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary--robert-bolt-1574410.html\">Robert Bolt</a>\u2019s Gentle Jack (1963) as part of a cast led by Edith Evans and Kenneth Williams. With the RSC at the Arts theatre he was in Nil Carborundum by Henry Livings and Afore Night Come by David Rudkin and at the Aldwych in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/03/peter-brook-obituary\">Peter Brook</a>\u2019s Marat/Sade production in 1964. In his one Stratford-upon-Avon season, in 1965, he played minor roles in Love\u2019s Labour\u2019s Lost, The Merchant of Venice and Timon of Athens (with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/20/2\">Paul Scofield</a>, directed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jul/26/guardianobituaries.filmnews\">John Schlesinger</a>).</p> <p>Prospect<strong> </strong>gave him the chance to expand into bigger roles \u2013 Prospero in The Tempest, Claudius to Derek Jacobi\u2019s Hamlet, a King Lear at the Edinburgh festival, Harry in Charles Dyer\u2019s Staircase \u2013 and he returned to the RSC to play a reptilian, notably nasty Judge Brack in Trevor Nunn\u2019s 1975 world tour of Hedda Gabler, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/15/glenda-jackson-obituary\">Glenda Jackson</a>, Patrick Stewart and Peter Eyre.</p> <p>At the same time, his TV career took off in earnest with 13 episodes of Edward the King (1975) for ATV, followed by the first of his three Sir Winstons in Churchill and the Generals (1979) and thereafter a vast array of roles, including, recently, the Dad\u2019s Army remakes, The Lost Episodes (2019), in which he was Private Godfrey, and Gentleman Jack (2019-22), as Jeremy, father of Anne Lister (Suranne Jones). In films, he was the royal physician Dr Botkin in Franklin J Schaffner\u2019s Nicholas and Alexandra (1971) and the police commissioner in <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-fred-zinnemann-1273470.html\">Fred Zinnemann</a>\u2019s The Day of the Jackal (1973) with Edward Fox.</p> <p>A yen for practical involvement beyond acting resulted in one season as artistic director of the Forum theatre, Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees, in 1973; a post of co-director with Prospect in 1975, continuing as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/08/toby-robertson\">Toby Robertson</a>\u2019s company moved into the Old Vic (when the National Theatre migrated to the South Bank) in 1977; and then a short, highly controversial period as artistic director at the Old Vic in 1980-81 when the Arts Council only offered support to \u201cProspect at the Old Vic\u201d if Robertson was removed (which he was, summarily), and West disowned a packed-out but critically derided production of Macbeth starring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/15/peter-o-toole-dies-81\">Peter O\u2019Toole</a>.</p>    <p>West consoled himself by playing Beecham in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/oct/03/guardianobituaries.media\">Ned Sherrin</a> and Caryl Brahms\u2019s rewarding solo play at the Apollo.

      "bodyText": "Although Timothy West, who has died aged 90, never played the greatest stage roles at the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, he took on many of them \u2013 Falstaff (twice), King Lear (four times), Uncle Vanya, Willy Loman, Ibsen\u2019s Solness \u2013 in regional reps and on tour, in a career that spanned seven decades and established him as one of the most recognisable, popular and substantial actors of his day. On television he was a notable interpreter of leading political and institutional figures, portraying Horatio Bottomley, Edward VII, Mikhail Gorbachev, Winston Churchill and Thomas Beecham, and he completed a double in soap history in 2013 by appearing in Coronation Street and EastEnders within one year: as Eric Babbage, a short-lived fiance to Sue Johnston\u2019s Gloria in the first, and as Stan Carter, a former Billingsgate fishmonger drawn into Albert Square life by his publican son in the second. This range and versatility carried right through to his involvement with theatres and companies beyond the stage itself, as director, manager and board member. With his second wife, the actor Prunella Scales, whom he married in 1963, and their first son, the actor and director Samuel West, he formed a dynastic bulwark that was not grand or high-flown, but practical and participatory. He believed in the cause of regional theatre, serving on the Arts Council drama panel, and on the board of Bristol Old Vic, spent 17 years as a director and trustee of the National Student Drama festival and, from 2003 until 2018, was president of the London drama school Lamda. West was a popular and convivial figure in his profession, and a stalwart of several important initiatives in the theatre of the last century: the touring Prospect Theatre Company that catapulted Ian McKellen to stardom in 1969 (he was Bolingbroke to McKellen\u2019s Richard II, Mortimer to his Edward II); Charles Marowitz\u2019s Open Space (in 1974, he played a man who eats himself to death in BS Johnson\u2019s Down Red Lane); a tricky interim period at the Old Vic; and a fine Theatre Night series of plays on BBC TV, which included Joe Orton\u2019s What the Butler Saw, John Galsworthy\u2019s Strife and David Storey\u2019s The Contractor. Always solid, four-square, with a crooked grimace and a light, sarcastic touch where appropriate, West was ideal as the marquee boss in Storey\u2019s play, as he was in the 1980s TV comedy series Brass, a send-up of all things northern, from DH Lawrence to Love on the Dole, as a ghastly old mill owner, or in JB Priestley\u2019s When We Are Married, as the textile magnate and town councillor Albert Parker, in a superb 1986 West End revival directed by Ronald Eyre. West was indeed a plausible gruff Yorkshireman. He was born in Bradford, while his father, the actor Lockwood West, was on tour there. But his parents \u2013 his mother was the actor Olive Carleton-Crowe \u2013 who had met, also on tour, in The Ghost Train in 1927, settled in Bristol. The family moved to South Ruislip in London after the second world war (but not before Timothy was expelled from Bristol grammar prep school), and he attended the John Lyon school in Harrow and took his A-levels at Regent Street Polytechnic (now part of the University of Westminster). This led to work as a recording engineer and furniture salesman, a stint in the box office at Frinton rep, and a growing enthusiasm for amateur dramatics. His association with the student drama festival began with his production of Thornton Wilder\u2019s Our Town. Encouraged by the critic Harold Hobson, he made his professional stage debut at Wimbledon theatre in 1956 as a farmer in Summertime; he also married an art student he had met at the polytechnic, Jacqueline Boyer (the marriage ended in divorce in 1961). After seasons in rep at Salisbury and Hull, he made his West End bow in a farce, Caught Napping, at the Piccadilly theatre in 1959. In the 1960s, he was in and out of the RSC, a member of the BBC radio drama rep and appeared in Robert Bolt\u2019s Gentle Jack (1963) as part of a cast led by Edith Evans and Kenneth Williams. With the RSC at the Arts theatre he was in Nil Carborundum by Henry Livings and Afore Night Come by David Rudkin and at the Aldwych in Peter Brook\u2019s Marat/Sade production in 1964. In his one Stratford-upon-Avon season, in 1965, he played minor roles in Love\u2019s Labour\u2019s Lost, The Merchant of Venice and Timon of Athens (with Paul Scofield, directed by John Schlesinger). Prospect gave him the chance to expand into bigger roles \u2013 Prospero in The Tempest, Claudius to Derek Jacobi\u2019s Hamlet, a King Lear at the Edinburgh festival, Harry in Charles Dyer\u2019s Staircase \u2013 and he returned to the RSC to play a reptilian, notably nasty Judge Brack in Trevor Nunn\u2019s 1975 world tour of Hedda Gabler, with Glenda Jackson, Patrick Stewart and Peter Eyre. At the same time, his TV career took off in earnest with 13 episodes of Edward the King (1975) for ATV, followed by the first of his three Sir Winstons in Churchill and the Generals (1979) and thereafter a vast array of roles, including, recently, the Dad\u2019s Army remakes, The Lost Episodes (2019), in which he was Private Godfrey, and Gentleman Jack (2019-22), as Jeremy, father of Anne Lister (Suranne Jones). In films, he was the royal physician Dr Botkin in Franklin J Schaffner\u2019s Nicholas and Alexandra (1971) and the police commissioner in Fred Zinnemann\u2019s The Day of the Jackal (1973) with Edward Fox. A yen for practical involvement beyond acting resulted in one season as artistic director of the Forum theatre, Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees, in 1973; a post of co-director with Prospect in 1975, continuing as Toby Robertson\u2019s company moved into the Old Vic (when the National Theatre migrated to the South Bank) in 1977; and then a short, highly controversial period as artistic director at the Old Vic in 1980-81 when the Arts Council only offered support to \u201cProspect at the Old Vic\u201d if Robertson was removed (which he was, summarily), and West disowned a packed-out but critically derided production of Macbeth starring Peter O\u2019Toole. West consoled himself by playing Beecham in Ned Sherrin and Caryl Brahms\u2019s rewarding solo play at the Apollo. The Arts Council cut the Prospect grant completely in 1981, leaving him distraught and guilt-ridden. Ironically, he returned to the theatre soon after, when the Canadian impresario Ed Mirvish rode to the rescue. He played Stalin in David Pownall\u2019s fine play, Master Class, and, in 1984, Charlie Mucklebrass, a noisy Huddersfield thespian in Mel Smith\u2019s production of Bamber Gascoigne\u2019s Big in Brazil, a misfired Feydeau-esque farce stranded up the Amazon (without a paddle). Prunella Scales was also in Big in Brazil. Unlike such inseparable theatrical couples as Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne or Michael Denison and Dulcie Gray, they were not often in shows together, but they made an exception for When We Are Married and a 1991 Bristol Old Vic/National Theatre joint production of Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s Long Day\u2019s Journey into Night, directed by Howard Davies, which West acknowledged was not a total success. They were also in a fine revival of Harold Pinter\u2019s The Birthday Party (West as Goldberg, Scales as Meg, the genteel landlady) at the Piccadilly in 1999. He teamed up as Falstaff with Samuel as Prince Hal in an English Touring Theatre production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two in 1997, and the pair played a major revival of Caryl Churchill\u2019s brilliant riddle of fathers and cloned sons, A Number, first at the Sheffield Crucible in 2006 and again, four years later, at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London. Another Lear for English Touring Theatre at the Old Vic in 2003 was fresh and surprising but not a tornado, exactly, and he returned to the RSC as a striking Menenius in Coriolanus in 2007. His few other films included Michael Apted\u2019s Agatha (1979) with Vanessa Redgrave and Dustin Hoffman, Richard Attenborough\u2019s Cry Freedom (1987) with Kevin Kline, Denzel Washington and Penelope Wilton, and Richard Eyre\u2019s Iris (2001) with Judi Dench. In his memoir, A Moment Towards the End of the Play (2001), West gives a vivid picture of an actor\u2019s life on the road, during the last days of weekly rep, and he also published a collection of his letters to Pru, I\u2019m Here, I Think, Where Are You? (2004), written when away on tour; she had saved them all. He loved old railways and, especially, the inland waterways of Britain, and he and Pru made a TV programme, Great Canal Journeys, in 2014 in which they celebrated this enthusiasm and discussed Pru\u2019s \u201cslight condition of a sort of Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d. This gentle programme, in which they appeared until 2019, encapsulated 50 years of a working marriage. West was appointed CBE in 1984 and was a member, typically, of both the Garrick and the Groucho clubs. He is survived by Prunella and their sons, Samuel and Joseph, and by a daughter, Juliet, from his first marriage, as well as seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. \u2022 Timothy Lancaster West, actor and director, born 20 October 1934; died 12 November 2024",

      "bodyText": "The chair of the government\u2019s equality watchdog, who was appointed by Liz Truss and investigated after a series of complaints by staff members, has been given a 12-month extension in the role, ministers have announced. The decision to reappoint Kishwer Falkner as chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), first revealed by the Guardian, has left some staff members angry after they had hoped a Labour government might change the organisation\u2019s leadership. However, the announcement by the government\u2019s Office for Equality and Opportunity said it was looking for a new chair, with a successor expected to be announced next year. It is understood that the extension was given largely because of the lack of time to find a replacement before her four-year term finishes at the end of this year. News that Lady Falkner would stay on in the role had dismayed some staff at the EHRC following a sometimes turbulent period in which she grappled with internal debates over transgender policy and was investigated over a series of complaints from current and past staff. Falkner, 69, a cross-bench peer who was given the job in 2020, when Truss was the minister for equalities, has denied any wrongdoing, with allies saying she has been unfairly targeted by some staff owing to her approach to trans rights. However, others in the EHRC say the complaints against her, understood to have come from about 12 staff members or former staff, were also connected to worries about a lack of independence and impartiality within the organisation, as well as claims about bullying and harassment. In May last year, it emerged that the EHRC had appointed a senior lawyer to look into the allegations, with the process then paused after leaks to the media from both sides of the debate. The inquiry was then restarted, but dropped a year ago after the then equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, ordered a review of the process. The EHRC said it was closing the process, with the organisation seeking to \u201cwork through any outstanding issues with all parties in confidence\u201d. Some staff members say the organisation remains split, with allies of the chair portraying the complaints as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d against her by pro-transgender rights staff members after the EHRC backed changing the Equality Act 2010 so the protected characteristic of sex would mean biological sex, which would allow transgender women to be barred from single-sex spaces. Others in the organisation say that while some concerns and complaints were about transgender policy, the wider worries were about a lack of independence and impartiality by the EHRC, plus an internal culture they called \u201ctoxic\u201d. David Isaac, who chaired the EHRC before Falkner was appointed, has previously expressed concern at what he called political pressure on the organisation to support a changed approach to equalities issues under the Conservatives. Announcing the extended term, Bridget Phillipson, who is the equalities minister as well as being education secretary, said: \u201cThe government thanks Baroness Falkner for her work chairing the EHRC, during which the commission supported businesses, intervened in strategic cases of discrimination to support victims and contributed to government policy on improving equalities. I look forward to her continuing this work throughout the next 12 months.\u201d",

There are several types of TMD, all of which relate to jaw bones and muscles.</p> <p>Roughly 10% to 15% of adults have some form of temporomandibular disorder, estimates Dr Thomas P Sollecito, professor and chair of oral medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine. \u201cThe vast majority don\u2019t require treatment,\u201d he says.

We asked experts.</p> <h2>What are temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)?</h2> <p>TMDs are \u201cdisorders or symptoms related to the structure and function of the jaw system\u201d, explains Dr Karyn A Kahn, a dentist at the Cleveland Clinic.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/health-info/tmd#:~:text=Temporomandibular%20disorders%20(TMDs)%20are%20a,each%20side%20of%20the%20jaw.\">National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</a>, TMDs fall into three main categories: disorders of the temporomandibular joint, disorders of the muscles used for chewing, and headaches associated with jaw strain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\" data-alt=\"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, \u2018Well Actually\u2019, then \u2018Read more on living a good life in a complex world,\u2019 then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say \u2018More from this section\u2019\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Because TMD encompasses a range of disorders, symptoms can vary. \u201cThere are a lot of different signs and symptoms that may suggest a patient is experiencing a temporomandibular disorder,\u201d Kahn says. These include a clicking or popping sound in the jaw, facial pain, tooth fractures from grinding, limited jaw movement, and even seemingly unrelated issues such as headaches and ear pain.</p> <p>Women tend to experience TMDs more than men, though no one\u2019s exactly sure why. Some studies have found a connection between estrogen and temporomandibular pain, Kahn says. Sollecito says others have also suggested that women experience stress differently, and are more likely to grip their jaws. \u201cAnd some people think women just seek [medical] care more than men,\u201d he says, which means more recorded cases in women.</p> <h2>What causes TMDs?</h2> <p>TMDs have a variety of causes. They can result from physical trauma (being hit in the jaw, for example), genetics, anatomical factors such as how your jaw lines up, and lifestyle habits such as chewing gum or eating lots of chewy food such as bagels.</p> <p>Temporomandibular disorders have also been found to overlap with some chronic pain conditions such as migraine headaches, fibromyalgia, chronic back pain and chronic pelvic pain in women, says Dr Clark Stanford, professor of prosthodontics and dean of restorative dentistry at the University of Iowa.</p> <p>TMDs can also be the result of emotional distress. Stress can lead to jaw tension and teeth grinding, both of which strain the muscles of the jaw, causing pain. Stanford\u2019s diagnostic process involves an exhaustive clinical exam as well as a psychological assessment. One recent patient had been struggling with acute jaw pain for a couple of months. As they spoke, he learned she had recently lost a close friend, and as a result had been juggling work stress and personal grief.</p> <p>\u201cIt sounds weird for a dentist to be asking about what\u2019s going on in your life,\u201d Stanford says. \u201cBut a lot of times, once [patients] understand why they\u2019re gripping their teeth all the time, they understand the need for an intervention to reduce that habit.\u201d</p> <h2>How are TMDs treated?</h2> <p>Generally, experts advise starting small when it comes to TMD treatment. For those who grind their teeth at night, doctors often prescribe a night guard \u2013 a plastic, retainer-like device \u2013 to help protect their teeth.</p> <p>So-called self-help therapies are also useful tools. Stanford says these can include daily exercises to loosen the jaw, awareness of sleep habits and education about which foods may exacerbate pain. In some cases, cognitive behavioral therapy and other stress reduction techniques can also be helpful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/sep/23/cbt-i-sleep-therapy\">Trouble sleeping?

Now the deadline has expired, leading international aid groups have said Israel has fallen far short, with the humanitarian situation in Gaza the worst it has been since the war erupted. </p> \n  <p>However, the US has said Israel has made limited progress and that it will not take punitive action.<br><br>After 13 months of war, aid groups accuse the Israeli military of hindering and even blocking shipments in Gaza. Almost the entire population of around 2.3 million Palestinians is relying on international aid for survival, and food security experts and rights groups caution that famine may already be under way.<br><br>Israel, which controls all crossings into Gaza, says it is committed to delivering humanitarian assistance. It says the UN and international aid groups need to do a better job of distributing supplies.</p> \n  <p><strong>Where do aid levels stand?</strong><br>Aid into Gaza is typically measured in terms of truckloads of food and supplies entering the territory. The US has demanded 350 trucks daily.<br><br>Israeli government figures show roughly 57 trucks a day entering on average in October and 75 a day in November. The UN counts trucks differently and says it has only received 39 trucks daily since the beginning of October.<br><br>In northern Gaza, where the Israeli military has been carrying out a major offensive over the past month, the figures were even lower. No aid entered the northernmost areas of Gaza \u2013 Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun \u2013 in October, the UN says.<br><br>Israel says it closed all the Gaza crossings for the Jewish high holidays in October and couldn\u2019t send aid to the north because of the offensive against Hamas fighters.<br><br>Over the last two days, the military body handling aid deliveries to Gaza \u2014 Cogat \u2014 says it has allowed aid trucks to enter the hardest-hit northern areas. But only three of the trucks have made it to their destination successfully, according to the World Food Program.</p> \n  <p><strong>Denial of passage and entry</strong><br>Aid groups accuse the Israeli army of blocking aid trucks from reaching areas where the fighting is most intense, including northern Gaza, where hunger is most acute.<br><br>\u201cThere can be aid sitting at the border ready to come in. But if we are not provided a safe passage to go and collect it, it\u2019s not possible for us to have it. And it will not reach the people who need it,\u201d said Louise Wateridge, a spokesperson for Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.<br><br>Unrwa has been the main agency procuring and distributing aid in Gaza, and a feud between Israel and the agency, led Israel to take steps toward banning it last month. Israel says Hamas has infiltrated Unrwa - a charge the agency denies.<br><br>During October, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that Israeli authorities rejected roughly 43% of all humanitarian movement requests, and impeded a further 16%.<br><br>Israeli authorities have also prohibited some vehicles and goods from entering the enclave, aid groups say, often without explanation. Rachel Morris, of the aid group Mercy Corps, said trucks carrying the group\u2019s tent supplies have been turned away more than five times. Israel says it denies entry to supplies that could be weaponised by Hamas.<br><br>Under intense international pressure, Israel has since taken measures to up aid delivery, with COGAT saying it was allowing trucks into the hard-hit north. On Tuesday, it said it had opened a fifth border crossing to increase the flow of aid.<br>But aid groups say access is still an issue.<br><br><strong>Lawlessness along aid routes</strong></p> \n  <p>Also stymying distribution is theft and criminality along aid routes. Israel accuses Unrwa of failing to pick up hundreds of trucks worth of supplies piling up at the territory\u2019s main southern aid crossing. It says the aid has been waiting there for months.<br><br>But the military and aid agencies both acknowledge that aid deliveries are treacherous, because family-based crime groups are robbing the trucks. An Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, estimated that 30% to 40% of aid supplies are stolen by members of criminal families.<br><br>Cogat spokesperson Shani Sasson said that the Israeli army has tried to secure part of the route and find alternate routes for drivers, but can\u2019t accompany each aid truck and the criminal groups are always moving.<br><br>Many aid groups that use the crossing now say it\u2019s too dangerous for their staff to collect aid. Baidoun, with MAP, said that drivers sometimes have to pay fees to move their aid from the crossing into Gaza.<br><br>He said that the Israeli military was \u201cfailing to provide an enabling environment to bring in sufficient humanitarian goods to Gaza.\u201d<br><br>Aid groups also say their warehouses and workers have come under attack from Israeli forces. OCHA says that at least 326 aid workers have been killed since the start of the war.

Here are the headlines \u2026 The US wants \u201creal and extended pauses\u201d in fighting in Gaza so assistance can get to people who need it, but the best way to help people would be to end the war, US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Wednesday.

Huckabee has a track record of hardline, pro-Israel rhetoric and has previously said Israel has a rightful claim to the West Bank Palestinian territory which it has occupied since 1967 The Biden administration had said on Tuesday that Israel has made some good but limited progress in increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza and will not limit arms transfers to Israel as it had threatened to a month ago Israeli military strikes killed at least 22 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, and the health ministry in Lebanon said a further 78 people had been killed there in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of people killed by Israel\u2019s military campaign to 3,365 Israel\u2019s plan to ban the UN Palestinian relief agency, Unrwa, within three months is impossible and unrealistic without causing further untold suffering to the Palestinian people, its director of operations in Gaza has warned The mother of Sasha Troufanov, who was taken hostage during Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack into Israel, has called for his immediate release after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group released a new video showing him speaking, likely under duress A man who worked for the US government has been charged with leaking classified information assessing Israel\u2019s earlier plans to attack Iran An Israeli court has extended the detention of Eli Feldstein, one of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s aides, by a further day. Feldstein has been accused of selectively leaking intelligence reports to foreign media in a way that supported Netanyahu\u2019s position on any potential ceasefire or hostage deal with Hamas UK prime minister Keir Starmer resisted pressure from an independent MP in parliament to describe the war in Gaza as \u201cgenocide\u201d Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has said that his country has cut off all ties with Israel, and urged incoming US president Trump to \u201ctake very different steps towards the region\u201d Reuters reports that Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has arrived in Iran. Iran\u2019s state news agency IRNA carried a video showing Grossi meeting the spokesperson for Tehran\u2019s state atomic energy agency, Behrouz Kamalvandi, shortly after his arrival. Iran\u2019s nuclear programme has remained contentious, with the Islamic Republic insisting it is only a peaceful programme for power generation, while many in the international community, particularly the US and Israel, view it as an attempt to obtain nuclear weapons technology. Tehran is now believed to be enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the roughly 90% required for a nuclear bomb. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that Israeli security forces have detained its journalist Israa Gorani and a television crew in Tubas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The agency reported that the journalist was returning from covering the Israeli demolition of a house in the village of Kardala. Israel\u2019s military has reported that a drone which infiltrated Israel from the direction of Lebanon has fallen in an open area in Upper Galilee. It said \u201cThe event has concluded, no reports regarding injuries have been received.\u201d Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the newswires from Gaza. An Israeli court has extended the detention of Eli Feldstein, one of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s aides, by a further day. Feldstein has been accused of selectively leaking intelligence reports to foreign media in a way that supported Netanyahu\u2019s position on any potential ceasefire or hostage deal with Hamas. A gag order is in place in Israel preventing the reporting of some aspects of the case. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry has issued updated casualty figures, stating that in the last 24 hours 78 people have been killed and 122 wounded by Israeli airstrikes in the country. It takes the total number killed since Israel stepped up its military campaign to 3,365 according to the official figures, with 14,344 wounded. Earlier Gaza\u2019s Hamas-led health ministry claimed that at least 43,712 Palestinians have been killed and 103,258 injured in Israel\u2019s offensive on Gaza since 7 October 2023. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. Israel\u2019s military has reported further rocket launches from Lebanon, aimed at central Israel. In a message on the Telegram app, it said \u201capproximately five projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Some of the projectiles were intercepted by the IAF, fallen projectiles were identified.\u201d There were no immediate reports of any casualties. My colleague Richard Luscombe has this report on a US intelligence official being charged with espionage relating to Israel: A US intelligence official has been charged with espionage offenses following an investigation into the leak last month of highly classified documents detailing Israel\u2019s plans for military attacks on Iran. Asif W Rahman, who works for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), will appear in court in Guam on Thursday charged with two counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The newspaper said FBI agents arrested Rahman in Cambodia on Tuesday following his indictment last week in federal court in Virginia. In October, the White House said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the unauthorized release of the papers, attributed to the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and National Security Agency, which were published on the Telegram messaging app. Read more here: US intelligence official charged after Israel\u2019s plan to attack Iran leaked Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that one Palestinian man has been wounded by Israeli security forces during a raid in Beit Furik, east of Nablus, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel\u2019s recently appointed defense minister, making his first visit to the IDF Northern Command since taking up the role, has said Israel \u201cwill not make any cease-fires, we will not take our foot off the pedal\u201d in its battle with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Reuters quotes Israel Katz, who replaced Yoav Gallant last week, saying: We will not make any cease-fires, we will not take our foot off the pedal, and we will not allow any arrangement that does not include the achievement of the war\u2019s objectives - and above all Israel\u2019s right to enforce and act on its own against any terrorist activity. Terrorist infrastructure is collapsing in Beirut - we will continue to hurt Hezbollah everywhere. Al Jazeera reports that Hezbollah has claimed two attacks on an Israeli military base in the north of the country. Reuters reports that about 100 students in Turin have staged a protest at the headquarters of Italian defence group Leonardo. The students, who unfurled a Palestinian flag on the roof of the offices, said the company was supporting Israel by providing remote technical assistance and spare parts to Israel\u2019s air force. Images released by the students show them in Leonardo\u2019s offices waving Palestinian flags and carrying spray cans. Outside they hung banners on the buildings saying \u201cno arms to Israel\u201d and accusing the group of complicity in genocide. Italian defence minister Guido Crosetto condemned the protest, saying \u201cThese people must be treated for what they are, dangerous subversives. Criminals have no political colour, they are just criminals.\u201d Israel\u2019s military, posting on its official Telegram channel, states that as of 4.30pm local time (2.30pm GMT) \u201capproximately 40 projectiles\u201d have been fired at Israel from inside Lebanon today. It is approaching 5pm in Gaza City, Tel Aviv and Beirut. Here is a summary of the key developments so far today: The US wants \u201creal and extended pauses\u201d in fighting in Gaza so assistance can get to people who need it, but the best way to help people would be to end the war, US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Wednesday. \u201cIsrael, by the standards it set itself, has accomplished the goals that it set for itself,\u201d Blinken told reporters during a visit to Brussels. Blinken added: \u201cThis should be a time to end the war.\u201d Senior Hamas official, Sami Abu Zuhri, said Blinken\u2019s comments showed: \u201cWe are facing one enemy and that the US enmity against the Palestinian people is no less than that of the occupation.\u201d On Tuesday, after the expiry of a 30-day US deadline for Israel to take steps to address the humanitarian situation in Gaza, Washington said Israel was not blocking aid to Gaza and therefore not violating US law. However, eight international aid groups said Israel had failed to meet the US demands to improve access for assistance. The Biden administration said on Tuesday that Israel has made some good but limited progress in increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza and will not limit arms transfers to Israel as it had threatened to a month ago if the situation had not improved. Relief groups say conditions are worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war. Donald Trump has chosen the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as the next US ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has a track record of hardline, occasionally provocative, pro-Israel rhetoric and previously said Israel has a rightful claim to the West Bank, which he refers to by its Hebrew and biblical name of Judea and Samaria. Posting on his Truth Social network, Trump predicted Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, would \u201cwork tirelessly to bring about peace in the Middle East\u201d. Israeli military strikes killed at least 22 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, as Israeli forces deepened their incursion into Beit Hanoun town in the north. Residents said Israeli forces besieged shelters housing displaced families and the remaining population, which some estimated at a few thousand, ordering them to head south through a checkpoint separating two towns and a refugee camp in the north from Gaza City. Lebanese state media reported on Wednesday a third wave of Israeli raids on Hezbollah\u2019s south Beirut bastion in 24 hours, after the health ministry said another strike south of the capital killed six people. Earlier on Wednesday, an Israeli strike on Aramoun, south of Beirut, killed six people, Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said giving a preliminary toll for the attack on the densely packed area which is located outside Hezbollah\u2019s traditional strongholds. The Israeli army on Wednesday told residents of parts of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs to leave, the third such warning in 24 hours/ Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said he hopes US president-elect Donald Trump would take a different approach on the Middle East during his term, but that some of the messages coming from his side were concerning, broadcaster NTV reported on Wednesday. \u201cIt seems too early to me to make observations about this,\u201d Erdo\u011fan told reporters on a return flight from Baku, Azerbaijan. \u201cOur hope is that Trump takes very different steps toward the region this term because the messages being given from time to time concern us,\u201d he was cited as saying. Asked about Turkey\u2019s decision to halt all trade with Israel in May, Erdo\u011fan said Ankara had no trade ties with Israel at the moment and no desire to develop them Israel\u2019s plan to close the UN Palestinian relief agency, Unrwa, within three months is impossible and unrealistic without causing further untold suffering to the Palestinian people, its director of operations in Gaza has warned. Just returned from Gaza, where he said he had seen levels of suffering unprecedented since the war started, Sam Rose warned that Unrwa could collapse, with severe implications for schools and hospitals not just in Gaza but in the West Bank if Israel went ahead with its plan. The mother of Sasha Troufanov, who was taken hostage during Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack into Israel, has called for his immediate release after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group released a new video showing him speaking, likely under duress. \u201cI am relieved to see my son alive, but I am very worried to hear what he is saying,\u201d said Lena Trufanov, in comments reported by the Times of Israel. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said, in response to the video: \u201cThe hostages have no time left \u2013 a deal for their release is the only way to bring them all back to us.\u201d Palestinian medics say an Israeli strike on a home in northern Gaza killed three siblings that were six years old or younger. They were among at least six people killed in Israeli strikes on Tuesday in the territory. The Gaza health ministry\u2019s emergency service said the three children were killed in a strike on a home near a clinic in the Jabaliya refugee camp, where Israel has been waging an offensive for over a month. In the central city of Deir al-Balah, a strike hit a tent in the western side of the city, killing at least two people, including a 15-year-old boy, al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital said. Another strike on a tent in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp killed a man, the hospital said. An AP journalist counted the three bodies at the hospital. A man who worked for the US government has been charged with leaking classified information assessing Israel\u2019s earlier plans to attack Iran, according to court papers filed on Wednesday. The man, identified as Asif William Rahman, was arrested by the FBI this week in Cambodia and was to due to make his first court appearance in Guam. The charges stem from the documents, attributed to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, appearing last month on a channel of the Telegram messaging app. Iran\u2019s top diplomat has said that communication channels with the US were still open, a week after Donald Trump was elected president. \u201cThe communication channels between us and the Americans still exist,\u201d Abbas Araghchi said on the sidelines of a weekly cabinet meeting. At least 43,712 Palestinians have been killed and 103,258 injured in Israel\u2019s offensive on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said on Wednesday. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Russia has asked Israel to avoid launching aerial strikes as part of its war against Hezbollah near one of Moscow\u2019s bases in Syria, a top official said on Wednesday. The US military said on Tuesday it had conducted strikes against an Iranian-backed militia group\u2019s weapons storage facility in Syria. \u201cThese strikes were in response to a rocket attack on US personnel at Patrol Base Shaddadi. There was no damage to US facilities and no injuries to US or partner forces during the attack,\u201d the US military said in a statement. The Israeli military said its forces had killed hundreds of Hamas militants in Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun during its new military offensive, which began more than a month ago. Hamas and the Islamic Jihad armed wing claimed killing several Israeli soldiers during ambushes and anti-tank rocket fire. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, resisted pressure from an independent MP during prime minister\u2019s questions (PMQs) to describe the war in Gaza as \u201cgenocide\u201d. When asked for his definition of the word, Starmer told the House of Commons he was \u201cwell aware of the definition of genocide, and that is why I have never described this as, and referred to it as, genocide\u201d. The Israeli military earlier issued a statement on social media saying it would act soon against targets in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, which residents have largely evacuated. Israeli military had released an evacuation order on Wednesday warning residents they were located near Hezbollah facilities. Israel has conducted many of its airstrikes on Dahiyeh at night-time, but on Tuesday and Wednesday carried out multiple strikes starting in the mid-morning. The airstrikes flattened around a dozen buildings in Dahiyeh on Tuesday, reports Reuters. On Monday, Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said there had been \u201ca certain progress\u201d in ceasefire talks over Lebanon, though the main challenge would be enforcement. Israel\u2019s new defence minister, Israel Katz, said on Monday there would be no ceasefire in Lebanon until Israel achieves its goals there, including disarming Hezbollah and returning evacuated Israelis to their homes in northern Israel. Egyptian foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, speaking during a visit to Beirut, said Cairo was in near daily contact with western and Arab states as well as Russia and China. \u201cThe main goal is the immediate cessation of this aggression and how to intensify pressure and all forms of influence on the Israeli government to stop its aggression,\u201d he said. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, resisted pressure from an independent MP during prime minister\u2019s questions (PMQs) to describe the war in Gaza as \u201cgenocide\u201d, reports the PA news agency. When asked for his definition of the word, Starmer told the House of Commons he was \u201cwell aware of the definition of genocide, and that is why I have never described this as, and referred to it as, genocide\u201d. His comments came in response to a question from Ayoub Khan, who argued that \u201cgenocide is not about numbers, it\u2019s about intent\u201d. Khan, MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, said: Article two of the United Nations genocide convention makes it explicitly clear that genocide is not about numbers, it\u2019s about intent. And the intent of the Israeli government and the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) has been explicitly clear in words and in actions over the past 400 days, more than 45,000 innocent men, women and children killed. On 28 October, the foreign secretary denied that a genocide is even taking place and suggested that the Israeli army had not yet killed enough Palestinians to constitute a genocide. And last week at PMQs, the prime minister started that he has never referred to the atrocities happening in Gaza as a genocide. Will the prime minister share his definition of genocide with this House? And will he state what further action he\u2019s prepared to take to save the lives of desperate and starving men, women and children? Given that we now hold presidency of the UN security council.\u201d The prime minister replied: It would be wise to start a question like that by reference to what happened in October of last year. I\u2019m well aware of the definition of genocide, and that is why I have never described this as, and referred to it as, genocide.\u201d The Associated Press (AP) has some more details on the news that Asif William Rahman has been charged with leaking classified information assessing Israel\u2019s earlier plans to attack Iran (1.39pm GMT). Rahman was indicted last week in a US court in Virginia on two counts of willful transmission of national defence information \u2013 felony charges that can can carry significant prison sentences. It was not immediately clear whether Rahman had a lawyer or which federal agency employed him, but officials say he had top secret security clearance, reports the AP. According to the AP, the charges stem from the documents, attributed to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, appearing last month on a channel of the Telegram messaging app. The documents noted that Israel was still moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack on 1 October. Israel carried out a retaliatory attack on multiple sites in Iran in late October. The documents were sharable within the \u201cFive Eyes,\u201d which are the US, the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. A man who worked for the US government has been charged with leaking classified information assessing Israel\u2019s earlier plans to attack Iran, according to court papers filed on Wednesday, reports the Associated Press (AP). The man, identified as Asif William Rahman, was arrested by the FBI this week in Cambodia and was to due to make his first court appearance in Guam. It was not immediately clear whether he had a lawyer or which federal agency employed him, reports Reuters. The New York Times was first to report his arrest. The Israeli military said its forces had killed hundreds of Hamas militants in Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun during its new military offensive, which began more than a month ago, reports Reuters. Hamas and the Islamic Jihad armed wing claimed killing several Israeli soldiers during ambushes and anti-tank rocket fire. Efforts by Arab mediators, Qatar and Egypt, backed by the US, have so far failed to end the war in Gaza, with Hamas and Israel trading the blame for the lack of progress. Speaking on Wednesday, US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Israel \u201chas accomplished the goals that it set for itself\u201d by taking out Hamas\u2019s leadership and ensuring the group is unable to launch another massive attack. \u201cThis should be a time to end the war,\u201d he said, adding: We also need to make sure we have a plan for what follows, so that if Israel decides to end the war and we find a way to get the hostages out, we also have a clear plan so that Israel can get out of Gaza and we make sure that Hamas is not going back in.\u201d Senior Hamas official, Sami Abu Zuhri, said Blinken\u2019s comments showed: We are facing one enemy and that the US enmity against the Palestinian people is no less than that of the occupation.\u201d The Associated Press (AP) is reporting that a US government employee has been charged in a leak of classified documents assessing Israel\u2019s earlier plans to attack Iran. More details to follow \u2026 Israeli military strikes killed at least 22 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, as Israeli forces deepened their incursion into Beit Hanoun town in the north, forcing most remaining residents to leave, reports Reuters. Residents said Israeli forces besieged shelters housing displaced families and the remaining population, which some estimated at a few thousand, ordering them to head south through a checkpoint separating two towns and a refugee camp in the north from Gaza City. Men were held for questioning, while women and children were allowed to continue towards Gaza City, residents and Palestinian medics said, according to Reuters. Israel\u2019s campaign in the north of Gaza, and the evacuation of tens of thousands of Palestinians from the area, has fueled claims from Palestinians that it is clearing the area for use as a buffer zone and potentially for a return of Jewish settlers. The Israeli military has denied any such intention, and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he does not want to reverse the 2005 withdrawal of settlers from Gaza. Hardliners in his government have talked openly about going back, reports Reuters. \u201cThe scenes of the 1948 catastrophe are being repeated. Israel is repeating its massacres, displacement and destruction,\u201d Saed, 48, a resident of Beit Lahiya, who arrived in Gaza City on Wednesday. \u201cNorth Gaza is being turned into a large buffer zone, Israel is carrying out ethnic cleansing under the sight and hearing of the impotent world,\u201d he told Reuters via a chat app. Lebanese state media reported on Wednesday a third wave of Israeli raids on Hezbollah\u2019s south Beirut bastion in 24 hours, after the health ministry said another strike south of the capital killed six people, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cEnemy aircraft targeted Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs\u201d, the official National News Agency (NNA) said, reporting six strikes. AFPTV footage showed plumes of black smoke rising over the area after the strikes, about an hour after Israel\u2019s army issued evacuation warnings. People hastily drove away from the area after the evacuation calls, with residents firing gunshots in the air to warn civilians to flee, an AFP photographer said. Earlier on Wednesday, an Israeli strike on Aramoun, south of Beirut, killed six people, Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said giving a preliminary toll for the attack on the densely packed area which is located outside Hezbollah\u2019s traditional strongholds. The NNA said the strike targeted a residential apartment at dawn. An AFP photographer said they saw rescuers pulling bodies out of the rubble in Aramoun, where the four-storey building had partly collapsed. Patrick Wintour is the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor. He writes: Israel\u2019s plan to close the UN Palestinian relief agency, Unrwa, within three months is impossible and unrealistic without causing further untold suffering to the Palestinian people, its director of operations in Gaza has warned. Just returned from Gaza, where he said he had seen levels of suffering unprecedented since the war started, Sam Rose warned that Unrwa could collapse, with severe implications for schools and hospitals not just in Gaza but in the West Bank if Israel went ahead with its plan. He was speaking the day after the US government stepped back from taking any action against Israel for failing to meet most of its demands to improve the supply of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The Biden administration said the humanitarian aid operation into Gaza was \u201cnot pristine\u201d but Israel was taking steps to meet the US demands, set out in a letter, including opening new crossings. The mother of Sasha Troufanov, who was taken hostage during Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack into Israel, has called for his immediate release after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group released a new video showing him speaking, likely under duress. \u201cI am relieved to see my son alive, but I am very worried to hear what he is saying,\u201d said Lena Trufanov, in comments reported by the Times of Israel. Lena Trufanov was also taken hostage from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, but was released last November. \u201cI urge that every effort be made to secure his immediate release and that of all other hostages. They have no time left,\u201d she added. The Hostages Families Forum said the \u201chorrific\u201d video show an urgent need for a deal to return the remaining 101 hostages. \u201cWith winter approaching, these hostages, who have been subjected to horrific conditions of abuse, starvation, and darkness for over a year, face an increasing risk of losing their lives,\u201d the forum says. Iran\u2019s top diplomat has said that communication channels with the United States were still open, a week after Donald Trump was elected president. \u201cThe communication channels between us and the Americans still exist,\u201d Abbas Araghchi said on the sidelines of a weekly cabinet meeting, in comments reported by AFP. \u201cWe have differences with the Americans, which are sometimes very fundamental and central and may not be resolved, but we must manage them to reduce their costs and decrease the tensions,\u201d he added. Araghchi, the minister for foreign affairs, said last month there was no ground for indirect nuclear talks with the United States. Iran, subject to biting international sanctions, reached a deal with major powers including the United States in 2015 to limit its nuclear programme in exchange for a gradual lifting of sanctions. But the pact was torpedoed three years later under Trump whose administration withdrew from it and reimposed sanctions. The Associated Press has a useful guide to the current situation relating to Gaza, aid, Israel and the US. Background The White House gave Israel 30 days to improve conditions or risk losing military support a month ago. Now the deadline has expired, leading international aid groups have said Israel has fallen far short, with the humanitarian situation in Gaza the worst it has been since the war erupted. However, the US has said Israel has made limited progress and that it will not take punitive action. After 13 months of war, aid groups accuse the Israeli military of hindering and even blocking shipments in Gaza. Almost the entire population of around 2.3 million Palestinians is relying on international aid for survival, and food security experts and rights groups caution that famine may already be under way. Israel, which controls all crossings into Gaza, says it is committed to delivering humanitarian assistance. It says the UN and international aid groups need to do a better job of distributing supplies. Where do aid levels stand? Aid into Gaza is typically measured in terms of truckloads of food and supplies entering the territory. The US has demanded 350 trucks daily. Israeli government figures show roughly 57 trucks a day entering on average in October and 75 a day in November. The UN counts trucks differently and says it has only received 39 trucks daily since the beginning of October. In northern Gaza, where the Israeli military has been carrying out a major offensive over the past month, the figures were even lower. No aid entered the northernmost areas of Gaza \u2013 Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun \u2013 in October, the UN says. Israel says it closed all the Gaza crossings for the Jewish high holidays in October and couldn\u2019t send aid to the north because of the offensive against Hamas fighters. Over the last two days, the military body handling aid deliveries to Gaza \u2014 Cogat \u2014 says it has allowed aid trucks to enter the hardest-hit northern areas. But only three of the trucks have made it to their destination successfully, according to the World Food Program. Denial of passage and entry Aid groups accuse the Israeli army of blocking aid trucks from reaching areas where the fighting is most intense, including northern Gaza, where hunger is most acute. \u201cThere can be aid sitting at the border ready to come in. But if we are not provided a safe passage to go and collect it, it\u2019s not possible for us to have it. And it will not reach the people who need it,\u201d said Louise Wateridge, a spokesperson for Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. Unrwa has been the main agency procuring and distributing aid in Gaza, and a feud between Israel and the agency, led Israel to take steps toward banning it last month. Israel says Hamas has infiltrated Unrwa - a charge the agency denies. During October, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that Israeli authorities rejected roughly 43% of all humanitarian movement requests, and impeded a further 16%. Israeli authorities have also prohibited some vehicles and goods from entering the enclave, aid groups say, often without explanation. Rachel Morris, of the aid group Mercy Corps, said trucks carrying the group\u2019s tent supplies have been turned away more than five times. Israel says it denies entry to supplies that could be weaponised by Hamas. Under intense international pressure, Israel has since taken measures to up aid delivery, with COGAT saying it was allowing trucks into the hard-hit north. On Tuesday, it said it had opened a fifth border crossing to increase the flow of aid. But aid groups say access is still an issue. Lawlessness along aid routes Also stymying distribution is theft and criminality along aid routes. Israel accuses Unrwa of failing to pick up hundreds of trucks worth of supplies piling up at the territory\u2019s main southern aid crossing. It says the aid has been waiting there for months. But the military and aid agencies both acknowledge that aid deliveries are treacherous, because family-based crime groups are robbing the trucks. An Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, estimated that 30% to 40% of aid supplies are stolen by members of criminal families. Cogat spokesperson Shani Sasson said that the Israeli army has tried to secure part of the route and find alternate routes for drivers, but can\u2019t accompany each aid truck and the criminal groups are always moving. Many aid groups that use the crossing now say it\u2019s too dangerous for their staff to collect aid. Baidoun, with MAP, said that drivers sometimes have to pay fees to move their aid from the crossing into Gaza. He said that the Israeli military was \u201cfailing to provide an enabling environment to bring in sufficient humanitarian goods to Gaza.\u201d Aid groups also say their warehouses and workers have come under attack from Israeli forces. OCHA says that at least 326 aid workers have been killed since the start of the war. It\u2019s not clear how many have been killed while working. At least 43,712 Palestinians have been killed and 103,258 injured in Israel\u2019s offensive on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said on Wednesday. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Iran\u2019s top diplomat said on Wednesday that communication channels with the US were still open, a week after Donald Trump was elected president, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cThe communication channels between us and the Americans still exist,\u201d Abbas Araghchi said on the sidelines of a weekly cabinet meeting. According to AFP, he said: We have differences with the Americans, which are sometimes very fundamental and central and may not be resolved, but we must manage them to reduce their costs and decrease the tensions.\u201d Araghchi said last month that there was no ground for indirect nuclear talks with the US. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any grounds for these talks, until we can get past the current crisis,\u201d Araghchi said on 14 October during a visit to Oman as part of a regional tour. Oman has long mediated between Iran and the US, which cut ties after the 1979 Islamic revolution that saw western-backed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi ousted. The remarks by the Iranian top diplomat were echoed by the country\u2019s president on Tuesday, reports AFP. \u201cRegarding America, whether we like it or not, we will eventually face this country in the regional and international arena, and it is better to manage this issue ourselves,\u201d Masoud Pezeshkian said. The developments come as the International Atomic Energy Agency director general, Rafael Grossi, is set to visit Tehran later today to hold talks with Iranian officials on the country\u2019s nuclear programme. \u201cThere are problems and disagreements about how to cooperate,\u201d with the agency, Araghchi said on Wednesday. He expressed hope that during the Grossi\u2019s trip, the two sides \u201ccan reach an agreement regarding some of the differences that exist and how to cooperate in the future\u201d. An Israeli group campaigning for the release of hostages held in Gaza said on Wednesday their loved ones had \u201cno time left\u201d, after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group released a new video of an Israeli hostage, Sasha Troufanov, who has been held in Gaza for over a year (see 10.27am GMT). According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said: The hostages have no time left \u2013 a deal for their release is the only way to bring them all back to us.\u201d Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said he hopes US president-elect Donald Trump would take a different approach on the Middle East during his term, but that some of the messages coming from his side were concerning, broadcaster NTV reported on Wednesday. \u201cIt seems too early to me to make observations about this,\u201d Erdo\u011fan told reporters on a return flight from Baku, Azerbaijan. \u201cOur hope is that Trump takes very different steps toward the region this term because the messages being given from time to time concern us,\u201d he was cited as saying, reports Reuters. Asked about Turkey\u2019s decision to halt all trade with Israel in May, Erdo\u011fan said Ankara had no trade ties with Israel at the moment and no desire to develop them. He was cited as saying: A Republic of Turkey that is headed by Tayyip Erdo\u011fan can\u2019t continue to develop its relationship with Israel. We have no such intention. We have cut trade and ties with Israel, period.\u201d Turkey withdrew its ambassador in Israel for consultations after the Israel-Hamas war broke out, but has not officially severed its ties with Israel and its embassy remains open and operational. Erdo\u011fan also said China and Russia had signed an initiative that Turkey launched at the United Nations to impose a weapons embargo on Israel. The US wants \u201creal and extended pauses\u201d in fighting in Gaza so assistance can get to people who need it, but the best way to help people would be to end the war, US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Wednesday. \u201cIsrael, by the standards it set itself, has accomplished the goals that it set for itself,\u201d Blinken told reporters during a visit to Brussels, according to Reuters. Blinken added: This should be a time to end the war.\u201d On Tuesday, after the expiry of a 30-day US deadline for Israel to take steps to address the humanitarian situation in Gaza, Washington said Israel was not blocking aid to Gaza and therefore not violating US law. However, eight international aid groups said Israel had failed to meet the US demands to improve access for assistance. Food security experts have said it is likely that famine is imminent in parts of Gaza. Blinken said Israel had taken multiple steps to address the humanitarian crisis ahead of the deadline set by outgoing president Joe Biden\u2019s administration \u2013 but that more was needed. Blinken told reporters on Wednesday: We need to see real and extended pauses in large areas of Gaza, pauses in any fighting, any combat, so that the assistance can effectively get to people who need it.\u201d Last month, Blinken and Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin sent a letter to Israel setting a 13 November deadline to comply with US law on permitting humanitarian assistance, or risk a cut to military aid. \u201cThe intent was to inject a sense of urgency with Israel to take necessary steps to address the dire humanitarian situation,\u201d Blinken said on Wednesday. Israel has since moved to implement 12 of the 15 steps the US urged action on, but \u201cthree big issues\u201d still needed to be addressed. Enacting extended pauses in fighting was one. The other two were allowing commercial trucks into the Palestinian territory and rescinding evacuation orders so that people could return to an area after Israel completed operations there, he said. \u201cShort of ending the war, which we believe now is the time to move to that, we have to see these humanitarian steps fully implemented,\u201d Blinken said. Biden, whose term ends in January and who will be replaced with his predecessor Donald Trump, has strongly backed Israel since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel in October 2023. Trump, a staunch supporter of Israel, has strongly backed Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s goal of destroying Hamas. Trump has promised to bring peace to the Middle East, but has not said how he would accomplish that. Palestinian medics say an Israeli strike on a home in northern Gaza killed three siblings that were six years old or younger, reports the Associated Press (AP). They were among at least six people killed in Israeli strikes on Tuesday in the territory. The Gaza health ministry\u2019s emergency service said the three children were killed in a strike on a home near a clinic in the Jabaliya refugee camp, where Israel has been waging an offensive for over a month. In the central city of Deir al-Balah, a strike hit a tent in the western side of the city, killing at least two people, including a 15-year-old boy, al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital said. Another strike on a tent in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp killed a man, the hospital said. An AP journalist counted the three bodies at the hospital. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group has released a new video showing an Israeli hostage who has been held in Gaza for over a year, reports the Associated Press (AP). The video shows Sasha Troufanov, likely speaking under duress, describing the harsh conditions inside Gaza, warning against military operations to free him and calling on Israelis to protest for his release. According to the AP, it was the first such video to be released in several weeks. The news agency said it was not clear when it was filmed, but Troufanov appeared to refer to Israel\u2019s war against Hezbollah in Lebanon and its recent exchange of fire with Iran, which occurred in October. Islamic Jihad took part in Hamas\u2019s 7 October 2023 attack into Israel, in which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 250 people hostage. Of those, 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Islamic Jihad released two previous videos of Troufanov earlier this year. He turned 29 on Monday, marking his second birthday in captivity. His mother, grandmother and girlfriend were also taken captive, but they were released during a November 2023 ceasefire. His father was killed in the 7 October 2023 attack. The US, Egypt and Qatar have spent most of this year trying to broker a ceasefire and the release of the remaining hostages. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in return for a lasting ceasefire, the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to retain Israeli control over parts of Gaza and to continue the war until \u201ctotal victory\u201d over Hamas and the return of the remaining captives. The US wants real and extended pauses in fighting in Gaza so assistance can get to people who need it, US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told reporters on Wednesday. More details to follow \u2026 Israel carried out a series of strikes across southern Lebanon, damaging several buildings and levelling a multi-storey building in Beirut on Tuesday, saying it was targeting Hezbollah installations. Evacuation orders were posted on social media by an Israeli army spokesperson. Here is a video report on the strikes: The US military said on Tuesday it had conducted strikes against an Iranian-backed militia group\u2019s weapons storage facility in Syria, according to Reuters. \u201cThese strikes were in response to a rocket attack on US personnel at Patrol Base Shaddadi. There was no damage to US facilities and no injuries to US or partner forces during the attack,\u201d the US military said in a statement. The Biden administration said on Tuesday that Israel has made some good but limited progress in increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza and will not limit arms transfers to Israel as it had threatened to a month ago if the situation had not improved, reports the Associated Press (AP). Relief groups say conditions are worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war. State department spokesperson, Vedant Patel, told reporters the progress to date must be supplemented and sustained but \u201cwe, at this time, have not made an assessment that the Israelis are in violation of US law\u201d. It requires recipients of military assistance to adhere to international humanitarian law and not impede the provision of such aid, reports the AP. \u201cWe are not giving Israel a pass,\u201d Patel said, adding that the steps Israel has taken have not yet made a significant enough difference. He said: We want to see the totality of the humanitarian situation improve, and we think some of these steps will allow the conditions for that to continue to progress.\u201d Russia has asked Israel to avoid launching aerial strikes as part of its war against Hezbollah near one of Moscow\u2019s bases in Syria, a top official said on Wednesday, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Syrian state media in mid-October claimed that Israel had struck the port city of Latakia, a stronghold of president Bashar al-Assad, who is supported by Russia and in turn backs Hezbollah. Latakia, and in particular its airport, is close to the town of Hmeimim that hosts a Russian airbase. \u201cIsrael actually carried out an airstrike in the immediate vicinity of Hmeimim,\u201d Alexander Lavrentiev, Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s special envoy in the near east, told the RIA Novosti press agency. \u201cOur military has of course notified Israeli authorities that such acts that put Russian military lives in danger over there are unacceptable,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is why we hope that this incident in October will not be repeated.\u201d Israel has carried out intensive bombing of Syria but rarely targets Latakia, to the north-west of Damascus. Israel accuses Hezbollah of transporting weapons through Syria. AFP reports that Lavrentiev said Russia\u2019s airbase was not being used to supply Hezbollah with weapons. The Israeli army on Wednesday told residents of parts of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs to leave, the third such warning in 24 hours, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cYou are located near facilities and interests affiliated with Hezbollah, against which the Israel Defense Forces (military) will act in the near future,\u201d army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X that included a map of the areas in question. The report listed 19 measures of compliance with the US demands. It said Israel had failed to comply with 15 and only partially complied with four. \u201cIsrael not only failed to meet the US criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground,\u201d the report said. \u201cThat situation is in an even more dire state today than a month ago.\u201d The US ultimatum, signed by US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, called on Israel to allow a minimum of 350 truckloads of goods to enter Gaza each day, open a fifth crossing into the territory, ensure access for aid groups to northern Gaza and halt legislation that would hinder the operations of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa. Global food security experts have warned of imminent famine in parts of northern Gaza. The amount of food aid reaching Gaza has dropped to the lowest level since December, official Israeli figures show, with only 8,805 tonnes of food aid crossing through Israeli checkpoints into the territory so far this month. \u201cThe humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is the result of systemic obstruction of aid, relentless bombardment and an alarming failure to protect civilians,\u201d said Katy Crosby, a senior director of US policy and advocacy at Mercy Corps. \u201cThe worst-case scenario for northern Gaza is now a devastating reality \u2026 The US government must hold Israel accountable and take decisive action to ensure unrestricted aid delivery. Without this, preventable suffering and deaths will escalate and erode the United States\u2019 moral and legal credibility,\u201d Crosby said. Israel said on Monday it had met most of the US demands and that a fifth crossing into Gaza would open within days, but it would press ahead with its laws against Unrwa. Matthew Miller, a US state department spokeperson, said last week that Israel had made some progress but needed to do more to meet the US conditions. Israeli officials reject the charge that aid is deliberately restricted and accuse humanitarian agencies of failing to organise its distribution. UN agencies say ongoing fighting and lawlessness makes it difficult to collect and distribute aid on the Gaza side. The news website Axios reported earlier on Tuesday that the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had decided not to reduce military assistance to Israel due to the humanitarian situation in Gaza, according to two US officials. In an apparent last-minute concession, Israeli authorities announced an extension of the designated \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d in Gaza, adding inland areas which could partially relieve intense overcrowding and allow some displaced people to move away from the coast as winter approaches. Aid officials in Gaza describe the situation as \u201capocalyptic\u201d in much of the territory, where more than 80% of the population of 2.3 million have been displaced and more than two-thirds of buildings have been destroyed or damaged in 13 months of war. Israeli attacks in Gaza continued this week, killing at least 14 people, including two children and a woman, according to Palestinian medical officials. A strike late on Monday hit a cafeteria west of Khan Younis, killing at least 11 people, including two children, according to officials at Nasser hospital, where the casualties were taken. Another strike early on Tuesday hit a house in central Gaza, killing three people including a woman, according to al-Awda hospital, which received the casualties. Israeli forces launched a major operation in northern Gaza last month, sealing off three towns and ordering the evacuation of civilians. Military officials said they were fighting Hamas militants who had regrouped in the area. Donald Trump has chosen the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as the next US ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has a track record of hardline, occasionally provocative, pro-Israel rhetoric and previously said Israel has a rightful claim to the West Bank, which he refers to by its Hebrew and biblical name of Judea and Samaria. The territory is claimed by Palestinians as part of a putative future state but is dotted multiple Israeli settlements that are not recognised under international law. Huckabee has refused to call the settlements by that name, insisting that they be called \u201ccommunities\u201d or neighbourhoods. He has also denied that the West Bank, seized by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 six-day war, is under military occupation. Posting on his Truth Social network, Trump predicted Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, would \u201cwork tirelessly to bring about peace in the Middle East\u201d. \u201cHe loves Israel and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him,\u201d wrote Trump, who called Huckabee \u201ca great public servant.\u201d Huckabee\u2019s appointment is likely to signal a return to the explicitly pro-Israel posture of Trump\u2019s first administration, when he relocated the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in a move decried by Palestinians as damaging to peace prospects. While Israel claims Jerusalem as its indivisible capital, Palestinians lay claim to the eastern part of the city as their future capital. Speaking to CNN in 2017, Huckabee \u2013 who has paid several visits to Israeli settlements \u2013 made his position clear. \u201cThe only people who have ever had Yerushalayim [Jerusalem\u2019s Hebrew name] as a capital have been the Jews,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody else has ever made this city a capital, ever. So it shouldn\u2019t even be controversial.\u201d A coalition of international aid organisations have accused Israel of ignoring a US ultimatum that threatened sanctions if Israel did not implement a series of measures to counter the acute humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The 30-day ultimatum \u2013 which was due to expire yesterday or today \u2013 was delivered on 13 October, and almost none of its demands have been met, the humanitarian groups say. It is unclear what measures Israel\u2019s apparent failure to comply will trigger, but they may include a temporary halt to the supply of some munitions or other military assistance. Washington has not yet said whether it deems Israel to have complied. The US state department said on Tuesday that the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had told a senior Israeli official the previous day that the steps Israel had taken must lead to actual improvement on the ground. Asked how the US would urge Israel to improve the humanitarian situation, the state department spokesperson Vedant Patel said on Tuesday there was \u201cno new policy or new assessment to offer but we\u2019ll continue to have our conversations with the Israeli government\u201d. \u201cWe have not made an assessment that Israel is violating US law,\u201d Patel said. More on that in a moment. In other developments: Donald Trump has chosen the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as the next US ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has a track record of hardline, occasionally provocative, pro-Israel rhetoric and previously said Israel has a rightful claim to the West Bank, which he refers to by its Hebrew and biblical name of Judea and Samaria. Palestinian medical officials say Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 46 people in the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, including 11 at a makeshift cafeteria in an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone. In Lebanon, warplanes struck Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and killed 33 people elsewhere across the country on Tuesday. Large explosions shook Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs \u2013 an area known as Dahiyeh, where Hezbollah has a significant presence \u2013 soon after the Israeli military issued evacuation warnings for 11 houses there. Lebanese state-run media reported an Israeli strike on an apartment south of the capital Beirut on Wednesday that injured an unspecified number of people. \u201cIsraeli warplanes launched a strike at dawn targeting a residential apartment in a building in the Dawhet Aramoun area, injuring people,\u201d the official National News Agency said. International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi will visit Tehran on Wednesday for crucial talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. His visit comes only two days after the Israel defence minister warned that Iran was \u201cmore exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities\u201d. US forces on Tuesday carried out strikes against targets linked to an Iranian-backed militia in Syria in response to a rocket attack on Washington\u2019s troops in the country, the US military said. The strikes targeted the group\u2019s \u201cweapons storage and logistics headquarters facility \u2026 in response to a rocket attack on US personnel,\u201d the US Central Command (Centcom) said in a post on social media that did not identify the militia by name. Australia will not change its laws on the supply of weapons or ammunition to Israel if the coalition wins the next federal election, opposition foreign spokesperson Simon Birmingham says. The Liberal senator said the coalition had \u201cno plans\u201d to change the rules, as it emerged during a parliamentary hearing Australia had amended or lapsed at least 16 defence-related export permits to Israel after a review.",

This is what the report says about six serving and former C of E bishops, two of whom are now dead.</p>  <h2>Stephen Conway, bishop of Lincoln</h2>  <p>Conway was bishop of Ely in 2013 when a victim of John Smyth disclosed his abuse to the local diocese. According to the independent review led by Keith Makin, Conway wrote to a bishop in South Africa, where Smyth was living, with details of the disclosures. Conway also emailed Jo Bailey Wells, now bishop for episcopal ministry in the Anglican Communion but then chaplain to the archbishop of Canterbury, who said she would pass on the information to Lambeth Palace staff and Welby.</p> <p>Conway told Makin he had passed detailed information to \u201can entirely independent authority, in another province, on another continent.

He said it was his \u201cunderstanding\u201d that the matter had been reported to police in Cambridgeshire and passed on to police in Hampshire where the abuse took place.</p> <p>\u201cI am clear that I did all within my authority as a bishop of the Church of England, bearing in mind that I had no authority over an entirely independent province on another continent,\u201d Conway said.</p> <p>\u201cI acknowledge fully that my fault was in not rigorously pursuing Lambeth about that province-to-province communication, and for this I am deeply sorry.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p></p> <h2>Jo Bailey Wells, \u00a0bishop for episcopal ministry in the Anglican Communion</h2>  <p>Bailey Wells was the former archbishop\u2019s personal chaplain in 2013 when news of Smyth\u2019s abuse reached Lambeth Palace.</p> <p>The Makin report noted that in August 2013 Bailey Wells was alerted by the bishop of Ely to a \u201cserious historic safeguarding situation\u201d regarding Smyth\u2019s abuse of boys and young men at Christian summer camps. She said she would alert Welby and noted that the archbishop might know Smyth personally. Bailey Wells told Welby the allegations against Smyth should be left to the Ely diocese to pursue and to take no further action until the police provided further advice. This further advice never came and Bailey Wells did not follow it up.&nbsp;</p> <p>She told the Makin review that safeguarding referrals were made every couple of weeks to Lambeth Palace and the allegations against Smyth were \u201cnot particularly remarkable\u201d. This attitude was criticised in the report. It said: \u201cThe referral should have stood out as being remarkable \u2013 at least three victims were known of, with a further number (around five or six) having been referenced by a victim.\u201d&nbsp; It added: \u201cFundamentally, the diocese was expected to follow safeguarding procedures but there was no oversight from Lambeth Palace, even though they had been alerted. This is all the more surprising given that Lambeth Palace had been told of, and had acknowledged, that Justin Welby may have a connection with John Smyth.\u201d</p> <p>Bailey Wells also told the church\u2019s national safeguarding team that safeguarding was not part of her role as chaplain to the archbishop. The report challenged this stance. It said:&nbsp;\u201cStating that safeguarding is not a formal part of a role runs counter to the important maxim that \u2018safeguarding is everyone\u2019s business\u2019.\u201d It also suggested Bailey Wells misled Welby by assuring him that a police referral had been made about Smyth\u2019s abuse and the relevant local authority had been informed, when neither proved to be the case. She also falsely told Welby that the South African church had been alerted to the fact that he had fled there, the report found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Wells said she conveyed all the information she had to Welby. She said: \u201cBecause I was advised that Ely was managing this case \u2013 including reporting to the police, and specifically asked that Lambeth did not make any direct contact \u2013 I did not take further action. With hindsight, I regret not verifying or querying these assertions.</p> <p>\u201cI am appalled by the abuse perpetrated by John Smyth and the trauma and pain experienced by the survivors. I had no idea of any detail of this at the time. I understand that safeguarding is everyone\u2019s business, including my own, and deeply regret the impression [I gave].\u201d</p> <p></p> <p></p> <h2>Martin Seeley, bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich</h2>  <p>Rico Tice, who later became a priest, was told of Smyth\u2019s abuse in 1987. He told the Makin review that when he was interviewed about the possibility of ordination several years later, he was asked about Smyth by the Rev Martin Seeley, who was later appointed bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich. The Makin report said: \u201cSeeley says that he has no recollection of asking such a question or being asked to do so.\u201d</p> <p>This week, Seely said: \u201cThe archbishop of Canterbury\u2019s decision to step down shows how clearly the C of E understands the need for change and its profound commitment to creating a safer church \u2026 We know that no words can undo the damage done to people\u2019s lives both by him and by the failure of individuals in the church and other institutions to respond well.\u201d</p> <p>Seeley\u2019s office has been approached for comment.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <h2>George Carey, former archbishop of Canterbury</h2>  <p>Carey, then principal of Trinity theological college in Bristol, was informed of Smyth\u2019s abuse and sent an outline of a 1982 report about Smyth carried out by the Rev Mark Ruston, according to the Makin report. \u201cHe denies seeing it,\u201d Makin said.</p> <p>Smyth enrolled at Trinity theological college in 1983, when Carey was its principal. Carey told Makin that he did not know of Smyth\u2019s attendance. \u201cOn the balance of probabilities this seems highly unlikely,\u201d the Makin report said. \u201cGeorge Carey must have known of a person as prominent as John Smyth.\u201d</p> <p>Carey was named as a member of a \u201ccouncil of reference\u201d for the Zambesi Trust, a charity set up to provide financial support for Smyth and his wife to move to Zimbabwe. Carey told Makin that he did not know he was named. \u201cIt is, again, possible but not probable that this was the case,\u201d the Makin report said.&nbsp;</p> <p>A spokesperson for Carey said: \u201cAfter the passage of 40 years it is difficult to see how the Makin review could have come to a finding of fact on this matter. Lord Carey maintains that he didn\u2019t receive any report of John Smyth\u2019s abuse in 1983.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p></p> <h2>Bishop John Trillo, former bishop of Chelmsford</h2>  <p>John Trillo, who died in 1992, was one of the most senior clerics involved in the cover-up of Smyth\u2019s abuse in the 1980s. The Makin report found that Smyth\u2019s abuse was detailed in a report by the Rev Mark Ruston as early as 1982. But those who saw it \u201cparticipated in an active cover-up to prevent that report and its findings \u2013 including that crimes had been committed \u2013 coming to light.\u201d</p> <p>When one of Smyth\u2019s victims was being selected for ordination into the clergy, Ruston alerted the chair of the selection conference, John Trillo, to Smyth\u2019s abuse. Ruston said the reason he informed Trillo was to demonstrate how well the victim had adapted and recovered from the abuse.&nbsp;</p> <p>The report said: \u201cIt is significant that the chair of the conference, a senior member of the clergy, did not act on this information or seek to report this further. Even within the context of the time, with no formal Church of England safeguarding guidance, this clearly demonstrates a lack of understanding of safeguarding, both by Mark Ruston and by the bishop.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p></p> <h2>Peter Walker, former bishop of Ely</h2>  <p>Walker, who died in 2010, was bishop of Ely from 1977 to 1989. One of Smyth\u2019s victims told the Makin review that he recalled Mark Ruston saying he had discussed his investigation into Smyth\u2019s abuse with Walker. The Makin report noted this recollection but said it could not confirm the evidence.</p> <p></p> <p></p>",

The author of bestsellers for children and adults has said she will donate 100% of author royalties earned from sales of The Golden Mole, her 2022 book on endangered species, \u201cin perpetuity\u201d. The book was published in the US on Tuesday under the title Vanishing Treasures. So far she said she has donated more than \u00a310,000, and hopes it could eventually be much more. \u201cThe election of a climate-change denier to the US presidency is a catastrophe for all of us,\u201d said Rundell. \u201cIt comes at a time when the planet has never more urgently needed our protection. \u201cIt has rarely been so tempting for anyone who cares about the fate of the living world \u2013 of the Earth itself, of the parliament of the non-human, of the terrible human suffering that climate chaos will bring \u2013 to despair. But it\u2019s much too urgent and important for despair.\u201d Rundell plans to split the royalties across different organisations, which will change every five years. The initial recipients are \u201ctwo relatively small charities whose work I admire colossally\u201d, said the author. They are Blue Ventures, which helps rebuild fisheries and restore ocean life, and Forest Peoples Programme, which supports the rights of communities living in forests. \u201cProtecting forests is often a deadly risk for Indigenous peoples and local communities,\u201d said Rundell, drawing attention to the 207 environmental defenders killed in 2017. \u201cI am so grateful that these groups are there, fighting for the planet, and the people most at risk.\u201d The author has previously donated to Blue Ventures \u2013 when she won the \u00a350,000 Baillie Gifford prize in 2022 for her book Super-Infinite, a biography of the poet John Donne, she donated half her winnings to the conservation charity, and half to Sea-Watch, which conducts rescues of migrants in the Mediterranean. Royalties from all the editions of The Golden Mole published in different countries will be donated. \u201cIn the scheme of things, it\u2019s very small \u2013 but I want my book to be a tiny part of the urgent fight ahead of us,\u201d said the author.

Simkin said her injuries were sustained during a sexual assault and \u201cresulted in almost immediate bleeding and she bled to death inside the defendant\u2019s home\u201d.</p> <p>Simkin outlined violent incidents that he said had taken place during Render\u2019s relationship with Irwin.</p> <p>On 17 July last year, Render phoned the ambulance service saying she was increasingly concerned about Irwin\u2019s conduct.</p> <p>During the call, Irwin struck her \u201cmultiple times with a wooden rolling pin\u201d, Simkin said, causing marks to her abdomen. She was also slapped, strangled and had her hair pulled, the jury was told.</p> <p>In February, Render alleged that she had been assaulted again with a forceful kick to the backside by Irwin. This, she told police, came against a background of his binge drinking, cocaine use, increasing control and repeated aggression towards her.</p> <p>After the alleged February assault, Render left the flat and said she was told by Irwin that he would burn photographs of her children if she did not return, the jury heard.</p> <p>In a statement, Render told police: \u201cI have said to him if you burn those photographs then I will kill you. He has then stated: \u2018Come up here and I will kill you, I\u2019m telling you now that I\u2019ll fucking kill you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The jury was told that Render alleged Irwin exercised \u201cfull control\u201d over her life, limiting access to money and contact with her children, inspecting her phone and telling her what she could and could not eat.</p> <p>Simkin said it was anticipated that Irwin would claim Render consented to sex and that her death was \u201can accidental result of sexual activity\u201d.</p> <p>He told jurors: \u201cThe prosecution submit that you will be able to reject that assertion.</p> <p>\u201cWe will invite you to consider the nature of their relationship, the background to this o\ufb00ence, the violence which the defendant previously used upon the deceased and the extreme nature of the injuries themselves; which, taken together we say, is evidence which torpedoes Mr Irwin\u2019s claim that Ti\ufb00any consented to the penetration.\u201d</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A woman \u201ctrapped\u201d inside an aggressive and controlling relationship bled to death after a violent sexual assault, a jury has heard. Paul Irwin, 50, of Whitehaven, Cumbria, has denied the murder and sexual assault of Tiffany Render, 34, on 22 March. On the opening day of Irwin\u2019s trial at Carlisle crown court, the prosecutor Iain Simkin KC said Render was an \u201cextremely vulnerable woman who was trapped inside an aggressive, violent and controlling relationship\u201d with the defendant. He said paramedics were called to Irwin\u2019s flat in Whitehaven shortly before midnight and \u201cremarked that Tiffany was surrounded by blood-soaked bedding\u201d. She was pronounced dead shortly after midnight. Simkin said her injuries were sustained during a sexual assault and \u201cresulted in almost immediate bleeding and she bled to death inside the defendant\u2019s home\u201d. Simkin outlined violent incidents that he said had taken place during Render\u2019s relationship with Irwin. On 17 July last year, Render phoned the ambulance service saying she was increasingly concerned about Irwin\u2019s conduct. During the call, Irwin struck her \u201cmultiple times with a wooden rolling pin\u201d, Simkin said, causing marks to her abdomen. She was also slapped, strangled and had her hair pulled, the jury was told. In February, Render alleged that she had been assaulted again with a forceful kick to the backside by Irwin. This, she told police, came against a background of his binge drinking, cocaine use, increasing control and repeated aggression towards her. After the alleged February assault, Render left the flat and said she was told by Irwin that he would burn photographs of her children if she did not return, the jury heard. In a statement, Render told police: \u201cI have said to him if you burn those photographs then I will kill you. He has then stated: \u2018Come up here and I will kill you, I\u2019m telling you now that I\u2019ll fucking kill you.\u2019\u201d The jury was told that Render alleged Irwin exercised \u201cfull control\u201d over her life, limiting access to money and contact with her children, inspecting her phone and telling her what she could and could not eat. Simkin said it was anticipated that Irwin would claim Render consented to sex and that her death was \u201can accidental result of sexual activity\u201d. He told jurors: \u201cThe prosecution submit that you will be able to reject that assertion. \u201cWe will invite you to consider the nature of their relationship, the background to this o\ufb00ence, the violence which the defendant previously used upon the deceased and the extreme nature of the injuries themselves; which, taken together we say, is evidence which torpedoes Mr Irwin\u2019s claim that Ti\ufb00any consented to the penetration.\u201d The trial continues.",

      "body": "<p>There are several problems with my face, not least of which is that I look so bloody miserable all the time. Honestly, I\u2019m usually smiling inside. A nice woman stopped me in the street on Sunday to tell me that she never looked very happy either. We were kindred spirits, she said, because she, like me, had a resting not-happy face.</p> <p>She turned out to be a vicar, and said that when she did manage a smile, her congregations were very relieved and pleased. Nice. While I don\u2019t have a congregation of my own, I knew what she meant. But still I think it\u2019s time to change my face. Not with the help of a surgeon, you understand \u2013 I just need to give my countenance a bit of a lift.</p> <p>The trouble is that as soon as I start thinking about what to do with my face, I find it even harder to know what to do with it. Catch-22. When I\u2019m not thinking about it, as the vicar pointed out, my face defaults to something between neutral and unhappy. If I catch sight of myself, or someone asks me what the matter is, I try to make adjustments, but nothing sticks. And if I try too hard, I start to look a bit weird.</p> <p>This was something I struggled with when I co-presented chat-type shows, perched alongside a colleague on a very brightly coloured sofa. My problem was that I never knew what to do when I was in the camera shot but not talking. Staring glumly into space didn\u2019t look right. Occasionally, I\u2019d see myself in a monitor, visibly start, and try to affect a correction. This never got me anywhere. I tried everything, but nothing quite worked. I plumped for sage, thoughtful, slight nods of the head, but couldn\u2019t sustain this long enough to make it my go-to look. I tried glancing down to consult notes I hadn\u2019t made, and then back up again. Every now and then I\u2019d look across at whoever was doing the talking next to me. But not enough for one woman I worked with for a vanishingly short spell on BBC Breakfast. She took me aside and said I needed to <em>love</em> her when she was talking. Crikey. To be fair, when I was talking she did <em>love</em> me. I could feel her loving look boring into the side of my face \u2013 but I found it off-putting, so I asked her to stop.</p> <p>I worked on smiling more, but when my co-presenter was saying something sad, it just looked weird. So I assumed a sadder countenance, which obviously looked daft when the subject matter cheered up. In the end, the corners of my mouth were going up and down like nobody\u2019s business. As with everything in life, overthinking the problem only made it worse. I went back to where I\u2019d started, staring bleakly into the camera. So no, I never sorted out my nonspeaking television face and I gave up trying, which may be one of the reasons I\u2019m not on television much any more.</p>    <p>What is our \u201cnatural\u201d face, anyway? Thomas Hardy thought that it was only as they slept that people looked like their real selves. In The Mayor of Casterbridge, Michael Henchard beholds the girl he had thought was his daughter lying asleep. It\u2019s only then that he sees the features of her biological father because, as he puts it: \u201cIn sleep there come to the surface buried genealogical facts, ancestral curves, dead men\u2019s traits, which the mobility of daytime animation screens and overwhelms.\u201d So your waking life pulls your real face out of shape, until sleep restores it, if only until morning. I find this idea compelling, even though photos I\u2019ve seen of myself asleep suggest my ancestors wandered around with their mouths wide open, making terrible sounds. There\u2019s surely something in it.</p> <p>And if it was true in Hardy\u2019s day, then it must be a lot truer now. Not because our lives are any more or less stressful; rather that, back then, there were fewer opportunities to curate the look you wanted by seeing what you looked like. I assume that in the 19th century, folk would only rarely get to see themselves \u2013 photographs were scarce, so all they were left to work with was their reflections in mirrors, windows or the odd puddle. And I\u2019m quite sure that even, say, Tess Durbeyfield, on the rare occasions she got the opportunity, did that mirror-face thing when you try to curate the look that most pleases you. Eyes a bit wider, cheeks pulled in, the angle favouring one side or the other \u2013 you know the kind of thing. Think what Tess would be like now, with a smartphone to consult and selfies taken and distributed hour by hour, minute by minute.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the strains of everyday life pulling our faces out of shape: it\u2019s the constantly looking at and adjusting and photographing of our own faces that is doing the job. Or perhaps, in the eye of the beholder, not doing the job. In which case the services of a cosmetic surgeon are sought. I wonder if Hardy\u2019s theory still holds true once you\u2019ve been under the knife. Does sleep still reveal the faces of your ancestors, or has the surgeon severed branches in your facial family tree?</p> <p>Anyway, having resolved to cheer up my severe resting face, I\u2019ve taken the first tentative steps to undo nigh on 58 years of conditioning. Yesterday, I walked along Stourbridge High Street, under the ring road and through the park, trying all the while to keep the corners of my mouth turned up. It felt wrong to me, this half-smile \u2013 rather smug, as if I was conveying that I knew something that pleased me which others weren\u2019t privy to.

Even the dog seemed to notice, making him more hopeful than ever of getting a treat. But my word, my mouth and cheek muscles did start to ache with the effort.

      "body": "<h2><strong>THIS IS ENGLAND</strong></h2> <p>The turnout for Lee Carsley\u2019s leaving drinks isn\u2019t looking all that great. With a viral case of knack spreading through the England squad, eight players have shown this season\u2019s third international break the door marked Do One. It\u2019s allowed the departing interim manager to dish out some resignation honours, with Aston Villa\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/11/trent-alexander-arnold-injury-carsley-england-selection\">Morgan Rogers</a> among a handful of uncapped players plucked out of the under-21s and told by HR, repeatedly, to chuck in a tenner for Carsley\u2019s farewell gift. Don\u2019t forget to sign the card.</p> <p>One man who won\u2019t be pulling out of Carsley\u2019s squad is Southampton\u2019s Taylor Harwood-Bellis, unless he wants his future father-in-law to call him a \u201cBIG BABY!\u201d. Yes, the defender, awaiting his first England cap, is set to become family with Roy Keane. Following Saipan and all that, Keane remained very serious about international commitments during his stint as sidekick to Martin O\u2019Neill with the Republic of Ireland. When asked in 2015 if Robbie Keane (<em>not</em> family) would be good to feature against Germany days after the birth of his son, Roy\u2019s straight-faced response was as old-school as you\u2019d expect: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/06/roy-keane-republic-of-ireland-robbie-keane\">Why wouldn\u2019t he be?</a> He didn\u2019t have the baby, did he? Unless he\u2019s breastfeeding he should be all right.\u201d</p> <p>Harwood-Bellis hails from Stockport, a town continuing to develop a reputation as a footballing hotbed, with Phil Foden, Kobbie Mainoo and Cole Palmer the prized assets. \u201cWe might as well just move Wembley up here,\u201d tooted Stockport Council on the socials after the 22-year-old\u2019s call-up. The area also continues to invite a cliched brand of nickname, with Harwood-Bellis a couple of solid displays away from being labelled the Stockport \u201cinsert legendary Big Cup-winning centre-half\u201d.</p> <p>Finally, Football Daily sends its best wishes to Carsley ahead of his final two fixtures against Greece and the Republic of Ireland. The 50-year-old has probably clocked by now the toxicity of the position he inherited, one that invites manufactured fury if you don\u2019t sing a song, one that\u2019s yours until you\u2019re apparently no good at all because you\u2019ve lost, um, <em>one </em>game after having just a <em>little </em>bit of fun with your starting XI, presumably upsetting the same people who wanted Gareth Southgate to Take the Handbrake Off. Can you blame him for never really knowing whether he wanted the job or not? The loving embrace of the under-21s \u2013 tournament football with a little less jingoism, experimentation without intense scrutiny, a place where he\u2019s already enjoyed significant success \u2013 awaits.</p> <h2><strong>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</strong></h2> <p>Join Sarah Rendell at 8pm GMT for Women\u2019s Big Cup updates on Celtic 1-3 Chelsea.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will enjoy it.

      "bodyText": "THIS IS ENGLAND The turnout for Lee Carsley\u2019s leaving drinks isn\u2019t looking all that great. With a viral case of knack spreading through the England squad, eight players have shown this season\u2019s third international break the door marked Do One. It\u2019s allowed the departing interim manager to dish out some resignation honours, with Aston Villa\u2019s Morgan Rogers among a handful of uncapped players plucked out of the under-21s and told by HR, repeatedly, to chuck in a tenner for Carsley\u2019s farewell gift. Don\u2019t forget to sign the card. One man who won\u2019t be pulling out of Carsley\u2019s squad is Southampton\u2019s Taylor Harwood-Bellis, unless he wants his future father-in-law to call him a \u201cBIG BABY!\u201d. Yes, the defender, awaiting his first England cap, is set to become family with Roy Keane. Following Saipan and all that, Keane remained very serious about international commitments during his stint as sidekick to Martin O\u2019Neill with the Republic of Ireland. When asked in 2015 if Robbie Keane (not family) would be good to feature against Germany days after the birth of his son, Roy\u2019s straight-faced response was as old-school as you\u2019d expect: \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he be? He didn\u2019t have the baby, did he? Unless he\u2019s breastfeeding he should be all right.\u201d Harwood-Bellis hails from Stockport, a town continuing to develop a reputation as a footballing hotbed, with Phil Foden, Kobbie Mainoo and Cole Palmer the prized assets. \u201cWe might as well just move Wembley up here,\u201d tooted Stockport Council on the socials after the 22-year-old\u2019s call-up. The area also continues to invite a cliched brand of nickname, with Harwood-Bellis a couple of solid displays away from being labelled the Stockport \u201cinsert legendary Big Cup-winning centre-half\u201d. Finally, Football Daily sends its best wishes to Carsley ahead of his final two fixtures against Greece and the Republic of Ireland. The 50-year-old has probably clocked by now the toxicity of the position he inherited, one that invites manufactured fury if you don\u2019t sing a song, one that\u2019s yours until you\u2019re apparently no good at all because you\u2019ve lost, um, one game after having just a little bit of fun with your starting XI, presumably upsetting the same people who wanted Gareth Southgate to Take the Handbrake Off. Can you blame him for never really knowing whether he wanted the job or not? The loving embrace of the under-21s \u2013 tournament football with a little less jingoism, experimentation without intense scrutiny, a place where he\u2019s already enjoyed significant success \u2013 awaits. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Sarah Rendell at 8pm GMT for Women\u2019s Big Cup updates on Celtic 1-3 Chelsea. QUOTE OF THE DAY I will enjoy it. It\u2019s going to be in my club with so many people, good weather. Having the opportunity to be, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the first, a professional football player and professional tennis player, just for one game, it\u2019s a privilege\u201d \u2013 Diego Forl\u00e1n is not the first to change his boots for a professional tennis racket, but his appearance this week at the Uruguay Open, an ATP Challenger tournament, will still be notable. The former Manchester United striker chats to our tennis correspondent, Tumaini Carayol. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS Hang on! Re Martin \u00d8degaard saying he\u2019s \u2018listened to my body\u2019 like a 90s pop sensation? No idea what you may be on about regarding the 90s, but isn\u2019t that reference more appropriate for the Prince Classic 1999? Or did you just get slightly confused by the song title? That\u2019s not like you \u2026 oh wait\u201d \u2013 Lochlan MacDonald. Sport in [the USA USA USA], isolationist as it is (World Series, really?), does deliver one huge advantage over the increasingly persecuted fans of European and British football. No international breaks\u201d \u2013 Lindsay Williams. I have the perfect solution for three soon-to-be-vacant jobs: send David Coote to the Match of the Day sofa/chair. Send Gary Lineker to Fenerbahce. Appoint Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as a referee to replace Coote\u201d \u2013 Krishna Moorthy. Send letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

He\u2019s also been in dozens of films and TV shows, including the action series Jack Ryan, as Jack Ryan. And now he\u2019s the sexiest man alive. Who could have known? It\u2019s been a long time coming: he appeared on People\u2019s longlist of sexiest men in 2006, 2009, 2018 and 2019. Again, nothing personal, but isn\u2019t he a bit, erm, hangdog to be considered the sexiest man alive? The choice was not greeted with universal approval. Reactions on social media ranged from \u201cHmmmm, I\u2019m not sure\u201d to \u201cI\u2019m so disappointed it\u2019s not even funny\u201d. Now I feel bad. He\u2019s perfectly nice looking. Some people even compared his triumph to the, er, controversial inclusion of Benny Blanco in the same list. Who on earth is Benny Blanco? We don\u2019t have time for that. Anyway, well done to John Krasinski for his stunning \u2013 if counterintuitive \u2013 victory. If it helps him get a few dates, it will have been worth it. He\u2019s been married to Emily Blunt since 2010. They have two kids. Wow! John\u2019s a bit of a dark horse, isn\u2019t he? No, he isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a consistently successful comic actor, action star, director, writer and producer with four Emmy nominations under his belt. In that case, maybe they should have conferred the title on someone who could have leveraged it a bit. Like Benny Blanco? Maybe, but you\u2019d really have to give me an idea of who exactly he \u2026 I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve told you we can\u2019t get into that right now. Do you mean Benny Blanco from the Bronx? No, that\u2019s a minor character from the 1993 film Carlito\u2019s Way. This Benny Blanco is a highly successful music producer and songwriter who goes out with Selena Gomez. And let me guess: the internet didn\u2019t like that either? Bingo. It\u2019s almost like these \u201csexiest man alive\u201d polls are extremely old fashioned, objectifying, and add nothing to the culture except to annoy people. Almost! Do say: \u201cCheer up, John! It may never happen!\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cYou weren\u2019t even the sexiest man in The Office.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A US intelligence official has been charged with espionage offenses following an investigation into the leak last month of highly classified documents detailing Israel\u2019s plans for military attacks on Iran. Asif W Rahman, who works for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), will appear in court in Guam on Thursday charged with two counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The newspaper said FBI agents arrested Rahman in Cambodia on Tuesday following his indictment last week in federal court in Virginia. In October, the White House said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the unauthorized release of the papers, attributed to the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and National Security Agency, which were published on the Telegram messaging app. The documents related to Israel\u2019s military planning for a retaliatory strike on Iran following the 1 October missile barrage that was Tehran\u2019s largest-ever assault on its regional foe and an escalation of the Middle East conflict sparked by the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel in October 2023. The first document was entitled \u201cIsrael: air force continues preparations for strike on Iran and conducts a second large-force employment exercise\u201d and the second was \u201cIsrael: defense forces continue key munitions preparations and covert UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] activity almost certainly for a strike on Iran\u201d. The NGA gathers and analyzes intelligence from US spy satellites for the defense department. Rahman\u2019s exact connection to the agency is unclear, but court documents show he held a top secret security clearance with access to sensitive compartmentalized information, which is typical for many CIA employees who handle classified materials, the Times reported. His arrest follows the sentencing to a 15-year prison term on Tuesday of the air national guard member Jack Teixeira in a case with striking parallels. Teixeira pleaded guilty earlier this year to six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information, namely highly classified military documents about the war in Ukraine, which he shared on the social media platform Discord. Prosecutors said the leak was \u201cone of the most significant and consequential violations of the Espionage Act in American history\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s the report from the Turin, nose plaster and all. Thanks for your company this afternoon during a very entertaining game. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow \u2013 till then, bye! Time for a plug for Gloucester cathedral and its tennis-court sized stained glass East window. Looking ahead to tonight, the pros don\u2019t give Casper Ruud a prayer against Zverev in prime form, despite his straight-sets defeat of Alcaraz on Monday. What can you do against this?! Laura Robson is analysing Rublev\u2019s performance. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bad performance, the match went down to fine margins. There were a few forehands when he slowed things down a bit and I thought he could have done more of that because just throwing power at Carlos doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Alcaraz is currently hitting pink tennis balls into the delighted crowd after an hour and 36 minutes of a wonderful tennis match. And here he is to talk over the game, nose strip still in place. \u201cI surprised myself with the way I played today from the base line and my serve,\u201d he says. \u201cI tried to forget that I\u2019m not feeling well. Once you step on the court you have to forget everything\u201d \u201cI felt like the last match I couldn\u2019t hit good drops and I was thinking what\u2019s going on. It felt pretty good today \u2013 from the base line running, I had more options to do in the match.\u201d The result means Casper Ruud and Alexander Zverev \u2013 who play later today at about 7.30 GMT \u2013 prance at the top of the John Newcombe Group table, having won one game each. Rublev sits at the bottom with no wins, and Alcaraz \u2013 won one, lost one - is sandwiched in the middle. Alcaraz beats Rublev 6-3, 7-6 (10-8) First point against the serve in the tie-break goes to Alcaraz as Rublev\u2019s double-handed backhand hits the net and he slides (almost) into the splits. He changes his shoes. From 4-1 down, Rublev pulls back to 4-3. What can he do with the Acaraz serve? Oh that\u2019s beautiful \u2013 an amazing rally, Rublev running to the net, leaping but killed by a backhand down the line. Oh \u2013 unexpectedly \u2013 an Alcaraz double fault. We\u2019re back with serve. Rublev draws even, then ahead (6-5) courtesy of a classic pick-up. Set point for Rublev which he \u2026 doesn\u2019t win. From 6-6, Alcaraz serves a 220k ace into the corner for match point\u2026 but Rublev pulls back. Alcaraz then volleys into the net! Rublev 8-7 up. But Alcaraz saves his second set point, then Rublev can\u2019t cope with the brute of Alcaraz\u2019s first serve and its aftermath. Match point for Alcaraz against the Rublev serve \u2013 he clinches it! Second set: Rublev 6-6, 3-6 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server) And so it continues. Eighteen points in a row on serve for Rublev who sends down a succession of bullets. Astonishing against such a wonderful player. So we move to our tie break. Second set: Rublev* 5-6, 3-6 Alcaraz (*denotes next server) Gorgeous tennis from both players, the best of which is an Alcaraz drop shot from nearly the base line to go 40-0 up. A pretty convincing hold. Can Rublev continue his run of brilliant service games to bring us to the first tie-break of the tournament? Second set: Rublev 5-5, 3-6 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server) Scoreboard pressure? Ha! Alcaraz is the first to falter, hitting long on the first point and Rublev goes on to his third love-hold in succession. Not all your way Carlos. Second set: Rublev* 4-5, 3-6 Alcaraz (*denotes next server) Anything you can do\u2026 Alcaraz nearly returns the favour, just spoiling his repertoire with his second double fault of the match. Soon wraps things up though with an exhibition of touch-perfect tennis. Rublev must now keep his nerve to serve to stay in the match. Second set: Rublev 4-4, 3-6 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server) Some banging techno (!) in the mini break as Rublev gets new balls to serve with. He duly scythes through the game to win his second service game on the bounce to love. Second set: Rublev* 3-4, 3-6 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server) A drop-shot-passing shot dummy by Alcaraz for the first point, but a killer return evens things up at 15-15. Rublev is playing good tennis but Alcaraz has hit scintillating: a swinging ace wide followed by one straight down the middle wins the game. Second set: Rublev 3-3, 3-6 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server) A first love-hold of the match for Rublev, whose only chance is to run Alcaraz ragged. Second set: Rublev* 2-3, 3-6 Alcaraz (*denotes next server) A badly-timed delivery man means I only see the last point as Rublev flops a forehand into the net. [But apparently Rublev was 0-30 up and let it slip away] Second set: Rublev 2-2, 3-6 Alcaraz *(*denotes next server) A thrilling game. Rublev takes a sensational opening rally and the tennis continues at that level. Alcaraz pulls back to 30-40 with a peachy backhand and draws level to win another topnotch rally with a pitch perfect forehand. He puts his hand to his ear to acknowledge the crowd.. He can\u2019t quite make a diving forehand and Rublev goes on to win another tight service game and stay in the match. Second set: Rublev* 1-2, 3-6 Alcaraz (*denotes next server) Alcaraz has fine-tuned the robot settings now. Slice, cross court forehand, dinky drop shot. Rublev flaps his long arms around like a frustrated octopus. Second set: Rublev 1-1, 3-6 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server) Rublev fights back from 30-30 with an ace. Throws in another at deuce and closes out the game, and ends the sequence, with a winning forehand. Second set: Rublev* 0-1, 3-6 Alcaraz(*denotes next server) An Alcaraz three-ace trick to start the set. He has now won 15 of the last 19 points. Henman\u2019s verdict on the first set: \u201cAlcaraz\u2019s movement has been good, he looks as if he\u2019s trying to keep the points a little bit shorter and has benefited from some loose shots from Rublev.\u201d First set: Rublev 3-6* Alcaraz (*denotes next server) Suddenly all frustrated arms, and anguished expressions, Rublev is struggling with his forehand. Alcaraz gets a first set point with a whipping forehand and duly collects the first set as Rublev flies long. The players take a break, Rublev disappears to the bathroom having lost four games in a row. Alcaraz seems to be more than coping with his cold. First set: Rublev* 3-5 Alcaraz (*denotes next server) From 0-30 down on his serve, Alcaraz pulls back with a forehand that brings the characteristic muscle squeeze celebration. A 217km serve levels things up. Rublev hits long and kicks the air in frustration as the chance of an immediate break back fades away. He must serve to stay in the set. First set: Rublev 3-4 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server) A high-stakes rally sends the heavy breathing Alcaraz from corner to corner, but a rogue shot, and double fault and Rublev has suddenly fallen back to deuce on his serve. Alcaraz takes advantage and has the first break of serve in his pocket. First set: Rublev* 3-3 Alcaraz (*denotes next server) A screaming cross court forehand to start the game, a leaping fizzer down the line to go ahead, a clever approach to the net to take his service game to love. First set: Rublev 3-2 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server) The full crowd roars as Alcaraz feathers a drop shot to bring him the first break points of the game. Rublev saves one, wrong footing his opponent, and the next as Alcaraz nets a backhand. A back-peddling smash and a big serve ensures Rublev holds. First set: Rublev* 2-2 Alcaraz (*denotes next server) Alcaraz flies through the first three points, Rublev pulls back one but Alcaraz swiftly squashes any hope of a comeback. Rublxv works him through a rally though \u2013 a good tactic against a man not in top health. First set: Rublev 2-1 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server) Lots of corner to corner hitting, neatly inside the lines. Alcaraz is visibly puffing after (winning) a testing rally. Rublev fluffs a backhand to let him back in the game, then Alcaraz a forehand to return the favour. First set: Rublev* 1-1 Alcaraz (*denotes next server) Alcaraz, in lavender shorts and lavender and turquoise T-shirt, starts with an ace. Rublev inches in front with an inside out whippy forehand. We have our first deuce after Alcraraz just overhits a backhand to finish a cracking rally, but he takes the game. First set: Rublev 1-0 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server) Rublev is eager to get going, bouncing around in his trainers waiting for Alcaraz, and whistles through the opening game to 15 before chomping on a banana. And here they come, both players gunning for their first win of the tournament. Alcaraz, with pink nose strip stretched across the bridge of his nose, carrying his racket bag over both shoulders. Rublev with a rakish red headband. He wins the toss and chooses to serve. Ws spot Rublev now in the tunnel, working through a practice shot with his physio, all messy mop of red hair. 2024: Rublev beat an injured Alcaraz in three sets in Madrid. 2023: Alcaraz defeated Rublev in straight sets during last year\u2019s ATP World Tour finals. Much will depend on whether Rublev can keep his head when things go wrong. As he said earlier this week: \u201cWhen my reality doesn\u2019t match my desire I start to panic.\u201d It hasn\u2019t been a bad year for Alcaraz. He\u2019s collected the French Open and Wimbledon titles, Indian Wells, Beijing, plus reaching (if losing) the Olympic final in Paris. He has, though, only pocketed one title since Wimbledon in mid July. And there is Alcaraz himself, rolling around on a mat in headphones, flicking through a few downward dogs in a pair of lavender shorts. News from the Ilie Natase group: Sinner sits on top, followed by Fritz, Medvedev and de Minaur \u2013 with all four still in contention. Alcaraz update: he had an easy-going warm-up this morning, but is \u2013 apparently \u2013 raring to go. Just getting some glorious pictures of Turin on a crisp winter\u2019s day, the Po flowing with feeling. On screen, Tim Henman, Laura Robson and Gigi Salmon are raving about the facilities. Thought Jake Paul turning to boxing was random? How about a pro-footballer dedicating himself to tennis. A lovely piece by Tumaini Carayol on Diego Forl\u00e1n, formerly of Man United, Villarreal, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Inter. Already this morning, the men\u2019s doubles favourites Mate Pavic and Marcelo Arevalo have clocked up a relatively straightforward win against Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden: 7-5, 6-3. While we wait, you were probably wondering who had the best hair in men\u2019s tennis? Hello! We\u2019re deep in the round-robin stages of the ATP finals \u2013 with Carlos Alcaraz and Andrey Rublev due on court about 1pm GMT. Alcaraz was struggling yesterday with illness during practise but the hints are that he\u2019ll be bouncing around the Turin courts with help from another round of antibiotics, a good handful of Vicks and a nasal strip.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a Saturday morning in October and Rouen\u2019s F\u00eate du Ventre \u2013 the festival of the tummy \u2013 is in full swing. The main street, Rue Jeanne d\u2019Arc, is lined with food stalls where red-aproned cheesemongers are proffering cubes of neufch\u00e2tel and camembert cheeses, and cloth-capped charcutiers are pulling great cords of black pudding on to their weighing scales. The aroma of grilled scallops, sizzling burgers and pongy <em>fromage</em> fills the air. Around the corner in the Place du Vieux March\u00e9, a samba band is warming up to march through the streets in celebration of this annual food festival, which this year marked its 25th anniversary.</p> <p>In 2021, Rouen was declared a City of Gastronomy by Unesco in recognition of its commitment to sustainable development, organic agriculture and high-quality food. It\u2019s a badge the city wears with pride, especially this weekend. Market stalls\u2019 awnings and banners are emblazoned with logos and slogans that show how their foods are organic, produced locally and recognised by the government body that protects their geographic origin.</p>    <p>The event is a feast of the senses, and one of many showcases for how deeply the French treasure their <em>gastronomie</em>, despite the ever-encroaching power of global agribusiness and multinational food companies. With myriad systems that ensure that flavours, products, crafts and jobs are protected, there is much that other Europeans can learn about how communities across France celebrate and protect their rich gastronomic culture, from local cooperatives and long-running food festivals to kookier traditions such as the <em>confr\u00e9</em><em>ries </em>(brotherhoods), a system of guilds in which uniformed, medal-wearing veterans conjure attention-grabbing dishes such as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/feb/15/10-best-food-festivals-in-france\">giant omelette for 2,000 people</a>.</p> <p>Here in Normandy, cheese is one of the most prized products. \u201cIt\u2019s important to defend the <em>terroir</em>,\u201d says cheesemonger Daniel Bourgeois in Rouen\u2019s modernist market hall in Place du Vieux March\u00e9. \u201cThe symbol of Normandy is really the cow; it\u2019s not the goat as you find in Poitou-Charentes. It\u2019s the same in Auxerrois or Tarn \u2013 all those are goat regions,\u201d he says gesturing towards the small white cheeses on his counter. </p> <p>For producers in France, the concept of<em> terroir </em>is key; the term \u2013 there is no direct equivalent in English \u2013 is more commonly associated with wine and refers to the specific combination of conditions in which a product grows, an alchemy of topography, geography, soil type and climate. When I was researching my book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/amuse-bouche-9781800810389\">Amuse Bouche: How to Eat Your Way Around France</a>, I explored the origins of hundreds of products that were dependent on a particular <em>terroir</em> for their existence, be it cheese, butter, vegetables, fruit, nuts, poultry or livestock. For every region I spoke to farmers, producers, market stall holders, chefs, cooks and bakers who were all fiercely proud of the <em>terroir</em> and what it meant for the local community \u2013 from putting good food on their plates to providing varied and fulfilling jobs.</p>    <p>Among those preserving Normandy\u2019s food heritage is Pascal Grosdoit, president of the association La Normande \u00e0 la Table des Chefs, which protects the interests of those involved in rearing La Normande, a local breed of cow that provides milk for cheeses and is reared for beef. \u201cThese days, we must ensure we have food autonomy; to be able to provide <em>good</em> food and not just <em>any</em> food,\u201d Grosdoit says. \u201cSo we must look after the treatment of the soil, the quality of the grass, we are obliged to protect farmers\u2019 incomes. We need a whole series of actions to achieve a virtuous model of agriculture and rearing of livestock, one that continues the region\u2019s heritage. We have five departments in Normandy, and each has its own unique character.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to supplying beef to consumers, the association prefers to reach them via butchers, caterers and restaurants, rather than supermarkets. \u201cIn France, we have a large catering sector, so at lunchtime we tend to eat out, whereas in Anglo-Saxon countries, like the UK or the US, there\u2019s more a culture of packed lunches, or takeaway food. In Rouen, we have restaurants.\u201d</p> <p>One of Grosdoit\u2019s key concerns is ensuring the region\u2019s agricultural sector maintains its workforce in order to maintain food security. \u201cWe are living in a period when children don\u2019t necessarily want to take over their families\u2019 farms. The reality is that we lose between 15% and 20% of farmers per year and, with global economic instabilities, if we are not careful we may encounter \u2013 and quite quickly, within four years \u2013 problems around accessing food that is created in good conditions.\u201d</p>    <p>A strong system of cooperatives exists throughout France that serves to protect farmers and food producers from unfair pricing and conditions imposed by large distribution networks, such as supermarkets.

Holding an AOC means that a product has been grown or created in a specific geographical area, where the <em>terroir</em> is key to its flavour. The government body responsible for awarding the AOC (and other protective labels such as the IGP, <em>indication </em><em>g\u00e9ographique </em><em>prot\u00e9g\u00e9e</em>) is the Institut National de l\u2019Origine et de la Qualit\u00e9 (Inao). Its director is Carole Ly, who tells me there are some 1,200 protected French products, including wine, cheese, meat, fruit and vegetables and even a specific kind of hay that is grown on Crau plain in the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne department (it is not intended for human consumption but many Michelin-starred chefs use it in cooking).</p> <p>\u201cThis policy was put in place in the 1930s, after many kinds of fake wine were being produced in the 1910s,\u201d says Ly, referring to the way bottles would be sold as Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape, for example, when the grapes within were grown elsewhere. Location of origin isn\u2019t the only criterion: in order to gain protected AOC designation, the producers must also adhere to rules relating to production methods.</p> <p>As we chat, Ly\u2019s colleague Raphael Bitton, Inao\u2019s communication manager, adds, \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the AOC or AOP isn\u2019t a \u2018brand\u2019. It\u2019s a name that doesn\u2019t belong to anyone but is shared by the producers.\u201d Which means established producers cannot prevent anyone else from using the label, so long as they fulfil all the relevant criteria.</p> <p>In France, approximately one farm in three produces at least one of these AOC-designated products, says Ly. Importantly, the system also helps members of rural communities to stay working on the land. \u201cIf the farmers did not have such recognition of these products, which are often sold at a higher price point, they would not have been able to compete against more productive areas. And we have consumers who know how to recognise these regional products, which form part of the French culinary heritage,\u201d she says.</p>    <p>Though there are thousands of producers who work within their AOC\u2019s criteria, there are others who want to work outside them \u2013 either because they believe the rules hamper innovation or are too strict or arbitrary, or because they want to distinguish themselves from the mass-production methods by which some AOP-listed products are made (by a large cooperative, say, or a multinational corporation). On Rouen\u2019s Rue Jeanne d\u2019Arc, for example, I meet Bruno Lefebvre, a cheese producer who has decided not to be part of the AOP for neufch\u00e2tel, one of Normandy\u2019s four AOP-listed cheeses. Yet his heart-shaped, white bloom-rind coeur de normande looks identical.</p> <p>\u201cI think the AOP for neufch\u00e2tel has lost something,\u201d he says, pointing out that 70% of this cheese is made by the Groupe Lactalis, a French multinational. \u201cMy cheese represents a family-run farm and tradition. All our cheeses are made by hand, with 100% milk from La Normande \u2013 others are only 60 to 80%.</p> <p>\u201cWe spent 20 years making neufch\u00e2tel but we reached a point [in 2019] where we didn\u2019t have large enough pastures right next to the farm; our pastures are a little further away. So, short of killing my neighbours to enlarge my farm,\u201d he laughs, \u201cthere was nothing I could do but leave the AOP. We sell through the markets and people are starting to recognise coeur de normande, and so we\u2019re getting a bit of notoriety. I have the freedom to make my cheese and my brand.\u201d</p> <p>As well as official channels that classify and protect foods, there exist throughout France more informal networks, such as the <em>confr\u00e9ries</em>. They generally consist of members of the community working in some way with the product in question \u2013 farmers, restaurateurs or simply those who are passionate about protecting its heritage.

Every Easter Monday, the town of Bessi\u00e8res, near Toulouse, hosts the Festival of the Giant Omelette. Here, the brotherhood (and their willing helpers), dressed in chef\u2019s whites with accents of yellow, crack 15,000 eggs into a four-metre (13ft) frying pan and stir them up with oars, before serving up to 5,000 festival-goers a plate of omelette (more like scrambled eggs) and bread.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a Saturday morning in October and Rouen\u2019s F\u00eate du Ventre \u2013 the festival of the tummy \u2013 is in full swing. The main street, Rue Jeanne d\u2019Arc, is lined with food stalls where red-aproned cheesemongers are proffering cubes of neufch\u00e2tel and camembert cheeses, and cloth-capped charcutiers are pulling great cords of black pudding on to their weighing scales. The aroma of grilled scallops, sizzling burgers and pongy fromage fills the air. Around the corner in the Place du Vieux March\u00e9, a samba band is warming up to march through the streets in celebration of this annual food festival, which this year marked its 25th anniversary. In 2021, Rouen was declared a City of Gastronomy by Unesco in recognition of its commitment to sustainable development, organic agriculture and high-quality food. It\u2019s a badge the city wears with pride, especially this weekend. Market stalls\u2019 awnings and banners are emblazoned with logos and slogans that show how their foods are organic, produced locally and recognised by the government body that protects their geographic origin. The event is a feast of the senses, and one of many showcases for how deeply the French treasure their gastronomie, despite the ever-encroaching power of global agribusiness and multinational food companies. With myriad systems that ensure that flavours, products, crafts and jobs are protected, there is much that other Europeans can learn about how communities across France celebrate and protect their rich gastronomic culture, from local cooperatives and long-running food festivals to kookier traditions such as the confr\u00e9ries (brotherhoods), a system of guilds in which uniformed, medal-wearing veterans conjure attention-grabbing dishes such as a giant omelette for 2,000 people. Here in Normandy, cheese is one of the most prized products. \u201cIt\u2019s important to defend the terroir,\u201d says cheesemonger Daniel Bourgeois in Rouen\u2019s modernist market hall in Place du Vieux March\u00e9. \u201cThe symbol of Normandy is really the cow; it\u2019s not the goat as you find in Poitou-Charentes. It\u2019s the same in Auxerrois or Tarn \u2013 all those are goat regions,\u201d he says gesturing towards the small white cheeses on his counter. For producers in France, the concept of terroir is key; the term \u2013 there is no direct equivalent in English \u2013 is more commonly associated with wine and refers to the specific combination of conditions in which a product grows, an alchemy of topography, geography, soil type and climate. When I was researching my book Amuse Bouche: How to Eat Your Way Around France, I explored the origins of hundreds of products that were dependent on a particular terroir for their existence, be it cheese, butter, vegetables, fruit, nuts, poultry or livestock. For every region I spoke to farmers, producers, market stall holders, chefs, cooks and bakers who were all fiercely proud of the terroir and what it meant for the local community \u2013 from putting good food on their plates to providing varied and fulfilling jobs. Among those preserving Normandy\u2019s food heritage is Pascal Grosdoit, president of the association La Normande \u00e0 la Table des Chefs, which protects the interests of those involved in rearing La Normande, a local breed of cow that provides milk for cheeses and is reared for beef. \u201cThese days, we must ensure we have food autonomy; to be able to provide good food and not just any food,\u201d Grosdoit says. \u201cSo we must look after the treatment of the soil, the quality of the grass, we are obliged to protect farmers\u2019 incomes. We need a whole series of actions to achieve a virtuous model of agriculture and rearing of livestock, one that continues the region\u2019s heritage. We have five departments in Normandy, and each has its own unique character.\u201d When it comes to supplying beef to consumers, the association prefers to reach them via butchers, caterers and restaurants, rather than supermarkets. \u201cIn France, we have a large catering sector, so at lunchtime we tend to eat out, whereas in Anglo-Saxon countries, like the UK or the US, there\u2019s more a culture of packed lunches, or takeaway food. In Rouen, we have restaurants.\u201d One of Grosdoit\u2019s key concerns is ensuring the region\u2019s agricultural sector maintains its workforce in order to maintain food security. \u201cWe are living in a period when children don\u2019t necessarily want to take over their families\u2019 farms. The reality is that we lose between 15% and 20% of farmers per year and, with global economic instabilities, if we are not careful we may encounter \u2013 and quite quickly, within four years \u2013 problems around accessing food that is created in good conditions.\u201d A strong system of cooperatives exists throughout France that serves to protect farmers and food producers from unfair pricing and conditions imposed by large distribution networks, such as supermarkets. In the department of Aveyron in the 1960s, for example, the Jeunes Montagnes cooperative saved Laguiole cheese from extinction and put the dish aligot (a gloriously stringy cheesy mashed potato) back on menus throughout the country. On the island of Noirmoutier, off France\u2019s west coast, the potato farmers\u2019 cooperative was hugely successful in marketing its delicious new-season potatoes in the 1990s, so much so that growers of jersey royal potatoes came to learn from them. \u201cThe cooperatives and their farmers can effectively create brands and develop commercial concepts,\u201d says Grosdoit. \u201cUltimately, it is also a good form of economic model: the value still partly returns to the producers.\u201d Many of France\u2019s cooperatives are centred on a product that is protected by the appellation d\u2019origine control\u00e9e (AOC) designation (many also hold the appellation d\u2019origine prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, AOP, awarded by the EU). Holding an AOC means that a product has been grown or created in a specific geographical area, where the terroir is key to its flavour.

Treasury estimations suggest only 28% of farms will be hit by a tax bill when the owner dies, but Defra\u2019s figures suggest it could be as high as 66%.</p>    <p>Zeichner said that government was convening with experts to see \u201cwhy the numbers are so different\u201d and \u201cwhat this will look like going ahead\u201d but added there will be no change to the budget.</p> <p>He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are not going to see any change to the budget. So what has disappointed me is that people have jumped to a series of extrapolations as to what will happen, rather than looking at the actual figures, what\u2019s actually been happening. I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s a huge discrepancy in the figures from the actual claims on estates which the Treasury has administered increased in recent years, and some of the figures that others are using, and our officials are working on that, because there must be reasons why there are those discrepancies.</p> </blockquote> <p>Zeichner added that there is \u201cno magic money tree,\u201d and reiterated that there will be no changes to the inheritance tax threshold despite the anger from farmers. </p> <p><strong>Thousands of people plan to descend on Westminster next week in a protest against the changes which they say will cause family farms to be sold off to pay inheritance tax bills.</strong> </p> <p><strong>Amazon Prime</strong> star <strong>Jeremy Clarkso</strong>n is due to speak at the event as are some political figures yet to be confirmed.</p> <p>On the EU, Zeichner said the UK will not be realigning with the EU\u2019s standards to reduce trade friction: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This government has said that we want to renegotiate or improve our relationship with our near neighbours, the European Union. But quite a lot of the regulatory systems we have inherited are now beginning to diverge and just not through choice, but just because time is passing. And I very much appreciate the fact that for exporters, that poses potential challenges. Now, without going over the debate from the past, we are where we are, but I am charged by <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> with working with others to try and negotiate an improved veterinary agreement, and we will be trying to achieve that. </p> <p>We must also respect the choice of British people made the referendum. It wasn\u2019t my choice but that choice was made, and there are advantages, as we\u2019ve seen, in terms of the fact that we\u2019ve been able to move much more quickly on precision breeding.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6734a6f28f0848dfcb79a944\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jasper-jolly\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-13T13:22:08.662Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Babcock expects higher military spending globally with Trump elected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The chief executive of the UK defence company <strong>Babcock</strong> has said that he expects countries around the world to maintain or increase military spending after the election of <strong>Donald Trump</strong> as US president.</p> <p><strong>David Lockwood</strong> said that he expected \u201call countries at least sustaining and maybe increasing\u201d defence budgets, partly in response to pressure from Trump on the US\u2019s Nato allies.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When President Trump was around first time, if you ignored the rhetoric for his domestic audience, his message to Nato members was \u2018I expect you to spend\u2019 [what was committed].</p> </blockquote> <p>Nato members are committed by treaty to spend the equivalent of 2% of GDP on military budgets.

The faults were spotted during an audit, after which Opus reported itself to the regulator. </p> <p>These two faults led to 87,825 customers being overcharged between 2003 and 2023. While 93% of accounts were overcharged by less than \u00a350, one customer, who has since been refunded, overpaid \u00a3102,000. </p> <p>Opus has since resolved the technical faults and will pay \u00a35.5m in refunds to affected customers. An additional \u00a31.56m will be paid in goodwill and redress payments. The supplier has committed not to claw back money from customers who were undercharged as a result of the system faults. </p> <p>It has identified all affected accounts and has processed refunds automatically for current customers. Former customers will be contacted to receive refunds where the amount is \u00a32.50 or more. Any unclaimed refunds and refunds below \u00a32.50 will be paid to the Energy Redress Fund.

 <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain\u2019s financial watchdog is pressing the Supreme Court to speed up a decision to permit lenders to appeal a crucial judgment that may pave the way for a multi-billion pound consumer compensation scheme linked to car finance commissions.</p> <p>The <strong>Financial Conduct Authority</strong> (FCA) said it would also consult on extending the time firms

the customer\u2019s informed consent.</p> <p>It is the latest twist in a slow-burning probe into banks\u2019 sales practices in past years that analysts estimate could cost the industry up to

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap things up. A key measure of US inflation has risen for the first time since March, underlining its bumpy ride down to lower levels. The consumer price index (CPI), which measures price growth across a basket of goods, ticked up to an annual pace of 2.6% in October \u2013 from 2.4% in September, which had been the slowest rate in more than three years. Stripping out volatile food and energy costs, the closely watched \u201ccore\u201d inflation index held firm at 3.3%. The reading was in line with economists\u2019 expectations. Though inflation has fallen dramatically since peaking at a four-decade high in summer 2022, many Americans are still under pressure after years of price increases. Frustration over the cost of living appeared to play a major role in the election, with exit polls indicating that the majority of Republican voters were frustrated with the US economy and their financial situation. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump proffered tax cuts and tariffs as solutions, but questions have been raised about what such policies will actually mean for inflation. The president-elect has pledged to enact tariffs of at least 10% on all US imports, a policy that many economists say would probably lead to inflation going up as much as 5.1%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in four years in September, a key turning point in its battle to bring down inflation. It lowered rates again last week, to their lowest level since February 2023. At a press conference, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said the central bank \u201chas gained confidence that we\u2019re on a sustainable path down to 2%\u201d, its target for inflation, but added: \u201cThe job\u2019s not done.\u201d The Fed has been trying to carry out its \u201cdual mandate\u201d, managing price increases without triggering higher rates of unemployment. The Post Office plans to close more than 100 branches and says about 2,000 jobs are at risk in a move that has been condemned by unions as \u201ctone deaf and immoral\u201d after the Horizon IT scandal. Our other main stories: Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Take care \u2013 JK Here\u2019s our full story on US inflation: Germany\u2019s BioNTech has struck a $950m deal to buy Biotheus, a Chinese developer of cancer drugs, as it seeks to strengthen its oncology portfolio. Biotheus specialises in a type of immunotherapies to treat cancer that could outperform US drugmaker Merck\u2019s blockbuster cancer treatment Keytruda. Mainz-based BioNTech, which became known around the world for developing one of the first Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic when it partnered up with Pfizer, will pay $800m upfront to Biotheus, which is based in Guangdong province, followed by milestone payments of up to $150m. With the acquisition, BioNTech obtains full global rights to a treatment in late-stage clinical trials called BNT327/PM8002. Studies have shown \u201cencouraging clinical activity in various tumour types\u201d including in patients who have been less responsive to current, so-called checkpoint inhibitor treatments, the firm said in a statement. The acquisition is the latest by a western drugmaker seeking to tap into innovation in China. Britain\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca bought another Chinese cancer specialist, Gracell Biotechnologies for up to $1.2bn last December. Gracell is focused on a type of cancer therapy known as CAR-T that modifies a patient\u2019s cells to fight the disease. Prof. Ugur Sahin, chief executive and co-founder of BioNTech, said: We believe that BNT327/PM8002 has the potential to set a new standard of care in multiple oncology indications, surpassing traditional checkpoint inhibitors. Xiaolin Liu, president, chief executive and co-founder of Biotheus, said: We are thrilled to deepen our bond with BioNTech. We share the goal of advancing the development of BNT327/PM8002 for future combination therapies in the fight against cancer. The third consecutive 0.3% month-on-month gain in the core consumer prices index in October is not too concerning, said Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics. However, he warned that with the incoming Trump administration seemingly intent on imposing import tariffs relatively quickly, the return of inflation to the 2% target may prove short-lived. Food prices went up by 2.1% year-on-year last month while energy costs fell by 4.9%, the breakdown of the latest US inflation figures showed. Inflation in the US has fallen sharply since reaching a peak of more than 9.1% in June 2022, but progress has slowed in recent months. Gerrit Smit, manager of the Stonehage Fleming Global Best Ideas Equity fund, said: The marginal increase in headline US inflation to 2.6% is as generally expected. Barring any potential tariff effects later on, investors can rest assured that the Federal Reserve does not need to reconsider their easing pathway. Chief market strategist Charlie Bilello noted: German economic journalist Holger Zsch\u00e4pitz posted this chart on X: US inflation is bang in line with forecasts: the headline annual rate has picked up slightly to 2.6% in October from 2.4% in September. The core rate \u2013 which strips out volatile items like food and energy \u2013 held at 3.3% last month, still a bit high for the Federal Reserve\u2019s liking. The data, released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, will be closely watched by the Fed, which has cut interest rates by 0.75 percentage points over two meetings to a target range of 4.5% to 4.75%. Market analyst Jesse Cohen said: The dollar is hovering near a six and a half month peak against other major currencies, ahead of the US inflation data, out in a couple of minutes. UK farming minister Daniel Zeichner has been speaking at the Agricultural Industries Confederation conference. He has been addressing farmers\u2019 concerns about inheritance tax and the re-election of Donald Trump, who is said to want a free trade deal with the UK that would inevitably include cheap agricultural products \u2013 food and drink \u2013 which could undercut UK farmers. Zeichner said of a Trump trade deal: At the moment, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but our view, and I think it\u2019s it is sensible view to take, is that we will always pursue the national interest of this country, He added that he was pleased the government recently agreed a deal to export beetroot to the US. He told the room there would be no changes to the threshold at which farms will be subject to inheritance tax. Treasury estimations suggest only 28% of farms will be hit by a tax bill when the owner dies, but Defra\u2019s figures suggest it could be as high as 66%. Zeichner said that government was convening with experts to see \u201cwhy the numbers are so different\u201d and \u201cwhat this will look like going ahead\u201d but added there will be no change to the budget. He said: We are not going to see any change to the budget. So what has disappointed me is that people have jumped to a series of extrapolations as to what will happen, rather than looking at the actual figures, what\u2019s actually been happening. I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s a huge discrepancy in the figures from the actual claims on estates which the Treasury has administered increased in recent years, and some of the figures that others are using, and our officials are working on that, because there must be reasons why there are those discrepancies. Zeichner added that there is \u201cno magic money tree,\u201d and reiterated that there will be no changes to the inheritance tax threshold despite the anger from farmers. Thousands of people plan to descend on Westminster next week in a protest against the changes which they say will cause family farms to be sold off to pay inheritance tax bills. Amazon Prime star Jeremy Clarkson is due to speak at the event as are some political figures yet to be confirmed. On the EU, Zeichner said the UK will not be realigning with the EU\u2019s standards to reduce trade friction: This government has said that we want to renegotiate or improve our relationship with our near neighbours, the European Union. But quite a lot of the regulatory systems we have inherited are now beginning to diverge and just not through choice, but just because time is passing. And I very much appreciate the fact that for exporters, that poses potential challenges. Now, without going over the debate from the past, we are where we are, but I am charged by Keir Starmer with working with others to try and negotiate an improved veterinary agreement, and we will be trying to achieve that. We must also respect the choice of British people made the referendum. It wasn\u2019t my choice but that choice was made, and there are advantages, as we\u2019ve seen, in terms of the fact that we\u2019ve been able to move much more quickly on precision breeding. The chief executive of the UK defence company Babcock has said that he expects countries around the world to maintain or increase military spending after the election of Donald Trump as US president. David Lockwood said that he expected \u201call countries at least sustaining and maybe increasing\u201d defence budgets, partly in response to pressure from Trump on the US\u2019s Nato allies. When President Trump was around first time, if you ignored the rhetoric for his domestic audience, his message to Nato members was \u2018I expect you to spend\u2019 [what was committed]. Nato members are committed by treaty to spend the equivalent of 2% of GDP on military budgets. Some of the allies have not hit that target for several decades, but the combination of pressure from the US and Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has prompted many countries to reassess their plans. \u201cAn unstable world is unfortunately good for defence budgets,\u201d said Lockwood, speaking as Babcock announced an increase in operating profits for the six months to the end of September. Babcock, a member of the FTSE 250 index, has recovered from a period of turmoil to earn a steady stream of profits. It runs large parts of the UK\u2019s defence operations, including training programmes and maintenance of the UK\u2019s nuclear submarine fleet. He said that the submarine infrastructure \u201cdefinitely didn\u2019t get the money it deserved\u201d during the period of relative geopolitical calm around the turn of the century. \u201cThere is definitely a need for the recapitalisation\u201d of Devonport, where Babcock maintains the nuclear fleet, Lockwood said. He added that the upgrade work at Devonport has been tricky while also doing work on the fleet, but insisted that previous regulatory concerns had now been addressed. He said: The Office for Nuclear Regulation would describe themselves as content with how we\u2019re running Devonport. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said about Homebase\u2019s woes: It\u2019s been tough going in the home renovation market, as consumers have tightened their belts amid high borrowing costs. Even though interest rates have begun to come down, homeowners have been ultra cautious, with bigger ticket items hard to shift. Some consumers appear to have been ring-fencing spending for holidays and experiences rather than major makeovers. Although a spurt of better weather later in the summer is likely to have helped propel sales of seasonal ranges, any improvement will have just been a sticking plaster on deeper rooted issues at Homebase. In the DIY space it\u2019s faced tough competition from the likes of Kingfisher owned B&amp;Q and Wickes which have also faced challenges in the market, but recently revealed guidance showing improvements. If the price is right though, shoppers are willing to splash the cash and value orientated chains like B&amp;M European Value Retail and Home Bargains have been faring better. The Range appears to have found a recipe for success with its pile \u2018em high, sell \u2018em cheaper approach to homewares, and appears to be mulling expanding its footprint by taking a chunk of Homebase stores. The future for others remains uncertain, although there may be other takers in the \u2018value\u2019 end of the home market, who could swoop in with a cut-price offer. Thousands of workers at the Homebase DIY chain face uncertainty over their future amid reports that the retailer is close to appointing administrators, with homeware specialist The Range poised to snap up some of its stores. Homebase is expected to appoint Teneo to handle an insolvency process for its UK arm, which has about 130 stores. The Range is reportedly planning to buy up to 75 Homebase stores including its Irish branches in a pre-pack sale, saving close to 1,500 jobs, as first reported by Sky News. However, the future of some further 1,700 staff is uncertain with its remaining shops at risk of closure. The deal with The Range is expected to be announced later today and Teneo is expected to run a sales process for the remaining stores. Employees may be transferred to any new owner \u2013 if their store remains open. Homebase has been under pressure to win shoppers for some time, and its parent group HHGL made a loss of \u00a385m in the year to January 2023, against an annual profit of nearly \u00a356m a year earlier, after an 11% drop in sales. Homebase\u2019s current owner, the turnaround specialist Hilco, reportedly put the chain back on the market this spring, six years after it bought it for \u00a31 from the Australian retail group Wesfarmers in 2018. An Opus Energy spokesperson said: Due to a historical fault in a billing system, regrettably some non-domestic customers received inaccurate bills during the period 2003 \u2013 2023. Opus Energy identified this issue and self-reported it to Ofgem in December 2023 and has been working closely with the regulator since. We are forgoing any money owed to us by customers we undercharged and are repaying those who were overcharged the money owed to them including an uplift to reflect inflation, alongside an additional goodwill payment. Opus Energy is also making a voluntary contribution to Ofgem\u2019s Energy Industry Voluntary Redress Scheme that will benefit charities and community projects that help vulnerable customers with energy-related support. The fault in the billing system pre-dated Drax Group\u2019s acquisition of Opus Energy in 2017. Opus Energy has agreed to pay more than \u00a37m in refunds, redress and goodwill payments after the regulator Ofgem found that the company overcharged almost 88,000 business customers over two decades. The company, which has been supplying businesses with renewable energy since 2002, had two faults in its billing system, meaning customers were temporarily on the wrong tariff, or their billing periods were incorrectly duplicated. The faults were spotted during an audit, after which Opus reported itself to the regulator. These two faults led to 87,825 customers being overcharged between 2003 and 2023. While 93% of accounts were overcharged by less than \u00a350, one customer, who has since been refunded, overpaid \u00a3102,000. Opus has since resolved the technical faults and will pay \u00a35.5m in refunds to affected customers. An additional \u00a31.56m will be paid in goodwill and redress payments. The supplier has committed not to claw back money from customers who were undercharged as a result of the system faults. It has identified all affected accounts and has processed refunds automatically for current customers. Former customers will be contacted to receive refunds where the amount is \u00a32.50 or more. Any unclaimed refunds and refunds below \u00a32.50 will be paid to the Energy Redress Fund. Accounts still supplied by Opus Energy have already been refunded. Opus was bought by Drax, which owns the UK\u2019s biggest renewable power plant, in 2017. Jacqui Gehrmann, deputy director of retail compliance at Ofgem, said: All energy consumers should be able to trust their supplier to provide accurate bills and charge them only what they owe. While things can go wrong, we expect suppliers to identify issues quickly. So, it\u2019s concerning that these billing issues weren\u2019t spotted sooner. Many businesses have struggled with the high cost of energy in recent years. Any instance of a customer overpaying, no matter how small, is unacceptable. We\u2019ve worked closely with Opus Energy in recent months to ensure the issues are rectified, and that customers affected are refunded and compensated swiftly. Bank of England policy maker Catherine Mann has warned of upward pressures on inflation in the UK. The American economist, who voted against last week\u2019s interest rate cut, said There are some possibilities about downward pressure on inflation coming from export prices coming out of China, for example. But against that ... one piece of news that is downward bias, the rest of it is upward bias, and likely to be more volatile going forward over the medium term. High US tariffs on imports from China by president-elect Donald Trump might lead to more Chinese goods heading to Europe at discounted prices, analysts have said. Mann said energy prices were more likely to rise than fall and highlighted \u201cpretty sticky\u201d services price inflation in Britain. She was speaking on the Female Central Bankers panel organised by BNP Paribas\u2019 Global Markets. She was the only member of the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee who voted against cutting borrowing costs last Thursday, when Bank Rate was lowered to 4.75% from 5%. The central bank said after last week\u2019s announcement that Mann wanted to wait to see the impact of the Labour' government\u2019s first budget and increase in the national minimum wage, which she thought could boost overall wage growth and businesses\u2019 pricing power. In lighter news, here\u2019s a round-up of this year\u2019s top Christmas toys. A \u201cfart blaster\u201d with a repertoire of 15 sounds that blasts \u201cfog fart rings\u201d and a waddling mother duck are among the toys destined to appear on Christmas lists as experts predict a \u201crecord-breaking\u201d year for sales. At \u00a330, the Despicable Me 4 spin-off toy promises to be a talking point on Christmas Day. It comes with two scents: banana and \u201cfart\u201d. Mercifully, on a day when the nation eats Brussels sprouts, the latter smells more like burnt popcorn. With the cost of living crisis in the background of yet another year\u2019s celebrations, the Toy Retailers Association\u2019s annual DreamToys list of the 20 \u201chottest toys\u201d includes 14 under \u00a350. Compiled by an independent panel it provides a crib sheet for shoppers seeking both value for money and play value. Whereas previous lists included sets costing well over \u00a3100, this year\u2019s priciest is FurReal\u2019s interactive pet monkey, Peanut, at \u00a380. Paul Reader, the chair of the selection committee, said it was \u201cvery conscious\u201d of the level of disposable income people had. Parents are spending a little bit more on toys but not looking for one iconic item. At the COP29 climate summit, the mood is gloomy. There is \u201cno sign\u201d of the transition away from burning fossil fuels that was pledged by the world\u2019s nations a year ago, with 2024 on track to set another new record for global carbon emissions. The new data, released at the UN\u2019s Cop29 climate conference in Azerbaijan, indicates that the planet-heating emissions from coal, oil and gas will rise by 0.8% in 2024. In stark contrast, emissions have to fall by 43% by 2030 for the world to have any chance of keeping to the 1.5C temperature target and limiting \u201cincreasingly dramatic\u201d climate impacts on people around the globe. The world\u2019s nations agreed at Cop28 in Dubai in 2023 to \u201ctransition away\u201d from fossil fuels, a decision hailed as a landmark given that none of the previous 27 summits had called for restrictions on the primary cause of global heating. On Monday, the Cop28 president, Sultan Al Jaber, told the summit in Baku: History will judge us by our actions, not by our words. The Post Office plans to close 115 branches and says about 2,000 jobs are at risk as part of a plan that will see post office operator pay increase by \u00a3250m over the next five years. The Post Office confirmed today that it is seeking to offload 115 branches that it centrally owns, known as crown post offices, but said it expects to maintain the total network at 11,500 branches across the UK. The plans come against the backdrop of the public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal, described as one of the worst miscarriages of justice in UK history. The move puts approximately 1,000 jobs at risk although the Post Office expects that all the branches will be refranchised to new owners over the next five years. About 2,000 branches are operated by partners such as Tesco, WHSmith and Morrisons and about 9,000 are operated by independent subpostmasters that have a contract with the Post Office. The Post Office is also \u201cstreamlining\u201d its central operations with speculation that this will lead to about 1,000 further job cuts. The plans also include increasing post office branch owner remuneration by \u00a3250m annually by 2030, with up to \u00a3120m in additional remuneration by the end of the first year of the five-year plan, a 30% increase in revenue share. \u201cThe Post Office has a 360-year history of public service and today we want to secure that service for the future by learning from past mistakes and moving forward for the benefit of all postmasters,\u201d said Nigel Railton, the chair of the Post Office. \u201cWe can, and will, restore pride in working for a business with a legacy of service, rather than one of scandal.\u201d Britain\u2019s financial watchdog is pressing the Supreme Court to speed up a decision to permit lenders to appeal a crucial judgment that may pave the way for a multi-billion pound consumer compensation scheme linked to car finance commissions. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it would also consult on extending the time firms have to respond to complaints from borrowers, after the Court of Appeal in October ruled it was unlawful for car dealers to receive a commission from banks providing motor finance without obtaining the customer\u2019s informed consent. It is the latest twist in a slow-burning probe into banks\u2019 sales practices in past years that analysts estimate could cost the industry up to \u00a316bn, in what could become Britain\u2019s costliest consumer banking scandal since the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal. Since the October judgment, the FCA said it has undertaken extensive industry engagement and found that firms are likely to receive a high volume of complaints. A complaint extension would allow them to prevent \u201cdisorderly, inconsistent and inefficient outcomes\u201d for consumers making complaints, motor finance firms and the market, the watchdog said. The FCA is investigating whether there was widespread misconduct related to discretionary commission arrangements, or DCAs, before they were banned in 2021. It wants to uncover whether consumers have lost out and what compensation they should get. It urged firms today to consider whether they should make financial provisions for resolving complaints. As part of its review, the FCA already granted motor finance firms and consumers more time to handle or make complaints where a DCA was involved. The FTSE index of UK banks rose by 0.77% this morning, outperforming the broader FTSE 100 index which is up by 0.3%. Lloyds Banking Group shares rose by 1.7%. The growing scrutiny has weighed heavily on some lenders\u2019 share prices this year, with Close Brothers, which is heavily involved in car finance, slumping by 75%. It is down by 0.6% today. Analysts at Jefferies said yesterday that redress could cost Lloyds \u00a32.5bn if the bank is required to repay all commissions from 2007-2020. Lloyds has already set aside \u00a3450m. Anglian Water has partnered with a UK AI tech company called nPlan to tackle storm overflow infrastructure. The water industry is under pressure to improve its poor record on storm overflows and sewage spills. Anglian said that nPlan\u2019s Predictive AI and dataset of 750,000 past project plans will enable the utility to spot systemic risks within its portfolio of infrastructure projects and tackle them before they delay key projects, and identify opportunities to accelerate the delivery of multiple projects at once. Ofwat, the regulator, is trebling the amount of cash water companies get to upgrade infrastructure \u2013 but that increases the risk of wastage. Anglian says nPlan will enable it to ramp up large-scale project works without harming productivity. Here\u2019s our full story on Thames Water: Thames Water has gained support from its top-ranking creditors to proceed to the next stage of securing a \u00a33bn emergency funding package intended to stave off its collapse for at least a year. The struggling utility company said on Wednesday that 75% of the holders of its least risky loans \u2013 known as class A debt \u2013 had backed a plan to extend the cash lifeline, the minimum threshold to needed to receive court approval for changes to its debts. Thames faces the prospect of a temporary nationalisation if it ultimately collapses, and the emergency funding would help the company avoid a short-term cash crunch. The support will smooth the path for court hearings to decide whether to approve the deal to take place. Grocery sales growth slowed across the UK last month as shoppers save their cash ahead of Christmas, and wait for Black Friday promotions, according to industry figures. Market researchers NIQ said UK supermarket sales rose by 4% in the four weeks to 2 November, down from the 4.7% growth in September. Mike Watkins, NIQ\u2019s UK head of retailer and business insight, said: Shoppers so far have been cautious and it\u2019s evident that they are saving on grocery essentials to be able to afford treats and indulgences. He said the UK has \u201ca polarised consumer\u201d \u2013 with half of households still feeling pressure on their finances. Sales volumes of clothes and other general merchandise fell by 5.5%. Yesterday, retail analysts Kantar said October was the biggest grocery sales month so far this year, with sales increasing by 2.3% year-on-year to \u00a311.6bn. The takeaway delivery firm Just Eat Takeaway is selling Grubhub to delivery-focused restaurant chain Wonder in a deal valued at $650m (\u00a3510m) \u2013 just four years after buying the US-app in a multi-billion dollar tie-up following the the first Covid lockdowns. Netherlands-based Just Eat, which is Europe\u2019s largest meal delivery firm, had been looking to offload its US unit since as early as 2022, as the pandemic boost faded and it grappled with tough competition. Wonder is a New York City-based chain of fast casual restaurants, led by former Walmart executive and serial entrepreneur Marc Lore. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, provided it receives the usual regulatory approvals, and Just Eat said it would retain no material liabilities associated with Grubhub. Just Eat bought Grubhub in a $7.3bn deal agreed in June 2020, which was aimed at creating the world\u2019s largest food delivery service outside China. The tie-up was aimed at giving Just Eat access to the lucrative food delivery market in the US, with the combined business able to serve customers in 25 countries. At the time, Uber was reportedly also holding talks with Grubhub, as the food delivery sector boomed during the pandemic. However, Just Eat executives came under pressure from investors after the boost from pandemic-era food deliveries began to fade as economies reopened following pandemic lockdowns, and its shares began to slide. Just Eat shares are trading some 90% lower than at their peak, reached in October 2020. Another utility, the power generator and network operator SSE, has reported a 26% increase in first-half profits, lifted by a strong performance of its electricity networks and renewables businesses. Its chief executive of more than 11 years, Alistair Phillips-Davies, will stand down next year, and will remain in post until a successor is appointed. He said: We are encouraged by the increasing attractiveness of our main markets and our alignment with the new UK government\u2019s mission to achieve clean power by 2030. The Perth-based company posted an adjusted pre-tax profit of \u00a3714.5m for the six months to 30 September, and stuck to its annual profit forecast. Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: SSE\u2019s powering along nicely and should continue thanks to the foundations built by group CEO Alistair Philips-Davies. But after 11 years in the power seat, he\u2019s announced his intention to step down once a successor is found. Turning to business performance, and climate-focused investors will be pleased to hear that renewable energy output rose 45% in the first half. The uplift was helped by increased capacity, higher prices and an easy comparative period as last year\u2019s performance was held back by unfavourable weather conditions. Efforts to plant itself at the heart of the clean energy transition have continued at pace, with \u00a31.3bn of investment in the first half. Turbo-charging focus on renewables is a bold and admirable move, but the shift comes with a hefty dose of risk \u2013 they\u2019re not always reliable. To some degree, they\u2019re always at the mercy of Mother Nature. That\u2019s why more flexible gas-fired plants are still part of the energy mix and can help plug the shortfall in energy output when the wind doesn\u2019t blow in SSE\u2019s favour. These assets were loss-making in the first half, but as consumers fire up the heating over winter months, profits are set to warm up over the second half. Journalist Nicholas Shaxson has said on X: Cat Hobbs, founder and director of the campaign group We own it, said this week: Thames Water has been teetering on the brink of collapse since being described as \u201cuninvestible\u201d in March when shareholders refused to pour in more cash. The government has been on standby for nationalisation through a special administration regime. But a cluster of investment firms who are among class A creditors including BlackRock, Abrdn and M&amp;G have drawn up an emergency funding plan. The class A creditor group, which represents more than \u00a312bn of debt, said: This is a decisive vote of confidence in the first stage of our restructuring plan for Thames Water from a large group of its creditors, which include a significant number of long-term infrastructure investors. It shows that there is a genuine will to develop a market-based solution which saves UK taxpayers from shouldering the costs of special administration. Our group is working intensively with the company and providing it with the resources and turnaround expertise it needs to ultimately attract strategic equity and rebuild so all parties can focus once again on delivering a better service for customers and the environment. There is also a \u00a3400m reserve fund that Thames is trying to access, and it said early voting suggests that the necessary consent levels will be achieved at the first bondholder meeting next Monday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Thames Water has obtained support from three-quarters of its creditors for an emergency funding deal, which would give it a \u00a33bn lifeline. Britain\u2019s biggest water company said today that creditors holding more than 75% of its Class A debt \u2013 the least risky class of bonds in its debt pile \u2013 agreed to the deal. The 75% threshold is the minimum needed for the plan to be approved by a UK court. Thames Water is aiming for a court date on 17 December. The debt-laden utility hailed this as an \u201cimportant milestone\u201d and is hoping more bondholders will take part. Under the plan, Thames Water would initially get \u00a31.5bn of funding with an annual interest rate of 9.75%, which the company says will keep it going until next October. Asian shares are down again, amid a strong dollar and concerns over the incoming Trump administration\u2019s trade policies. Today, traders await key inflation data from the United States, which could be key to the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest rate decision. Japan\u2019s Nikkei is down by 1.6% while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index has slipped by 0.1% and South Korea\u2019s Kospi slid by 2.6%. Over the past week, we\u2019ve seen \u2018Trump trades\u2019 \u2013 traders betting on big government spending, lower taxes and higher tariffs once Donald Trump takes office. The dollar has jumped and Treasury yields rocketed since last week\u2019s election. Markets are now seeing a 62% chance of an interest rate cut at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in December, down from 77% a week ago and 84% a month ago, according to CME Group. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, explained: US yields pushed higher and the dollar rally gained further momentum yesterday, as investors continued to surf on the idea that Donald Trump\u2019s pro-growth policies and tariffs would boost inflation in the US and limit the Federal Reserve\u2019s capacity to ease the monetary policy as much as previously anticipated. The US 2-year yield, for example, which best captures the rate expectations, is up by 85bp since the September dip, we could see a similar jump in the US 10-year yield. The CPI [consumer price index] data has regained importance since Donald Trump was re-elected president of the US. Jobs data remains crucial for the Fed\u2019s policy path, as the last thing the Fed wants is to panic and lose control of the situation, but the Fed\u2019s victory over inflation looks more vulnerable today than it did a month ago. And that\u2019s supportive of the US dollar. Of course, October figures won\u2019t tell much about the Trump effect on consumer prices. We must wait a few months before we start seeing the impact of Trump on numbers. But the higher the numbers, the lower the December cut expectations. And I sense that today\u2019s numbers may not sooth the doves\u2019 nerves: the US headline inflation is expected to have climbed from 2.4% to 2.6%, while core inflation is seen steady near 3.3% - still significantly above the Fed\u2019s 2% policy target.

The most headline making of them, is <strong>her pledge to immediately instigate a mass deportation of all undocumented migrants in Germany</strong>, in what commentators have compared to the policies Donald Trump is expected to enact when he enters office.</p> <p>Weidel also pledged the reinstatement of Germany\u2019s defunct nuclear power stations, the continued use of its coal fired power plants, a reversal of the planned ban on combustion engines, an overturn of gender policies and a controlled use of cannabis, among other u-turn promises.</p> <p>She described Scholz\u2019s government as \u201cheadless\u201d and \u201clacking in dignity\u201d and accused it of failing to demonstrate an ounce of humility to accept it had driven Germany into the economic turmoil it finds itself in.</p> <p> The AfD leader described Merz as a potential \u201cersatz Scholz\u201d and no alternative to the current government, saying he and his colleagues had been among the main authors of the chaos Germany found itself in now. </p> <p>The CDU\u2019s \u201cmother of sins\u201d, she said, had been allowing millions of refugees into the country, under the 16 year leadership of Angela Merkel. She described this \u201cflood\u201d of people as having consisted of largely criminal, lazy newcomers, who were a burden to ordinary Germans, robbing them of their chance of prosperity and safety.

These are due to take place on February 23, following a vote of confidence on December 16, which <strong>Olaf Scholz,</strong> the chancellor is expected to lose, paving the way for the elections.</p> <p>The eyes of many European political observers are on the parliament this lunchtime. Scholz is due to speak for half an hour, and is <strong>expected to attempt to justify why he considered it necessary to oust his finance minister Christian Lindner, of the pro-business FDP, thus triggering the early election,</strong> particularly at a time of national crisis, inextricably linked with an array of unprecedented global challenges, not least events unfolding in Washington following the re-election there of president elect Donald Trump.</p> <p>Scholz is also expected to lay out the successes of his coalition government amid all the criticisms, in what will effectively be his first election campaign speech.</p> <p>Because, to the astonishment of outside observers in particular, Scholz is standing again as his Social Democrats\u2019 chancellor candidate, despite the fact he is currently ranked 19 out of 20 in a popularity rating of politicians amongst German voters.

      "bodyText": "After a lively, sometimes rowdy, German Bundestag debate, this is what we learnt: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will ask for a vote of confidence on 16 December, paving the way forward for an early parliamentary election in February. Striking an unusually fiery tone, Scholz said he was right to fire Christian Lindner as his finance minister last week, triggering the collapse of his three-party coalition and early elections. The German chancellor urged all parties to pass outstanding bills on child benefit and fiscal drag. He also called for greater protection of the German Constitutional court, which mainstream parties fear could be damaged, if the far-right and far-left make gains in the elections and seek to block appointments to the court. Opposition leader Friedrich Merz, who polls suggest will become Germany\u2019s next chancellor, denounced Scholz\u2019s record. He also pledged to backtrack Germany\u2019s climate policies and expel migrants at the border as part of a \u201ctotally different\u201d approach to migration. Earlier in the day, Merz indicated openness to reform of Germany\u2019s debt brake, strict spending limits enshrined in the constitution that ultimately tore apart the outgoing coalition. It could be a significant step from a fiscal hawk, but we don\u2019t know yet what he has in mind. In her contribution Germany\u2019s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock was forced on the defensive after her Green co-leader Robert Habeck had to miss the debate because a broken-down government plane kept him grounded in Lisbon. Ousted finance minister Christian Lindner defended his approach to the debt brake, the issue that broke the government apart. Far-right leader Alice Weidel lambasted the government and opposition in an angry speech, where she outlined her policies of deporting all undocumented migrants in Germany, reversing the planned ban on combustion engines and continuing to burn coal. This brings an end to our live coverage. Thank you for following today and don\u2019t forget to check out all our coverage of Germany. The leader of the far right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party Alice Weidel has given an angry speech, spitting in rage and frustration at both Olaf Scholz\u2019s government and the opposition conservatives, who she said had collaborated as architects in the downfall of Germany. She pledged a 100 day plan, should the AfD get into government which would overturn the main policies introduced by Scholz\u2019s government. The most headline making of them, is her pledge to immediately instigate a mass deportation of all undocumented migrants in Germany, in what commentators have compared to the policies Donald Trump is expected to enact when he enters office. Weidel also pledged the reinstatement of Germany\u2019s defunct nuclear power stations, the continued use of its coal fired power plants, a reversal of the planned ban on combustion engines, an overturn of gender policies and a controlled use of cannabis, among other u-turn promises. She described Scholz\u2019s government as \u201cheadless\u201d and \u201clacking in dignity\u201d and accused it of failing to demonstrate an ounce of humility to accept it had driven Germany into the economic turmoil it finds itself in. The AfD leader described Merz as a potential \u201cersatz Scholz\u201d and no alternative to the current government, saying he and his colleagues had been among the main authors of the chaos Germany found itself in now. The CDU\u2019s \u201cmother of sins\u201d, she said, had been allowing millions of refugees into the country, under the 16 year leadership of Angela Merkel. She described this \u201cflood\u201d of people as having consisted of largely criminal, lazy newcomers, who were a burden to ordinary Germans, robbing them of their chance of prosperity and safety. She referred to Merkel, as \u201cthe best chancellor the Greens ever had,\u201d a dig at Merkel\u2019s sympathy for environmental concerns. Leaning into the podium from which she spoke, digging her heels into the floor, as she moved forwards and backwards, Weidel\u2019s angry shouts were met with applause and cries of support from her fellow party members. She said Germans \u201cjust want normality and they have a right to that\u201d, but they would only get this if the AfD was - as the second most popular party in the Bundestag - allowed to participate in a government, something which all mainstream parties have ruled out. The debate continues in the Bundestag, but it is unlikely to get a more provocative speech than that delivered by Weidel. Once again, is a foretaste of the election campaign to come over the coming months. Germany\u2019s ousted finance minister, Christian Lindner, leader of the pro-business FDP, which departed the government last Wednesday, has just taken to the podium delivering a speech which was received with stormy applause from his own ranks, and enthusiastically by the conservatives. Referring to his sacking by Scholz, Lindner said: \u201cSometimes being relieved of something is freeing\u201d. He says the government of Scholz has collapsed because the chancellor is treating Germany as if it were a completely different country to the reality as Lindner sees it. Scholz does not appear to be listening, instead, demonstratively turns to talk to his ministers Wolfgang Schmidt and Boris Pistorius, who are sitting behind him. Lindner offers the extra dig at Scholz: \u201cIf you only go round in a circle, you can\u2019t expect to lead a coalition of progress\u201d. He vehemently defends his course to protect the mechanisms of the German debt brake in the constitution - the row over which led to the collapse of the government. He leaves the podium to rousing applause, returning to his seat next to Merz, in whose government he might get a position, again as finance minister, if his FDP manages to poll above the 5% mark, the threshold needed to get into parliament. Currently it is hovering around or below that crucial figure. Annalena Baerbock of the Greens, and Germany\u2019s foreign minister, has stepped in for her colleague Robert Habeck, economy minister and deputy chancellor, who, embarrassingly and inconveniently at such a historic moment, is stuck in Lisbon due to his government plane breaking down. Baerbock takes the bull by the horns on this one, knowing that the government is going to get a lot of stick for this. A member of the AfD shouts the question: \u201cwhy didn\u2019t he take a cargo bike?\u201d in a dig at the Greens\u2019 push for car and plane-free mobility. Baerbock scoffs at this and suggests they can now save themselves from using this as an election slogan. Baerbock stresses again the government\u2019s support for Ukraine, and says as the world gets more complicated, with drone attacks on Ukraine likely to get heftier over Christmas, and Putin caring not a jot about the German election results, Germany has to continue to recognise the particular responsibility it has in the times ahead, to contribute to international security. She says if asked by her kids in 10 years time, what Germany did, and did Europe act collaboratively, she wanted to say it had acted responsibly and helped to strengthen security. The new US administration would not make life easier, she said, at the same time as stressing that it was a choice of US voters that had to be respected. Germany\u2019s answer had to be to work in a spirit of cooperation with other countries, she said. \u201cOur answer to America First cannot be Germany First, as some here have suggested,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Europe United - with a strong Germany.\u201d Merz accused Scholz of dividing Germany, in contrast to what Scholz himself has just stated \u2013 the desire he has to stop a US-style polarisation of the country - and of having lost touch with reality. The opposition leader complained of artificial intelligence generated images of himself doing the rounds on social media, although he doesn\u2019t go into detail. He said the fact that they are being distributed online by members of Scholz\u2019s SPD is an indication, of \u201cforetaste of the type of election campaign\u201d to come, accusing the SPD of being prepared to strike below the belt. Scholz, donning black spectacles, peers at his mobile phone and doesn\u2019t react to the accusation. Merz\u2019s speech is met by rousing applause from the benches of his conservatives. Merz received warm and sustained applause after his speech. Now up is Green party co-leader and German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock. Friedrich Merz has said Germany needs a totally different approach to migration policy. He said a new government must regain control over migration with expulsions at the border. It is a handbrake turn on the approach of his predecessor Angela Merkel, whose open-door to Syrian refugees in 2015 contributed to more than a million asylum seekers arriving in the EU that year. Friedrich Merz is laying into the AfD, sitting in flamboyant, fiery and rambunctious mode to his right hand side, repeating with a jab of his finger in his direction, his pledge that he would, as chancellor, never work together with the party. This will come as a relief to those who have sometimes feared there was a crack in the firewall that CDU members and other mainstream parties have erected in insisting there will be no cooperation with the far-right populists. Merz in almost the same breath, lays into Scholz, saying that Germany needs a \u201ccompletely different type of politics\u201d, that this is \u201curgently needed\u201d. He announces, like a quick fire shopping list, his plans to backtrack on the government\u2019s climate policies, to tackle immigration control, to boost Germany\u2019s status as a modern transport hub, its digital standards. He accuses Scholz of only now reaching out for cooperation from the CDU/CSU, at a time when it wants to bring its government to a more graceful close, but says he will not play ball. He says cooperation can only take place once Scholz has faced the vote of confidence in parliament - on December 16. He again makes a dig at the AfD, angrily asking: \u201cIs that all you\u2019re capable of? Screaming at us from the sidelines?\u201d Friedrich Merz, chancellor in waiting, takes to the podium, and it\u2019s clear from the start that he is trying to separate himself from Scholz as much as possible, even as Scholz called on him to help his government to push through outstanding legislation which was for the good of the nation. Merz slapped Scholz down saying he was \u201cnot from this world\u201d, but \u201cfrom another cosmos\u201d. He criticised his behaviour in the run up to his government\u2019s collapse. Merz, a lawyer and investment banker who has been waiting for this moment his whole political career, is presenting himself as the diametrical opposite of Scholz, in what is effectively the opening salvo of what is going to be a heated election campaign. Friedrich Merz, the leader of the Christian Democrats, is now speaking and getting a warm reception from some in the chamber. He was officially nominated as his party\u2019s candidate in September, putting him in poll position to be Germany\u2019s next chancellor. A former BlackRock executive, he is a fiscal conservative, who is seen as impulsive even by his allies. Towards the end of his speech, in which Scholz avoided being interrupted by cat calls and jibes from the AfD benches, he spoke of having just read a book by US author and journalist Ezra Klein, Why We Are Polarised - an analysis of political polarisation. He warns of what has happened in the US being repeated in Germany, but saying as a democrat, he will not let that happen. He says polarisation is the \u201cpolitical business model\u201d of certain parties in the Bundestag, a pointed reference to the far-right AfD. In his speech, which has just finished, Scholz - referred to a telephone call he held with US president-elect Trump on Sunday evening, describing it as \u201ca good discussion\u201d. Defending his government\u2019s record he touches in particular on its support of Ukraine, saying Germany has contributed to helping the conflict not to escalate. But he confirms he will not bow to demands for Germany to deliver Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine, even as Merz has suggested he is planning to do just that if he becomes chancellor. He is receiving warm, but certainly not rapturous support, from the benches of his SPD. Noted: This post was amended at 15.37 CET to clarify the nature of the technology. Scholz has finished speaking and a large part of the chamber warmly applauded. Now it\u2019s Friedrich Merz\u2026 Scholz is speaking in a confident and defiant tone, justifying his decision to oust finance minister Christian Lindner, saying it was right, even as he acknowledges, it has led to a change in Germany\u2019s political landscape. He calls on Germany\u2019s democrats, regardless of their political persuasion, to work together on issues that are important for Germany, \u201cwhich cannot wait\u201d. He touches on issues his government is still working on, including an initiative to boost growth, plans to increase child support payments and measures to protect the country\u2019s highest instance, the constitutional court. The members of the AfD - whose benches to the right of Scholz are full - is loud and rowdy, expressing its disapproval of Scholz. Olaf Scholz stresses he\u2019ll need the support of the opposition CDU to push through remaining government reforms before parliament is dissolved. He strongly implies that if these issues - including tax reforms proposed by his former finance minister and an increase in child support payments - are not passed, the CDU will be to blame. Olaf Scholz has said there are \u201curgent topics\u201d where Germany\u2019s parties can reach agreement before the elections. He calls on parties to agree to increase child benefits, and legislate to tackle fiscal drag \u2013 when inflation lifts taxpayers into paying higher rates. Significantly, he also calls for stronger protection of the Germany\u2019s constitutional court. The court is seen as vulnerable if the far-right and radical left win a third of seats in parliament after elections, as polls suggest they might. Mainstream parties fear that the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland and the nationalist far-left Sahra Wagenknecht alliance could unite to block appointments to the court, slowing down the wheels of justice. Scholz has taken the podium to applause and immediately said it was \u201cnecessary, right and unavoidable\u201d to sack his finance minister, and he is grateful that the new election date is set for the end of February. Olaf Scholz - unusually fiery and determined in tone - confirms that he will submit an application for a vote of confidence in his government on December 11, to be held on 16 December, to pave way for the 23 February election. \u201cLet us, for the good of the country, work together until the new election,\u201d he appeals to members of the Bundestag, insisting his government will continue its work, despite only having a minority since the departure of the FDP. Here are some images from the Bundestag ahead of the debate. Olaf Scholz looks relaxed as he talks to Friedrich Merz, the man who could replace him as chancellor, and Christian Lindner, the erstwhile finance minister he fired last week. As Kate Connolly writes The Bundestag is full to the rafters for this significant occasion. Everyone who is anyone is inside the glass-domed hall. Scholz, who has greeted his party and government colleagues with a handshake, is due to take to the podium at 1.20pm local time. He has also shaken the hands of Friedrich Merz, his arch rival and likely future German chancellor, as well as his former finance minister Christian Lindner, who is sitting shoulder to shoulder with Merz. The mood between the men is surprisingly cordial. Here is another image of Lindner, who has said he expects Friedrich Merz to be Germany\u2019s next chancellor. And here is defence minister Boris Pistorius, who is far more popular than Scholz and is the favoured SPD chancellor candidate for some, but not expected to run. MPs in the Bundestag have risen to their feet, as Bundestag session opens. Chancellor Olaf Scholz is expected to speak at 13.30 CET/ 12.30 GMT. You can follow it live here The German parliament is bracing itself for a showdown of its main players, following a week of political turmoil. Sparked by the collapse of the German coalition over a lengthy row focused on how to balance the books and fill a multi-billion Euro hole in next year\u2019s budget, Europe\u2019s biggest economy now faces weeks of political uncertainty as it gears up for snap elections. These are due to take place on February 23, following a vote of confidence on December 16, which Olaf Scholz, the chancellor is expected to lose, paving the way for the elections. The eyes of many European political observers are on the parliament this lunchtime. Scholz is due to speak for half an hour, and is expected to attempt to justify why he considered it necessary to oust his finance minister Christian Lindner, of the pro-business FDP, thus triggering the early election, particularly at a time of national crisis, inextricably linked with an array of unprecedented global challenges, not least events unfolding in Washington following the re-election there of president elect Donald Trump. Scholz is also expected to lay out the successes of his coalition government amid all the criticisms, in what will effectively be his first election campaign speech. Because, to the astonishment of outside observers in particular, Scholz is standing again as his Social Democrats\u2019 chancellor candidate, despite the fact he is currently ranked 19 out of 20 in a popularity rating of politicians amongst German voters. His nickname is \u2018komakanzler\u2019 or coma chancellor - considered a lame duck by many despite his promise to push through important legislation before his administration is replaced. His speech will be followed by a much anticipated address by the conservative opposition\u2019s Friedrich Merz, who is waiting in the wings and widely expected to become the next German chancellor, after years and years of trying to scale the heights. Annalena Baerbock of the Greens, the foreign minister in Scholz\u2019s administration, will follow. Her colleague Robert Habeck is stuck in Lisbon following an international digital congress, after the government plane he was due to return to Berlin in, in time for this historical moment, broke down. It is the latest in a string of problems which have regularly grounded the government\u2019s aircraft fleet in recent years, and is seen as a veritable metaphor for the crisis Germany currently finds itself in. Attention will then be on Lindner, the slighted finance minister, who is still smarting from his unceremonious dismissal from the Scholz administration, and vowing a comeback, if his FDP can get over the 5% threshold needed to get into parliament, as junior coalition partner to the conservatives. There then follows Alice Weidel, head of the far-right populist AfD, which has been making hay from the government debacle, and is riding high in the polls - second behind Merz\u2019s CDU/CSU - emboldened in addition by what analysts are referring to as the \u2018Trump Effect\u2019, with many of the party\u2019s policies aligned with those of the Trump team. We\u2019re expecting an unusually lively debate. And in case you are wondering, we are still waiting for Scholz\u2019s address to the Bundestag to begin. The start time is now forecast for 13.30 CET/ 12.30 GMT. Germany\u2019s possible next chancellor Friedrich Merz has indicated some openness to reform of his country\u2019s debt brake, in what could be a significant development for the EU\u2019s largest economy. Merz has always been a strict advocate of the debt brake, but appeared not to rule out reform of the mechanism that requires government spending to stay within strict limits. According to Der Spiegel, the CDU leader described the debt brake as \u201ca technical issue, you can answer it one way or the other\u201d. Of course you can reform it. The question is, why? For what purpose? What is the result of such a reform? Is the result that we spend even more money on consumption and social policy? Then the answer is no\u2026Is the result that it is important for investment, it is important for progress, it is important for the livelihood of our children? Then the answer may be different. Germany\u2019s commitment to the debt brake in an age of escalating pressures for government spending proved to be the undoing of Scholz\u2019s coalition. But it is too early to say what Merz has in mind. Why a February election? Basically the chancellor and the opposition agreed to split the difference. Olaf Scholz wanted to hold off a poll until March, but the opposition CDU-CSU were pressing for January, the earliest possible poll. After a debate about whether there would be enough paper to print ballots, political parties settled on 23 February. You can read the full background here. As the political scientist Nicolai von Ondarza has commented, that is still pretty slow. As he writes \u201cconfronted with severe geopolitical and economic challenges\u201d Germany is \u201cstill doing it the slow way\u201d. Don\u2019t forget after the elections, come the coalition talks, which could last until Easter or beyond, leaving Europe\u2019s largest economy - and the EU\u2019s indispensable decision maker - in limbo for months. You don\u2019t have to be fluent in Hochdeutsch to appreciate the wonderful flexibility of the German language. And the government crisis has produced a new word for the dictionaries: \u2018Komakanzler\u2019. Best translated as the comatose chancellor, the label has been used by opposition conservatives to describe Olaf Scholz after the collapse of his government. Hat tip Kate Connolly. If you want to follow Scholz\u2019s address and the debate, you can watch the Bundestag live stream here. The session begins at 13.00 CET (noon GMT) Want to know more about how the German government got to this point? Bookmark the latest episode of Today in Focus, where Der Spiegel journalist Regina Steffens and author John Kampfner explain how the traffic-light coalition came to an end. Titled the Briefcase, the Porsche and the collapse of the German government, it looks at the deep structural problems in German politics and Europe\u2019s biggest economy. I would also highly recommend Philip Oltermann\u2019s profile of vice chancellor Robert Habeck, published in September 2023. It\u2019s a fascinating portrait of an idealist in power. Why is Germany having an election seven months earlier than expected? The heart of the problem is a long-running dispute over economic policy between the coalition partners, against a backdrop of intense pressure on Germany\u2019s economic model. The liberal Free Democratic (FDP) party led by ousted finance minister Christian Linder refused to countenance changes to Germany\u2019s debt brake - a constitutional mechanism that restricts Germany\u2019s annual deficit to 0.35% of gross domestic product over the economic cycle. Scholz and his Social Democrats, supported by the Greens, wanted to declare a state of emergency to suspend the debt brake; fiscally-hawkish Lindner refused. The row comes amid intense pressure on Germany to spend more to fix its dilapidated or outdated infrastructure and meet the demands for greater defence spending. Following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Scholz spoke of a Zeitenwende, a turning point, but critics say he has failed to respond to the magnitude of the moment. This article by Kate Connolly is a useful backgrounder on the budget crisis \u2013 look out for the the Swabian housewife and the Sparfuchs, the \u2018savings fox\u2019 or \u2018skimper\u2019. And the UK think tank Chatham House has an interesting read on the problems facing Germany\u2019s economic model: The break-up of Scholz\u2019s coalition government signals the end of Germany\u2019s old economic model The opposition CDU/CSU alliance is comfortably ahead in the race to become the largest political force, according to the latest opinion poll from Forsa. Based on a survey last week, it shows the CDU/CSU, far ahead of their nearest rivals, the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, which looks set to become the main opposition. As expected from last June\u2019s European elections, Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats and the Greens will shed votes, while the pro-business FDP could fail to meet the 5% threshold to enter parliament (although there are some exceptions to help smaller parties around this rule). This means the CDU/CSU would be in the driving seat to form another coalition, while the AfD would be Germany\u2019s main opposition. CDU/CSU \u2013 33% AfD \u2013 17% SPD 16% Greens 11% Alliance Sahra Wagenknecht 5% FDP 4% Linke (left) 3% You can see the results via Europe Elects here Greetings, it\u2019s midday in Berlin and German chancellor Olaf Scholz will soon address the Bundestag for the first time since his government collapsed, firing the starting gun on his election campaign. For months Germany has been hamstrung by the weakness of its squabbling three-way coalition government, leaving allies lamenting that Europe\u2019s most powerful country and largest economy was unable to take big decisions. That changed last week, when Scholz sacked his finance minister, the pro-business liberal leader, Christian Lindner, triggering the end of the coalition and early elections. Germany will go to the polls on 23 February, following an agreement on Tuesday between Scholz\u2019s Social Democrat party and the conservative CDU/CSU opposition. Under the deal, Scholz will table a no-confidence vote on 16 December - one month earlier than he had originally wanted - paving the way for early elections. Scholz is due to speak for 30 minutes from 1pm CET (noon GMT), followed by two hours of debate. We can expect to hear plenty from Friedrich Merz, the leader of the opposition CDU party, who is in poll position to become Germany\u2019s next chancellor. Robert Habeck, Scholz\u2019s deputy, however, will not be at the debate, as his government plane has broken down and he is stuck in Lisbon (where he was attending a digital conference). As our Berlin correspondent Kate Connolly writes: \u201cAll this fits neatly of course into the narrative of a broken Germany\u201d.",

I also asked the fine people of Bluesky to weigh in, and here are the recommendations they came back with (thank you, everyone): Slice &amp; Dice, Konami\u2019s Pixel Puzzle Collection, Township, Threes, Match Factory! and Twenty. A dev shouted out their game, Vectic Lite, which has ignorable banner ads, alongside another banner-ad-only puzzle game called Nokama. There\u2019s also an independent puzzle games website, Thinky Games, that lets you search its database for recommendations. If you\u2019ve got a question for Question Block \u2013 or anything else to say about the newsletter \u2013 hit reply or email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

In these online fantasy worlds, players could quest together rather than alone, adding a fascinating new social \u2013 and competitive \u2013 dimension to the static, offline role-playing that Holly\u2019s generation had grown up with.

Then I saw another player running in the opposite direction, a Druid who buffed me on their way by. That was when I knew I was going to be in this for the long-haul.\u201d Twenty years later, Longdale is now WoW\u2019s VP and executive producer at its developer, Blizzard, as well as one of millions who embraced the game as part of their lives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By 2021, players had collectively clocked up a total playtime of nearly 9m years</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For two decades, World of Warcraft has been emblematic of nerd culture, referenced everywhere from South Park to The Big Bang Theory to Family Guy. WoW became a useful shorthand not just for a certain type of gamer, but any and all geeky, nerdy and dorky subcultures. In the 00s, it was advertised by the likes of Ozzy Osborne, Chuck Norris and Mr T, with his infamous Night Elf Mohawk. It counts Henry Cavill, Mila Kunis and Vin Diesel among its fans, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2016/jun/21/warcraft-movie-most-successful-stinker-of-all-time\">a movie adaptation in 2016</a> grossed $439m, without being particularly good. In 2021, Blizzard revealed that players had collectively clocked up a total playtime of nearly 9m years.</p>    <p>There were certainly other role-playing games prior to WoW\u2019s release in 2004. But 3D graphics were still in their infancy. The likes of Star Wars Galaxies and Everquest had large, mostly barren worlds that relied on reams of in-game text for exposition, and clunky rules lifted from tabletop games. Then along came Blizzard \u2013 a developer that had made its name and a small fortune from superb online competitive strategy games such as StarCraft and Warcraft III. Unlike its competitors, WoW\u2019s world of Azeroth felt lived-in, with gorgeous scenic vistas and vast numbers of animals and monsters prowling its landscapes. Iconic bright-yellow exclamation marks hovered above the heads of non-player characters, letting you know a quest awaited. And, of course, you\u2019d see other players everywhere, taming beasts, taking down monsters for quests, drinking in inns, mining ore or just running by in high-level gear that filled you with jealousy as you struggled to tackle a pack of lowly Murlocs.</p> <p>It was the social side of the game that came to define early WoW. The world\u2019s tightly curated zones encouraged players to stumble across other people as they quested through Azeroth. And when you created your character, you had to pick between two factions, Alliance and Horde, giving players an immediate sense of allegiance. Whether it was grouping up to tackle dungeons, rallying into 40-person bands to take down colossal raid-bosses, or even rushing the enemy capital as an army of low-level cannon-fodder, seemingly every player has a story about their time in Azeroth.</p>    <p>I still romanticise my role in sneaking up to the Alliance capital of Stormwind alongside a group of low-level Undead Rogues. What we\u2019d imagined as a daring raid ended up with us running for our lives. Another time, I asked a better-geared passerby for help taking down a particularly tough monster in the Night Elf zone of Darkshore, only to end up chatting to him for hours. I messaged that same player for months after.</p> <p>WoW was quite simply a phenomenon. Blizzard had to more than double its headcount within a year, employing legions of people to answer players\u2019 questions, solve their technical issues and keep servers up and running. WoW racked up staggering subscriber counts, boosted further by the release of two expansion packs: The Burning Crusade in 2007 and Wrath of the Lich King in 2008.</p> <p>By 2010, more than 12 million players had active monthly subscriptions. Some called themselves WoWaholics. Other players found WoW to be an escape from the limitations of real life, as evidenced by the touching story of Mats Steen, recently told in the Netflix documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/18/the-remarkable-life-of-ibelin-review-moving-tale-of-disabled-gamers-digital-double-life-world-of-warcraft-mats-steen\">The Remarkable Life of Ibelin</a>. Mats had muscular dystrophy before his untimely death at 25, but he was living a vibrant life inside WoW, a life of which his parents were totally unaware until his online friends sent long messages from all over Europe telling them how their son had touched their lives. Five members of Mats\u2019 WoW guild went to Norway for his funeral.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The way we\u2019re social on the internet has changed \u2013 and WoW is a reflection of that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But no game can stay in the spotlight for ever. While WoW went from strength to strength in its first six years, as the game aged, so did its players. As then lead game designer, now game director, Ion Hazzikostas <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/world-of-warcraft-ten-year-anniversary-interview-ion-hazzikostas/\">put it</a> in 2014: \u201cThe person who picked up the game in 2004, who was a student with tons of free time, is now a career person with a family.\u201d Blizzard had to attract a new generation, while keeping existing fans. For the 2010 Cataclysm expansion, a decision was made to shake up the game through a massive revamp of its world, with a new design philosophy suited to faster gameplay that it was thought modern gamers demanded. The changes are still controversial.</p> <p>Questing through Azeroth today is a scarcely recognisable experience compared to those early years. WoW has had several distinct eras: there\u2019s the classic WoW era running up to Wrath of the Lich King (2004-8); the world revamp that defined Cataclysm (2010) through to Warlords of Draenor (2014); the pivot to a long endgame grind, where players could become endlessly more powerful in Legion (2016) through Shadowlands (2020); and WoW\u2019s modern era, beginning with Dragonflight (2022) and continuing into the recently launched expansion The War Within (2024). These \u201ceras\u201d are so distinct that it feels as though the game reinvents itself every six or so years.</p> <p>The social aspect has also changed with the times. As Taliesin \u2013 one half of the husband and wife WoW <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/taliesinevitel\">YouTube duo</a> Taliesin &amp; Evitel \u2013 puts it: \u201cThe way we\u2019re social on the internet has changed \u2013 and WoW is a reflection of that; 2004 was a time of message boards and forums and a more \u2018underground\u2019 internet. The internet today is much shorter and sharper. It\u2019s TikTok, it\u2019s all your social media focused on one or two megasites. What we do socially on the internet has changed, and so has WoW.\u201d</p>    <p>It\u2019s common to hear complaints that WoW has changed so much that its original spirit has been lost. Players have often been left confused about design decisions they felt were inconsistent with the traditional experience. Unfortunately for Blizzard, these reached their peak following the launch of Shadowlands in 2020, precisely when a perfect storm was brewing for the company. Not only was game development upended by Covid, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/08/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-women-sexual-harassment\">in 2021 Blizzard</a> was hit with a lawsuit brought by California\u2019s department of fair employment, accusing it of fostering a \u201cfrat boy\u201d workplace culture, with sexual harassment and poor treatment of women.</p> <p>The lawsuit had wide-reaching implications for the company and the wider gaming industry. Although it was found that found that no court or independent investigation had substantiated any allegations about systemic or widespread sexual harassment, several senior executives, including Blizzard\u2019s president J Allen Brack, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-58061231\">stood down</a>, and the company agreed to pay millions to address gender discrimination and wage inequality concerns. The suit ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/21/activision-blizzard-employees-union#:~:text=It%20will%20be%20part%20of,for%20discrimination%20and%20harassment%20claims.\">contributed to the formation of the first labour union at a major US gaming firm</a>.</p> <p>Within WoW specifically, the suit led to rapid changes in-game. Characters named after accused abusers were renamed and many in-game assets deemed inappropriate in light of the allegations, such as sexualised depictions of women, were replaced or tweaked. Many of the changes were ridiculed by the playerbase, who urged Blizzard to combat toxicity, <a href=\"https://www.dexerto.com/world-of-warcraft/wow-players-urge-blizzard-combat-toxicity-instead-censoring-game-content-1662472/\">rather than \u201cturning women into fruit bowls</a>\u201d.</p>    <p>Longdale had only just joined Blizzard in 2020 when the lawsuit kicked off. \u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d she says. \u201cI was only a few months in. To see the team just devastated, wondering what the future will be, was truly heartbreaking.\u201d The fallout, combined with the already-present malaise about the state of the game, could easily have been the beginning of the end for WoW. But a commitment from both the WoW team and the new Blizzard leadership to build back better meant the game held on. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really proud of,\u201d says Longdale, \u201cis that the diversity of our team has grown significantly. There\u2019s a lot more \u2018voice\u2019 in the content that we make now \u2013 and people are creating content that is very personal, based on their own experiences.\u201d</p> <p>Every time WoW seemed at risk of losing relevance over the years, it has managed to reinvent itself and claw its way back. And while its cultural reach has lessened over time, the impact it\u2019s had is undeniable. Countless fantasy roleplaying worlds and characters have been inspired by WoW\u2019s pantheon of heroes. The game is in the DNA of every subsequent generation of video games that have been developed since 2004.</p> <p>While the WoW of today may not spark that same wonder that early players felt roaming the green hills of Stranglethorn or taking that first ship from Kalimdor to the Eastern Kingdoms back in 2004, the fact it\u2019s still going, and still changing, is testament to the incredible foundations it laid down 20 years ago. And as for WoW\u2019s future? \u201cMy goal, and I think the team\u2019s goal, is that WoW is more than a game,\u201d says Longdale. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially part of your lifestyle. It can be for your friends, it can be for parents playing with their kids. It\u2019s a charming fantasy world that connects you with people.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 November 2024 to add the detail that it was found that no court or independent investigation had substantiated any allegations about systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A German energy firm has said that Donald Trump\u2019s election victory has increased the risks of investing in offshore wind projects \u2013 but his return to the White House could help bolster Britain\u2019s renewables sector, according to UK developer SSE. Germany\u2019s RWE has cut its spending plans and warned that, as a result of the US election, \u201cthe risks for offshore wind projects have increased\u201d. The company, which is behind a string of wind and solar projects, on Wednesday shaved \u20ac3bn from its spending plans for the next financial year to \u20ac7bn, down from \u20ac10bn in 2024. It will also delay its plans to invest \u20ac55bn in renewables before 2030. Trump\u2019s re-election last week sent a chill through the renewables sector, as investors dumped green energy stocks. He has vowed to clamp down on Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which stands to inject about $433bn in grants, loans and tax incentives to healthcare, utilities and clean energy companies. Separately, Alistair Phillips-Davies, the chief executive of Britain\u2019s SSE, said a clean energy slowdown in the US could be \u201ca real positive\u201d for the UK even after Trump\u2019s victory wiped billions from the market value of Europe\u2019s largest renewable energy developers. But Phillips-Davies told the Guardian that, while doubts surround the future of the US industry, the UK could seize the chance to secure a greater share of global supply chains and manufacturing opportunities. \u201cIt\u2019s not good news for US renewables but it could be helpful because it means the US will not be sucking up the global supply chain,\u201d Phillips-Davies said. Renewable developers have been forced to compete for supplies of products used for green projects in recent years as demand for new windfarms has taken off, raising concerns over project delays. Siemens Energy, one of the world\u2019s largest wind turbine makers, on Wednesday reported a net income of \u20ac1.3bn for its last financial year as it begins to emerge from a crisis in its wind turbine division which led to a historic loss of \u20ac4.6bn. Phillips-Davies added that the UK could now get \u201cahead of the game\u201d to secure its supply of materials and components and establish its own manufacturing capabilities. This would help the UK to deliver domestic projects at lower cost and increase exports to the rest of the world, he said. It could prove to be \u201ca real positive in terms of an industrial strategy story\u201d, he added. SSE, which is building the world\u2019s biggest offshore windfarm in North Sea, was not directly affected by the sell-off in renewable shares as its focus is on the UK and Europe. It is planning to expand its portfolio into continental Europe. Phillips-Davies used the company\u2019s half-year financial results to announce his retirement as chief executive next year after 11 years in the role. SSE\u2019s pre-tax profits climbed by 26.4% from last year\u2019s half-year results to \u00a3714.5m, he said. Michael M\u00fcller, the chief financial officer of RWE, which has multi-billion euro plans to develop windfarms in the US, said that its investment plans for the rest of the decade would \u201cslip back\u201d following the election result, and due to delays to Europe\u2019s green hydrogen plans. \u201cBut we will have to wait and see how things develop in the future,\u201d he added. RWE reported earnings of \u20ac4bn in the first nine months of the year, down from \u20ac5.7bn in the same period in 2023 despite its growing renewable energy generation. Its share price tumbled by more than 4% after the US election result, but its decision to take a more cautious approach to investment combined with a \u20ac1.5bn share buyback programme, helped its share price to climb back above pre-election levels on Wednesday. Tancrede Fulop, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said: \u201cThe buy-back addresses investor demands from the substantial profits during the 2022-23 energy crisis, and management\u2019s decision is supported by potential delays in US offshore wind projects and challenges in Europe\u2019s hydrogen sector.\u201d",

It still is. You wouldn\u2019t have your Teslas or your iPhones without raw material from the Congo.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean rape just metaphorically. If you made a map of the east Congo showing where the mining is and the statistics of how many women are raped, it\u2019s a one-on-one correlation.\u201d</p> <p>His film juxtaposes the racist lynchings and de facto apartheid of southern American states such as Mississippi in the 1960s with the contemporary assassination of Patrice Lumumba, Congo\u2019s first democratically elected, Black African post-colonial prime minister. His film reveals how Lumumba was toppled in a military coup aided \u2013 either actively or through docile complaisance \u2013 by the CIA, MI6, 20,000 supposed peacekeepers deployed by UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, freebooting mercenaries like \u201cMad Mike\u201d Hoare and, finally, Belgium, whose secret service worked with white colonists desperate to retain their African assets.</p>    <p>\u201cI thought it was time to dig into my own country\u2019s past,\u201d says the Belgian director from his New York hotel room. \u201cWhen I grew up, it was all around me. But I didn\u2019t really know about the nitty gritty. This film is about the nitty gritty.\u201d</p> <p>Belgium, Grimonprez says, is younger than the US, but, thanks to its ruthless colonial exploitation of Congo for its mineral riches, its exploitation of Black people mirrored slave-era America. \u201cIf the United States was behaving like a teenager, then we were behaving like a toddler.\u201d Only in 2002, the film reveals, did Belgium formally apologise for the role its partisans played in Lumumba\u2019s torture and murder. His killing made Lumumba a pan-African icon and hero across the Atlantic to African Americans (Malcolm X named his daughter Lumumba). </p> <p>Grimonprez doesn\u2019t only indict Belgium. The 62-year-old director has walk-on roles from not just some of the greatest jazz musicians ever (Max Roach, Abbey Lincoln, Coltrane, Art Blakey, Quincy Jones \u2013 the list goes on), but shady characters such as British spy Daphne Park, our woman in Stanleyville. It includes chilling archive footage of this MI6 agent who looks and sounds like Miss Marple but was one of the brains behind the coup that did for Lumumba. Her policy of surreptitiously fomenting dissent between Congolese politicians, the better to undermine the first prime minister of a free, post-colonial Congo, clearly worked. Without Park\u2019s interference and that of her CIA counterparts, the downfall of Lumumba might not have been so precipitate.</p> <p>But why did the west dabble in the Congo? This is where Grimonprez\u2019s film is especially rewarding. It takes us back 64 years, to a time when Black African nations were shaking off the colonial yoke and simultaneously figured as proxies in the cold war. Lumumba had the misfortune to be regarded by the US state department as a dangerous red. The film quotes US President Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s reported hope that \u201cLumumba would fall into a river full of crocodiles\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLumumba was no communist,\u201d says Grimonprez when I put this to him. \u201cHe was a Black nationalist like many African leaders at the time.\u201d Footage suggests he was also an immensely charismatic man, who spoke eloquent truth to power. We see him amid the pomp and circumstance of Congo\u2019s Independence Day ceremony on 30 June 1960, when he told dignitaries, including the Belgian king, of his pride in leading the push for Congolese liberation: \u201c[I]t was a noble and just struggle, and indispensable to put an end to the humiliating slavery which was imposed upon us by force.\u201d King Baudouin was reportedly livid at Lumumba\u2019s ungrateful tone.</p> <p>Six months later, after being ousted from office by western-backed army officer Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu, Lumumba was kidnapped and tortured, then finally shot dead by Belgians under orders from the Katangan government. While some think it speculative that the CIA was involved, Grimonprez has no doubts: \u201cEisenhower got his wish.\u201d His body was dug from its shallow grave, dissolved with sulphuric acid and the bones ground up.</p> <p>Others in Lumumba\u2019s circle were a little more fortunate. Lumumba\u2019s chief of protocol, Andr\u00e9e Blouin, smeared as an African Mata Hari by the western media, survived two assassination attempts and fled to Paris. Her children were not allowed to go with her: they remained in the Congo as bargaining chips to buy her silence.</p>    <p>As well as acts of unspeakable cruelty, the film also introduces us to murderous gizmos that would have made 007\u2019s M envious. A CIA-agent nicknamed \u201cJoe from Paris\u201d travelled to the Congo armed with toothpaste concealing poison to be used in a so-called heart attack pistol to assassinate Lumumba. He was, Grimonprez argues, under orders from the Dulles brothers \u2013 John, who was President Eisenhower\u2019s secretary of state, and CIA director Allen. These were the two Americans subject to Winston Churchill\u2019s withering assessment, quoted in the film: \u201cDull, duller, Dulles.\u201d</p> <p>As for jazz\u2019s role in Lumumba\u2019s downfall, Grimonpez\u2019s film reveals how the great trumpeter Louis \u201cSatchmo\u201d Armstrong became embroiled in the Dulles brothers\u2019 machinations as a cultural ambassador to the Congo. It was as fatuous a policy as sending Taylor Swift or Beyonc\u00e9 to bring about peace in the Middle East. No matter: jazz was used as soft power to spread American values to counter the Soviet threat, and as handmaiden to the CIA\u2019s destabilisation of elected governments. Says Grimonprez: \u201cDave Brubeck was sent to Syria, Armstrong went to Katanga [the short-lived state established inside the Congo in 1960] to give it legitimacy.\u201d</p> <p>Grimonprez doesn\u2019t portray Satchmo as CIA stooge, though. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a passive instrument. He refused to play in apartheid South Africa and when he found out what the state department were plotting in Katanga and that he was being used to gather information for the CIA, he was furious. He threatened to leave America and go live in Ghana.\u201d</p> <p>The film includes footage of a concert Armstrong gave in Accra before Ghana\u2019s first post-independence leader Kwame Nkrumah. We see Nkrumah in the audience quietly crying as Armstrong sings (What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue:</p> <p>\u201cMy only sin is in my skin / What did I do to be so black and blue? / I\u2019m white inside but, that don\u2019t help my case / This life can\u2019t hide what is in my face\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe changed the words when he sang that to Nkrumah,\u201d Grimonprez tells me, \u201cInstead of \u2018I\u2019m white inside\u2019, he sang \u2018I\u2019m right inside\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Yet despite his musical insights, Grimonprez is no jazz buff. I supposed that he realised that Lumumba\u2019s downfall coincided with such a golden age of jazz that he just flicked through his record collection to select his movie\u2019s soundtrack. This was the era, after all, of Coltrane\u2019s Giant Steps, Eric Dolphy\u2019s Out to Lunch, Miles Davis\u2019s Kind of Blue and Ornette Coleman\u2019s The Shape of Jazz to Come.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the other way round. I knew the politics but not the music. I found out about that,\u201d he says. Could he have made this documentary without jazz? \u201cNo. The music is integral to the film. If the politics is all about dividing and conquering, it\u2019s the music that brings people together. And even if it\u2019s a scream of anger, it can also be an energy that opts for a change in this world.\u201d</p>    <p>When we hear Nina Simone exquisitely perform Wild Is the Wind in the film, it\u2019s not hard to hear precisely that. Her motif of the derangement of love takes on other resonances. This wild wind may carry not just radioactive dust from a looming nuclear armageddon, but something more hopeful: the \u201cwinds of change\u201d evoked by Harold Macmillan in 1960.</p> <p>By that phrase, the British prime minister meant the end of white colonial rule from Delhi to Accra (if not in apartheid Cape Town, where he made that speech). Soundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat opens a new perspective on the cold war in which the west is afraid not of reds under the bed, but Black Africans running their own contras. True, one reason the CIA was involved in the Congolese domestic politics was out of fear that the Kremlin might get its hands on Congo\u2019s Uranium-235 stocks after the country became independent from Belgium. But the US and its allies, Grimonprez convincingly suggests, were battling another foe. \u201cThey were terrified of the United States of Africa proposed by Kwame Nkrumah. Stanleyville [today Kisangani, capital of Tshopo Province] would have been the capital of that United States, by the way. The west was never going to allow that to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Congo was the focus for that new front in the cold war because of fears the material wealth of this long-exploited colony would fall into the wrong hands. </p> <p>For a few moments in 1960, though, the Congo might have been different. \u201cWith your kiss my life begins,\u201d sings Simone on Wild Is the Wind, and, as she sings, Black Africa\u2019s life and Congolese self-rule was beginning. Another song, Ind\u00e9pendence Cha Cha by the king of Congolese rumba <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Grand_Kall%C3%A9\">Joseph Kabasele</a>, quoted in the film, captures that short-lived pan-Africanist joy:</p> <p>\u201cInd\u00e9pendance, cha-cha, tozoui e / Oh! Kimpwanza cha-cha, tubakidi\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIndependence we\u2019ve won it / Oh! Independence we\u2019ve achieved it)</p> <p>But they hadn\u2019t. \u201cThe Congo was too valuable an asset for it to be allowed to be truly independent,\u201d says Grimonprez. Every war in the 20th century was fought with minerals from the Congo. The rights to its uranium have been signed away in perpetuity.\u201d Novelist In Koli Jean Bofane, author of Congo Inc, points out it in the film that without Congolese raw materials, the US would not have been able to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nor fire bullets in Vietnam.</p> <p>In the film, there is a heart-catching sequence when we hear John Coltrane blowing a few peerless bars from My Favourite Things. The music cuts off abruptly. We see tanks rolling through the Congo as the military coup subverts democracy. We cut back to Coltrane, his face contorted in rapturous agony as he blows his now-unheard solo. Grimonprez thereby shows us the tragic disconnect between Congolese aspiration and reality and that paradox, inexpressible pain. It\u2019s a pain described in the film by In Koli Jean Bofane: \u201cNobody sees the tears of a fish.\u201d Soundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat, most remarkably, finds a way of making us see and feel what we miss in our everyday experience \u2013 that pain, those tears, that tragedy. </p> <p>\u2022 Soundtrack to a Coup D\u2019Etat is released in the UK on 15 November</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 November 2024. An earlier version described Kisangani as the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is in fact the capital of Tshopo Province.</p>",

The film quotes US President Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s reported hope that \u201cLumumba would fall into a river full of crocodiles\u201d. \u201cLumumba was no communist,\u201d says Grimonprez when I put this to him. \u201cHe was a Black nationalist like many African leaders at the time.\u201d Footage suggests he was also an immensely charismatic man, who spoke eloquent truth to power. We see him amid the pomp and circumstance of Congo\u2019s Independence Day ceremony on 30 June 1960, when he told dignitaries, including the Belgian king, of his pride in leading the push for Congolese liberation: \u201c[I]t was a noble and just struggle, and indispensable to put an end to the humiliating slavery which was imposed upon us by force.\u201d King Baudouin was reportedly livid at Lumumba\u2019s ungrateful tone. Six months later, after being ousted from office by western-backed army officer Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu, Lumumba was kidnapped and tortured, then finally shot dead by Belgians under orders from the Katangan government. While some think it speculative that the CIA was involved, Grimonprez has no doubts: \u201cEisenhower got his wish.\u201d His body was dug from its shallow grave, dissolved with sulphuric acid and the bones ground up. Others in Lumumba\u2019s circle were a little more fortunate. Lumumba\u2019s chief of protocol, Andr\u00e9e Blouin, smeared as an African Mata Hari by the western media, survived two assassination attempts and fled to Paris. Her children were not allowed to go with her: they remained in the Congo as bargaining chips to buy her silence. As well as acts of unspeakable cruelty, the film also introduces us to murderous gizmos that would have made 007\u2019s M envious. A CIA-agent nicknamed \u201cJoe from Paris\u201d travelled to the Congo armed with toothpaste concealing poison to be used in a so-called heart attack pistol to assassinate Lumumba. He was, Grimonprez argues, under orders from the Dulles brothers \u2013 John, who was President Eisenhower\u2019s secretary of state, and CIA director Allen. These were the two Americans subject to Winston Churchill\u2019s withering assessment, quoted in the film: \u201cDull, duller, Dulles.\u201d As for jazz\u2019s role in Lumumba\u2019s downfall, Grimonpez\u2019s film reveals how the great trumpeter Louis \u201cSatchmo\u201d Armstrong became embroiled in the Dulles brothers\u2019 machinations as a cultural ambassador to the Congo. It was as fatuous a policy as sending Taylor Swift or Beyonc\u00e9 to bring about peace in the Middle East. No matter: jazz was used as soft power to spread American values to counter the Soviet threat, and as handmaiden to the CIA\u2019s destabilisation of elected governments. Says Grimonprez: \u201cDave Brubeck was sent to Syria, Armstrong went to Katanga [the short-lived state established inside the Congo in 1960] to give it legitimacy.\u201d Grimonprez doesn\u2019t portray Satchmo as CIA stooge, though. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a passive instrument. He refused to play in apartheid South Africa and when he found out what the state department were plotting in Katanga and that he was being used to gather information for the CIA, he was furious. He threatened to leave America and go live in Ghana.\u201d The film includes footage of a concert Armstrong gave in Accra before Ghana\u2019s first post-independence leader Kwame Nkrumah. We see Nkrumah in the audience quietly crying as Armstrong sings (What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue: \u201cMy only sin is in my skin / What did I do to be so black and blue? / I\u2019m white inside but, that don\u2019t help my case / This life can\u2019t hide what is in my face\u201d \u201cHe changed the words when he sang that to Nkrumah,\u201d Grimonprez tells me, \u201cInstead of \u2018I\u2019m white inside\u2019, he sang \u2018I\u2019m right inside\u2019.\u201d Yet despite his musical insights, Grimonprez is no jazz buff. I supposed that he realised that Lumumba\u2019s downfall coincided with such a golden age of jazz that he just flicked through his record collection to select his movie\u2019s soundtrack. This was the era, after all, of Coltrane\u2019s Giant Steps, Eric Dolphy\u2019s Out to Lunch, Miles Davis\u2019s Kind of Blue and Ornette Coleman\u2019s The Shape of Jazz to Come. \u201cIt was the other way round. I knew the politics but not the music. I found out about that,\u201d he says. Could he have made this documentary without jazz? \u201cNo. The music is integral to the film. If the politics is all about dividing and conquering, it\u2019s the music that brings people together. And even if it\u2019s a scream of anger, it can also be an energy that opts for a change in this world.\u201d When we hear Nina Simone exquisitely perform Wild Is the Wind in the film, it\u2019s not hard to hear precisely that. Her motif of the derangement of love takes on other resonances. This wild wind may carry not just radioactive dust from a looming nuclear armageddon, but something more hopeful: the \u201cwinds of change\u201d evoked by Harold Macmillan in 1960. By that phrase, the British prime minister meant the end of white colonial rule from Delhi to Accra (if not in apartheid Cape Town, where he made that speech). Soundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat opens a new perspective on the cold war in which the west is afraid not of reds under the bed, but Black Africans running their own contras. True, one reason the CIA was involved in the Congolese domestic politics was out of fear that the Kremlin might get its hands on Congo\u2019s Uranium-235 stocks after the country became independent from Belgium. But the US and its allies, Grimonprez convincingly suggests, were battling another foe. \u201cThey were terrified of the United States of Africa proposed by Kwame Nkrumah. Stanleyville [today Kisangani, capital of Tshopo Province] would have been the capital of that United States, by the way. The west was never going to allow that to happen.\u201d Congo was the focus for that new front in the cold war because of fears the material wealth of this long-exploited colony would fall into the wrong hands. For a few moments in 1960, though, the Congo might have been different. \u201cWith your kiss my life begins,\u201d sings Simone on Wild Is the Wind, and, as she sings, Black Africa\u2019s life and Congolese self-rule was beginning. Another song, Ind\u00e9pendence Cha Cha by the king of Congolese rumba Joseph Kabasele, quoted in the film, captures that short-lived pan-Africanist joy: \u201cInd\u00e9pendance, cha-cha, tozoui e / Oh! Kimpwanza cha-cha, tubakidi\u201d \u201cIndependence we\u2019ve won it / Oh! Independence we\u2019ve achieved it) But they hadn\u2019t. \u201cThe Congo was too valuable an asset for it to be allowed to be truly independent,\u201d says Grimonprez. Every war in the 20th century was fought with minerals from the Congo. The rights to its uranium have been signed away in perpetuity.\u201d Novelist In Koli Jean Bofane, author of Congo Inc, points out it in the film that without Congolese raw materials, the US would not have been able to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nor fire bullets in Vietnam. In the film, there is a heart-catching sequence when we hear John Coltrane blowing a few peerless bars from My Favourite Things. The music cuts off abruptly. We see tanks rolling through the Congo as the military coup subverts democracy. We cut back to Coltrane, his face contorted in rapturous agony as he blows his now-unheard solo. Grimonprez thereby shows us the tragic disconnect between Congolese aspiration and reality and that paradox, inexpressible pain. It\u2019s a pain described in the film by In Koli Jean Bofane: \u201cNobody sees the tears of a fish.\u201d Soundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat, most remarkably, finds a way of making us see and feel what we miss in our everyday experience \u2013 that pain, those tears, that tragedy. \u2022 Soundtrack to a Coup D\u2019Etat is released in the UK on 15 November \u2022 This article was amended on 14 November 2024. An earlier version described Kisangani as the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is in fact the capital of Tshopo Province.",

      "bodyText": "The Post Office plans to close more than 100 branches and says about 2,000 jobs are at risk in a move that has been condemned by unions as \u201ctone deaf and immoral\u201d after the Horizon IT scandal. The Post Office confirmed on Wednesday it was seeking to offload 115 branches, known as crown post offices, it centrally owns, but said it expected to maintain the total network at 11,500 branches across the UK. The plans come against the backdrop of the public inquiry into Horizon , described as one of the worst miscarriages of justice in UK history. The closures put at risk approximately 1,000 jobs, although the Post Office expects that all the branches will be refranchised to new owners over the next five years. Approximately 2,000 branches are operated by partners including Tesco, WH Smith and Morrisons, and about 9,000 are run by independent operators that have a contract with the Post Office. The Post Office is also \u201cstreamlining\u201d its central operations, with speculation that this will lead to about 1,000 further job cuts. The plans also include increasing post office branch owner remuneration by \u00a3250m annually by 2030, with up to \u00a3120m in additional remuneration by the end of the first year of the five-year plan, a 30% increase in the operators\u2019 share of revenue. Nigel Railton, the chair of the Post Office, said: \u201cThe Post Office has a 360-year history of public service and today we want to secure that service for the future by learning from past mistakes and moving forward for the benefit of all postmasters. We can, and will, restore pride in working for a business with a legacy of service, rather than one of scandal.\u201d The Post Office said its remaining directly managed branches were lossmaking and that it was in talks with unions about \u201cfuture options\u201d for the businesses. The organisation has been moving to a fully franchised branch model over a number of years; in 2012 the Post Office had almost 400 wholly owned branches. However, the Communications Workers Union (CWU) condemned the closure plans. Its general secretary, Dave Ward, said: \u201cFor the company to announce the closure of hundreds of post offices hot on the heels of the Horizon scandal is as tone deaf as it is immoral. \u201cCWU members are victims of the Horizon scandal and for them to now fear for their jobs ahead of Christmas is yet another cruel attack.\u201d Ward called the planned cuts a \u201cshambolic decision\u201d and said Labour should act to ensure it did \u201cnot become the government that targeted elderly people with the removal of the winter fuel allowance and then saw crucial services they rely on removed\u201d. The Post Office said the planned increase in the operators\u2019 share of revenue remained subject to securing funding from the government, which is the sole shareholder of the company, but that it would double the average remuneration at each branch by 2030. The government said it was in \u201cactive discussions\u201d with the Post Office about the proposed cuts. \u201cPost offices are an integral part of the communities they serve and the services they provide for local people,\u201d a spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said. \u201cThe government is in active discussion with Nigel Railton on his plans to put postmasters at the centre of the organisation and strengthen the post office network for its long-term future.\u201d Part of the \u201cnew deal\u201d also includes establishing a postmaster panel consisting of serving branch owner-operators to \u201chelp the business to improve the support and training it provides to postmasters\u201d.In a speech to staff and subpostmasters Railton said that nearly half of all branches are either loss-making or only make a small profit from the Post Office business. This week the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, expressed his support for the long-term future of the Post Office under a new model of governance that would include branch operators. While Reynolds was open to options such as mutualisation, he said the structure of the business model had to change to be sustainable. \u201cI think despite the scale of this scandal, the Post Office is still an incredibly important institution in national life,\u201d he said. \u201cAs an institution, as a brand, there is still tremendous affection and desire for the Post Office to have a strong future.\u201d However, he pointed out that the Post Office required a large annual taxpayer subsidy and the underwriting of various liabilities such as compensation schemes and the ballooning cost of a replacement for Horizon.

Details of this late 19th-century case of mansplaining are laid out in a new book by the Pulitzer prize-winning Washington Post art critic Sebastian Smee, which explores how impressionism emerged as a response to the siege of Paris and the attendant civil and political tumult of the time. In the book \u2013 Paris in Ruins: Love, War and the Birth of Impressionism \u2013 Smee gives an account of an incident involving \u00c9douard Manet and his friend and fellow painter Berthe Morisot, who would eventually marry Manet\u2019s younger brother, Eug\u00e8ne. An excerpt, published in the Art Newspaper, reveals how Morisot \u2013 who is considered one of the great impressionists \u2013 was working on a portrait of her mother and sister that she intended to submit to the Salon of 1870 when Manet called at her home and offered to help out. Knowing that she was feeling \u201cdubious\u201d about the picture, Manet had already told her: \u201cYou may put yourself in my hands. I shall tell you what needs to be done.\u201d What Manet did next, according to Smee, \u201cwas so painful to Morisot that it stayed with her for years\u201d. Despite an initially positive reaction to the painting, Manet concluded that a lower part of one of the dresses in it wasn\u2019t quite working. \u201cBefore she could say anything, he picked up her brushes and put in \u2018a few accents\u2019,\u201d Smee writes, citing an account of the episode that Morisot gave to her sister Edma, who was also a painter. \u201cOnce started, nothing could stop him; from the skirt he went to the bust, from the bust to the head, from the head to the background,\u201d Morisot recalled. \u201cHe cracked a thousand jokes, laughed like a madman, handed me the palette, took it back; finally, by five o\u2019clock in the afternoon we had made the prettiest caricature that was ever seen.\u201d As the carter tasked with transporting the painting from the studio to the Salon jury was waiting, Manet encouraged her to dispatch the work forthwith. \u201cAnd now I am left confounded,\u201d Morisot wrote. \u201cMy only hope is that I shall be rejected.\u201d Her mother, she added, was \u201cin ecstasies\u201d, finding it all very amusing, \u201cbut I find it agonising\u201d. The art of Morisot, who died of pneumonia at the age of 54 in 1895, examined what the art critic Laura Cumming has described as an \u201cinfinitely subtle and secretive\u201d world of women. Reviewing an exhibition of Morisot\u2019s paintings in London last year, Cumming noted that her work had little in common with her male contemporaries. \u201cIt would be hard to think of an impressionist with a more evanescent and shifting technique, more absorbingly strange and indeterminate surfaces, into which you look as if seeking clues to the ever-changing movements of a mind,\u201d she wrote in the Observer. \u201cMorisot never settles into a trademark look, a fixed and recognisable style.\u201d In the same review, Cumming recalls what Manet wrote when he first met the Morisot sisters in 1868 and realised that their talent was likely to be dismissed by the male establishment. \u201cWhat a shame,\u201d said Manet, \u201cthey are not men.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Kevin Rudd\u2019s historical criticisms of Donald Trump have caught the eye of some in the US president-elect\u2019s inner circle \u2013 and prompted renewed debate about whether the incoming administration could seek retribution. This week Dan Scavino, a senior adviser to Trump, reposted Rudd\u2019s congratulatory statement to the president-elect on social media with a gif of an hourglass. That move has reignited suggestions that the incoming president may prefer another Australian representative in Washington when he takes office in January. A new video emerged earlier this week of Rudd in an interview in 2021 describing Trump as \u201ca village idiot\u201d and \u201cnot a leading intellectual force\u201d. Rudd last week \u2013 after the US election \u2013 deleted old social media posts criticising Trump. The former prime minister is Australia\u2019s highest profile envoy in one of its most important diplomatic posts. His status highlights the distinction between career diplomats and political appointees and the processes for sending them abroad \u2013 and home. While some Australian critics are calling for Rudd to be replaced, others \u2013 including his predecessor and former Liberal senator Arthur Sinodinos \u2013 have warned that kowtowing would be a damaging move. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The Albanese government continues to stand by Rudd as the best person to serve as Australia\u2019s ambassador to Washington DC. But could Trump do anything to remove him? How is an ambassador appointed? Diplomatic appointments are governed by the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. When a country nominates a new ambassador, the advance clearance process involves a \u201cdemarche\u201d \u2013 a formal request from one government to another that allows the destination country to raise any significant objections it may have. The convention allows the host to reject a nominee but it\u2019s usually a routine approval process. Once accepted and dispatched, the appointee presents credentials formally on arrival, usually in person to the host country\u2019s leader. That approval transcends a change of host-nation administration. Could Trump really fire Rudd? Under article 9 of the convention, the host nation\u2019s leader can declare a country\u2019s head of mission \u2013 or any other member of its diplomatic staff \u2013 persona non grata, requiring that person\u2019s withdrawal and with no explanation required. The home country is then expected to either recall its diplomat or terminate their official responsibilities at the mission. In the US, the expulsion precedent dates back far further, to 1793, when France\u2019s first ambassador, Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat, attracted the ire of President George Washington for encouraging American privateers to join the French Revolution in violation of Washington\u2019s neutrality position. How big a deal would it be if he did? It would be a huge diplomatic incident if Trump was to declare Rudd persona non grata under the Vienna convention. Expulsions of lower-level diplomatic staff from countries with which the US has tensions occur more regularly, for example where they may be accused of being undeclared intelligence operatives. But formally invoking article 9 against the head of mission of a friendly country would be an extraordinary move. The Australian National University international law professor Donald Rothwell says he doubts Trump would take that step. \u201cI just cannot perceive that the Vienna convention would be relied upon in the case of an Australian ambassador,\u201d Rothwell says. \u201cAs things stand at the moment, it would cause a very significant rift in diplomatic relations.\u201d But he says the Australian government \u201cmay be put in a position of saying we really need to replace this ambassador to ensure there is a good relationship\u201d and ensure the Aukus nuclear submarine deal succeeds. Rothwell suggests any formal persona non grata declaration would be fatal for the submarine pact. \u201cIf the Vienna convention trigger was pulled and the Australian ambassador was declared persona non grata in the midst of Aukus treaty still winding its way through the parliamentary processes [in this country], it\u2019s doubtful whether Aukus would survive.\u201d Are there other ways the president could force a change of ambassador? The convention isn\u2019t the only option for Trump, if he decided he wanted a different Australian ambassador. Instead of using the formal expulsion process, with all that it would imply for the two countries\u2019 ties, he could make it known across the administration and on Capitol Hill that his government\u2019s agencies were not to deal with Rudd. Even less formally than that, if he simply reiterated his displeasure with Rudd\u2019s perceived attitude to him \u2013 as he\u2019s already done once, ahead of the election \u2013 his supporters may take that as a cue to make access more difficult, making Rudd\u2019s position extremely difficult. Trump has already forced one other Five Eyes ally\u2019s ambassador to withdraw over personal criticisms, albeit made as contemporary assessments at the time, and not historical reflections as Rudd\u2019s were. In late 2019, during the first Trump administration, Britain\u2019s ambassador Kim Darroch was forced to resign after cables he wrote back to London were leaked. The cables included frank assessments of Trump as \u201cinsecure\u201d and \u201cincompetent\u201d and described his administration as \u201cdiplomatically clumsy\u201d, \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional\u201d, predicting that it would \u201ccrash and burn\u201d. \u201cI do not know the ambassador, but he is not liked or well \u2026 thought of within the US.

The second applicant, DBD24, is a Vietnamese citizen who came to Australia by boat in April 2013. He was granted permission to reside in community detention, but he \u201cabsconded\u201d and was \u201cat large\u201d for eight years, the commonwealth submission revealed. DBD24 applied for a safe haven enterprise visa in November 2021, but it was refused in February 2022. He was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment for supply of commercial quantities of drugs, suspended after two years, and went into immigration detention in June 2023 after his release. In December 2023 the tribunal ordered his visa application be reconsidered. On 1 October 2024, DBD24 was granted his protection visa and released from detention. Lawyers for the applicants argue that \u201cthe executive detention of an alien who has made a visa application is punitive \u2026 if it is inevitable [they] will be released on the final determination of their visa application\u201d. Such detention \u201cfunctions as a form of punitive limbo, detaining them solely for the illegitimate purpose of segregation and doing so futilely because they must inevitably be released into the Australian community on the making of a visa decision, whatever that decision is\u201d, they said. The commonweath argues that the Migration Act requires non-citizens be detained \u201cfor the constitutionally permissible purpose of enabling visa applications to be investigated, considered, and determined\u201d. The NZYQ ruling on the limit on indefinite detention for the separate purpose of removing non-citizens has no bearing on the legality of detention for the \u201cadmission purpose\u201d, it says. Earlier in November the high court struck down a law imposing ankle bracelets and curfews on people released from detention, resulting in the government remaking regulations. Another potential high court defeat could be embarrassing for the government, but would probably trigger only a handful of new releases, as advocates report dozens of people with protection findings have already been released from detention. On Monday 4 November the general counsel of the home affairs department, Clare Sharp, told Senate estimates that 13 applicants had a \u201csimilar claim\u201d to CZA19 and DBD24 but \u201cthose matters have been resolved as their visa processes have been finalised\u201d. \u201cThey would have been resolved by the person either being granted a protection visa or being found not to be removable and being released from immigration detention as NYZQ affected,\u201d she said.",

Her pre-fame tweets include candid musings on pop culture (the iconic \u201cjust fuck the wolf!\u201d, as seen above), experiences at her old customer service job, and an <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/popheadscirclejerk/comments/1acgza0/some_gems_of_megans_old_tweets/\">ill-fated Miami trip</a>. </p> <h2>2.

Unbeknownst to her, the basement they run Pitchfork out of happens to be the new World Trade Center. Devoid of nuance as always, Twitter berated the singer for inciting terrorism and she immediately deleted her tweet.

This clip is a perfect example of everything that makes Azealia so intriguing as a public figure: the sharpest bob known to man, Edna Mode frames, boobs somehow defying gravity, body language making everyone in the room on edge and speaking with such frankness that no one knows how to respond.<strong><br></strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>This is a classic comedy of errors with the random producer becoming defensive at being called the gay intern, the failed attempt at creating drama when Azealia says she does in fact make music for gay people, topped off with the awkward silence before her infamous utterings: \u201cSo \u2026 what now?\u201d Lynchian and effortless.</p> <h2>6.

According to Williams, The Killer has no restraint and will attack as soon as you have your guard down. Is The Killer one person? Unknown. Is The Killer human? Unsure.

Tokyo Toni (mother of Blac Chyna) is at a nondescript red carpet event talking about recently coming out as bisexual, when she is asked if she thinks that a man giving another man fellatio is gay. She responds with the two words heard at gay bars all around the world: \u201cWell, yes!\u201d </p> <p>That refrain on its own changed the course of linguistic history, but the second half of this video also merits a mention. A mere 10 seconds after celebrating her bisexuality, Toni goes on to say that bisexuality does not exist, and she is gay. Sexuality is confusing and we come to terms with our labels at our own pace.

In the time between getting my first Twitter account at 13 to the Meta online megaverse of 2024, the internet has developed into what can only be described as a million different languages. What once used to go viral in 2012 is swept away in today\u2019s oversaturated and algorithmically rigged ocean. The iconic blue and black dress would barely get 20 likes in the cold hard light of El*n M*sk\u2019s X. Over the last 14 years I\u2019ve downloaded and then deleted every social media app probably every 12 months. Sometimes I feel like a veteran of the internet, fluent in multiple dialects and a witness to the evolution of online humour, from the low-res theatrical nature of \u201coh my god shoes\u201d to the candid charm of front-facing anecdotes like \u201cdemure\u201d. The things that have resonated with me during my time online aren\u2019t necessarily designed to be hilarious, but more bizarre misinterpretations or chance interactions whose lore takes on a life of its own. 1. Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s old tweets A hugely underrated part of Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s charm is her effortless sense of humour, as captured delightfully in her 15-year-old Twitter account. Her pre-fame tweets include candid musings on pop culture (the iconic \u201cjust fuck the wolf!\u201d, as seen above), experiences at her old customer service job, and an ill-fated Miami trip. 2. Halsey accidentally calls for a second 9/11 At the beginning of 2020, musician Halsey received a bad review from Pitchfork for her latest album and like any true millennial/Gen Z cusp, she promptly subtweeted about her dissatisfaction: \u201cwill the basement that they run p*tchfork out of just collapse already\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Despite paying for private health insurance for the last four years, Jessica* has no idea who will deliver her baby. The first-time mother felt assured by the policy\u2019s promise of continuity of care and comforted that the doctor who saw her at the beginning of her pregnancy would be there to deliver her baby when her January due date arrived. Instead, she discovered there was no private obstetrician to deliver her baby in Lismore, in the northern rivers area of New South Wales. The city\u2019s only private hospital also has no maternity service, meaning her only private option is to drive almost 150km to the Gold Coast. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have to be on the road for an hour and a half if I was to go into spontaneous labour,\u201d she says. As more private hospitals close their maternity wards, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (Ranzcog) says more women like Jessica are facing limited choices in maternity care. Ranzcog says it is a symptom of the gender bias in the funding for private health services, where procedures for men attract higher rebates. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The peak body says the stoush between private hospitals and health insurers is exacerbating the issue. Hospitals are concerned about the rising costs of providing care and asking insurers to pay more, while insurers argue they are paying hospitals fairly and that consumers with health insurance should not be asked to pay more. In the meantime, nine private hospitals closed their maternity wards between 2015 and 2023, and two private hospitals with maternity services ceased operating. Ranzcog says these issues are limiting women\u2019s health choices. The peak body will hold a roundtable on Thursday when the government and industry stakeholders will discuss the future of private obstetrics and gynaecology. It follows a government review of the private hospital sector\u2019s financial viability which found obstetrics is a service \u201cof concern\u201d and becoming \u201cincreasingly difficult to offer\u201d. Dr Heather Waterfall, Ranzcog\u2019s South Australia and Northern Territory chair, says private insurers, Medicare and private hospitals do not provide women\u2019s health with the same level of funding or support as men\u2019s health. For example, specialists get paid less to do a more complex ultrasound on a woman than a routine simple scrotal ultrasound on a man. Private hospitals also have limited theatre availability, Waterfall says, and will prioritise the patients of orthopaedic surgeons and urologists who bring in more money because they bring in higher returns. She has been advised not to book endometrial ablations, a procedure to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding, unless women are insured with two private insurers, because otherwise \u201cit actually loses money for the hospital\u201d. Because the private health insurers do not pay the private hospitals sufficiently for obstetric and gynaecological services, they are the first to be closed down when the hospital comes under financial pressure, Waterfall says. The CEO of the Australian Private Hospitals Association, Brett Heffernan, said: \u201cUnfortunately, as the main mechanism for funding services in private hospitals is private health insurance, and as those payments have not kept pace with indexation, some hospitals have had to make the tough decision to close services, or close hospitals.\u201d But Dr Rachel David, the CEO of Private Healthcare Australia (PHA), which represents the private health insurers, says factors affecting the viability of private maternity services are mostly beyond the insurers\u2019 control. She points to economic and social factors driving down the birthrate, a limited specialist workforce, and high fees being charged by obstetricians. \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned that if obstetricians are getting fewer patients, they will increase their fees even more to make up for this,\u201d David says. \u201cThis is causing a vicious cycle which could eventually end private maternity.\u201d David says PHA has urged the government to allow health funds to contribute to more affordable, contemporary models of care such as paying midwives and GPs more for their work in private hospitals. In the meantime, Ranzcog says patients with potentially complex, painful conditions like endometriosis can\u2019t rely on the public health system for care either, which is increasingly showing cracks. Amber* eventually upgraded her private health insurance after almost two years on the public waitlist for surgery to treat the condition. After Amber became \u201cabsolutely distraught\u201d from the pain she suffered while on the waitlist, her gynaecologist advised her it would be quicker for her to upgrade her private health insurance and wait the 12 month cooling off period. As soon as it ended, she went back to see her gynaecologist. \u201cI said that you were right. I still haven\u2019t moved on the public health system and can I get surgery now?\u201d Amber told them. Amber was booked two weeks later. She was still $3,000 out of pocket after the surgery, but says she is \u201choping that there\u2019s a new chapter on the end of this\u201d. Ged Kearney, the assistant health minister and chair of the National Women\u2019s Health Advisory Council, will attend Thursday\u2019s roundtable and says: \u201cWhether it in be the public or private system, in health and medical research, or disparities in costs faced by women, there are many ways that gender bias creeps into our healthcare system.\u201d The government is conducting an audit of the Medicare Benefits Scheme to examine gender-based differences, she says. \u201cFor too long women\u2019s health has been ignored and overlooked.\u201d *First name only used to protect medical privacy.",

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Central to Alexander\u2019s warning are indications as to the likely station locations, and his concerns these locations will dramatically restrict the potential for value capture \u2013 a tax on the future sale of land and homes in the vicinity of stations where the value has skyrocketed due to the new infrastructure. He says parliamentary inquiries and expert advisers have found value capture will be essential to fund the project\u2019s multibillion-dollar price tag. Alexander\u2019s alarm follows the start of geotechnical drilling by the HRSA into rocks and riverbeds on the New South Wales central coast to determine the optimal route for the tunnelling project needed for a one-hour fast train between Sydney and Newcastle with a stop halfway at Gosford. Drill rigs have started work on the Hawkesbury River at Brooklyn and at Brisbane Water near Gosford.

The rest of the cast, even the charismatic Gideon, are as inert.

So his amateur boxing club manager (Cyril Blake) has the inspired idea he should represent St Vincent instead. He goes on to knock Britain out of the contest \u2013 and win his gold. The drama in this alone is enough to carry a play, but like everything else, we are told rather than shown its impact.</p> <p>Lucas\u2019s peer group of boxers included Frank Bruno, whose personal life took a similar turn when he was sectioned, while the life of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/10/vernon-vanriel-windrush-boxer-who-lost-everything-then-battled-his-way-back\">Vernon Vanriel</a>, another Windrush generation boxer, was marked by prejudice and depression. Lucas\u2019s trajectory, within this bigger picture, follows a pattern of mental illness intersecting with bigger systemic forces. There is some attempt to draw this out but it is dramatically ineffective. You should feel so much more for Lucas than you do.</p> <p>For me this story has a personal resonance: Lucas, who died last year, spent his last days in the same London care home as my father. I passed him often and knew he had been a boxer, long ago. In those fleeting exchanges I felt a keen sense of Lucas\u2019s untold story. But in this production you do not feel its magnitude.

So his amateur boxing club manager (Cyril Blake) has the inspired idea he should represent St Vincent instead. He goes on to knock Britain out of the contest \u2013 and win his gold. The drama in this alone is enough to carry a play, but like everything else, we are told rather than shown its impact. Lucas\u2019s peer group of boxers included Frank Bruno, whose personal life took a similar turn when he was sectioned, while the life of Vernon Vanriel, another Windrush generation boxer, was marked by prejudice and depression. Lucas\u2019s trajectory, within this bigger picture, follows a pattern of mental illness intersecting with bigger systemic forces. There is some attempt to draw this out but it is dramatically ineffective. You should feel so much more for Lucas than you do. For me this story has a personal resonance: Lucas, who died last year, spent his last days in the same London care home as my father. I passed him often and knew he had been a boxer, long ago. In those fleeting exchanges I felt a keen sense of Lucas\u2019s untold story. But in this production you do not feel its magnitude. Sadly, a big miss. At Park theatre, London, until 30 November",

The work and pensions secretary stressed she wanted all people eligible for pension credit to have the benefit, regardless of whether it could limit the government\u2019s attempt to repair the \u201cdire state\u201d of public finances. Ministers launched a pension credit publicity campaign in August, yet Kendall told the Commons work and pensions select committee 800,000 eligible pensioners had still not applied for it. Winter fuel payments have been restricted so only those claiming pension credit from this winter are eligible to receive the benefit worth up to \u00a3300. The government made the decision in the hope of saving \u00a31.5bn a year, although a boost in people securing pension credit will naturally reduce the amount of money saved. Many Labour MPs remain privately concerned about the government\u2019s decision to radically restrict winter fuel payments, over fears poorer pensioners will have to make choices between heating and eating a decent meal. Kendall said: \u201cI would like every pensioner who is entitled to pension credit, up to \u00a33,900, to get it, yes,\u201d she told the Commons work and pensions committee.

The social security advisory committee, a group of independent experts who advise the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), has said the savings from limiting the allowance to only the poorest pensioners are unclear and could be outdone by a rise in those seeking pension credit.

Last year, a real-life sibling group, lost in the Colombian rainforest, left a trail behind them as they wandered missing for 40 days: nappies, a baby bottle, a dummy. The four brothers and sisters, aged between 11 months and 13 years old, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/10/colombian-children-found-alive-five-weeks-after-amazon-jungle-plane-crash\">had been travelling on a small plane</a> that crashed over a remote part of the Amazon, killing the three adults on board \u2013 including their mother, a member of the Indigenous Huitoto people. The remarkable story of the search and rescue, and the children\u2019s survival, is told in this Netflix documentary.</p> <p>The fate of the missing children, swallowed up by the forest, gripped Colombia. Immediately after the plane came down, two search parties frantically began combing the area.

      "bodyText": "In the fairytale, Hansel and Gretel dropped pebbles and breadcrumbs. Last year, a real-life sibling group, lost in the Colombian rainforest, left a trail behind them as they wandered missing for 40 days: nappies, a baby bottle, a dummy. The four brothers and sisters, aged between 11 months and 13 years old, had been travelling on a small plane that crashed over a remote part of the Amazon, killing the three adults on board \u2013 including their mother, a member of the Indigenous Huitoto people. The remarkable story of the search and rescue, and the children\u2019s survival, is told in this Netflix documentary. The fate of the missing children, swallowed up by the forest, gripped Colombia. Immediately after the plane came down, two search parties frantically began combing the area. The military\u2019s effort, known as Operation Hope, involved a fine-tooth comb search by elite soldiers, with helicopters with megaphones playing a recording of the children\u2019s grandmother telling them to stay put in one place and keep close to water.

      "body": "<p>Hi everyone. The first thing you\u2019ll notice about this newsletter is that I\u2019m not Nesrine. But don\u2019t worry, we don\u2019t need her to have a good time. I\u2019m Jason, the editor of The Long Wave, and I\u2019ll be writing the newsletter this week and occasionally in the future.</p> <p>Last month I attended a pop-up in London for the pioneering British-Ghanaian DJ and producer Juls. If you\u2019re a fan of African music, like me, you\u2019ll know that when a track opens with \u201cJuls, baby\u201d you\u2019re about to hear straight fire (for the uninitiated, start with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RstK5waga3o\">Wizkid\u2019s True Love </a>and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbPv2C8R__0\">Wande Coal\u2019s So Mi So</a>). So I was very excited to meet the man himself as he celebrated 10 years shaping modern Afrobeats, and the launch of his most recent album, which takes listeners on a journey through the sounds and traditions of the global Black diaspora. First, here\u2019s the weekly roundup.</p> <h2><strong>Weekly roundup</strong></h2>    <p><em><strong>Racist texts after Trump\u2019s win</strong></em><strong> </strong>| Black people across the US have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/racist-text-messages-trump-win\">receiving racist messages</a> telling them they have been selected to \u201cpick cotton\u201d and need to report to \u201cthe nearest plantation\u201d in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s election win. The president-elect\u2019s campaign has denied any association with them.</p> <p><em><strong>Big oil payouts in Guyana</strong></em> | Hundreds of thousands of Guyanese citizens at home and abroad will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/guyana-cash-payouts-oil-wealth\">receive a payout of GY$100,000</a>, as the country attempts to redistribute its oil wealth, Natricia Duncan reports. Since Guyana began crude oil extraction in late 2019, its economy has enjoyed incredible growth.<br><br><em><strong>Buz Stop Boys</strong></em><em><strong> sweep Ghana\u2019s streets</strong></em> | A group of young professionals and tradespeople are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2l9kdznkzko\">\u201cdriving a new wave of civic responsibility in Ghana\u201d</a> cleaning and sweeping away rubbish in Greater Accra, as well as clearing gutters and cutting overgrown grass. The collective hopes to inspire environmental consciousness and investment in proper methods of waste disposal.</p> <p><em><strong>A toast to Abidjan cocktail week</strong></em> | Ivory Coast\u2019s drinks festival, founded by the doctor turned mixologist Alexandre Quest Bede and \u201cAfrofoodie\u201d blogger Yasmine Fofana, is encouraging Africans to embrace their roots. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/08/africa-in-a-glass-abidjan-cocktail-week-mixes-local-flavours-for-global-palates\">Eromo Egbejule reports</a> that \u201cdue in part to colonial-era stigmatisation and bans, local gins and other alcoholic drinks have long been seen as unsafe [and] inferior\u201d.<br><br><em><strong>London Rastafarian HQ </strong></em><em><strong>revived</strong></em><strong> |</strong> A new exhibition will tell the story of the temple at St Agnes Place in London, which became a focal point for Rastafarian religion after a takeover in 1972. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/nov/09/exhibition-brings-london-hq-of-rastafarian-faith-back-to-life\">As Lanre Bakare reports</a>, Echoes Within These Walls hopes to \u201cdispel myths about the religion, which continues to be a big influence in popular culture\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>In depth: A cultural odyssey</strong></h2>    <p>When Juls conceptualised the album <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/peace-and-love/1771496417\">Peace &amp; Love</a>, he envisioned a cultural odyssey that drew on Black traditions, sounds and instruments around the world. Much of the album was made in Jamaica and Ghana, where he would create beats on his mother\u2019s balcony in Esiama, or rent a beach house in Kokrobite so he could hear the ocean. But to finish it off sonically, Juls headed to Brazil in the summer of 2023, where he added further details to his tracks. \u201cOn the album we\u2019ve got a song called Saint Tropez, which has elements of amapiano and highlife, but then there\u2019s some triangle sounds that I got from Brazil. There\u2019s a mix of different sounds I\u2019m hearing as I\u2019m going on these trips.\u201d</p> <p>These trips were also an opportunity for Juls to enrich himself culturally. In Jamaica, he visited Bob Marley\u2019s <a href=\"https://tuffgongmusic.com/studio/\">Tuff Gong Studio</a> in Kingston, where he made beats. \u201cI was just connecting with a lot of people who are deep in reggae music history. We spoke a lot to the Marley family, and we spoke to Bob Marley\u2019s engineer. It was a real music journey. I got to meet Augustus Pablo\u2019s son \u2013 we went to his record store and bought some vinyls as well.\u201d</p> <p>In Salvador, home to Brazil\u2019s largest Black community, he was reminded of Yoruba culture \u2013 \u201cthey still practise a lot of rituals over there\u201d. He made similar observations in Jamaica: \u201cWhen you go to the Accompong [Maroon] village, they practise a lot of the Ashanti rituals from Ghana. So there\u2019s a lot of similarities between parts of the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa that I found interesting.\u201d</p> <p>Juls was also struck by the use of instruments in the places he visited and how similar percussive sounds were transformed in new contexts. A staple of Afro-Brazilian music is the agog\u00f4, a bell with origins in Yoruba and Edo traditions. \u201cBut we don\u2019t call it that in Ghana, we call it Gan Gan,\u201d Juls says. Where Ghanaians use the kpanlogo drum, Brazilians may use the atabaque.</p> <p>For Juls, the Black diaspora\u2019s use of drums gave him an opportunity to \u201cplay with all of these sounds\u201d and provide a deeper layer of meaning to his music. On the opening track of his album, Leap of Faith, featuring the British artist Wretch 32, Nyabinghi drums are played, \u201cthese drums are used by Jamaicans and Ghanaians as a form of communication, celebrating their ancestors and showing praise. And they were also used to communicate in the village back in the day. In the beginning of the song there\u2019s a guy from my father\u2019s home town, Jamestown, who says: \u2018Everybody gather around and listen\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>\u2018I like to bring people together\u2019</strong></p>    <p>Juls is considered a maestro of Afrobeats, evidenced by the long list of artists who bring him on as a collaborator, but his curiosity stretches far beyond whatever limited perception people have of the genre, as he explores the interconnectedness of the diaspora. He loves mixing African and Brazilian music in his sets. He recounts <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6D4TL3bPic\">performing in S\u00e3o Paulo</a>, where the Brazilians were pleasantly surprised by his extensive knowledge of their genres.</p> <p>That passionate embrace of similarities and differences is something he literally wears around his neck. He shows me his chain, which he tells me is \u201can Adinkra symbol called Funtunfunefu Denkyemfunefu, which means unity and diversity. And that\u2019s just something that I live by \u2013 I just like to bring everybody together from different tribes.\u201d But in African music, there has at times been backlash over incorporations of different genres into a broader Afrobeats sound \u2013 there have especially been concerns around <a href=\"https://thenativemag.com/nigeria-amapiano-own-2/\">Nigerian artists \u201cappropriating\u201d amapiano music</a>, which is native to South Africa.</p> <p>But for Juls, this melting pot of African genres can be embraced so long as what is produced is always in dialogue with its originators. \u201cI\u2019ve tapped into amapiano quite a few times but I always make sure I\u2019m doing it with a South African artist or producer,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a song on my album called Muntuwam, which has an element of amapiano, and on there I have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW21M_s6PlM\">Nkosazana\u2019s Daughter</a>. She listened to the song and loved it, which made me feel great because that\u2019s coming from a South African who\u2019s deep into that sound. It means you\u2019re on the right path.\u201d</p> <p>Juls also sees this as something that charts the progression of Afrobeats from its birth in the early 2000s DJ sets \u2013 \u201cdata, internet, structure\u201d. There\u2019s an ability to authentically tap into genres around the world, from f\u00faj\u00ec to highlife and kwaito to soukous, because you\u2019re able to readily access information about this music. Afrobeats is thus less a coherent genre and more a label used for convenience. \u201cIf you really want to tap into the proper sound, you have to travel to these countries specifically, and do even deeper research.\u201d</p> <p>This curiosity is evidently booming for Black artists. He cites Asake\u2019s collaboration with the Afro-Brazilian singer-songwriter Ludmilla \u2013 Whine (one of my most played tracks from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/09/asake-lungu-boy-review-nigerian-superstar-trips-across-the-black-diaspora-with-help-from-stormzy\">Lungu Boy</a>) and even Tyler, the Creator\u2019s sampling of the Zamrock band Ngozi Family on NOID from his latest album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/28/tyler-the-creator-chromakopia-album-review\">Chromakopia</a>, as some of his favourite recent Black Atlantic link-ups.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear Juls is ready for his sound to enter a new chapter, bringing the Black diaspora with him. \u201cThe first 10 years have been about putting people in a good mood; the next 10 years, I\u2019m trying to make people dance.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What we\u2019re into</strong></h2>    <ul> <li><p>I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve played <strong>Tyla</strong>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLK2r3sG4lE\">Push 2 Start music video</a> \u2013 that song!

      "bodyText": "Hi everyone. The first thing you\u2019ll notice about this newsletter is that I\u2019m not Nesrine. But don\u2019t worry, we don\u2019t need her to have a good time. I\u2019m Jason, the editor of The Long Wave, and I\u2019ll be writing the newsletter this week and occasionally in the future. Last month I attended a pop-up in London for the pioneering British-Ghanaian DJ and producer Juls. If you\u2019re a fan of African music, like me, you\u2019ll know that when a track opens with \u201cJuls, baby\u201d you\u2019re about to hear straight fire (for the uninitiated, start with Wizkid\u2019s True Love and Wande Coal\u2019s So Mi So). So I was very excited to meet the man himself as he celebrated 10 years shaping modern Afrobeats, and the launch of his most recent album, which takes listeners on a journey through the sounds and traditions of the global Black diaspora. First, here\u2019s the weekly roundup. Weekly roundup Racist texts after Trump\u2019s win | Black people across the US have reported receiving racist messages telling them they have been selected to \u201cpick cotton\u201d and need to report to \u201cthe nearest plantation\u201d in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s election win. The president-elect\u2019s campaign has denied any association with them. Big oil payouts in Guyana | Hundreds of thousands of Guyanese citizens at home and abroad will receive a payout of GY$100,000, as the country attempts to redistribute its oil wealth, Natricia Duncan reports. Since Guyana began crude oil extraction in late 2019, its economy has enjoyed incredible growth. Buz Stop Boys sweep Ghana\u2019s streets | A group of young professionals and tradespeople are \u201cdriving a new wave of civic responsibility in Ghana\u201d cleaning and sweeping away rubbish in Greater Accra, as well as clearing gutters and cutting overgrown grass. The collective hopes to inspire environmental consciousness and investment in proper methods of waste disposal. A toast to Abidjan cocktail week | Ivory Coast\u2019s drinks festival, founded by the doctor turned mixologist Alexandre Quest Bede and \u201cAfrofoodie\u201d blogger Yasmine Fofana, is encouraging Africans to embrace their roots. Eromo Egbejule reports that \u201cdue in part to colonial-era stigmatisation and bans, local gins and other alcoholic drinks have long been seen as unsafe [and] inferior\u201d. London Rastafarian HQ revived | A new exhibition will tell the story of the temple at St Agnes Place in London, which became a focal point for Rastafarian religion after a takeover in 1972. As Lanre Bakare reports, Echoes Within These Walls hopes to \u201cdispel myths about the religion, which continues to be a big influence in popular culture\u201d. In depth: A cultural odyssey When Juls conceptualised the album Peace &amp; Love, he envisioned a cultural odyssey that drew on Black traditions, sounds and instruments around the world. Much of the album was made in Jamaica and Ghana, where he would create beats on his mother\u2019s balcony in Esiama, or rent a beach house in Kokrobite so he could hear the ocean. But to finish it off sonically, Juls headed to Brazil in the summer of 2023, where he added further details to his tracks. \u201cOn the album we\u2019ve got a song called Saint Tropez, which has elements of amapiano and highlife, but then there\u2019s some triangle sounds that I got from Brazil. There\u2019s a mix of different sounds I\u2019m hearing as I\u2019m going on these trips.\u201d These trips were also an opportunity for Juls to enrich himself culturally. In Jamaica, he visited Bob Marley\u2019s Tuff Gong Studio in Kingston, where he made beats. \u201cI was just connecting with a lot of people who are deep in reggae music history. We spoke a lot to the Marley family, and we spoke to Bob Marley\u2019s engineer. It was a real music journey. I got to meet Augustus Pablo\u2019s son \u2013 we went to his record store and bought some vinyls as well.\u201d In Salvador, home to Brazil\u2019s largest Black community, he was reminded of Yoruba culture \u2013 \u201cthey still practise a lot of rituals over there\u201d. He made similar observations in Jamaica: \u201cWhen you go to the Accompong [Maroon] village, they practise a lot of the Ashanti rituals from Ghana. So there\u2019s a lot of similarities between parts of the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa that I found interesting.\u201d Juls was also struck by the use of instruments in the places he visited and how similar percussive sounds were transformed in new contexts. A staple of Afro-Brazilian music is the agog\u00f4, a bell with origins in Yoruba and Edo traditions. \u201cBut we don\u2019t call it that in Ghana, we call it Gan Gan,\u201d Juls says. Where Ghanaians use the kpanlogo drum, Brazilians may use the atabaque. For Juls, the Black diaspora\u2019s use of drums gave him an opportunity to \u201cplay with all of these sounds\u201d and provide a deeper layer of meaning to his music. On the opening track of his album, Leap of Faith, featuring the British artist Wretch 32, Nyabinghi drums are played, \u201cthese drums are used by Jamaicans and Ghanaians as a form of communication, celebrating their ancestors and showing praise. And they were also used to communicate in the village back in the day. In the beginning of the song there\u2019s a guy from my father\u2019s home town, Jamestown, who says: \u2018Everybody gather around and listen\u2019.\u201d *** \u2018I like to bring people together\u2019 Juls is considered a maestro of Afrobeats, evidenced by the long list of artists who bring him on as a collaborator, but his curiosity stretches far beyond whatever limited perception people have of the genre, as he explores the interconnectedness of the diaspora. He loves mixing African and Brazilian music in his sets. He recounts performing in S\u00e3o Paulo, where the Brazilians were pleasantly surprised by his extensive knowledge of their genres. That passionate embrace of similarities and differences is something he literally wears around his neck. He shows me his chain, which he tells me is \u201can Adinkra symbol called Funtunfunefu Denkyemfunefu, which means unity and diversity. And that\u2019s just something that I live by \u2013 I just like to bring everybody together from different tribes.\u201d But in African music, there has at times been backlash over incorporations of different genres into a broader Afrobeats sound \u2013 there have especially been concerns around Nigerian artists \u201cappropriating\u201d amapiano music, which is native to South Africa. But for Juls, this melting pot of African genres can be embraced so long as what is produced is always in dialogue with its originators. \u201cI\u2019ve tapped into amapiano quite a few times but I always make sure I\u2019m doing it with a South African artist or producer,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a song on my album called Muntuwam, which has an element of amapiano, and on there I have Nkosazana\u2019s Daughter. She listened to the song and loved it, which made me feel great because that\u2019s coming from a South African who\u2019s deep into that sound. It means you\u2019re on the right path.\u201d Juls also sees this as something that charts the progression of Afrobeats from its birth in the early 2000s DJ sets \u2013 \u201cdata, internet, structure\u201d. There\u2019s an ability to authentically tap into genres around the world, from f\u00faj\u00ec to highlife and kwaito to soukous, because you\u2019re able to readily access information about this music. Afrobeats is thus less a coherent genre and more a label used for convenience. \u201cIf you really want to tap into the proper sound, you have to travel to these countries specifically, and do even deeper research.\u201d This curiosity is evidently booming for Black artists. He cites Asake\u2019s collaboration with the Afro-Brazilian singer-songwriter Ludmilla \u2013 Whine (one of my most played tracks from Lungu Boy) and even Tyler, the Creator\u2019s sampling of the Zamrock band Ngozi Family on NOID from his latest album, Chromakopia, as some of his favourite recent Black Atlantic link-ups. It\u2019s clear Juls is ready for his sound to enter a new chapter, bringing the Black diaspora with him. \u201cThe first 10 years have been about putting people in a good mood; the next 10 years, I\u2019m trying to make people dance.\u201d What we\u2019re into I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve played Tyla\u2019s Push 2 Start music video \u2013 that song! That choreography! Her performance at the MTV EMAs on Sunday was electrifying. Jason One of the advantages of living on the African continent is all the African content on streaming platforms. This week, the most watched movie on Netflix is the South African Umjolo \u2013 the Gone Girl. It is tagged as \u201cSteamy. Quirky. Dramedy\u201d. I\u2019ve heard enough. Nesrine I\u2019m obsessed with Toyo Tastes, a British-Nigerian food blogger and cook who makes everything from plantain and efo riro croquettes to gizdodo vol-au-vents. Jason I am a tragic cyclist, in that I love it but am not gifted at it. (And all the kit puts me off.) There may also be a cultural element \u2013 which is why I\u2019m excited to dig into my copy of New Black Cyclones \u2013 Racism, Representation and Revolutions of Power in Cycling by Marlon Lee Moncrieffe. What a title. Nesrine Black catalogue Abi Morocco Photos, the Lagos photography studio operated by husband-and-wife John and Funmilayo Abe, captured portraits of Nigerians from the 1970s to 2006. A new exhibition at Autograph in London focuses on the studio\u2019s formative decade in the 1970s, showcasing Lagos street-style and the characters who made up the every day hustle and bustle of the city. Signal boost Last week we wrote about how Nigerians have responded to Kemi Badenoch\u2019s rise to the top of the Conservative party in the UK. Here, a reader offers their response: \u201cI\u2019ve always maintained that people who expect Kemi Badenoch to be different don\u2019t understand anything about her background. Her education and exposure would also have imbued her with a certain amount of intellectual superiority. \u201cAs a fellow Nigerian who also spent her formative years in an upper middle class family steeped in academia, nothing about her surprises me. I just wish we would all stop identifying with people simply because they are black/African/Nigerian etc. She is her own person and this so-called achievement has no bearing whatsoever on the issues faced by black and brown people in the UK.\u201d Kan Frances-Benedict in Kent, UK Tap in Do you have any thoughts or responses to this week\u2019s newsletter?

Just returned from Gaza, where he said he had seen levels of suffering unprecedented since the war started, Sam Rose warned that Unrwa could collapse, with severe implications for schools and hospitals not just in Gaza but in the West Bank if Israel went ahead with its plan. He was speaking the day after the US government stepped back from taking any action against Israel for failing to meet most of its demands to improve the supply of humanitarian aid to Gaza.

One of the requirements was for Israel to recognise that Unrwa remained the only viable means of providing services to Gaza. But since that letter was sent, the Israeli parliament in October passed two new laws requiring the Israeli government to end cooperation and contact with Unrwa. The plan is due to be imposed within three months. Unrwa operates in Gaza, the West Bank and in surrounding countries such as Jordan and Lebanon, where large numbers of Palestinian refugees live. It provides schools, hospitals and waste disposal services, as well as being the central organisation for the distribution of aid.

The findings show a potential impact on about 95 million people, or 27% of the nation\u2019s population. The US Geological Survey sampling and modeling of groundwater contamination found readings up to 37,000 times higher than the EPA\u2019s new drinking water limits. In some regions virtually all of those using public systems that draw from groundwater may be drinking contaminated water. This is especially a problem for those who draw from private wells, or small public wells, because neither is covered by strong new PFAS limits implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency \u2013 those people represent about 13% of the US population. \u201cThis study\u2019s findings indicate widespread PFAS contamination in groundwater that is used for public and private drinking water supplies in the US,\u201d said Andrea Tokranov, a USGS hydrologist and the study\u2019s lead author, said in a statement. PFAS are a class of about 15,000 chemicals often used to make products resistant to water, stains and heat. They are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down and are linked to cancer, liver problems, thyroid issues, birth defects, kidney disease, decreased immunity and other serious diseases. As many as 200 million people were in recent years drinking PFAS contaminated water, according to some estimates. The new study built on previous USGS research that took over 1,200 drinking water samples nationwide, as well as modeling. The aim is to help the government identify where there\u2019s more potential for PFAS contamination. It looked at several dozen of the most common types of PFAS, but thousands exist, so levels could be higher and more groundwater could be contaminated than estimated. However, some water utilities have begun implementing technology that removes PFAS, so the number of people who are drinking contaminated water could be lower. The highest levels of exposure to potentially contaminated water in private wells were found in Michigan, Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio. Meanwhile, California and Florida show the highest population levels potentially exposed to PFAS in water drawn from public wells. Up to 98% and 87% of populations in Massachusetts and Connecticut, respectively, who draw from public wells may have contaminated water. The research found the usual suspects were behind the most polluted areas \u2013 military bases, airports, chemical production centers, plating facilities, plastic production and other industries. Groundwater sources in areas with higher population density and more industry were more likely to be contaminated. Depth also plays a role \u2013 deeper wells are typically safer because they are further from the pollution source, and public wells using groundwater are usually deeper than private wells. Though wells near Memphis, Tennessee, are in an urbanized area, the region\u2019s deep, old water aquifer is largely clean, while nearly every well tested that relies on shallow aquifers in the Ohio valley or New England regions had some PFAS in it. The USGS also produced an interactive map that shows where there may be trouble.",

During the heatwaves earlier this year she went into early labour</em><em>, and lost her baby.</em></p> \n<p>It was my first pregnancy. I had been trying to have a child since I was 26. Ten years now. Some doctors had told me it would be impossible to have children because of an operation on my fallopian tubes in 2018. In fact, I had stopped trying. But, <em>voil\u00e0! </em>The first month I thought I had my period, but it wasn\u2019t, and by the second month, my pants didn\u2019t fit anymore. So I went to the pharmacy to take a test. I couldn\u2019t believe it \u2013 I was pregnant! I also went to the hospital to confirm it. I was two months along.</p> \n<p>At that moment, I stopped everything and started taking care of myself. Everything was going well. My mother always said she wanted seven grandchildren, but since she said I was already too old, we agreed on just four! I followed all the gynaecological and medical visits at the Yalgado hospital. Up until six months, everything was fine. I had no problems, I could sleep, and I wasn\u2019t in pain.</p> \n<p>Then the heat came. At night, I\u2019d wake up to get some air because I was so hot. I\u2019d also take showers during the night. I\u2019d wake up two or three times each night. When I woke up, I was exhausted, as if I hadn\u2019t slept at all. Since it was my first pregnancy, I wasn\u2019t sure if this was normal or not, so I assumed it was, even though I couldn\u2019t sleep well due to the heat.</p> \n<p>You feel suffocated at night, you can\u2019t breathe well because on top of the heat, this year there was so much humidity. I even thought I had breathing problems, but doctors told me no, it was just the heat.</p> \n<p>I was scared, because the doctors told me to stay in a cool place, but they didn\u2019t understand my reality. What if there were power cuts? I had to wet a towel and lay it on my bed to lie down, and when it got warm, I\u2019d go wet it again. So, I wasn\u2019t sleeping well. I thought maybe the heat was because of the pregnancy, but the heat was real; it wasn\u2019t just because I was pregnant.</p> \n<p>During the day, it was infernal. My daily activities had to be done from 8-9am at the latest, or at night when the sun was down. But in the sun, it was unbearable\u2013 heavy, humid, and with my sinus issues, I couldn\u2019t breathe. When it was heavy and dusty, I preferred to stay home.</p> \n<p>It hurt a lot. My chest was swollen, and my back hurt. The heat made my back pain even worse, so it wasn\u2019t good for me. I was always looking for a cool spot. I\u2019d take showers, but it was so hot that when you came out, you felt even hotter because your fan was blowing hot air. The best thing was to aim the fan towards a corner to cool the air a bit. But it really wasn\u2019t good; I felt nauseous, dizzy \u2026 mainly dizzy from the heat. That\u2019s what was happening to me.</p> \n<p>We\u2019re in the Sahel, so we\u2019re used to heat, but this year, people weren\u2019t used to it anymore. I\u2019ve never seen so many people sleeping outside or sitting by their doors. Before, there were power cuts, but never like this. It used to happen during the day; now it\u2019s at night, too. In your neighbourhood, you feel safe because so many people are outside. Everyone\u2019s out, everyone\u2019s hot, nobody wants to go inside. They wait for the power to come back or to get so exhausted that they would finally go to sleep. Otherwise, it was impossible. Really.</p> \n<p>About six months along, when I was at the market one day, I felt dizzy; I was so hot. I was walking, and at some point, I stopped because I felt a liquid running down my leg, and I thought, \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d The next couple of days were a blur of pain and worry. I saw one doctor who told me that it wasn\u2019t serious, and we\u2019d see what was going on. I waited five hours to see him. He told me to get ultrasounds done. I had the first one, then a second, and they told me things were OK, that I had lost a little fluid, but there were natural ways to recover it.</p> \n<p>I was sent to another hospital where they told me not to go home, that someone needed to see me. So I stayed there waiting in the car, lying down in the back. You can\u2019t open the windows because of mosquitoes, so you have to sleep with the air conditioning, which uses up your fuel.</p> \n<p>Finally, the next morning, they told me to go to another hospital. By the time I got there and someone saw me, the pain was so bad. They got me to lie down in a room. The pain was so bad that the doctor came, took my temperature, then brought a syringe with something in it. I asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d After the injection, I said, \u201cI\u2019m in even more pain, it\u2019s contracting.\u201d They didn\u2019t say anything. Forty minutes later, the doctor came back and asked if I was still having contractions. I said yes, that it hurt. He explained that the drug they gave me was to help deliver the baby. I asked if my baby would survive and he said no.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2023/01/2024-cop/climate-breakdown-reporting-team\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In those two days of being passed around, nobody could explain to me what was going on. When they induced labour, I didn\u2019t even know who I was. I had the impression that nobody saw me. I couldn\u2019t even ask questions; my mouth wouldn\u2019t react. They had just induced labour without me realising it \u2026 I didn\u2019t know what to think. I felt defeated. I asked myself, \u2018What did I do? Why is nobody looking at me?\u2019 I thought, \u2018Why didn\u2019t anyone tell me I was going to lose my baby?\u2019 And there they were, sitting there, doing nothing. No explanation, no details, nothing.</p> \n<p>It was like a slap in the face, a shock. I felt defeated. You go to the hospital to die. The heat, the power cuts, there\u2019s no equipment. The heat \u2013 nobody even wants to talk about it. It\u2019s the first thing everyone will tell you. It was extremely hot. And then, there are the specialists. When you go into their office, it\u2019s so cold you start shaking, and when you step back into the hallway, you feel like fainting.</p> \n<p>In the room where I had to push and push, there were no mosquito nets. We were six or seven in one room. Here, you learn not to be ashamed. You scream, you push, you scream, you push, you scream, you push. My husband was outside, panicking as he heard my screams without knowing what was happening. It\u2019s a plastic mattress. Either you bring your own sheet, or you give birth where so many women have already done so. When someone has to push, they send out the women\u2019s companions, but we women face each other; the ones in front of you see everything.</p> \n<p>There was no air conditioning, and the fans are on either side of the room. The first person who arrives takes the bed under the fan, and others take the second fan. All the others, we get nothing. There are six beds here and six across. It\u2019s packed, and you\u2019re pressed up against other women. It\u2019s so hot. It was unbearable there because of the heat. Everyone was looking for air. When I was screaming, it was my mother who fanned me. But I didn\u2019t even want anyone to touch me anymore. When anyone touched me, I\u2019d scream. I didn\u2019t want anything. It\u2019s true that it\u2019s over now, but I can\u2019t go three nights without thinking about it. It still lingers within me.</p> \n<p>It was after six hours of contractions that the baby came out. The nurse asked if I wanted to throw it in the trash or bury it, I swear you. I took the baby home, wrapped in the cloth I had bought for its birth, and we buried it at the father\u2019s house.</p> \n<p>How did you start living again? No one pushed me. Afterward, I heard other similar stories. Here, they often link pregnancy problems to something the woman has done or eaten, but I know that it was the effect of the heat and the stress, with 40 to 41 degrees (celsius) of heat, going back and forth between hospitals. This year, the heat was something very unusual. I didn\u2019t know if it was climate change or what, but we experienced a strange kind of heat. Throughout the entire ordeal, I was asking God to help me. Only Him. I felt like I was going crazy. I felt better talking to a deity than to a human being. Most people tend to judge before understanding what\u2019s happening.</p> \n<p>A few weeks afterwards, we planted a guava tree. It was important to have a place to go, to gather oneself and be at peace. I threw myself completely into my activities; I looked for work. Working is a way to release it. But every time I watch a movie and see a woman who just gave birth, that feeling returns, and I feel awful: \u201cImagine, I could have too.\u201d</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Design and development by</em> Harry Fischer <em>and</em> Pip Lev</p></li> \n <li><p><em>Photography by </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/elia-borras\">\u00c8lia Borr\u00e0s</a></p></li> \n</ul>",

There are six beds here and six across. It\u2019s packed, and you\u2019re pressed up against other women. It\u2019s so hot. It was unbearable there because of the heat. Everyone was looking for air. When I was screaming, it was my mother who fanned me. But I didn\u2019t even want anyone to touch me anymore. When anyone touched me, I\u2019d scream. I didn\u2019t want anything. It\u2019s true that it\u2019s over now, but I can\u2019t go three nights without thinking about it. It still lingers within me. It was after six hours of contractions that the baby came out. The nurse asked if I wanted to throw it in the trash or bury it, I swear you. I took the baby home, wrapped in the cloth I had bought for its birth, and we buried it at the father\u2019s house. How did you start living again? No one pushed me. Afterward, I heard other similar stories. Here, they often link pregnancy problems to something the woman has done or eaten, but I know that it was the effect of the heat and the stress, with 40 to 41 degrees (celsius) of heat, going back and forth between hospitals. This year, the heat was something very unusual. I didn\u2019t know if it was climate change or what, but we experienced a strange kind of heat. Throughout the entire ordeal, I was asking God to help me. Only Him. I felt like I was going crazy. I felt better talking to a deity than to a human being. Most people tend to judge before understanding what\u2019s happening. A few weeks afterwards, we planted a guava tree. It was important to have a place to go, to gather oneself and be at peace. I threw myself completely into my activities; I looked for work. Working is a way to release it. But every time I watch a movie and see a woman who just gave birth, that feeling returns, and I feel awful: \u201cImagine, I could have too.\u201d Design and development by Harry Fischer and Pip Lev Photography by \u00c8lia Borr\u00e0s",

Our economic institutions and political systems are not built for a world like this.</p> <p>Yet our economic modelling often fails to capture the experience of rising prices. Last year, official US figures suggested that voters there were living in the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cepr.net/joe-biden-has-given-us-the-greatest-economy-ever/\">greatest economy ever</a>\u201d, with rising GDP and inflation rapidly falling, which is why Kamala Harris\u2019s defeat has been condescendingly blamed on the \u201cvibecession\u201d \u2013 implying that voters feel bad for no good reason. But you can\u2019t eat GDP. And if basic foods shoot up in price and stay high, every pound or yen or dollar you have goes a little bit less far than it used to. Official inflation figures don\u2019t capture this raw experience of squeezed living standards and the sense of permanent loss this points towards, since they aim to report on the average price changes in a \u201cbasket of goods\u201d bought by the \u201caverage\u201d household. But there is no such thing as an \u201caverage\u201d household: it\u2019s a statistical construction. Actual household consumption varies substantially.</p> <p>So while this basket of goods certainly contains food and energy, with a share based on how much, on average, a household will spend on both, it also contains items like the \u201caverage\u201d amount of air travel abroad, or flatscreen TVs. Some households will buy one or both in any given month, of course, and so their prices matter to those households. But for the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/08/12/most-americans-have-traveled-abroad-although-differences-among-demographic-groups-are-large/\">27% of US citizens</a> who have never travelled to another country, the cost of air travel abroad is an irrelevance. And although <a href=\"https://www.progressivepolicy.org/ppis-trade-fact-of-the-week-the-price-of-a-40-inch-tv-set-has-fallen-by-99-in-25-years/\">flatscreen TVs</a> have fallen spectacularly in price, most of us don\u2019t rush off to buy a new one every month. Yet those TV price changes are still influencing the inflation figures. In other words, there\u2019s a disconnect between the headline numbers and most people\u2019s experience of the economy. Worse, this disconnect can vary systemically with income: poorer households have to spend proportionately more on essentials, and so they often experience inflation <a href=\"https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2024/lower-income-higher-inflation-new-data-bring-answers-at-last\">far more strongly</a> than headline figures suggest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/09/olive-oil-becomes-most-wanted-item-for-shoplifters-in-spain\">Olive oil becomes most wanted item for shoplifters in Spain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tools intended to combat inflation are worse than useless. Jamming up interest rates in London or Washington doesn\u2019t make more olives grow in Spain or cocoa beans magically sprout in Ghana. Perhaps this disconnect between the policy levers and economic outcomes<strong> </strong>didn\u2019t matter too much when price rises were limited. For two decades before Covid-19, a combination of rapid industrialisation in China and east Asia, improved farming productivity, falling transport costs, and (as we failed to appreciate at the time) a relatively stable global climate, delivered consistently falling prices of goods, both agricultural and manufactured, with global food prices reaching an all-time low in the early 2000s. Nor did it matter that interest rate changes would have little meaningful impact when inflation hovered fairly reliably around central banks\u2019 target levels.</p> <p>The supply shocks of the 2020s have brought this period to an end. The world we live in now is one where geopolitical conflict intersects with the climate crisis to produce repeated, sometimes dramatic, shocks and shortages. Price rises on one side are all too often matched by outright profiteering on the other: the five agribusinesses that <a href=\"https://www.somo.nl/hungry-for-profits/\">control 70%</a> of the global trade made all-time high profits during 2020-22, while Oxfam reports that <a href=\"https://oi-files-d8-prod.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2022-05/Oxfam%20Media%20Brief%20-%20EN%20-%20Profiting%20From%20Pain%2C%20Davos%202022%20Part%202.pdf\">62 new \u201cfood billionaires\u201d</a> were created.</p> <p>Three steps are needed. The first is to claw back the wealth of the new profiteers through wealth taxes in the first instance, which would free up resources that could be invested.

      "bodyText": "In the US, where Donald Trump swept the board last week, it was the experience of sharply increasing essentials prices, from food to energy, that glued together the Republicans\u2019 new electoral coalition. About 75% of those voting Republican reported that they had faced \u201chardship\u201d or \u201csevere hardship\u201d as a result of price rises; only 25% of Democrats said the same. When Trump asked if Americans felt better now than they did four years ago, the answer for most was a clear no. Price surges are having political impacts. In elections this year in three of the world\u2019s largest economies, incumbent parties were hammered by voters angry about their helplessness in the face of the steeply rising cost of essentials. In India, Narendra Modi, widely assumed to enjoy a total dominance of domestic politics in the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy, lost his parliamentary majority. Food price inflation in the country has been running at an average of 8% for months, with the price of rice soaring to its highest point in a decade, despite a government export ban in July (which has subsequently been lifted). A quarter of voters cited price rises as their main concern, the highest since the early 1980s, and well over half thought the government had handled inflation badly. In Japan, the conservative coalition, led by the Liberal Democratic party, lost its majority in a snap election. The price of rice had risen by 63% over the previous 12 months, the biggest increase since official records began, the result of the falling value of the yen pushing up imported fertiliser prices \u2013 and, crucially, the \u201cbrutal summer heatwave\u201d that affected rice quality and shrank harvests. After decades of low inflation and its associated low wage rises, the sharp increase in the price of staple foods has been a rude political shock. It\u2019s the same story across the world. The price of olive oil in British supermarkets has gone up by as much as 90% during the last two years, the direct result of drought and extreme heat throttling harvests across the Mediterranean. Butter prices have risen more than 80% across Europe, as climate change-linked bluetongue fever has hit cattle herds. Orange juice prices have doubled in a year in the US, as extreme heat, floods and droughts have knocked out fruit harvests in Brazil and Florida. Easter eggs were smaller and more expensive this year than last as a deadly flood-drought combination hammered cocoa production in west Africa, where 60% of the world\u2019s beans are grown. Torrential rains and floods have hurt harvests across Europe, and the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization has reported that world food prices reached an 18-month high in October. As climate change begins to bite harder, it\u2019s not only about the appalling drama of floods and deadly storms \u2013 it\u2019s the steady grind of failing production systems and, behind them, the opportunity for profiteering from the soaring prices of essentials like food and energy. Our economic institutions and political systems are not built for a world like this. Yet our economic modelling often fails to capture the experience of rising prices. Last year, official US figures suggested that voters there were living in the \u201cgreatest economy ever\u201d, with rising GDP and inflation rapidly falling, which is why Kamala Harris\u2019s defeat has been condescendingly blamed on the \u201cvibecession\u201d \u2013 implying that voters feel bad for no good reason. But you can\u2019t eat GDP. And if basic foods shoot up in price and stay high, every pound or yen or dollar you have goes a little bit less far than it used to. Official inflation figures don\u2019t capture this raw experience of squeezed living standards and the sense of permanent loss this points towards, since they aim to report on the average price changes in a \u201cbasket of goods\u201d bought by the \u201caverage\u201d household. But there is no such thing as an \u201caverage\u201d household: it\u2019s a statistical construction. Actual household consumption varies substantially. So while this basket of goods certainly contains food and energy, with a share based on how much, on average, a household will spend on both, it also contains items like the \u201caverage\u201d amount of air travel abroad, or flatscreen TVs. Some households will buy one or both in any given month, of course, and so their prices matter to those households. But for the 27% of US citizens who have never travelled to another country, the cost of air travel abroad is an irrelevance. And although flatscreen TVs have fallen spectacularly in price, most of us don\u2019t rush off to buy a new one every month. Yet those TV price changes are still influencing the inflation figures. In other words, there\u2019s a disconnect between the headline numbers and most people\u2019s experience of the economy. Worse, this disconnect can vary systemically with income: poorer households have to spend proportionately more on essentials, and so they often experience inflation far more strongly than headline figures suggest. The tools intended to combat inflation are worse than useless. Jamming up interest rates in London or Washington doesn\u2019t make more olives grow in Spain or cocoa beans magically sprout in Ghana. Perhaps this disconnect between the policy levers and economic outcomes didn\u2019t matter too much when price rises were limited. For two decades before Covid-19, a combination of rapid industrialisation in China and east Asia, improved farming productivity, falling transport costs, and (as we failed to appreciate at the time) a relatively stable global climate, delivered consistently falling prices of goods, both agricultural and manufactured, with global food prices reaching an all-time low in the early 2000s. Nor did it matter that interest rate changes would have little meaningful impact when inflation hovered fairly reliably around central banks\u2019 target levels. The supply shocks of the 2020s have brought this period to an end. The world we live in now is one where geopolitical conflict intersects with the climate crisis to produce repeated, sometimes dramatic, shocks and shortages. Price rises on one side are all too often matched by outright profiteering on the other: the five agribusinesses that control 70% of the global trade made all-time high profits during 2020-22, while Oxfam reports that 62 new \u201cfood billionaires\u201d were created. Three steps are needed. The first is to claw back the wealth of the new profiteers through wealth taxes in the first instance, which would free up resources that could be invested. The second is to kill the sacred cow of conventional economics. When inflation spikes as a result of supply shocks, jamming up interest rates merely increases the misery. Debt repayments soar \u2013 but inflation isn\u2019t necessarily restrained. We can take inspiration here from countries like Spain, which introduced well-designed controls on essential prices last year. Targeted price controls and buffer stocks of essentials like staple foods, of the kind recommended by economist Isabella Weber and her collaborators, can work. The third step is the longer term task of rebuilding our supply systems for those essentials. This would mean localising production, offering more support to farmers and communities adapting to a climate-shocked world, shortening supply chains and maximising their resilience, rather than prioritising profit.

He also coined or popularised many of the rudeboy battle cries doing the rounds at the time: \u201cBad boy come again!\u201d; \u201cJunglists, are you ready!\u201d Then, after dying of a heart attack in 1998 aged 31 on the eve of releasing his first album, Stevie Hyper D fell into obscurity. \u201cWhen I first met Jamie, I was still very raw and bitter about how Steve\u2019s legacy was being handled,\u201d Austin says.</p> <p>\u201cJamie\u201d is Jamie Ross-Hulme, director of a new documentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/12/hyper-the-stevie-hyper-d-story-review-massively-entertaining-portrait-of-legendary-mc\">Hyper</a>, that resurrects this little-known talent. On a video call from a Twickenham hotel a little tender the day after the film\u2019s premiere, the 42-year-old remembers sneaking underage into a rave at Bagley\u2019s in July 1998, unaware of Stevie\u2019s death, and amped up at the prospect of witnessing the fast-spitting prodigy. Instead, \u201cthere was a collection box for the family. It was too weird and surreal.

With only a 10-year age gap between them, the two were more like brothers; Austin\u2019s middle name is Stephen, because his uncle had insisted he share it. As soon as he was old enough, he was accompanying Stevie Hyper D to gigs, witnessing the scene\u2019s breakneck evolution from hardcore to jungle to drum\u2019n\u2019bass. \u201cIt was like a virus that took over the UK and infected everybody,\u201d says Austin, 49, speaking from his home in Kingston, south-west London on the same call. \u201cAnd everybody got a different variant.\u201d</p> <p>In the film, it\u2019s clear how the next generation mutated the strain. Maxwell D from garage crew Pay as U Go Cartel recalls trading Jaffa Cakes in prison for the cassette tape packs that were the only way to hear live MC sets after they\u2019d finished. So Solid Crew\u2019s Megaman once rode round on an unlicensed moped to Stevie Hyper D\u2019s house in Fulham to beg the jungle icon to play a community gig. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see our stars on TV. Our stars were in the raves.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Steve is the Jesus Christ of MCs, man. He died for all these guys.\u201d With a chuckle, Darrell Austin is lionising his uncle Steve \u2013 who under the moniker Stevie Hyper D was the 1990s\u2019 main man in live drum\u2019n\u2019bass MCing. A swaggering, gap-toothed, stentorian town crier for the scene at key raves like One Nation and Dreamscape, he was credited with accelerating the fastchat of Caribbean soundsystem MCs into exhilarating \u201cdouble-time\u201d rapping, which defined the sound of jungle and pointed the way towards garage and grime. He also coined or popularised many of the rudeboy battle cries doing the rounds at the time: \u201cBad boy come again!\u201d; \u201cJunglists, are you ready!\u201d Then, after dying of a heart attack in 1998 aged 31 on the eve of releasing his first album, Stevie Hyper D fell into obscurity. \u201cWhen I first met Jamie, I was still very raw and bitter about how Steve\u2019s legacy was being handled,\u201d Austin says. \u201cJamie\u201d is Jamie Ross-Hulme, director of a new documentary, Hyper, that resurrects this little-known talent. On a video call from a Twickenham hotel a little tender the day after the film\u2019s premiere, the 42-year-old remembers sneaking underage into a rave at Bagley\u2019s in July 1998, unaware of Stevie\u2019s death, and amped up at the prospect of witnessing the fast-spitting prodigy. Instead, \u201cthere was a collection box for the family. It was too weird and surreal. You could feel the void in the room.\u201d After Stephen Austin\u2019s mother died in 2007, his nephew Darrell inherited much of his uncle\u2019s memorabilia and found himself the custodian of his legacy. With only a 10-year age gap between them, the two were more like brothers; Austin\u2019s middle name is Stephen, because his uncle had insisted he share it. As soon as he was old enough, he was accompanying Stevie Hyper D to gigs, witnessing the scene\u2019s breakneck evolution from hardcore to jungle to drum\u2019n\u2019bass. \u201cIt was like a virus that took over the UK and infected everybody,\u201d says Austin, 49, speaking from his home in Kingston, south-west London on the same call. \u201cAnd everybody got a different variant.\u201d In the film, it\u2019s clear how the next generation mutated the strain. Maxwell D from garage crew Pay as U Go Cartel recalls trading Jaffa Cakes in prison for the cassette tape packs that were the only way to hear live MC sets after they\u2019d finished. So Solid Crew\u2019s Megaman once rode round on an unlicensed moped to Stevie Hyper D\u2019s house in Fulham to beg the jungle icon to play a community gig. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see our stars on TV. Our stars were in the raves. Our stars were on those stages,\u201d he says in the film. Ironically, it was the rising waves of UK garage and grime \u2013 which both gave greater prominence to MCs than drum\u2019n\u2019bass \u2013 that contributed to Stevie Hyper D being so swiftly forgotten. Another factor was that, while he left many a loudly designed tape pack in his wake, very few of his performances were filmed. This was a major obstacle to making Hyper, until Ross-Hulme stumbled on a secret trove of footage courtesy of legendary star of happy hardcore DJ Dougal. The DJ had been so green during his entry on the rave scene that his father chaperoned him around \u2013 and had filmed many gigs, including early Stevie Hyper D appearances, on camcorder. After a first screening of their film to executive producers, the consensus was that something was missing. This is when Ross-Hulme suggested pushing Austin, and his relationship with his uncle, more to the fore. \u201cJamie\u2019s intuition picked up that there was maybe something I wasn\u2019t telling him, or was holding back on,\u201d says Austin. This was more than grief. At the time of his uncle\u2019s death, they had barely reconciled from a major falling-out, partly over Austin\u2019s own ambitions to MC. Ross-Hulme encouraged him to explore their kinship on camera, carefully coaching him through this confessional work. It brings the film closer to the redemptive documentaries that were his models: 2012\u2019s Searching for Sugar Man and 2018\u2019s Evelyn, about the director\u2019s brother\u2019s suicide. \u201cA core theme is \u2018what could have been\u2019,\u201d says Ross-Hulme. \u201cThe nostalgia and the melancholy of what could have been with this amazing talent. But also what could have been with Darrell. This big emotion of regret.\u201d This kind of pastoral arm over the shoulder offered to Austin by Ross-Hulme was lacking in his uncle\u2019s fast-living life, he believes.

But he was being unduly modest. He had an outstanding career that lasted more than half a century, embraced theatre, film, TV and radio, and made him the kind of actor that directors always wanted to have in their company.</p> <p>West had a particular gift for playing historical figures. He appeared on screen as Mikhail Gorbachev, Winston Churchill (twice), Edward VII, Lord Reith and the suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams. On stage he played Josef Stalin, the conductor Thomas Beecham and the literary giant Samuel Johnson. In fact, he played the latter twice for the Prospect Theatre Company and, with his strong jaw and solid figure, he seemed the very embodiment of Dr Johnson. He also exuded an 18th-century quality known as \u201cbottom\u201d, which the OED defines as \u201cphysical resources, staying power, substance, stability\u201d.

He went on to play numerous roles for Prospect, including a gay hairdresser opposite Derek Jacobi in Staircase and, when Prospect morphed into the Old Vic Company in the late 70s, West unexpectedly found himself at its helm. This led to an unfortunate incident in 1980 when he appeared to disown an ill-fated production of Macbeth starring Peter O\u2019Toole. His intention, he later explained, was simply to make clear that Macbeth was an autonomous production, but the resulting brouhaha cured him of any further desire to run a company.</p> <p>West\u2019s career as an actor continued unabated.

Between 1983 and 1990 he starred in 32 episodes of the Granada series Brass, in which he played an even more ruthless, domineering mill-owner: he later described it as one of the most enjoyable things he had done in his life.

West always relished playing opposite members of his own family. In 1996, he was Falstaff in the two parts of Shakespeare\u2019s Henry IV with his son, Samuel, playing Prince Hal.

We think that the benefits of being on X are now outweighed by the negatives and that resources could be better used promoting our journalism elsewhere. This is something we have been considering for a while given the often disturbing content promoted or found on the platform, including far-right conspiracy theories and racism. The US presidential election campaign served only to underline what we have considered for a long time: that X is a toxic media platform and that its owner, Elon Musk, has been able to use its influence to shape political discourse. X users will still be able to share our articles, and the nature of live news reporting means we will still occasionally embed content from X within our article pages. Our reporters will also be able to carry on using the site for news-gathering purposes, just as they use other social networks in which we do not officially engage. Social media can be an important tool for news organisations and help us to reach new audiences but, at this point, X now plays a diminished role in promoting our work. Our journalism is available and open to all on our website and we would prefer people to come to theguardian.com and support our work there. Thankfully, we can do this because our business model does not rely on viral content tailored to the whims of the social media giants\u2019 algorithms \u2013 instead we\u2019re funded directly by our readers. You can support the Guardian today from just \u00a31/$1.",

What does Huckabee\u2019s appointment signal?

Fast forward almost a decade and Rubio has happily bent the knee to Trump in order to become fourth in line for the presidency and to take charge of US diplomacy.</p> <p>The slight problem is that Rubio isn\u2019t a fan of diplomacy; he\u2019s a fan of war. An ardent hawk, Rubio <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/may/18/marco-rubio/rubios-statements-iraq-have-shifted-not-flipped/\">defended</a> the invasion of Iraq during his first Senate run in 2010.

Over the past year, he has been one of the <a href=\"https://floridapolitics.com/archives/672902-rubio-hitler/\">strongest supporters</a> in Congress of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s assault on Gaza, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@codepinkalert/video/7307046985654275374\">dismissing</a> widespread Palestinian civilian casualties as the fault only of Hamas, and <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/176107/marco-rubio-eradication-extreme-langauge-hamas-gaza-israel\">saying</a> that Israel cannot coexist \u201cwith these savages \u2026 They have to be eradicated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am peace\u201d?

He went to Dearborn, the \u201ccapital\u201d of Arab America, attacked Kamala Harris for campaigning with the pro-war Cheneys, and came away with an endorsement from a local imam who called him the \u201cpeace\u201d candidate. In fact, I have lost count of the number of leftists who have told me in recent months: \u201cTrump didn\u2019t start any new wars.\u201d Sorry, what? Trump spent his four years in the White House escalating every single conflict that he inherited from Barack Obama. Many have forgotten that Trump bombed the Assad government in Syria twice; dropped the \u201cmother of all bombs\u201d on Afghanistan; illegally assassinated Iranian general Qasem Soleimani on Iraqi soil; armed Saudi Arabia\u2019s genocide in Yemen; and made John Bolton his national security adviser. Few are even aware that Trump launched more drone strikes in his first two years in office than Obama, dubbed \u201cthe drone president\u201d, did across eight years in office. But this time, we were told, it would be different. This time Trump meant it. No more war! No more neocons! Some took heart from Trump\u2019s very public rejection of arch-hawks Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley. Others signal-boosted efforts by RFK Jr, Don Jr and Tucker Carlson to block neoconservative figures from joining the new Trump-Vance administration. \u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d bragged Trump\u2019s eldest failson.

All were clear violations of Legacy\u2019s policy prohibiting workplace violence and should have resulted in Calles\u2019s immediate removal, but administrators initially responded to the complaints by providing \u201csupport options\u201d over email, the lawsuit prepared by attorney Tom D\u2019Amore\u2019s office alleged.</p> <p>According to the suit, nurses resolved to have Calles removed from the hospital on the morning of 22 July.

      "bodyText": "The family of an Oregon hospital security guard who was shot to death while protecting a maternity ward from an attacker during the summer of 2023 is suing the medical facility for $35m in damages, saying it ignored warning signs that could have prevented the killing if addressed. In the days before the killing of 44-year-old Bobby Smallwood made international news headlines, staffers at Portland\u2019s Legacy Good Samaritan hospital made five separate complaints to administrators against the man later charged with his murder, PoniaX Calles, according to the lawsuit from the victim\u2019s family, which was filed on Tuesday. Calles allegedly threatened violence and tried to strike a nurse while saying, \u201cIf you guys keep acting like this, someone is going to get killed around here\u201d \u2013 after accompanying his partner to the hospital on 19 July. All were clear violations of Legacy\u2019s policy prohibiting workplace violence and should have resulted in Calles\u2019s immediate removal, but administrators initially responded to the complaints by providing \u201csupport options\u201d over email, the lawsuit prepared by attorney Tom D\u2019Amore\u2019s office alleged. According to the suit, nurses resolved to have Calles removed from the hospital on the morning of 22 July. Smallwood was working that day as an unarmed guard and had received instructions to wait nearby in the hallway while other hospital security staff searched the room of Calles\u2019s partner, finding ammunition and multiple guns. The lawsuit alleges that, for more than 40 minutes, Smallwood\u2019s colleagues failed to notify him of their dangerous discovery \u2013 or their having learned that Calles had an additional gun in his possession. Hospital staffers encountered Calles prior to his departure \u2013 and before they had declared a \u201ccode silver\u201d that would have alerted everyone there of a potential shooting threat, the lawsuit said. Calles turned around, fired at Smallwood, struck him in the neck and mortally wounded him, the lawsuit said. Calles allegedly had a history of arrests on suspicion of assault, disorderly conduct and trespassing, including one case in which he was accused of stabbing someone at a restaurant in the face. Calles, 33, fled the hospital and was shot to death by police as officers moved in to arrest him, authorities said. \u201cThe repeated failures of Legacy Good Samaritan to follow their own safety protocols directly led to the tragically preventable death of Bobby Smallwood,\u201d D\u2019Amore said. \u201cDespite documented threats and abusive behavior that required immediate removal under hospital policy, Legacy allowed a dangerous individual to remain on the premises for three days until those threats escalated to violence.\u201d Smallwood\u2019s parents said they were told that their son was standing between Calles and patients along with staff in the hallway of a hospital maternity ward. His family is seeking $30m and $5m in non-economic and monetary damages, respectively, from the hospital over his murder, said a statement attributed to his parents, Walter and Tammy Smallwood. \u201cEvery day we grieve the loss of our son and all the years ahead that should have been his to live,\u201d the Smallwoods\u2019 statement said. \u201cNothing can bring Bobby back, but we will not stop fighting until Legacy is held fully responsible for what they took from our family.\u201d A Legacy Health spokesperson declined to comment, the Oregonian newspaper reported. Days after Smallwood\u2019s shooting death, the health network that runs Legacy Good Samaritan announced it would add metal detectors with bag searches at each of its hospitals\u2019 entrances, equip lead security officers with stun guns and weigh whether any more measures were necessary. The lawsuit from Smallwood\u2019s family said Legacy Good Samaritan \u201conly checked individuals for weapons at a single entrance equipped with a metal detector located in the emergency department\u201d at the time he was killed. Smallwood\u2019s death illustrated the dangers of the unarmed security and highlighted how \u2013 as the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration says \u2013 \u201cworkplace violence is a recognized hazard\u201d in the medical field.",

She should have stopped there (it\u2019s a winning policy platform) but she added that she\u2019d also ban prison sentences for white-collar criminals and make them do things like teach inner-city kids to ride horses instead.</p> <p>If I were queen for the day I\u2019d focus less on white-collar criminals and more on literary ones: implementing an immediate ban on celebrities writing children\u2019s books. Should a famous person so much as think of penning a kids\u2019 book, it\u2019d be straight to jail: locked in a cell full of the strongest-smelling air fresheners available.</p> <p>The celebrity children\u2019s book trend is out of control: everyone from Keith Richards to Meghan Markle to Keira Knightley has written one. Which has naturally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/20/its-quite-galling-childrens-authors-frustrated-by-rise-in-celebrity-penned-titles\">frustrated</a> non-famous authors who rely on their talent, rather than their name to sell books, particularly as trying to eke out a living as a writer is <a href=\"https://societyofauthors.org/2022/12/06/a-profession-struggling-to-sustain-itself/#:~:text=The%20report%2C%20which%20ALCS%20argues,33%25%20in%202016%2F17)\">increasingly difficult</a>.</p> <p>To be fair, simply being famous doesn\u2019t necessarily mean your kids\u2019 book is going to be a success. As Markle discovered, it could still flop. And, as celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is currently discovering, you could also find yourself embroiled in an international PR disaster.</p> <p>Oliver published his first children\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/21/jamie-oliver-and-geri-halliwell-horner-become-the-latest-celebrities-to-announce-childrens-books\">Billy and the Giant Adventure</a>, last year. That didn\u2019t cause any major international incidents but the sequel, a 400-page fantasy novel, has caused uproar. The issue is a section of the book in which a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/10/jamie-oliver-pulls-childrens-book-from-shelves-after-criticism-for-stereotyping-indigenous-australians-ntwnfb\">young First Nations girl</a> living in foster care in an Indigenous community is kidnapped: advocacy groups have called it \u201cdamaging\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d, and said it trivialises the trauma associated with Australia\u2019s violent history of child removal. The book has now been pulled from shelves. Oliver and his publishers wholeheartedly apologised for their misjudgment.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think certain topics are automatically off limits for certain writers. But, crikey, if you\u2019re going to tackle fraught subjects, you\u2019ve got to be able to pull it off. Let this be a lesson to celebrities: if you really must bash out a kids\u2019 book, stick to subjects closer to home. Dinosaurs learning to make pasta, perhaps. Or white-collar criminals teaching inner-city kids to ride horses.</p> <p>\u2022 Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

She should have stopped there (it\u2019s a winning policy platform) but she added that she\u2019d also ban prison sentences for white-collar criminals and make them do things like teach inner-city kids to ride horses instead. If I were queen for the day I\u2019d focus less on white-collar criminals and more on literary ones: implementing an immediate ban on celebrities writing children\u2019s books. Should a famous person so much as think of penning a kids\u2019 book, it\u2019d be straight to jail: locked in a cell full of the strongest-smelling air fresheners available. The celebrity children\u2019s book trend is out of control: everyone from Keith Richards to Meghan Markle to Keira Knightley has written one. Which has naturally frustrated non-famous authors who rely on their talent, rather than their name to sell books, particularly as trying to eke out a living as a writer is increasingly difficult. To be fair, simply being famous doesn\u2019t necessarily mean your kids\u2019 book is going to be a success. As Markle discovered, it could still flop. And, as celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is currently discovering, you could also find yourself embroiled in an international PR disaster. Oliver published his first children\u2019s book, Billy and the Giant Adventure, last year. That didn\u2019t cause any major international incidents but the sequel, a 400-page fantasy novel, has caused uproar. The issue is a section of the book in which a young First Nations girl living in foster care in an Indigenous community is kidnapped: advocacy groups have called it \u201cdamaging\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d, and said it trivialises the trauma associated with Australia\u2019s violent history of child removal. The book has now been pulled from shelves. Oliver and his publishers wholeheartedly apologised for their misjudgment. I don\u2019t think certain topics are automatically off limits for certain writers. But, crikey, if you\u2019re going to tackle fraught subjects, you\u2019ve got to be able to pull it off. Let this be a lesson to celebrities: if you really must bash out a kids\u2019 book, stick to subjects closer to home. Dinosaurs learning to make pasta, perhaps. Or white-collar criminals teaching inner-city kids to ride horses. \u2022 Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The same user had been posting pictures of various other \u201cgirls from the alternative subculture\u201d on subreddits, and those pictures were then reposted on other even more explicitly pornographic websites. </p> <p>\u201cIt felt really surreal, like I was in a fever dream,\u201d says Hooper. \u201cI was panicking.\u201d</p> <p>It was mid-October 2019, and 20-year-old Hooper, from Essex, was in her second year of a policing and criminal justice degree. As class wrapped up, she told the lecturer what had happened. Within the hour, while she waited for her train, Hooper had submitted a 101 police report online.</p> <p>But as she made her way home, there was something else spinning through the \u201cwhirlwind\u201d in her mind. The acquaintance who had warned her she was being targeted thought he knew who was behind it, because his girlfriend, another victim, had pieced it together. \u201cThis is the guy we think is doing it,\u201d he said, sending a screenshot of a Facebook profile.</p> <p>Looking at the profile picture, Hooper felt a stab of familiarity: the account belonged to someone she had never met, but who had messaged her, on and off, for more than five years. His profile showed he lived in a town 20 minutes away.</p> <p><strong>* * *</strong></p> <p>Hooper was 12 when she signed up for Twitter in 2011. \u201cNo one I knew had it \u2013 that was the beauty of it,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI hated school, I had undiagnosed autism and I was being bullied. I was in therapy and on antidepressants. Twitter was an escape.\u201d</p> <p>As Hooper entered her teens, her life revolved around music; specifically, pop-punk bands like My Chemical Romance and All Time Low.<strong> </strong>She embraced the alternative<strong> </strong>style (she dyed her hair \u201cpink, blue, green \u2013 every colour you can name at some point\u201d), and took to social media. \u201cI wanted to find a space where people liked the same thing as me,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the least cringe way, it gave me an outlet.\u201d</p> <p>By 16, she had amassed 20,000 Twitter followers and was active in fandom circles on Tumblr, Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. \u201cMy mum used to come with me to concerts and there\u2019d be people who recognised me from this online fandom,\u201d she remembers. \u201cShe thought it was weird.\u201d But Hooper didn\u2019t feel she needed to fill her in too much. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was at risk \u2026 and I don\u2019t think she\u2019d have known what to do about it, either.\u201d</p> <p>And anyway, Hooper, who was being home educated by 13, was enjoying having a rich online social life. \u201cI had lots of online friends and built up a following in fandom circles. Many were a bit older.\u201d Some were a lot older: Hooper remembers that among her online followers were men in their 50s and 60s. \u201cI\u2019d notice people pop up and think \u2013 why are you following me? What have we got in common? I just wouldn\u2019t follow them back.\u201d</p> <p>Messages from strangers began to pile up in her inbox. \u201cAt the peak, there might be 30 to 40 a day, [many] of them sexual, from men in their 20s to 60s. I was very open about my age on my profile \u2013 I was clearly under 18.\u201d Sometimes she would block accounts, but more often, she\u2019d ignore them.</p>    <p>Ryan (not his real name) was one of her more persistent followers. \u201cI\u2019d say he was about five years older,\u201d she reckons. \u201cThe messages were all like: \u2018Hi. Hello. How are you doing? Wish we could talk.\u2019\u201d To Hooper, he just seemed like \u201csomeone who wanted to talk to me, that I wasn\u2019t really interested in\u201d.</p> <p>His DMs might stop for a few months, and then start again, continuing daily. \u201cWhat was weird was how he jumped between platforms \u2013 he\u2019d find me on Facebook, then move to Tumblr.\u201d Hooper responded once, in 2013. Then, for the next five years, she ignored him. Despite the frequency of his messages, he didn\u2019t particularly stand out \u2013 Hooper got a lot of DMs, some of them daily. Did she see the messages as the price of having a life online?<strong> </strong>\u201cDefinitely. I thought: I\u2019ve put myself out there \u2026 and the content of his messages didn\u2019t seem malicious. It felt like a cost of being on social media.\u201d</p> <p>But by the time Hooper was at university, her internet presence was declining. \u201cI\u2019d say between the ages of 18 and 20, I lost about half my followers,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was always really weird to me \u2026 The content I posted didn\u2019t change.\u201d By the time she got that fateful Facebook message in October 2019, she was already spending less time online.</p> <p>The police response was dispiriting. She says she was repeatedly passed between two forces and in the end the officer sent to take her statement \u201cclearly had no clue about tech \u2013 or how to handle a young girl\u2019s experience\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was retraumatising,\u201d Hooper remembers. \u201cI was left to explain what Reddit was to the officer \u2026 I\u2019m sat there thinking, does he know what he\u2019s doing?\u201d She remembers having to define the misogynistic terms used to describe her: \u201cWhat \u2018DSL\u2019 stands for, \u2018dick sucking lips\u2019. It felt really embarrassing for me.\u201d</p> <p>What support was she offered? \u201cNothing. What was interesting was a year or two later, somebody knocked the wing mirror off my car. And as soon as I reported it, I had a text saying: do you need help with victim support? And I was like, not really \u2026 But that would have been great a year ago!\u201d</p> <p>In February 2020, the police confirmed that it was Ryan who had been posting her pictures. He admitted it to the police and was cautioned under the Malicious Communications Act. Her case was closed.</p>    <p>However, Hooper found she couldn\u2019t stop looking over her shoulder. \u201cKnowing how close he was \u2026 that was the worst part,\u201d she says. Earlier that year, she had started volunteering with the <a href=\"https://www.thecyberhelpline.com/\">Cyber Helpline</a>, a charity advocating for cybercrime victims, where she is now operations manager. The charity works with victims of digital fraud and scams, as well as online harassment, grooming and intimate image abuse. It also supports stalking victims, <a href=\"https://www.thecyberhelpline.com/helpline-blog/2024/4/22/national-stalking-awareness-week-2024\">80% of whom are women</a>; cyberstalking, along with online harassment, accounts for more than 30% of all cybercrime cases reported at the Cyber Helpline. <a href=\"https://www.thecyberhelpline.com/helpline-blog/2024/4/22/national-stalking-awareness-week-2024\">Up to 700,000 women in the UK</a> are believed to become victims of stalking each year \u2013 but research by the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, which runs the National Stalking Helpline, indicates that <a href=\"https://www.suzylamplugh.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=a36b1293-4f9e-4fa2-ae0a-73fc1f47084d\">only 1.7% of stalking reports</a> end in a conviction.</p> <p>After the police cautioned Ryan, Hooper knew there was a chance the stalking could intensify. \u201cI\u2019m thinking: is he going to escalate now I\u2019ve reported him? I was on very high alert \u2013 I didn\u2019t know what he was capable of.\u201d Was he angered by the police caution, she wondered. Could he be watching her in person, too?</p> <p>She had been unable to sleep in the days after finding her photos online, and months on, she could still feel alarm bells ringing, a state known as hypervigilance. \u201cWhenever I left the house, I thought: is he going to be there? The scariest part was not knowing what his next step was going to be.\u201d</p> <p>Hooper had grown up regularly visiting the town where Ryan lived, but she has not been able to face going there since. She shut herself away from socialising for a while and was terrified he would walk into the shop where she worked. The fear would twist her thoughts: if her phone was acting up, she would catch herself wondering if he had hacked it. \u201cOr I\u2019d see people in public, and wonder \u2013 have they seen the posts?\u201d</p> <p>She would be set on edge by simple things, such as being added to a WhatsApp group chat, in case it led to Ryan finding her number. \u201cAny information leakage was the end of the world for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew my data was out there, and I just wanted to suck it back in.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan had deleted his social media profiles since being called out online by another victim, and Hooper knew little about him. But she seemed to see pieces of him everywhere. If a man in the street had the same colour hair, she\u2019d stare at the back of his head until he turned around. Thankfully, it was never Ryan \u2013 though she is not sure she would have recognised him, based only on one profile picture taken years ago: \u201cI felt like he could see me, but I couldn\u2019t see him.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My work has been a major part of coming to terms with it. Putting my energy into supporting others has been therapeutic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite her expert knowledge of the subject, it took Hooper years before she called what was happening by its name. \u201cAt the time, I\u2019d never have said this was stalking,\u201d she says. She questioned whether it was \u201cbad enough\u201d to count. But now, as she lays out the hallmarks of stalking behaviour \u2013 \u201cfixated, obsessed, unwanted, repeated\u201d \u2013 she wishes that at the time Ryan was cautioned she had pushed for stalking and harassment charges. \u201cAnd this is just what I know about. I don\u2019t know if anything else was going on.\u201d</p> <p>Although at first she tried to rationalise away what had happened, the way the pictures had been used hit home. \u201cI felt objectified, like I\u2019d been used as a fetish, which made it feel a lot more personal.\u201d Although Ryan deleted the posts, some remain archived on porn sites, which she says have not responded to her requests for them to be taken down.</p> <p>Still, Hooper feels \u201cpretty lucky\u201d that deepfake technology was still nascent at the time. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of people come to the helpline with really similar [experiences],\u201d she says \u2013 but additionally, the perpetrator has used deepfake \u201cdenuding\u201d technology, either out of \u201cpure maliciousness\u201d or to extort money.</p> <p>Though Ryan never contacted her again after his police caution, it took time for the feeling of threat to dissipate, Hooper says. \u201cBut every time I look over my shoulder and he\u2019s not there, I become a little less hypervigilant.\u201d</p> <p>In the days after October 2019, Hooper made her Twitter and Instagram feeds private. But then she decided she wasn\u2019t going to back down. \u201cIt was quite hard, because I felt like I wanted to. But for me it was just: I don\u2019t want to change anything because of this person. The onus should be on him, not on me.\u201d</p>    <p>Though Hooper had planned to go into policing, her experience drove her to focus on cybercrime victims, and she recently led the Cyber Helpline\u2019s launch in the US. \u201cMy work has been a major part of coming to terms with it,\u201d she says. \u201cPutting my energy into supporting others has been therapeutic.\u201d The charity works with stalking charities and trains police officers: \u201cMulti-agency collaboration is really key.\u201d Last year, Hooper was given a <a href=\"https://diana-award.org.uk/our-programmes-and-initiatives/award-and-development/roll-of-honour/roll-of-honour-2023\">Diana award</a> and a <a href=\"https://truecrimeawards.co.uk/truecrimeawards2025/en/page/crime-fighter-of-the-year\">Crime Fighters</a> award for her work.</p> <p>It also expanded the scope of her ambition. \u201cBefore my experience, my motivation was: how can I support individuals to get the justice they need? My perception has changed in what needs to be [done] as a whole. Cybercrime makes up half of all crime but <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/addressing-cybercrime-challenge-cyberhelplineuk-2xy8e/\">only 5% of police resources</a> are allocated to it. There\u2019s a clear need to change how we tackle the problem.\u201d With a staggering <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gxz5zjpx1o\">87% of cybercrime cases</a> in the UK resulting in no action, she feels there are \u201cmajor opportunities for developing how victims are treated \u2026 whether that\u2019s a national cyber force\u201d or specialised officers within forces.</p> <p>Tech companies, too, must take responsibility and make cyber safety experts central, she says. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t release a car without putting it through rigorous safety testing. AirTags were a good example \u2013 only after they\u2019d been used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/20/apple-airtags-stalking-complaints-technology\">for malicious purposes</a> did they implement safety features.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment, the onus is on the victim. And many platforms are doing the opposite of what they should be doing,\u201d she says, pointing to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2024/10/17/x-will-soon-let-users-see-tweets-from-people-who-block-them-the-controversial-change-explained/\">X relaxing its blocking function</a> while <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/26/tech-companies-are-laying-off-their-ethics-and-safety-teams-.html\">it and other platforms</a> automate their trust and safety teams.</p> <p>This kind of cybercrime transcends borders, and Hooper is backing moves for international efforts to tackle it. Five years on from that \u201csurreal\u201d day in the lecture theatre, she says: \u201cIt\u2019s left me with a real drive to change how we perceive cybercrime \u2013 and how people get justice.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 In the UK, the <a href=\"https://www.suzylamplugh.org/pages/category/national-stalking-helpline\">National Stalking Helpline</a> is on 0808 802 0300 or email via its <a href=\"https://www.suzylamplugh.org/forms/national-stalking-helpline-enquiry-form\">inquiry form</a>.

She shot a quick glance at it \u2013 there were 10 minutes of class left \u2013 and brushed it off. It was from an acquaintance: \u201cIs this you?\u201d, he asked, attaching a link. She assumed it was some kind of scam. But within seconds, another notification popped up: this time, screenshots of selfies she had taken over the years. \u201cI had a very physical reaction to it \u2013 my whole body tensed up. I thought: oh shit, yeah, this is me.\u201d She followed the link to find that photos of her, taken from age 16 onwards, were being hosted on an X-rated chat forum.

Still, Hooper feels \u201cpretty lucky\u201d that deepfake technology was still nascent at the time. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of people come to the helpline with really similar [experiences],\u201d she says \u2013 but additionally, the perpetrator has used deepfake \u201cdenuding\u201d technology, either out of \u201cpure maliciousness\u201d or to extort money. Though Ryan never contacted her again after his police caution, it took time for the feeling of threat to dissipate, Hooper says. \u201cBut every time I look over my shoulder and he\u2019s not there, I become a little less hypervigilant.\u201d In the days after October 2019, Hooper made her Twitter and Instagram feeds private. But then she decided she wasn\u2019t going to back down. \u201cIt was quite hard, because I felt like I wanted to. But for me it was just: I don\u2019t want to change anything because of this person. The onus should be on him, not on me.\u201d Though Hooper had planned to go into policing, her experience drove her to focus on cybercrime victims, and she recently led the Cyber Helpline\u2019s launch in the US. \u201cMy work has been a major part of coming to terms with it,\u201d she says. \u201cPutting my energy into supporting others has been therapeutic.\u201d The charity works with stalking charities and trains police officers: \u201cMulti-agency collaboration is really key.\u201d Last year, Hooper was given a Diana award and a Crime Fighters award for her work. It also expanded the scope of her ambition. \u201cBefore my experience, my motivation was: how can I support individuals to get the justice they need? My perception has changed in what needs to be [done] as a whole. Cybercrime makes up half of all crime but only 5% of police resources are allocated to it. There\u2019s a clear need to change how we tackle the problem.\u201d With a staggering 87% of cybercrime cases in the UK resulting in no action, she feels there are \u201cmajor opportunities for developing how victims are treated \u2026 whether that\u2019s a national cyber force\u201d or specialised officers within forces. Tech companies, too, must take responsibility and make cyber safety experts central, she says. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t release a car without putting it through rigorous safety testing. AirTags were a good example \u2013 only after they\u2019d been used for malicious purposes did they implement safety features. \u201cAt the moment, the onus is on the victim. And many platforms are doing the opposite of what they should be doing,\u201d she says, pointing to X relaxing its blocking function while it and other platforms automate their trust and safety teams. This kind of cybercrime transcends borders, and Hooper is backing moves for international efforts to tackle it. Five years on from that \u201csurreal\u201d day in the lecture theatre, she says: \u201cIt\u2019s left me with a real drive to change how we perceive cybercrime \u2013 and how people get justice.\u201d \u2022 In the UK, the National Stalking Helpline is on 0808 802 0300 or email via its inquiry form. In the US, resources are available at stalkingawareness.org.",

This included deregulation and isolationism. He won with a decisive victory and in 1922 introduced the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordney%E2%80%93McCumber_Tariff\">Fordney-McCumber Tariff</a>, a law that raised American tariffs on many imported goods.</em></p> <h2>America and Europe</h2> <p>From our New York correspondent<br>7 June 1922</p> <p>Most internationally minded American observers who were at <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Conference-of-Genoa\">Genoa</a> or have been following recent events from Europe earnestly desire greater American participation in European affairs. Many thoughtful English liberals agree with them. But, curiously enough, many in America who share their hope that the United States may soon appreciate and bear her share of the world\u2019s burdens and problems believe that participation by the American government in European conferences would at this time be futile and perhaps dangerous.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/07/why-donald-trumps-return-is-a-disaster-for-europe\">Why Donald Trump\u2019s return is a disaster for Europe | Paul Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/hughes-charles-evans\">Mr Hughes</a> is a man of principle, but Mr Harding is a man of expediency. There is no doubt that the administration would like to take a larger part in European affairs; there is no doubt that the financial interests, to which it lends an attentive ear, are of the same mind; and there is also no doubt whatever that financial interest to which it lends and attentive ear, are of the same mind; and there is also no doubt whatever that the mass of American sentiment is steadfastly against it. The huge majority by which Mr Harding defeated the Democratic candidate in the autumn of 1920 was in large part a reaction against Mr Wilson\u2019s entanglement in transatlantic politics.</p> <p>In so far as recent byelections and primary elections can be interpreted as bearing upon foreign policy they show a clear sympathy with the \u201cirreconcilables\u201d who kept the United States out of the League. The Administration, which shifts its domestic policy after every vote in an effort to please the country, would be even more incapable of a clearcut foreign policy.</p> <p>On the Russian question of course the United States has a policy \u2013 as intransigent as that of France. Mr Hughes and Mr Hoover, the two strong men of the Cabinet.</p> <p><strong>A prejudice analysed</strong><br>The popular prejudice against participation in European affairs is often misinterpreted in Europe. It is, in part, of course, merely content with the relative prosperity in America, a selfish unwillingness to bother about a sick continent so far away. But it is vastly more than that. The figures of private donations for relief in Northern France, in Germany, in Austria, in Russia \u2013 which mounted into the tens of millions last year and continue mounting \u2013 are one proof of that. To anyone in touch with the pulse of American life it is plain that the main reason for the hesitation to plunge into Europe is a kind of bewildered disappointment at the results of America\u2019s last plunge. There is no confidence in America\u2019s diplomatic wisdom. The ordinary American farmer has two strong convictions \u2013 first, that the Europeans are making a mess of things; and, second, that the Americans, while they were in Europe, helped to make the mess worse. He would like to help, but he is unwilling to sign more blank cheques. He is confused; the issue is not clear, and until it is he thinks it safer to keep out. Where Wilson failed, he argues, what reason is there to believe that Harding and Hughes would succeed?</p> <p>There were during the Genoa Conference, when Europe seemed to be doing things on its own account, that American feeling was changing. The disappointing result at Genoa was tragic in its effect upon America. It did help still further to destroy the myth of a romantic France that could do no wrong; but tended to make the country still less disposed to mix in European problems. Yet other factors are at work. The discussion of the tariff, in which the New York banks that give the tone to financial opinion throughout the country are almost unanimously arguing for Free Trade, is very salutary indeed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/from-the-archive-blog/2020/mar/04/reconstruction-in-europe-keynes-guardian-guide-1922\">Reconstruction in Europe: a Guardian guide - archive, April 1922</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Genoa despatches of Mr Keynes and of Mr <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_A._Vanderlip\">Frank Vanderlip</a>, the former president of the National City Bank, attracted widespread comment and had a profound educative effect. But the bewildered apathy remains, and while it remains useful American participation in European affairs will be confined to the action of individuals such as Mr Morgan and Mr Vanderlip. It will take some striking event to galvanise American opinion.

      "bodyText": "During the 1920 US presidential election, Warren G Harding campaigned with the slogan \u201creturn to normalcy\u201d \u2013 a return to how things were before the first world war. This included deregulation and isolationism. He won with a decisive victory and in 1922 introduced the Fordney-McCumber Tariff, a law that raised American tariffs on many imported goods. America and Europe From our New York correspondent 7 June 1922 Most internationally minded American observers who were at Genoa or have been following recent events from Europe earnestly desire greater American participation in European affairs. Many thoughtful English liberals agree with them. But, curiously enough, many in America who share their hope that the United States may soon appreciate and bear her share of the world\u2019s burdens and problems believe that participation by the American government in European conferences would at this time be futile and perhaps dangerous. Mr Hughes is a man of principle, but Mr Harding is a man of expediency. There is no doubt that the administration would like to take a larger part in European affairs; there is no doubt that the financial interests, to which it lends an attentive ear, are of the same mind; and there is also no doubt whatever that financial interest to which it lends and attentive ear, are of the same mind; and there is also no doubt whatever that the mass of American sentiment is steadfastly against it. The huge majority by which Mr Harding defeated the Democratic candidate in the autumn of 1920 was in large part a reaction against Mr Wilson\u2019s entanglement in transatlantic politics. In so far as recent byelections and primary elections can be interpreted as bearing upon foreign policy they show a clear sympathy with the \u201cirreconcilables\u201d who kept the United States out of the League. The Administration, which shifts its domestic policy after every vote in an effort to please the country, would be even more incapable of a clearcut foreign policy. On the Russian question of course the United States has a policy \u2013 as intransigent as that of France. Mr Hughes and Mr Hoover, the two strong men of the Cabinet. A prejudice analysed The popular prejudice against participation in European affairs is often misinterpreted in Europe. It is, in part, of course, merely content with the relative prosperity in America, a selfish unwillingness to bother about a sick continent so far away. But it is vastly more than that. The figures of private donations for relief in Northern France, in Germany, in Austria, in Russia \u2013 which mounted into the tens of millions last year and continue mounting \u2013 are one proof of that. To anyone in touch with the pulse of American life it is plain that the main reason for the hesitation to plunge into Europe is a kind of bewildered disappointment at the results of America\u2019s last plunge. There is no confidence in America\u2019s diplomatic wisdom. The ordinary American farmer has two strong convictions \u2013 first, that the Europeans are making a mess of things; and, second, that the Americans, while they were in Europe, helped to make the mess worse. He would like to help, but he is unwilling to sign more blank cheques. He is confused; the issue is not clear, and until it is he thinks it safer to keep out. Where Wilson failed, he argues, what reason is there to believe that Harding and Hughes would succeed? There were during the Genoa Conference, when Europe seemed to be doing things on its own account, that American feeling was changing. The disappointing result at Genoa was tragic in its effect upon America. It did help still further to destroy the myth of a romantic France that could do no wrong; but tended to make the country still less disposed to mix in European problems. Yet other factors are at work. The discussion of the tariff, in which the New York banks that give the tone to financial opinion throughout the country are almost unanimously arguing for Free Trade, is very salutary indeed. The Genoa despatches of Mr Keynes and of Mr Frank Vanderlip, the former president of the National City Bank, attracted widespread comment and had a profound educative effect. But the bewildered apathy remains, and while it remains useful American participation in European affairs will be confined to the action of individuals such as Mr Morgan and Mr Vanderlip. It will take some striking event to galvanise American opinion. If the French should undertake independent military action they would certainly be unanimously condemned in this country; such an act might well give the Administration the popular support it requires for an effective return to the councils of Europe.

      "bodyText": "Beabadoobee\u2019s stage decor \u2013 huge white drapes, an artfully placed stepladder and a dozen cans of paint \u2013 heavily implies that the indie rock singer-songwriter is in the middle of a transformation. Opener and sun-blasted recent single California makes the same case: \u201cWanted to change, it took a big fight,\u201d she sings, leaning out to an eager crowd. \u201cCall it a bluff, you\u2019ll see it real time.\u201d Beatrice Laus\u2019s star has been rising since 2017, but this summer her Rick Rubin-produced third album This Is How Tomorrow Moves earned her first UK No 1. Now 24, she\u2019s said the record is about the \u201cconfusing world of becoming a woman\u201d, while some of those changes she heralds on California include a healthier, long-view approach to touring. There\u2019s a nonchalance to tonight\u2019s opening run; across songs from all three albums, Laus sings about making out and self-harm with a lightness of touch and sets the room pogoing with a beckoning hand for 10:36, her 2022 single about deep loneliness. She\u2019s still working from the same eclectic references \u2013 the fuzz of 90s alt rock, bossa nova, cabaret, shoegaze and retro instrumentation \u2013 but this tour hints at all-out rock band potential. Standout album track One Time has an uneasy bassline and a great guitar shred from bandmate and album co-producer Jacob Bugden, while lead single Beaches has a muscled-up riff and a clear-eyed vision: \u201cI\u2019m sure now, I\u2019m sure!\u201d Laus sings, with visible feeling, even as her breathy, delicate voice is lost in the mix. She\u2019s often drowned out tonight; her vulnerable vocals are so suited to intimacy and texture that it seems tricky to scale them up. But then she finds an extra gear for Together, a self-destructive single from debut Fake It Flowers, and compellingly holds her own. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how nervous I was getting on this stage,\u201d she admits, later. \u201cThank you for making me feel like I\u2019m enough.\u201d Perhaps her nerves showed in this show\u2019s restraint; it felt measured and careful, without the total conviction she sings of \u2013 but Beabadoobee\u2019s pushing for more, in real time, and it\u2019s compelling to watch. \u2022 Beadbadoobee plays O2 City Hall, Newcastle, 13 November, and on UK tour until 21 November, details here",

One listed donor to the fundraiser, a low-wage employee at that mall, admitted to being reimbursed in cash after donating to Adams at the behest of their employer \u2013 an act that would constitute an illegal \u201cstraw\u201d donation.

At the time of the original reporting, the role of Greco at the mall operator\u2019s event was not publicly known. The newly unearthed footage shows the aide escorting Adams in and out of the event, stage-managing photo ops for the candidate, and hugging and laughing with family members of the evening\u2019s host, Lian Wu Shao, the chairman of Queens\u2019 New World Mall. Greco, a prolific fundraising liaison for Adams, has also played a central role in at least two other Adams fundraisers in which purported donors said their donations were forged or resulted in illegal cash reimbursements, as the Guardian, the City, and Documented have previously reported. Last February, following a series of stories on Greco by the three outlets, the FBI raided two of Greco\u2019s homes and Shao\u2019s mall. Steven Brill, an attorney representing Greco, declined to answer questions about his client\u2019s fundraising activities. Adams\u2019s campaign attorney, Vito Pitta, did not respond to questions about Greco\u2019s role in the event or the alleged straw donations, but said the campaign was reviewing the details of the fundraiser. The footage of the fundraiser at Shao\u2019s home also casts doubt on the Adams campaign\u2019s past characterizations of the event and his team\u2019s compliance with campaign finance laws. Last year in response to questions about the suspicious donations, Adams\u2019s campaign insisted in an email to the City that Shao\u2019s fundraiser was bankrolled by the people who attended the event that evening, and that \u201cmany\u201d of these attendees were employees of a local grocery chain, partially owned by Shao\u2019s family. Campaign finance records show that just under 200 small donors gave to Shao\u2019s fundraiser on the day of the event, including almost 40 cashiers and other employees from Shao\u2019s grocery chain, who each gave exactly $249. But the footage shows that only a few dozen guests, not about 200, attended the fundraiser. And most of them, wearing dress shirts and dresses and raising glasses of expensive red wine to toast Shao, appear to be his relatives and business associates, not his low-wage workers. In addition, at least seven of the people listed in the campaign\u2019s financial disclosures as having contributed to the barbecue that day said they never attended \u2013 or did not recall attending \u2013 the fundraising event, which took place at the Shao family\u2019s $4m mansion outside New York City, where a select crowd enjoyed catered sushi and lobster. The discrepancy between the footage of the intimate event and the Adams campaign\u2019s description of it as a large, grassroots fundraiser raises questions about whether his staff knowingly accepted campaign cash that wealthy interests had bundled together and falsely attributed to an army of small donors in order to score additional taxpayer dollars for the campaign. New York City\u2019s campaign finance board runs a public matching fund program that provides candidates with eight-to-one matches for donations of $250 or less, and nearly all of the donations from Shao\u2019s fundraiser were for exactly $249 and $250. Thanks to the small nature of most of these donations, his campaign team was able to apply for more than $300,000 in taxpayer-funded matching funds. The revelations about Shao\u2019s fundraiser come on the heels of September\u2019s explosive federal indictment which accused Adams\u2019s 2021 mayoral campaign of similar conduct: knowingly soliciting and accepting illegal donations from wealthy interests \u2013 in that case, donors with ties to the Turkish government \u2013 who passed their money through small \u201cstraw\u201d donors in order to score Adams additional public matching funds. Adams, who faces charges of wire fraud, bribery and soliciting campaign donations from foreign nationals, has pleaded not guilty. After the indictment, which also referred to Greco without naming her, the longtime Adams aide resigned from her government post as Adams\u2019s Asian affairs director. She is currently being investigated as part of a separate federal inquiry by prosecutors in New York\u2019s eastern district, whose investigation resulted in the recent raids on her two homes and Shao\u2019s mall. As of now Greco has not been publicly charged with any crime. Low-wage employees say mall management pushed them to donate New York City campaign finance rules attempt to curb the influence of business interests in politics, like those of the Shao family, by limiting how much individuals can give to candidates who participate in the city\u2019s public matching funds program. By January of 2021, Shao, chairman of Queens\u2019 New World Mall and the local grocery chain, which is called J-Mart, had already donated $2,000 to Adams, the maximum he was allowed to give at that time.

That bundle of purported small donations put nearly $8,000 into Adams\u2019s campaign coffers, and allowed his campaign team to ask authorities for more than $37,000 in taxpayer-funded matching funds.

Adams\u2019s team did not disclose whether any intermediaries were behind the cluster of donations ahead of the election in response to regulators\u2019 inquiries.

In the 1990s, such angels became synonymous with internet start-up culture.

And it really was a drinking event. I\u2019m not sure I actually watched the game\u2026\u201d</p> <p>She really picked the sport up through her children, who played in Singapore, at the American School.</p> <p>\u201cI love the development and the sense of community it gave them. I think they have incredibly strong values, good work ethic, a good sense of community, a good sense of helping others. I\u2019d like to think my husband and I helped a little bit, but I think it was driven by the rugby culture. I think rugby is a little less of a hot-dog individual sport, because it takes the team to make the win, by and large, and I love that.</p> <p>\u201cI had an incredibly successful 30-year career with Proctor &amp; Gamble and I know a lot about business. I know a lot about investing. I\u2019ve been working the last 10 years both as an independent board director and also as an operating advisor for tier-one private equity so what I\u2019d like to do with WER is not just be an investor but bring some of my business acumen, some of my investment acumen, so we can help drive this forward.\u201d</p>    <p>WER, a women\u2019s 15-a-side league, announced itself last spring. It is set to kick-off next year, semi-pro to start and with teams in Boston, New York, Chicago, the Twin Cities, Denver and the Bay Area, four coached by women, all arising from the structure of the amateur <a href=\"https://www.wplrugby.org/teams\">Women\u2019s Premier League</a>. In September, the Legacy Cup, a WER taster event for WPL teams, saw Colorado Gray Wolves <a href=\"https://scrumhalfconnection.com/2024/09/16/colorado-gray-wolves-triumph-over-all-blues-rugby-in-2024-legacy-cup-finals/#google_vignette\">beat</a> Berkeley All Blues in an epic final in North Carolina.</p> <p>For WER, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/women-s-elite-rugby-wer/company_financials\">funding</a> began with a pre-seed round, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/pro/media-deals/2024/05/30/women-elite-rugby-funding\">raising</a> $500,000 from Henretta and Chasing Rainbows, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm that invests in companies with LGBTQ+ founders. Such efforts continue.</p> <p>This year, the profile of US women\u2019s rugby received a huge boost when the national sevens team took Olympic bronze in Paris. That success attracted an <a href=\"https://usa.rugby/news/usa-rugby-announces-transformative-gift-from-kyniscas-michele-kang-2024730\">announced</a> $4m investment from Michele Kang, owner of women\u2019s soccer teams including the Washington Spirit. The Olympics also propelled the star player Ilona Maher to a Sports Illustrated shoot, <a href=\"https://www.si.com/onsi/rugby/dancing-with-strength-ilona-maher-shatters-stereotypes-on-dancing-with-the-stars-01jc6cnp8cxq\">ABC\u2019s Dancing with the Stars</a> and perhaps next <a href=\"https://www.thethings.com/did-ilona-maher-next-bachelorette-dwts/\">The Bachelorette</a>. Maher has also said she wants to play at the 15-a-side World Cup in England next year. After that, the World Cup will be in Australia in 2029 and then the show will come to the US in 2033, two years after the men\u2019s event lands on American soil.</p> <p>Asked how long it might take to establish WER, Henratta says: \u201cThis thing will take some years to develop. I don\u2019t think anybody who\u2019s going to come into this, from a management, a board, an investor position, is going to be able to look for a quick two- or three- or maybe even five-year exit from the investment. So I think it\u2019s a bit of a longer-term build.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s exciting for me to see what the WNBA has done, what women\u2019s soccer has done. It takes time, but I think we\u2019re going to have to find our way to the investors like myself who are willing to make a longer-term bet, to try to build something extraordinary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/20/packed-houses-and-superstars-have-made-this-a-wnba-season-unlike-any-other\">Packed houses and superstars have made this a WNBA season unlike any other</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think this is the time for women\u2019s sports. Women\u2019s sports are finally starting to take off in a big way. I mean, look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/20/packed-houses-and-superstars-have-made-this-a-wnba-season-unlike-any-other\">the WNBA</a>. Look at what Caitlin Clark has been able to do for Indiana Fever. And when you look at women\u2019s sports at the college level, to offset, from a Title IX standpoint, the large football teams, you need other women\u2019s sports. And so rugby is starting to take hold.\u201d</p> <p>Henretta speaks proudly of her alma mater, the Bonnies, national small college <a href=\"https://www.sbu.edu/news/news-items/2023/12/03/bonnies-hold-off-uw-platteville-22-17-to-claim-small-college-rugby-national-title\">champions</a> last year. Members of that team and others like it will hope to challenge for WER contracts, maybe US Eagles caps too.</p> <p>Angel investors do not seek large profits fast. Henretta knows, first hand, that establishing rugby in the US will never be close to easy. She previously joined up with the World Rugby Football League, which <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230427005737/en/World-Rugby-Football-League-All-Star-Team-to-Host-July-15-2023-NYC-Champion-Sevens-Showcase-World-Rugby-Teams-and-Offer-Major-Market-Franchises\">aimed</a> to host, but <a href=\"https://www.streetinsider.com/Business+Wire/New+York%E2%80%99s+record+severe+air+quality+alerts+force+World+Rugby+Football+League+to+Reschedule+the+RFL%E2%80%99s+Kick-Off+%241%2C000%2C000+NYC+Champion+Sevens+Tournament/21777659.html\">cancelled</a>, a million-dollar sevens event in New Jersey.</p> <p>She was \u201clooking for a sports investment. And I kept getting minor-league baseball teams and, you know, we\u2019re not baseball fans. It just doesn\u2019t hold my interest. So I ended up connecting through a private equity firm with [WRFL founder] Bill Tatham and we made a run.\u201d</p> <p>WRFL stumbled but Henretta found WER: \u201cSome people play golf and they spend a lot of money on country clubs and golf clubs. And that\u2019s not our thing. We love rugby. I\u2019d love to give rugby a jump start here in the US.</p>    <p>\u201cI did not want to go forward with the men\u2019s rugby. And I\u2019ll tell you why: because there are so many groups of people trying to make a go of men\u2019s rugby, and they will not play in the sandbox together. And I tried my hardest to get some of these entities into a room, like, let\u2019s figure out what we can do instead of spending money to compete against each other. Why don\u2019t we pool our resources and see if we can\u2019t get the sport established \u2026 you can\u2019t compete with each other when you\u2019re trying to get a league started in a sport that has lower awareness and lower loyalty \u2026 I just couldn\u2019t seem to swing that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/22/womens-rugby-union-world-cup-has-hallmarks-of-game-changer-breakdown\">The Breakdown | Women\u2019s World Cup has the hallmarks of game-changer for rugby union</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>For Henretta, what made WER different \u201cis it\u2019s a single-entity structure where you\u2019re going to establish something, you\u2019re going to work together with USA Rugby, you\u2019re going to work together with global rugby as a unit dedicated to building the sport.

      "bodyText": "The term \u201cangel investor\u201d comes from 1950s Broadway, where eager producers sought wealthy individuals to get their plays off the ground. In the 1990s, such angels became synonymous with internet start-up culture. Now, Deb Henretta, a former Proctor &amp; Gamble executive and habitu\u00e9 of Fortune magazine\u2019s list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, is playing such a role for a US sporting start-up: Women\u2019s Elite Rugby. \u201cI am a little bit of an angel investor,\u201d Henretta says from her home in Cincinnati, via Zoom, \u201cbecause we\u2019re just getting started, and I happen to be someone who has an absolute love and passion for rugby.\u201d Henretta knew the game at college, St Bonaventure in New York, though not as a player. \u201cWhen you went to the rugby games, there was a keg on the sidelines. And it really was a drinking event. I\u2019m not sure I actually watched the game\u2026\u201d She really picked the sport up through her children, who played in Singapore, at the American School. \u201cI love the development and the sense of community it gave them. I think they have incredibly strong values, good work ethic, a good sense of community, a good sense of helping others. I\u2019d like to think my husband and I helped a little bit, but I think it was driven by the rugby culture. I think rugby is a little less of a hot-dog individual sport, because it takes the team to make the win, by and large, and I love that. \u201cI had an incredibly successful 30-year career with Proctor &amp; Gamble and I know a lot about business. I know a lot about investing. I\u2019ve been working the last 10 years both as an independent board director and also as an operating advisor for tier-one private equity so what I\u2019d like to do with WER is not just be an investor but bring some of my business acumen, some of my investment acumen, so we can help drive this forward.\u201d WER, a women\u2019s 15-a-side league, announced itself last spring. It is set to kick-off next year, semi-pro to start and with teams in Boston, New York, Chicago, the Twin Cities, Denver and the Bay Area, four coached by women, all arising from the structure of the amateur Women\u2019s Premier League. In September, the Legacy Cup, a WER taster event for WPL teams, saw Colorado Gray Wolves beat Berkeley All Blues in an epic final in North Carolina. For WER, funding began with a pre-seed round, raising $500,000 from Henretta and Chasing Rainbows, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm that invests in companies with LGBTQ+ founders. Such efforts continue. This year, the profile of US women\u2019s rugby received a huge boost when the national sevens team took Olympic bronze in Paris. That success attracted an announced $4m investment from Michele Kang, owner of women\u2019s soccer teams including the Washington Spirit. The Olympics also propelled the star player Ilona Maher to a Sports Illustrated shoot, ABC\u2019s Dancing with the Stars and perhaps next The Bachelorette. Maher has also said she wants to play at the 15-a-side World Cup in England next year. After that, the World Cup will be in Australia in 2029 and then the show will come to the US in 2033, two years after the men\u2019s event lands on American soil. Asked how long it might take to establish WER, Henratta says: \u201cThis thing will take some years to develop. I don\u2019t think anybody who\u2019s going to come into this, from a management, a board, an investor position, is going to be able to look for a quick two- or three- or maybe even five-year exit from the investment. So I think it\u2019s a bit of a longer-term build. \u201cBut it\u2019s exciting for me to see what the WNBA has done, what women\u2019s soccer has done. It takes time, but I think we\u2019re going to have to find our way to the investors like myself who are willing to make a longer-term bet, to try to build something extraordinary. \u201cI think this is the time for women\u2019s sports. Women\u2019s sports are finally starting to take off in a big way. I mean, look at the WNBA. Look at what Caitlin Clark has been able to do for Indiana Fever. And when you look at women\u2019s sports at the college level, to offset, from a Title IX standpoint, the large football teams, you need other women\u2019s sports. And so rugby is starting to take hold.\u201d Henretta speaks proudly of her alma mater, the Bonnies, national small college champions last year. Members of that team and others like it will hope to challenge for WER contracts, maybe US Eagles caps too. Angel investors do not seek large profits fast. Henretta knows, first hand, that establishing rugby in the US will never be close to easy. She previously joined up with the World Rugby Football League, which aimed to host, but cancelled, a million-dollar sevens event in New Jersey. She was \u201clooking for a sports investment. And I kept getting minor-league baseball teams and, you know, we\u2019re not baseball fans. It just doesn\u2019t hold my interest. So I ended up connecting through a private equity firm with [WRFL founder] Bill Tatham and we made a run.\u201d WRFL stumbled but Henretta found WER: \u201cSome people play golf and they spend a lot of money on country clubs and golf clubs. And that\u2019s not our thing. We love rugby. I\u2019d love to give rugby a jump start here in the US. \u201cI did not want to go forward with the men\u2019s rugby. And I\u2019ll tell you why: because there are so many groups of people trying to make a go of men\u2019s rugby, and they will not play in the sandbox together. And I tried my hardest to get some of these entities into a room, like, let\u2019s figure out what we can do instead of spending money to compete against each other. Why don\u2019t we pool our resources and see if we can\u2019t get the sport established \u2026 you can\u2019t compete with each other when you\u2019re trying to get a league started in a sport that has lower awareness and lower loyalty \u2026 I just couldn\u2019t seem to swing that.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 For Henretta, what made WER different \u201cis it\u2019s a single-entity structure where you\u2019re going to establish something, you\u2019re going to work together with USA Rugby, you\u2019re going to work together with global rugby as a unit dedicated to building the sport. Then when you\u2019ve got the sport built, when you\u2019ve got some loyalty to teams and some success with players, then you can either come up with a sort of NFL, NBA kind of structure, where you compete that way, or if you really feel you need to spin off and do an alternative league, go for it, but do it once the sport has awareness and it\u2019s established.\u201d WER will be tested in the short term, as it attempts to establish itself and survive, and in the longer term, as that home World Cup approaches. Henretta says she is \u201ca passionate rugby person with the financial ability to to make some investments in the sport. I\u2019d love to see nothing more than women\u2019s and men\u2019s rugby making a bigger impact. \u201cIn the run up to the 2028 Olympics in LA, and also prior to the 2033 World Cup, it\u2019s an exciting time. If rugby is going to make an impact and get something going, I think it\u2019s going to be in this window. If we\u2019re not successful, shame on us.\u201d",

My last book looked at <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/tesla-inventor-of-the-modern-richard-munson/16607175\">Nikola Tesla</a>, who brought us the electric motor, radio remote control, the list goes on.

Franklin was saying: \u2018There\u2019s nothing more important than experimentation, observation, verifiable analysis.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cSo it struck me as a chance to highlight one of our nation\u2019s founders, probably our most popular one, who has relevance in this age when we\u2019re so disjointed. He\u2019s speaking out for civility and free speech and tolerance. That all struck me as an important message to get across.\u201d</p> <p>Munson is speaking from his home outside Chicago, a week after election day, when Donald Trump stormed back to power. News of the far-right president-elect\u2019s intended appointments is leaching out. Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine conspiracy theorist, is reportedly close to a position <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/election-trump-antivax-movement\">as a health policy \u201cczar\u201d</a>. As it happens, Franklin had problems with vaccine denial too.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an awkward position that he was in,\u201d Munson says, of Franklin\u2019s time in Philadelphia in the mid-18th century, a printer and newspaperman. \u201cIt was his brother who was the one that went after vaccines in particular, because he was trying to sell more newspapers by having a sort of contest with [the Boston minister] Cotton Mather, who was the pre-eminent religious figure [in the US colonies] but also really quite welcoming to science.</p> <p>\u201cYoung Benjamin didn\u2019t really speak out much, but didn\u2019t try and stop his brother at the same time. Eventually Benjamin came around to embrace inoculation and express horror that his son died because he and his wife decided not to inoculate him against smallpox.\u201d</p>    <p>Franklin\u2019s politics remain relevant, too. In 1787, when the US constitution was written, he famously, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/12/18/republic-if-you-can-keep-it-did-ben-franklin-really-say-impeachment-days-favorite-quote/\">supposedly</a>, told a questioner the new government would be \u201ca republic, if you can keep it\u201d. That warning is regularly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/11/06/trump-election-americans-blame-democracy/\">trotted out</a> whenever Trump\u2019s perceived threat to US democracy is discussed, not least in the present moment. But the real Franklin was never the sort of democratic demigod he is sometimes claimed to have been, serene above the partisan fray. Like the other people who shaped a new country, winning independence from Britain and writing the constitution, he was as flawed as he was great.</p> <p>It might be said that instead of skeletons in his closet, Franklin had, as Munson puts it, \u201ccadavers in his basement\u201d. In 1998, at the house on Craven Street in London from which Franklin represented Pennsylvania <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/benjamin-franklin-in-london\">between 1757 and 1775</a>, workmen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/aug/11/usa.past\">found a pit of human bones</a>. They were leftovers from the work of William Hewson, an anatomist who set up shop in the house and died after contracting an infection from a corpse.</p> <p>Eighteenth-century science was messy and dangerous. Franklin\u2019s own experiments \u2013 most famously, flying a kite in a thunderstorm to show lightning was an electrical discharge \u2013 could have hurt him more than they did. In terms of his reputation, his <a href=\"https://benjaminfranklinhouse.org/franklin-and-slavery-peter-and-king/\">ownership of enslaved people</a> might do damage yet. His newspaper printed advertisements for the sale of enslaved people or seeking the capture of those who ran away; his household owned as many as seven enslaved people; and in London he was accompanied by two enslaved African men, Peter and King. Peter\u2019s fate is unknown. King escaped and found refuge in Suffolk, where Franklin ultimately left him. Franklin\u2019s views changed.</p> <p>\u201cNot everybody came around like he did at the end,\u201d Munson says. \u201cAnd the way that he came around, I think, is perfectly Benjamin. He writes this snide little story in response to a Georgia slave-owning legislator who says that it\u2019s appropriate for plantation owners to enslave people because the Bible says it\u2019s right and it\u2019s necessary for their economy, and so on. Franklin writes the view of an \u2018Algerian legislator\u2019 that, in fact, the Koran says it\u2019s just fine too and we\u2019re enslaving Christians because they are the only ones who will do their dirty work for us.\u2019 That\u2019s one way to skewer the slave-owners.</p> <p>\u201cThe challenge for a biographer is you have to sort of peel back Franklin\u2019s voices. Because is he Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim? Not really. He\u2019s Ben Franklin, putting on different personas, <a href=\"https://www.hudson.org/domestic-policy/benjamin-franklin-and-fake-news\">and he did that a lot</a>, which wasn\u2019t all that uncommon back then. But I think there\u2019s power in that snideness. It was a way to approach slavery in a way that people would have to sort of step back and think: \u2018Well, all right, maybe I need to rethink this.\u2019 Obviously, they didn\u2019t for a long time, but at least that was his attempt.\u201d</p> <p>By the time the constitution was written, Franklin wasn\u2019t the only founder who opposed slavery but chose not to challenge the slave-owning states. The results are with us still: minority rule through a skewed constitutional structure, institutional racism deepening social division.</p> <p>Munson says: \u201cYou can go back and criticize Franklin, if you want to, for not raising the slavery issue during the second constitutional convention, which was the appropriate time to do it. But he made the judgment call, most historians probably would agree, that it wouldn\u2019t work. The southerners would have split. You wouldn\u2019t have had a union. And he valued the union more than getting an anti-slavery majority. Was that a good or a bad thing? It was just the temper of the times.</p> <p>\u201cHe fathered a son out of wedlock \u2026 he\u2019s admitting he had a great time going to brothels and pubs. I think you can look back on those and sort of diss him \u2026 but he has multiplicities, as we all do. He tried to resolve them, but he couldn\u2019t hide them. And I guess I was trying not to hide them, but I still come away with thinking this guy was really clever and fun.\u201d</p>    <p>Munson\u2019s biography is concise but comprehensive, a highly readable epic in 210 pages, no mean feat given all Franklin saw and did in his 84 years. As a legislator and leader, his civic contributions included helping to form the first Philadelphia public library, police force and firefighting company, and co-founding the University of Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Munson\u2019s focus on Franklin\u2019s scientific work grew from his own career \u2013 including a stint as senior director of the Environmental Defense Fund \u2013 and a belief that Franklin the scientist has been relatively neglected by biographers generally focused on Franklin the politician and diplomat, particularly his time in France <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1776-1783/b-franklin#:~:text=Franklin%20served%20from%201776%20to,of%20the%20New%20World%20Enlightenment.\">between 1776 and 1785</a>, when he helped secure the alliance that ensured independence for America.</p> <p>Amid it all, Franklin inquired and experimented ceaselessly, designing heating stoves, exploring the properties of oil and water, even inventing his own bifocal glasses.

      "bodyText": "Asked how he came to write Ingenious, his new biography of Benjamin Franklin presenting the American founder in light of his work as a scientist, the author and clean energy advocate Richard Munson offers \u201ctwo reasons. One is that I\u2019ve been fascinated with innovators. My last book looked at Nikola Tesla, who brought us the electric motor, radio remote control, the list goes on. And Franklin just seemed like another remarkable individual who brought new ideas to life. \u201cBut it also struck me that at this time with our modern politics, he has great relevance \u2013 while there\u2019s a growing group of activists that dismiss science and reject facts. Franklin was saying: \u2018There\u2019s nothing more important than experimentation, observation, verifiable analysis.\u2019 \u201cSo it struck me as a chance to highlight one of our nation\u2019s founders, probably our most popular one, who has relevance in this age when we\u2019re so disjointed. He\u2019s speaking out for civility and free speech and tolerance. That all struck me as an important message to get across.\u201d Munson is speaking from his home outside Chicago, a week after election day, when Donald Trump stormed back to power. News of the far-right president-elect\u2019s intended appointments is leaching out. Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine conspiracy theorist, is reportedly close to a position as a health policy \u201cczar\u201d. As it happens, Franklin had problems with vaccine denial too. \u201cIt was an awkward position that he was in,\u201d Munson says, of Franklin\u2019s time in Philadelphia in the mid-18th century, a printer and newspaperman. \u201cIt was his brother who was the one that went after vaccines in particular, because he was trying to sell more newspapers by having a sort of contest with [the Boston minister] Cotton Mather, who was the pre-eminent religious figure [in the US colonies] but also really quite welcoming to science. \u201cYoung Benjamin didn\u2019t really speak out much, but didn\u2019t try and stop his brother at the same time.

      "bodyText": "A bishop and a cabinet minister have said more senior clergy in the Church of England may need to resign after a damning report into a sadistic abuser. Julie Conalty, the bishop of Birkenhead and deputy lead bishop for safeguarding, said Justin Welby had \u201cdone the right thing\u201d on Tuesday by resigning as archbishop of Canterbury. Conalty told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cJust the archbishop of Canterbury resigning is not going to solve the problem. This is about institutional changes, our culture and a systemic failure so there must be more that we need to do. Very possibly some of the people should go.\u201d Wes Streeting, the health secretary and a practising Anglican, said it was right that Welby had taken responsibility for the C of E\u2019s failures on abuse. But, in a warning to other church leaders, he added: \u201cDon\u2019t think one head rolling solves the problem\u201d. \u201cThere are deep and fundamental issues of practice and culture on safeguarding that need to be taken seriously \u2026 The culture of cover-up has been part of the problem on serious abuse allegations for far too long,\u201d he told the BBC. The independent Makin report had said Welby, the spiritual leader of 85 million Anglicans worldwide, was \u201cinsufficiently curious\u201d about allegations of abuse by John Smyth, a barrister who ran Christian summer camps in the 1970s and 80s. Survivors have said that other senior clergy who failed to take effective action when told of Smyth\u2019s abuse should also resign. The review of the Smyth case names several serving and retired bishops as people who were told of allegations. They include Stephen Conway, the bishop of Lincoln, and formerly the bishop of Ely. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Conway said he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for not \u201crigorously pursuing\u201d the matter with the archbishop of Canterbury. He insisted that he did all he could within his authority by making a detailed disclosure to Lambeth Palace, and contacting the diocese in South Africa to which Smith had moved. \u201cI am clear that I did all within my authority as a bishop of the Church of England, bearing in mind that I had no authority over an entirely independent province on another continent. \u201cI acknowledge fully that my fault was in not rigorously pursuing Lambeth about that province-to-province communication, and for this I am deeply sorry.\u201d The independent report said Conway and others had been complacent and that \u201cserious abuse and crimes [were] being covered up at the time\u201d. Mark Stibbe, a former vicar and survivor of abuse, said senior church figures should step down. Survivors wanted \u201cmore resignations because that means more accountability, people taking responsibility for having been silent when they should have spoken,\u201d he told Channel 4 News. Andrew Morse, another victim of Smyth, said Welby was \u201cjust the leader and there are countless other Anglican churchmen who equally bear responsibility\u201d. Welby had provided \u201can example for them whether they follow it or not\u201d. Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, said \u201csome people pretty systematically covered this up, and those people do need to be brought to account\u201d. However, he declined to be drawn on individuals such as Conway. Those who had actively covered up Smyth\u2019s abuse were not bishops, he said. Welby had resigned as a way of taking \u201cpersonal responsibility for institutional failings\u201d, Cottrell told the BBC. The C of E was taking steps to put effective safeguarding measures in place, but it was \u201cfrustrating\u201d that it was taking so long. Cottrell, who is expected to step up to the top position in the church until a new archbishop of Canterbury is appointed, said: \u201cI now find I have additional responsibilities to change the culture and to change the way the church is safeguarded.\u201d Conalty also said she could not guarantee the C of E was a safe institution. \u201cIt is frustrating for me because in many ways we have been working really hard at making churches safer places,\u201d she said. \u201cNo institution, nothing, can ever be totally safe but there has been loads of really good work going on. \u201cWe still have this institutional problem where we are not putting victims and survivors at the centre. In some ways, we are not a safe institution.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The only time I have met Kemi Badenoch was in a television studio a few months ago when she shamed me into a stumbling apology. We were part of a panel discussing her plan to bar transgender people from entering female-only spaces. And the then equalities minister had, for once, gone out of her way to emphasise the need for a reasoned debate on this bitterly contested issue. So how, I asked, could she then justify a <a href=\"https://x.com/Conservatives/status/1797542007134662849\">Conservative advert</a><strong> </strong>that day claiming Keir Starmer didn\u2019t know \u201cwhat a woman is\u201d?</p> <p>Badenoch replied with words that would chill the blood of anyone with vaguely progressive instincts. \u201cPlease don\u2019t point at me like that, I find it unnecessarily aggressive,\u201d she said. \u201cErr \u2026 sorry,\u201d I muttered, \u201cthere are some strong feelings on this.\u201d Fair enough. Middle-aged white men like me really should have learned by now to keep their fingers under control.</p> <p>My purpose in recalling this slightly painful experience now is because there has been some excited chatter that the \u201cforthright\u201d new Tory leader will cause similar discomfort for Starmer.</p> <p>Even though the prime minister has never really been the finger-jabbing type, his new opponent is not averse to using her gender and ethnicity to invalidate other opinions in a fashion more often associated with the \u201cwoke\u201d identity politics she usually professes to despise. Earlier this year, when the actor David Tennant said he wanted her to \u201cshut up\u201d on transgender issues, <a href=\"https://x.com/KemiBadenoch/status/1805613113380585496\">Badenoch responded</a> that it wasn\u2019t a good look for \u201ca rich, lefty, white male celebrity\u201d to attack \u201cthe only Black woman in government\u201d. Last month, she claimed this identity alone would make her \u201c<a href=\"https://www.conservatives.com/news/i-am-labours-worst-nightmare\">Labour\u2019s worst nightmare</a>\u201d if elected leader. \u201cThey want to paint people on the right as being prejudiced, and they know that with me there, they will be unable to make that case convincingly.\u201d</p> <p>Her arrival as leader of the opposition has coincided with a couple of fresh allegations about Starmer. In September, the Canterbury MP, Rosie Duffield, quit the Labour party with a long list of grievances that included Starmer having some sort of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/29/rosie-duffield-keir-starmer-women-problem-labour\">problem with women</a>\u201d. More recently, leaked WhatsApp messages from MPs have suggested he has a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/03/senior-labour-mps-frustrated-at-lack-of-black-officials-in-no-10\">blind spot</a>\u201d on race because his appointments to Downing Street have so far not included any senior Black advisers.</p> <p>Such accusations are easier to fling around than refute. For what it\u2019s worth, however, I suspect it will be difficult to make this type of mud stick on Starmer. He has a select group of old friends from outside politics who are generally better sources about his values than anyone running around Westminster. Although football and the pub (or watching football in a pub) dominate vast tracts of his hinterland, there\u2019s none of that casual sexism or racism often associated with such pastimes. \u201cThat\u2019s just not in him,\u201d says one of his most regular companions.</p> <p>His tight circle of friends also includes Indra Sharma, who he first met at grammar school four and a half decades ago. \u201cAs a half-Asian girl, I suppose I stood out a bit in Surrey during the 1970s,\u201d she says, \u201cbut Keir never showed anything except respect to me and my father.\u201d Sharma has fond memories of him taking her \u201cdodgy early boyfriend\u201d aside one night so that the future prime minister could explain exactly how he should behave. \u201cThat\u2019s what Keir\u2019s like and how he was brought up,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>None of which, of course, gives Starmer a free pass on such issues. He remains sensitive to repeated claims that his Downing Street team is a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d, while aides say he will also want to appoint more people of colour in coming months. But the most important difference between him and Badenoch is not so much about race and gender, or even her rightwing views, as their sharply contrasting approach to big political choices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2024/nov/04/tories-kemi-badenoch-election\">\u2018High energy, high risk\u2019: Tories already wonder if Kemi Badenoch will last until the next election | Katy Balls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At her first outing in the House of Commons last week, Badenoch found no fewer than five ways of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/06/keir-starmer-congratulates-donald-trump-uk-politics-live-news?page=with:block-672b5b768f08143bb9017515#block-672b5b768f08143bb9017515\">praising Donald Trump\u2019s triumph</a> in the US presidential election as she sought to embarrass Britain\u2019s left-of-centre prime minister.

But if they were serving an anti-Soviet purpose, the musicians were entitled also to see something more than philistinism in the Soviet Union\u2019s icy indifference to jazz, and to see this music as a vital link between the new African anticolonialism and the drive for civil rights at home. This is a film which has a little of Oliver Stone in the way it inhales something eerie and sinister in the atmosphere, and it\u2019s something to set alongside Leon Gast\u2019s 1996 documentary When We Were Kings, about the Ali-Foreman boxing match in Zaire (formerly Congo) more than a decade after Lumumba\u2019s death; another chapter in this strange international culture war. \u2022 Soundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat is in UK cinemas from 15 November.",

This dropout rate is understandable. The trail\u2019s epic scale gives low-probability risks ample room to transform into unsolvable problems.</p> <p>The trail, which spans much of the eastern United States, stretches 2,190-miles (3,524 km) across the Appalachian Mountains and through 14 US states, much of it in wilderness. Among those who successfully thru-hike the route from Maine to Georgia (or vice versa), most will need five to seven months to complete the trip. But American ultrarunner Tara Dower is no ordinary hiker. In September, she set a new speed record on the Appalachian Trail, finishing her thru-hike in just under 41 days, beating the previous record by 13 hours. Covering such a distance in that span required Dower to run the equivalent of more than two marathons each day \u2013 over mountains. Speaking with the Guardian a few weeks after finishing her record-setting run, Dower could still feel every step.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m <em>tired</em>,\u201d she admits. \u201cI tried to run the other day and it was embarrassing. I ran for five seconds was like, \u2018All right, I\u2019m done.\u2019\u201d Dower regularly runs (and <a href=\"https://www.umstead100.org/results.html\">wins</a>) 100 mile, single-day races, so her extreme fatigue is a testament to the challenges the trail poses to runners chasing speed records. Despite her accomplished career in elite ultrarunning, however, Dower also knows the pain that the Appalachian Trail can inflict \u2013 seven years ago, she was one of the 75% of people unable to complete their thru-hike.</p> <p>\u201c2017 is really where it began,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd, [it] didn\u2019t go <em>quite</em> the way I wanted it to.\u201d After years of completing small sections of the trail, she experienced a panic attack just eight days into her first planned thru-hike.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t process fully what that would look like, physically [and] mentally \u2026 It was a change to the system. To go from the comfort of a home and the comfort of showers and a bed,\u201d Dower says. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t know what it was. I didn\u2019t understand panic attacks \u2013 [they are] a <em>very</em> physical manifestation of anxiety. I felt like something was sitting on my chest \u2026 I didn\u2019t really understand, at the time, how to <em>deal</em> with anxiety. I had just graduated college and, I guess, I just thought that \u2018If you don\u2019t think about it, it\u2019ll be OK.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Dower says she was \u201cdevastated\u201d after her first attempt, which raises the question of why she tried again. It is, perhaps, an unfair question \u2013 nobody grills Lionel Messi over his decision to play another match after a loss. At the same time, success in football doesn\u2019t require days of sleep deprivation, weeks without showers, or many of the other myriad <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37535248/\">hardships endured by elite ultrarunners</a>.</p> <p>But Dower\u2019s relationship with endurance sport is the product of three factors: a natural penchant for long-distance running, a lifelong affection for the Appalachians and, of unexpected importance, a Covid-related travel complication. Raised in the relatively flat suburbia of central North Carolina, Dower\u2019s passion for sport started early but was directed away from the mountains.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up watching sports, I\u2019m a Dallas Cowboys fan,\u201d she says. \u201cI played soccer throughout my life and ran [track and cross-country] in middle school and high school. I\u2019m not one to stay still very often.\u201d She went on to play rugby at college, where she studied sport and hoped to segue her degree into a career in the NFL.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to do <em>something</em> with the Dallas Cowboys,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI was just getting a degree in something that I enjoyed learning about and hoping that I could figure out, a little later, what I wanted.\u201d</p> <p>A chance viewing of a documentary about the Appalachian Trail, however, introduced Dower to a new subculture that caught her attention and, eventually, changed her life. Although she\u2019d encountered the Appalachians during family trips, the culture of thru-hiking depicted in the film fascinated her.</p> <p>\u201cJust the act of walking from Georgia to Maine seemed really difficult and bizarre. Like, who <em>does</em> that? At the time, I never even knew that people even did that,\u201d she says. \u201cI was really intrigued by experience of the mountains, but I think I was more focused on the challenge of it.\u201d Dower eventually decided that she too would attempt to thru-hike the full trail.</p> <p>She took at a job at an outdoor shop where, among other things, she was able to buy discounted gear for her expedition \u2013 the same trip that ended with her panic attack.</p>    <p>\u201cThe panic attack really scared me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really hard for me to see anything to do with the thru-hiking [in the future].\u201d Eventually she would try the thru-hike again with her husband, Jonathan, in 2019. This time she was successful.</p> <p>\u201cWe were on the trail as newlyweds,\u201d Dower says. \u201cI really <em>peaked</em> during that thru-hike in 2019 ... I still say that now, even after setting this [record]. Still, [2019] is the best experience of my life.\u201d</p> <p>With the Appalachian Trail finally under her belt, Dower decided to thru-hike another trail. She eventually landed on a 2020 journey along <a href=\"https://mountainstoseatrail.org/\">the Mountain-to-Sea Trail</a>, a 1,100 mile path that runs from North Carolina\u2019s mountains to the Atlantic coast. Like her 2019 thru-hike with Jonathan, Dower\u2019s Mountain-to-Sea journey was initially intended to be a non-competitive, recreational trip. Then Covid happened.</p> <p>Thru-hikers walking long distances often rely on pitstops in small towns to replenish their supplies. During Covid lockdowns, however, such interactions were discouraged. As a workaround, Dower asked people already in her \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/pandemic-pod-winter-covid/2020/10/14/214ed65c-0d63-11eb-b1e8-16b59b92b36d_story.html\">pandemic pod</a>\u201d to meet her with supplies along the way. In doing so, she realized that she was also inadvertently setting the conditions for a \u201csupported fastest known time\u201d attempt.</p> <p>A quick explanation \u2013 attempts at a trail\u2019s fastest known time (FKT) are where long-distance hikers can engage their competitive side. A <a href=\"https://fastestknowntime.com/\">database of FKT speed records</a>, managed by <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/\">Outside</a> magazine, updates and verifies attempts daily, organizing them by several variables. Dower\u2019s recent record, for example, was achieved while working with a team and travelling southward along the trail. In addition to setting the record in this specific category, Dower\u2019s run is also <a href=\"https://fastestknowntime.com/route/appalachian-trail\">the fastest overall Appalachian Trail thru-hike</a> regardless of support-type or direction of travel.</p> <p>Despite never attempting an FKT previously, Covid restrictions and helpful friends meant that Dower could easily adapt her pitstops on the Mountain-to-Sea Trail to maximise her efficiency. So, she decided to also attempt the FKT. Although inarguably a success \u2013 in the frequently updating world of FKTs, Dower still holds the <a href=\"https://fastestknowntime.com/route/mountains-sea-trail-nc\">Mountain-to-Sea Trail\u2019s female FKT</a> \u2013 it wasn\u2019t enjoyable.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a really difficult experience. I didn\u2019t really know what I was doing. My crew \u2013 we weren\u2019t really <em>that</em> well-versed in what we were doing, as far as nutrition and sleep deprivation. It was probably the hardest FKT I\u2019ve done,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t run for more than 10 seconds without feeling like I was going to fall over and faint \u2026 My brain was like scrambled eggs out there.\u201d</p> <p>Despite those difficulties, Dower\u2019s interest in competitive sport was reignited and she was intrigued by the team dynamic of what is superficially an individual pursuit.</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely in supported FKTs, I consider it a team sport,\u201d she says, comparing her support team to a motorsport pit crew. \u201cI am the <em>physical</em> racecar. I like to view <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbTcOcH5LoI\">Rascal</a> [Dower\u2019s support team leader] as the pit crew chief and the pacer with me at [any given] time is the <em>driver</em> <em>of</em> the racecar. Although I am moving my body, they are the ones leading me and feeding me. And then the \u2018pit crew\u2019 is fuelling me and maintaining my body and all I am is this physical manifestation of this FKT. I wish on [Outdoor\u2019s FKT database] they would refer to it as a \u2018team,\u2019 rather than just my name.\u201d Her experience on the Mountain-to-Sea Trail helped her finetune her team selection process for her Appalachian Trail FKT attempt.</p> <p>\u201cI look for people who know me really well,\u201d she says. \u201cThey kind of push me a little harder and there\u2019s no real sympathy there. It\u2019s going to be hard and I\u2019m probably going to cry and I probably am going to be injured or hurt. It\u2019s just nice to have people there who are going to push you a little further.\u201d The new strategy worked. Although Dower had <a href=\"https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=95482\">won other races</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trailrunnermag.com/people/news/tara-dower-colorado-trail-womens-supported-fkt/\">set other FKTs</a> in the time since her thru-hike on the Mountain-to-Sea Trail, her recent record on the Appalachian Trail clearly stands out.</p> <p>\u201cI think this is \u2018mission accomplished.\u2019 Even if I hold [the record] for a day,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is just a more meaningful record \u2026 Not a lot of people have come close to beating the Appalachian Trail record.\u201d She already knows of multiple men who plan on pursuing her record next season. It\u2019s worth noting that Dower is the fastest person, male or female, to complete the Appalachian Trail. For her part, she hopes at least as many women attempt to break it as well.</p> <p>\u201cI would love to encourage more women to go for these long FKTs,\u201d Dower says, \u201cbecause I do think we have this special gift for endurance.\u201d She is part of a broader trend in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/13/leah-goldstein-the-cyclist-who-raced-men-across-america-and-won\">female athletes outperform their male counterparts</a> in ultra long-distance events. As anecdotal evidence, she mentions the <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/hiking-and-backpacking/thru-hiking-body-image/\">widely made observation in the hiking community</a> that men often seem emaciated at the end of a thru-hike, whereas women appear to be at peak fitness.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s somebody out there,\u201d she says, \u201cBut I\u2019ve yet to see a photo of a woman after her through-hike looking as starved as a man.\u201d</p> <p>Although generous with her thoughts about the future of Appalachian Trail FKTs, Dower is more guarded about predictions for her own career. Many peers have encouraged her to chase FKTs on other routes out west which, along with the Appalachian Trail, comprise the \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Hiking\">American Triple Crown of Hiking</a>.\u201d She\u2019s not ready to make such a decision. For the time being, she\u2019s still processing (and recovering from) her time on the very trail that, just seven years ago, left her feeling devastated.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I did finally break [the Appalachian Trail record], and it was official and it was verified \u2026\u201d Dower momentarily loses her words, before concluding, \u201cI was complete.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 November 2024. Tara Dower was running the trail southward, not northward, when she set the record.</p> <p><br></p>",

As anecdotal evidence, she mentions the widely made observation in the hiking community that men often seem emaciated at the end of a thru-hike, whereas women appear to be at peak fitness. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s somebody out there,\u201d she says, \u201cBut I\u2019ve yet to see a photo of a woman after her through-hike looking as starved as a man.\u201d Although generous with her thoughts about the future of Appalachian Trail FKTs, Dower is more guarded about predictions for her own career. Many peers have encouraged her to chase FKTs on other routes out west which, along with the Appalachian Trail, comprise the \u201cAmerican Triple Crown of Hiking.\u201d She\u2019s not ready to make such a decision. For the time being, she\u2019s still processing (and recovering from) her time on the very trail that, just seven years ago, left her feeling devastated. \u201cWhen I did finally break [the Appalachian Trail record], and it was official and it was verified \u2026\u201d Dower momentarily loses her words, before concluding, \u201cI was complete.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 15 November 2024. Tara Dower was running the trail southward, not northward, when she set the record.",

      "bodyText": "Thames Water has gained support from its top-ranking creditors to proceed to the next stage of securing a \u00a33bn emergency funding package intended to stave off its collapse for at least a year. The struggling utility company said on Wednesday that 75% of the holders of its least risky loans \u2013 known as class A debt \u2013 had backed a plan to extend the cash lifeline, the minimum threshold needed to receive court approval for changes to its debts. Thames faces the prospect of a temporary nationalisation if it ultimately collapses, and the emergency funding would help the company avoid a short-term cash crunch. The support will smooth the path for court hearings to decide whether to approve the deal to take place. Another group of creditors, who hold riskier class B debt, have offered a competing deal, but Thames Water has so far endorsed the class A offer. Thames said reaching the 75% threshold meant that it could push ahead with a first court date on 17 December. Thames Water provides water and sewage services to 16 million customers across London and the Thames Valley in south-east England. It has been on the verge of collapse for several months, labouring under its \u00a315bn debt pile. Securing the emergency cash would give Britain\u2019s biggest water company time to try to raise the billions of pounds of new equity investment it needs to return to a more stable footing. Thames Water said receiving the support was \u201can important milestone\u201d in securing the emergency cash. It also said that it appeared to have secured the support of enough creditors to access a \u00a3400m reserve account, in a parallel process. Even if Thames secures formal backing from its creditors to access more funding, there are several further hoops to jump through. It must go through a formal court process, and the backing of creditors ultimately depends on the outcome of its negotiations with the industry regulator for England and Wales, Ofwat. Thames has been in talks with the regulator, along with other water companies, over how much they can increase bills to consumers over the next five years. Ofwat is expected to give its final verdict on bill increases in December, and investors will compare it with the company\u2019s forecast costs in order to calculate whether to lend Thames extra funds or make equity investments in the water supplier. A spokesperson for the class A bondholders said: \u201cThis is a decisive vote of confidence in the first stage of our restructuring plan for Thames Water from a large group of its creditors, which include a significant number of long-term infrastructure investors. \u201cIt shows that there is a genuine will to develop a market-based solution which saves UK taxpayers from shouldering the costs of special administration. \u201cOur group is working intensively with the company and providing it with the resources and turnaround expertise it needs to ultimately attract strategic equity and rebuild so all parties can focus once again on delivering a better service for customers and the environment.\u201d Thames said it was working on getting other creditors \u2013 the class B bondholders \u2013 to join the class A deal. A spokesperson for the class B bondholders said: \u201cEven with Thames Water having apparently reached 75% support among its class A creditors for the class A proposal, this is only approval of one of the many classes that will have to ultimately vote on the plan. \u201cIn addition, this level of support is only the bare minimum required for the court to even consider granting its approval. The court will have to carefully consider matters such as fairness and alternatives when deciding whether to approve the non-consensual plan.\u201d The class A bondholder group includes the controversial US hedge funds Elliott Partners and Silver Point, as well as some well-known UK fund managers, representing \u00a312bn of Thames\u2019s debt.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has chosen the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as the next US ambassador to Israel and a Fox News host to be his new defense secretary.</p> <p>Huckabee has a track record of hardline, occasionally provocative, pro-Israel rhetoric and previously said Israel has a rightful claim to the West Bank, which he refers to by its Hebrew and biblical name of Judea and Samaria.</p> <p>The territory is claimed by Palestinians as part of a putative future state but is dotted with multiple Israeli settlements that are not recognised under international law. Huckabee has refused to call the settlements by that name, insisting that they be called \u201ccommunities\u201d or neighbourhoods. He has also denied that the West Bank, seized by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 six-day war, is under military occupation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://x.com/alaynatreene/status/1856411426132250769/photo/\">Posting</a> on his Truth Social network, Trump predicted Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, would \u201cwork tirelessly to bring about peace in the Middle East\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/12/canada-trump-migration-deportations\">Canadian minister says \u2018not everyone is welcome\u2019 amid Trump migrant threat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe loves Israel and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him,\u201d wrote Trump, who called Huckabee \u201ca great public servant.\u201d</p> <p>Later on Tuesday, Trump said he was nominating a Fox News host, the army veteran Pete Hegseth, to lead the world\u2019s largest and most powerful military, in an appointment that stunned the Pentagon and the broader defense world. Hegseth, a former army national guard captain who is well-known in conservative circles, has no experience in government and is untested on the global stage.</p> <p>Hegseth\u2019s appointment as defense secretary could bring sweeping changes to the military, as he has made it clear on his show and in interviews that, like Trump, he is stridently opposed to \u201cwoke\u201d programs that promote equity and inclusion. He has also questioned the role of women in combat and advocated pardoning service members charged with war crimes.<strong><br><br></strong>A staunch conservative who embraces Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, the 44-year-old Hegseth has pushed for making the military more lethal. During an interview on The Shawn Ryan Show podcast, he said allowing women to serve in combat damaged that effort.</p> <p>Also announced on Tuesday was Trump\u2019s pick of the former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Ratcliffe, a close ally of Trump, served as director of national intelligence at the end of his first term.</p> <p>Ratcliffe was confirmed as the country\u2019s top spy in May 2020, eight months before Trump left office. A former member of the House of Representatives and US attorney for Texas, he received no support from Senate Democrats during his confirmation.</p> <p>As director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe was accused by Democrats and former intelligence officials of declassifying intelligence for use by Trump and his Republican allies to attack political opponents, including Joe Biden, then Trump\u2019s rival for the presidency \u2013 a charge Ratcliffe\u2019s office has denied.</p> <p>Additionally, the president-elect had picked real estate investor and campaign donor Steve Witkoff to be his special envoy to the Middle East. Witkoff is a real estate investor, landlord, and founder of the Witkoff Group, which he started in 1977.</p> <p>Continuing his Tuesday evening appointments, Trump announced Governor Kristi Noem of South Dakota would head the homeland security department, a key role overseeing the nation\u2019s immigration system.</p> <p>Immigration enforcement has been a central focus of Trump\u2019s agenda, with commitments to tighten border control and implement a large-scale deportation initiative across the country.</p> <p>On social media, Trump described Noem as \u201cvery strong on border security\u201d, highlighting her decision as governor to deploy national guard troops to the Texas-Mexico border.</p>    <p>Huckabee\u2019s appointment is likely to signal a return to the explicitly pro-Israel posture of Trump\u2019s first administration, when he relocated the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in a move decried by Palestinians as damaging to peace prospects.</p> <p>While Israel claims Jerusalem as its indivisible capital, Palestinians lay claim to the eastern part of the city as their future capital.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/03/politics/huckabee-west-bank-settlements/index.html\">Speaking to CNN</a> in 2017, Huckabee \u2013 who has paid several visits to Israeli settlements \u2013 made his position clear.</p> <p>\u201cThe only people who have ever had Yerushalayim [Jerusalem\u2019s Hebrew name] as a capital have been the Jews,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody else has ever made this city a capital, ever.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has chosen the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as the next US ambassador to Israel and a Fox News host to be his new defense secretary. Huckabee has a track record of hardline, occasionally provocative, pro-Israel rhetoric and previously said Israel has a rightful claim to the West Bank, which he refers to by its Hebrew and biblical name of Judea and Samaria. The territory is claimed by Palestinians as part of a putative future state but is dotted with multiple Israeli settlements that are not recognised under international law. Huckabee has refused to call the settlements by that name, insisting that they be called \u201ccommunities\u201d or neighbourhoods. He has also denied that the West Bank, seized by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 six-day war, is under military occupation. Posting on his Truth Social network, Trump predicted Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, would \u201cwork tirelessly to bring about peace in the Middle East\u201d. \u201cHe loves Israel and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him,\u201d wrote Trump, who called Huckabee \u201ca great public servant.\u201d Later on Tuesday, Trump said he was nominating a Fox News host, the army veteran Pete Hegseth, to lead the world\u2019s largest and most powerful military, in an appointment that stunned the Pentagon and the broader defense world. Hegseth, a former army national guard captain who is well-known in conservative circles, has no experience in government and is untested on the global stage. Hegseth\u2019s appointment as defense secretary could bring sweeping changes to the military, as he has made it clear on his show and in interviews that, like Trump, he is stridently opposed to \u201cwoke\u201d programs that promote equity and inclusion. He has also questioned the role of women in combat and advocated pardoning service members charged with war crimes. A staunch conservative who embraces Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, the 44-year-old Hegseth has pushed for making the military more lethal. During an interview on The Shawn Ryan Show podcast, he said allowing women to serve in combat damaged that effort. Also announced on Tuesday was Trump\u2019s pick of the former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Ratcliffe, a close ally of Trump, served as director of national intelligence at the end of his first term. Ratcliffe was confirmed as the country\u2019s top spy in May 2020, eight months before Trump left office. A former member of the House of Representatives and US attorney for Texas, he received no support from Senate Democrats during his confirmation. As director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe was accused by Democrats and former intelligence officials of declassifying intelligence for use by Trump and his Republican allies to attack political opponents, including Joe Biden, then Trump\u2019s rival for the presidency \u2013 a charge Ratcliffe\u2019s office has denied. Additionally, the president-elect had picked real estate investor and campaign donor Steve Witkoff to be his special envoy to the Middle East. Witkoff is a real estate investor, landlord, and founder of the Witkoff Group, which he started in 1977. Continuing his Tuesday evening appointments, Trump announced Governor Kristi Noem of South Dakota would head the homeland security department, a key role overseeing the nation\u2019s immigration system. Immigration enforcement has been a central focus of Trump\u2019s agenda, with commitments to tighten border control and implement a large-scale deportation initiative across the country. On social media, Trump described Noem as \u201cvery strong on border security\u201d, highlighting her decision as governor to deploy national guard troops to the Texas-Mexico border. Huckabee\u2019s appointment is likely to signal a return to the explicitly pro-Israel posture of Trump\u2019s first administration, when he relocated the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in a move decried by Palestinians as damaging to peace prospects. While Israel claims Jerusalem as its indivisible capital, Palestinians lay claim to the eastern part of the city as their future capital. Speaking to CNN in 2017, Huckabee \u2013 who has paid several visits to Israeli settlements \u2013 made his position clear. \u201cThe only people who have ever had Yerushalayim [Jerusalem\u2019s Hebrew name] as a capital have been the Jews,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody else has ever made this city a capital, ever. So it shouldn\u2019t even be controversial.\u201d He was equally uncompromising on the issue of West Bank, declining to use the term. \u201cI think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain words I refuse to use. There is no such thing as a West Bank. It\u2019s Judea and Samaria. There\u2019s no such thing as a settlement. They\u2019re communities, they\u2019re neighbourhoods, they\u2019re cities. There\u2019s no such thing as an occupation.\u201d Huckabee\u2019s zealous support of Israel has occasionally offended Israelis and Jewish groups. He drew criticism in 2015 during an abortive presidential bid after accusing Barack Obama of marching Jews \u201cto the door of the oven\u201d by signing a nuclear deal with Iran. The comment drew a rebuke from Ron Dermer, Israeli ambassador to Washington at the time, and the Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy group dedicated to combating antisemitism. Nevertheless, Huckabee was unrepentant. \u201cThe response from Jewish people has been overwhelmingly positive,\u201d he said. Huckabee\u2019s daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the current Arkansas governor, served as White House press secretary in Trump\u2019s first presidency.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI am excited, everyone is excited, you have to be excited,\u201d the Sudan international Abdelrahman Kuku says and that\u2019s understandable. Sudan need a point against Niger on Thursday to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations \u2013 for the fourth time in 24 tournaments \u2013 and eliminate Ghana. That would be impressive enough given the circumstances but the Jediane Falcons are also soaring at the top of their World Cup qualification group after four games as they seek to qualify for the first time.</p> <p>The circumstances, though, are as dire as can be. The country of almost 50 million is being torn apart by a fierce civil war that broke out in April 2023 between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces militia. The UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said in October that millions are not able to escape from a \u201cnightmare of violence, hunger, disease and displacement\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe war drives the team on,\u201d Kuku says. \u201cIt is a big push for us, knowing that we are pretty much the only reason for people to be happy in Sudan.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI am excited, everyone is excited, you have to be excited,\u201d the Sudan international Abdelrahman Kuku says and that\u2019s understandable. Sudan need a point against Niger on Thursday to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations \u2013 for the fourth time in 24 tournaments \u2013 and eliminate Ghana. That would be impressive enough given the circumstances but the Jediane Falcons are also soaring at the top of their World Cup qualification group after four games as they seek to qualify for the first time. The circumstances, though, are as dire as can be. The country of almost 50 million is being torn apart by a fierce civil war that broke out in April 2023 between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces militia. The UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said in October that millions are not able to escape from a \u201cnightmare of violence, hunger, disease and displacement\u201d. \u201cThe war drives the team on,\u201d Kuku says. \u201cIt is a big push for us, knowing that we are pretty much the only reason for people to be happy in Sudan. When we play, that is all that happens in the country. The war stops for 90 minutes as everyone watches, there is no fighting.\u201d Unsurprisingly, there is no football being played in Sudan and all the players are based overseas, even those who belong to the league\u2019s two powerhouse clubs.

      "body": "<p>Before the start of the Uruguay Open, the organisers of the second-string ATP Challenger tournament <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DCFQ4jwS-Xj/\">had an announcement</a>. After flooding their social media pages with references to just one participant during the week, finally, a date was confirmed for<em> </em>the unmissable match and tickets were on sale: \u201cGet ready for an epic night that will remain in the memory of the Uruguay Open,\u201d they wrote.</p> <p>It is incredibly rare for any first round match on the humble challenger or future tours to generate enough attention to warrant the tournament organisers planning its exact date and time in advance. In doubles, which is usually banished to the outer courts in front of nobody at all, it is almost unheard of. But this is no normal occasion. On Wednesday at 10am local time, after weeks of publicity, interviews and hype, Diego Forl\u00e1n, the former footballer for Manchester United, Villarreal, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Inter, will make his professional tennis debut alongside Federico Coria of Argentina in Montevideo.</p> <p>Forl\u00e1n\u2019s first tennis appearance is the next step in a journey that began as a child. He grew up playing tennis and football, training at the Uruguay Open\u2019s tournament venue, Carrasco Lawn Tennis Club. When the time came to commit to one sport, Forl\u00e1n opted to pursue football, following the path set out before him by his father, Pablo, and maternal grandfather, Juan Carlos Corazzo, who both also competed for Uruguay internationally.</p>    <p>Since his retirement, Forl\u00e1n has dedicated himself to tennis again, now training four to five times a week under the tutelage of Enrique P\u00e9rez Cassarino, the former Uruguay Davis Cup captain. Although right-footed on the pitch, the 45-year-old is a left-hander on the court. Last year, he began to compete on the ITF Masters Tour, playing in five tournaments. He has enjoyed some success, particularly in the 45+ category, where he reached a final in August and rose to No 101 in the age-group rankings.</p> <p>This one-off appearance on the professional circuit is a result of the persistence of the Uruguayan tennis player Ignacio Carou. After repeatedly urging Forl\u00e1n to compete on the lower futures circuit, Carou decided to link Forl\u00e1n and Coria together. \u201c[Now] we are here, trying to see what it is gonna be,\u201d says Forl\u00e1n, smiling.</p> <p>The gap between the ATP Challenger tour, where many players are close to breaking through to compete each week at the highest level, and the amateur 45+ Masters Tour is enormous. While it may be a spectacle to see one of the footballing greats in action, it will be extremely difficult for Forl\u00e1n to hold his ground on the court.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m far away from those guys,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, everything is positive. Playing with professionals, just for one game, you never know, but I know it\u2019s difficult. I will enjoy.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be in my club with so many people, good weather. Having the opportunity to be, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the first, a professional football player and professional tennis player, just for one game, it\u2019s a privilege.\u201d</p>    <p>This event also reflects one of the unique facets of the sport: Open, as many tournaments are titled, truly means open. Anyone can enter a professional tournament if they are given a wildcard or if the entry cutoff is low enough, as long as they fill out the requisite forms and enter the anti-doping pool.</p> <p>This is, after all, the sport of Gail Falkenberg, a 77-year-old <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xboscvSG_vs\">who competed regularly in singles</a> on the ITF World Tennis Tour as recently as last year, won a match and faced Naomi Osaka and Taylor Townsend in professional matches. At the lower level of the sport, there are sometimes even <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maA8FQck-AM\">beginner or intermediate players</a> who invest significant time and resources in losing 6-0, 6-0 around the world.</p> <p>Forl\u00e1n may not fall into that category, but his cameo on the tour will be tough.

      "bodyText": "Before the start of the Uruguay Open, the organisers of the second-string ATP Challenger tournament had an announcement. After flooding their social media pages with references to just one participant during the week, finally, a date was confirmed for the unmissable match and tickets were on sale: \u201cGet ready for an epic night that will remain in the memory of the Uruguay Open,\u201d they wrote. It is incredibly rare for any first round match on the humble challenger or future tours to generate enough attention to warrant the tournament organisers planning its exact date and time in advance. In doubles, which is usually banished to the outer courts in front of nobody at all, it is almost unheard of. But this is no normal occasion. On Wednesday at 10am local time, after weeks of publicity, interviews and hype, Diego Forl\u00e1n, the former footballer for Manchester United, Villarreal, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Inter, will make his professional tennis debut alongside Federico Coria of Argentina in Montevideo. Forl\u00e1n\u2019s first tennis appearance is the next step in a journey that began as a child. He grew up playing tennis and football, training at the Uruguay Open\u2019s tournament venue, Carrasco Lawn Tennis Club. When the time came to commit to one sport, Forl\u00e1n opted to pursue football, following the path set out before him by his father, Pablo, and maternal grandfather, Juan Carlos Corazzo, who both also competed for Uruguay internationally. Since his retirement, Forl\u00e1n has dedicated himself to tennis again, now training four to five times a week under the tutelage of Enrique P\u00e9rez Cassarino, the former Uruguay Davis Cup captain. Although right-footed on the pitch, the 45-year-old is a left-hander on the court. Last year, he began to compete on the ITF Masters Tour, playing in five tournaments. He has enjoyed some success, particularly in the 45+ category, where he reached a final in August and rose to No 101 in the age-group rankings. This one-off appearance on the professional circuit is a result of the persistence of the Uruguayan tennis player Ignacio Carou. After repeatedly urging Forl\u00e1n to compete on the lower futures circuit, Carou decided to link Forl\u00e1n and Coria together. \u201c[Now] we are here, trying to see what it is gonna be,\u201d says Forl\u00e1n, smiling. The gap between the ATP Challenger tour, where many players are close to breaking through to compete each week at the highest level, and the amateur 45+ Masters Tour is enormous. While it may be a spectacle to see one of the footballing greats in action, it will be extremely difficult for Forl\u00e1n to hold his ground on the court. \u201cI\u2019m far away from those guys,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, everything is positive. Playing with professionals, just for one game, you never know, but I know it\u2019s difficult. I will enjoy. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be in my club with so many people, good weather. Having the opportunity to be, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the first, a professional football player and professional tennis player, just for one game, it\u2019s a privilege.\u201d This event also reflects one of the unique facets of the sport: Open, as many tournaments are titled, truly means open. Anyone can enter a professional tournament if they are given a wildcard or if the entry cutoff is low enough, as long as they fill out the requisite forms and enter the anti-doping pool. This is, after all, the sport of Gail Falkenberg, a 77-year-old who competed regularly in singles on the ITF World Tennis Tour as recently as last year, won a match and faced Naomi Osaka and Taylor Townsend in professional matches. At the lower level of the sport, there are sometimes even beginner or intermediate players who invest significant time and resources in losing 6-0, 6-0 around the world. Forl\u00e1n may not fall into that category, but his cameo on the tour will be tough. He will face the fourth seeds, Federico Zeballos and Boris Arias, who are doubles specialists ranked 109. Forl\u00e1n\u2019s incredible record and earnings as a footballer contrast sharply with his opponents\u2019 modest experiences as professional athletes. The Bolivian pair have made $35,919 (\u00a328,082) each in 2024 after 11 months of racking up expenses while travelling and competing around the world. This is serious for them. They are fighting an uphill battle to make a living and they should ruthlessly target the weaker link, Forl\u00e1n, in order to advance. Unlike Paolo Maldini, who originated the football legend to professional tennis pipeline by competing in a Milan ATP Challenger event in 2017 at 49 years old alongside his 46-year-old coach Stefano Landonio, losing 6-1, 6-1, Forl\u00e1n will at least have a strong player alongside him. Coria, the younger brother of the former No 3 Guillermo Coria, is 32 years old, ranked No 101 in singles and the third seed in the singles draw. Coria publishes a popular vlog that charts his life on tour. With a doubles ranking of 413 and a 2-9 record in doubles this year, this match will have no impact on his career aspirations, but the YouTube content will be spectacular.",

It looks like pure procrastination, it even feels like procrastination a lot of the time \u2013 but I am passionate in my defence that it isn\u2019t, quite. I\u2019m not the only one who thinks so.

Procrastination is less an art than an extreme sport. Some is genuinely productive, but too much will ruin your life.

But it\u2019s a technique that requires careful monitoring and recalibration. I once merrily described my process of built-in procrastination to my mum, who is self-employed too, so also has relatively free rein over how she organises her working life. She laughed ruefully. The technique, she said, eventually stops working so well. The longer you do a certain kind of work, the better you get at it, and the more you can kid yourself that you only really need three hours to do this thing, whereas a decade ago you might have given yourself four.

Personally, I need to be genuinely afraid that I do not have enough time left to complete my work to a high standard in order to really get down to it. If you\u2019ve learned that you can actually get your task done relatively easily in three hours, then the fear isn\u2019t going to kick in at T-minus three hours. It\u2019s going to kick in at T-minus two. In my experience, it is just not possible to manufacture the fear that acts like rocket fuel for my work ethic. I have tried saying I <em>must </em>have made X amount of progress by Y time or I will be angry with myself \u2013 but I don\u2019t fear my own opprobrium enough.

In some ways I wish the procrastination portion of my work process did not exist. Because it might work, broadly, but it often doesn\u2019t feel good. I frequently fall prey to the worst of both worlds: not properly working, but not resting and allowing thoughts to flourish either, just sort of pickling and worrying and frittering around.

What\u2019s the heaviest defeat to end an unbeaten run?\u201d</strong> asked Matthew Shore last week.</p> <p>We added the caveat of an unbeaten run of at least 15 games, and Chris Roe got busy crunching the numbers, for English football at least. \u201cThere have been 487 instances of unbeaten runs in league fixtures of at least 15 matches in length,\u201d he tells us. \u201cOf those, 290 were ended by a single-goal defeat, and 133 by a two-goal margin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe first Football League team to lose their unbeaten run in a defeat by three goals was <strong>Preston North End </strong>in 1891-92. After a run of 14 wins and one draw, they lost 4-1 to Sunderland on 12 March 1892. <strong>Grimsby Town</strong> eclipsed that in 1900-01, when their 17-game run was ended by a 5-0 defeat to New Brighton Tower.\u201d</p> <p>As Daniel Seppings also reported, there are three other teams to lose unbeaten runs with a five-goal defeat, and one is slightly more memorable than the others: <strong>Northampton Town </strong>(lost 5-0 to Newcastle, 1964-65), <strong>Swansea City </strong>(lost 5-0 to Luton, 1979-80) \u2026 and Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s <strong>Manchester United</strong>, who were thumped 5-0 at Chelsea in October 1999 to end a 29-game unbeaten league run.</p> <p>Jeremy Simmonds points out that in 1977-78, \u201c<strong>Everton</strong> lost their opening two matches then went unbeaten for 18 games, before conceding six <em>at home</em> to Manchester United on Boxing Day. They did, however, get on the scoresheet twice themselves.\u201d It finished 6-2 to United, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/apr/24/the-joy-of-six-everton-v-manchester-united\">as Scott Murray writes here</a>, the shattered Toffees went on to lose 3-1 at Leeds just 24 hours later.</p> <p>Finally, as both Chris and Daniel highlight, there is an English team with a 25-game unbeaten league run who suffered a 7-0 defeat. Step forward <strong>Nottingham Forest</strong>, whose run across two seasons from February to November 1995 was ended in ruthless fashion by the reigning Premier League champions, Blackburn Rovers.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Can you do any better? <a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\">Mail us</a> your questions or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theknowledge_gu\">@TheKnowledge_GU</a></strong></em></p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Heading south</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u201cWith seven London teams and three on the south coast, is this season the least \u2018northern\u2019 in English top-flight history?\u201d </strong>asks Tim P.</p> <p>\u201cThe short answer is yes, that is correct!!\u201d writes Daniel Seppings, stopping at a disappointing two exclamation marks. \u201cUsing Ordnance Survey coordinates for every ground ever used in an English top-flight match, I\u2019ve worked out the average number of miles north a match has been played.

What\u2019s the heaviest defeat to end an unbeaten run?\u201d asked Matthew Shore last week. We added the caveat of an unbeaten run of at least 15 games, and Chris Roe got busy crunching the numbers, for English football at least. \u201cThere have been 487 instances of unbeaten runs in league fixtures of at least 15 matches in length,\u201d he tells us. \u201cOf those, 290 were ended by a single-goal defeat, and 133 by a two-goal margin.\u201d \u201cThe first Football League team to lose their unbeaten run in a defeat by three goals was Preston North End in 1891-92. After a run of 14 wins and one draw, they lost 4-1 to Sunderland on 12 March 1892. Grimsby Town eclipsed that in 1900-01, when their 17-game run was ended by a 5-0 defeat to New Brighton Tower.\u201d As Daniel Seppings also reported, there are three other teams to lose unbeaten runs with a five-goal defeat, and one is slightly more memorable than the others: Northampton Town (lost 5-0 to Newcastle, 1964-65), Swansea City (lost 5-0 to Luton, 1979-80) \u2026 and Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s Manchester United, who were thumped 5-0 at Chelsea in October 1999 to end a 29-game unbeaten league run. Jeremy Simmonds points out that in 1977-78, \u201cEverton lost their opening two matches then went unbeaten for 18 games, before conceding six at home to Manchester United on Boxing Day. They did, however, get on the scoresheet twice themselves.\u201d It finished 6-2 to United, and as Scott Murray writes here, the shattered Toffees went on to lose 3-1 at Leeds just 24 hours later. Finally, as both Chris and Daniel highlight, there is an English team with a 25-game unbeaten league run who suffered a 7-0 defeat. Step forward Nottingham Forest, whose run across two seasons from February to November 1995 was ended in ruthless fashion by the reigning Premier League champions, Blackburn Rovers.

Two members fled, while another walked into a restaurant and detonated his suicide vest.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/20/bataclan-witnesses-recount-horror-paris-attacks\">attack and subsequent siege</a> lasted two and a half hours and ended with all three terrorists dead.

Everything about it was unprecedented: it would last nine months, with the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony alone taking five weeks. There were 1,800 of those plaintiffs, a legal brief comprising 542 volumes which, if stacked, would stand 53 metres high; 20 defendants, and nearly 400 magistrates and lawyers, all occupying a 650sq metre, \u20ac7m (\u00a35m) purpose-built courtroom at the Palais de Justice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It is hard to read these accounts of the terrible rhythm of death</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Carr\u00e8re\u2019s task was to show up, observe and file a&nbsp;weekly piece, and this book (translated from French by John Lambert) is the result. In 2009\u2019s <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/other-lives-but-mine-9781529111224/\">Other Lives But Mine</a>, he managed to make the workings of a&nbsp;provincial small claims court compelling. The challenge posed by a trial as inherently dramatic as V13 isn\u2019t how to render it interesting, but how to traverse its morass&nbsp;of detail and sometimes contradictory defence testimony. The skill with which he does so is extraordinary. In Carr\u00e8re\u2019s hands it becomes a lattice of absorbing storylines: will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/29/paris-attacker-salah-abdeslam-found-guilty-of-and-terrorism\">Salah Abdeslam</a>, the sole surviving attacker, break his silence and take the stand? Why did Mohamed Abrini resign his role in the slaughter during the death convoy\u2019s drive to Paris, then fail to blow himself up in an attack on Brussels airport four months later? What happened to Sonia, who tipped police off as to the location of Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the cell\u2019s leader, several days after the attack? Will the three defendants not currently in custody, who need to be resident in Paris for the duration (one of them rents an old woman\u2019s garden shed for \u20ac600 a month), be found guilty of criminal association with terrorists?</p> <p>The first part of Carr\u00e8re\u2019s book, however, is devoted to the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony, the majority of which comes from the Bataclan. It is hard to read these accounts of the terrible rhythm of death \u2013 \u201cA shout a shot, a sob a shot, a ringtone a shot\u201d \u2013 of people crawling through \u201chuman mud\u201d, or of one of the attackers showering the pit with \u201ca confetti of human flesh\u201d when he blows himself up on stage. Carr\u00e8re also relates the story of the 131st victim, a young man who killed himself two years after escaping the Bataclan. This ugly litany of violence makes for grim, queasy reading.</p> <p>There are startling moments of human kindness and generosity, though, and Carr\u00e8re is ever alive to striking details. The plaintiffs wear ribbons of green or red, which denote their willingness or otherwise to speak with journalists. Some, uncertain, wear both. When a plaintiff\u2019s testimony is particularly good, the sound of clicking keyboards suddenly rises from the press benches (\u201cSuch a casting-call attitude is terrible,\u201d Carr\u00e8re acknowledges, \u201cbut how to escape it?\u201d). Early in the proceedings, tipped off by a lawyer, the author slips into a small basement courtroom to briefly watch the trial of another terrorist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/carlos-the-jackal\">Carlos the Jackal</a>, who has lodged a final appeal against the sentence handed down for his grenade attack on a Paris pharmacy in 1974.</p> <p>As an account of what it was like to sit in the V13 courtroom, a \u201cunique experience of horror, pity, proximity and presence\u201d, Carr\u00e8re\u2019s book is absolutely&nbsp;gripping. But if there is an area in which it could, on its own terms, be said to fail, it is in the provision of answers. At one point, he reports \u201can astonishing sentence uttered by Abdeslam at the beginning of the trial and which, to my knowledge, went largely without comment: \u2018Everything you say about us jihadists is like reading the last page of a book. What you should do is read the book from the start.\u2019\u201d This statement persists in Carr\u00e8re\u2019s mind as an encapsulation of what he expects from the trial. But while the terrorists framed their actions as a response to French involvement in Iraq and its bombing of Syria, there is a difference between a political cause and the willingness to do what these young men did (or, in Abrini\u2019s case, didn\u2019t do).</p> <p>In the end justice is done, sentences are handed down, and at least some of the plaintiffs and the families of victims find closure. Yet despite Carr\u00e8re\u2019s attempt to imagine his way into the hash smoke-filled space of Les B\u00e9guines, the Molenbeek cafe where the attackers congregated to watch grisly IS videos of beheadings and burnings on Brahim Abdeslam\u2019s laptop (and, the defendants claim, videos of IS building schools in Raqqa), he cannot penetrate them, or the fatal decisions they made, to any real depth.</p> <p>The problem is perhaps one of form: a weekly magazine column isn\u2019t an ideal medium for deep insight, and even if these pieces have been edited, shaped and expanded for the book, this is still fundamentally a collection of reports (as betrayed by the frequent repetitions \u2013 necessary in a weekly format, irritating here). There is also the matter of the raw material. Carr\u00e8re may disagree with Manuel Valls, prime minister of France at the time of the attacks, who said that to try to understand the terrorists\u2019 actions was to justify them. But while he imagined their testimony would be captivating, it turns out instead to be a \u201cpoor mystery: an abysmal void wrapped in lies, which one regrets with stunned amazement having spent so much time thinking about at all\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 V13: Chronicle of a Trial by Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re, translated by John Lambert, is published by Vintage (\u00a320).

Why did Mohamed Abrini resign his role in the slaughter during the death convoy\u2019s drive to Paris, then fail to blow himself up in an attack on Brussels airport four months later? What happened to Sonia, who tipped police off as to the location of Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the cell\u2019s leader, several days after the attack? Will the three defendants not currently in custody, who need to be resident in Paris for the duration (one of them rents an old woman\u2019s garden shed for \u20ac600 a month), be found guilty of criminal association with terrorists? The first part of Carr\u00e8re\u2019s book, however, is devoted to the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony, the majority of which comes from the Bataclan. It is hard to read these accounts of the terrible rhythm of death \u2013 \u201cA shout a shot, a sob a shot, a ringtone a shot\u201d \u2013 of people crawling through \u201chuman mud\u201d, or of one of the attackers showering the pit with \u201ca confetti of human flesh\u201d when he blows himself up on stage. Carr\u00e8re also relates the story of the 131st victim, a young man who killed himself two years after escaping the Bataclan. This ugly litany of violence makes for grim, queasy reading. There are startling moments of human kindness and generosity, though, and Carr\u00e8re is ever alive to striking details. The plaintiffs wear ribbons of green or red, which denote their willingness or otherwise to speak with journalists. Some, uncertain, wear both. When a plaintiff\u2019s testimony is particularly good, the sound of clicking keyboards suddenly rises from the press benches (\u201cSuch a casting-call attitude is terrible,\u201d Carr\u00e8re acknowledges, \u201cbut how to escape it?\u201d). Early in the proceedings, tipped off by a lawyer, the author slips into a small basement courtroom to briefly watch the trial of another terrorist, Carlos the Jackal, who has lodged a final appeal against the sentence handed down for his grenade attack on a Paris pharmacy in 1974. As an account of what it was like to sit in the V13 courtroom, a \u201cunique experience of horror, pity, proximity and presence\u201d, Carr\u00e8re\u2019s book is absolutely gripping. But if there is an area in which it could, on its own terms, be said to fail, it is in the provision of answers. At one point, he reports \u201can astonishing sentence uttered by Abdeslam at the beginning of the trial and which, to my knowledge, went largely without comment: \u2018Everything you say about us jihadists is like reading the last page of a book. What you should do is read the book from the start.\u2019\u201d This statement persists in Carr\u00e8re\u2019s mind as an encapsulation of what he expects from the trial. But while the terrorists framed their actions as a response to French involvement in Iraq and its bombing of Syria, there is a difference between a political cause and the willingness to do what these young men did (or, in Abrini\u2019s case, didn\u2019t do). In the end justice is done, sentences are handed down, and at least some of the plaintiffs and the families of victims find closure. Yet despite Carr\u00e8re\u2019s attempt to imagine his way into the hash smoke-filled space of Les B\u00e9guines, the Molenbeek cafe where the attackers congregated to watch grisly IS videos of beheadings and burnings on Brahim Abdeslam\u2019s laptop (and, the defendants claim, videos of IS building schools in Raqqa), he cannot penetrate them, or the fatal decisions they made, to any real depth. The problem is perhaps one of form: a weekly magazine column isn\u2019t an ideal medium for deep insight, and even if these pieces have been edited, shaped and expanded for the book, this is still fundamentally a collection of reports (as betrayed by the frequent repetitions \u2013 necessary in a weekly format, irritating here). There is also the matter of the raw material. Carr\u00e8re may disagree with Manuel Valls, prime minister of France at the time of the attacks, who said that to try to understand the terrorists\u2019 actions was to justify them. But while he imagined their testimony would be captivating, it turns out instead to be a \u201cpoor mystery: an abysmal void wrapped in lies, which one regrets with stunned amazement having spent so much time thinking about at all\u201d. \u2022 V13: Chronicle of a Trial by Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re, translated by John Lambert, is published by Vintage (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "Passengers on Sydney trains will be able to access 24-hour transport from Thursday to Sunday, at the same time as they are being warned to expect delays due to industrial action on New South Wales\u2019 rail networks. Escalating industrial action between government and the Rail, Tram and Bus Union had looked to spill over with a shutdown of the rail network threatened from Thursday. But a late call to cede to the union\u2019s demand of trialling around-the-clock transport services this weekend has avoided that action as pay talks between the parties continue. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The transport minister, Jo Haylen, said there could be major delays but the current plan was for a normal timetable to run across Sydney on Thursday, Friday and Saturday and, in the evening, in particular between midnight and 4am when there wouldn\u2019t normally be trains operating, there will be a train every 30 minutes. \u201cWe want people to understand that there will be delays and cancellations, and they need to plan ahead,\u201d Haylen said. \u201cThey need to check their travel apps. They need to look at transport info to understand that, from Thursday, there will be impacts on our train network.\u201d Planned industrial action on light rail services, which will see limited services run on Friday and Saturday, are still set to continue. The union wants a 32% pay rise over four years and a 35-hour working week, and has accused the government of \u201cdragging its heels\u201d on an improved offer. But the RTBU NSW secretary, Toby Warnes, said commuters should not pay the price for that and would instead benefit from the \u201cnovel\u201d industrial action. \u201cOur protected industrial action is always about causing a headache for the government, so they actually listen to the needs of their workforce; it\u2019s never about disrupting the travelling public,\u201d he said. \u201cOur call for 24-hour transport has the benefit of being a pain for management and the government, while also resulting in improved services for commuters.\u201d Previous industrial action was avoided when the government agreed to a union demand to have 50c fares for a weekend. A separate piece of the union\u2019s industrial action will see them limit the distance train crews travel on a shift, which Haylen said would gradually wear down the system. \u201cThey\u2019re like a boa constrictor on our train network, they are strangling and making it harder and harder, and will eventually squeeze the life out of the network,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will make it harder and harder to run services, and therefore more difficult for people to get where they need to go.\u201d The industrial action is listed to continue every weekend but Sydney Trains said it was not feasible long term due to the impact on essential trackwork. Light rail network operator Transdev claimed the RTBU had not met with them this week as it attempted to avoid the industrial action. \u201cThis action has made demands about fares and hours of operations which we don\u2019t control,\u201d the Transdev managing director, Arsene Durand-Raucher, said. \u201cOur pay offer was recently voted down by the RTBU, which included an 18% wage increase over four years.\u201d The Business Sydney executive director, Paul Nicolaou, said the government should treat the 24-hour trains as a \u201cproper trial\u201d as it could boost the city\u2019s night-time economy.",

Tyson was said to be \u201cferocious\u201d as he backed his cornerman against the ropes.

When they had fought five years earlier, Tyson said he\u2019d tried to drive Ferguson\u2019s nose into his brain before knocking him out.</p> <p>That same <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/24/mike-tyson-interview-pain-escape-violent-past\">unhinged malevolence</a> in Tyson remained in 1991 and it was disconcerting to watch him rip left hooks into Ferguson\u2019s sagging midriff and long right crosses to the jaw with serious intent. The power of those punches sprayed the air with sweat and water as if Tyson had hit a small geyser hidden inside his sparring partner\u2019s skull. Feeling some of that sticky wetness on my face I retreated to a safe distance.</p> <p>Tyson seemed scary but his best years as a fighter were already behind him. The fighter I watched that afternoon was not a patch on the world champion who, in 1988, obliterated the previously outstanding Michael Spinks with a display of fury and skill that, for the 91 seconds it lasted, captured the magnetism of boxing.</p> <p>Thirty-six years on from that career high, Tyson was asked what he had learned about himself since he began training for Paul. The former Baddest Man on the Planet paused and then said: \u201cThat I\u2019m tougher than I believed I was because, when I agreed to this fight and started training, I thought: \u2018What the fuck was I thinking of?\u2019 But I\u2019ve finished the process. The fight is the party.

Again you can <a href=\"https://www.faracharity.org/fara-shop/find-a-shop/?postcode=&amp;amp;amp;speciality=13&amp;amp;amp;filter_shop_profiles=1\">find them listed online</a>.</p> <p>Secondhand sales events can also offer great savings \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nct.org.uk/local-activities-meet-ups/nct-nearly-new-sales\">NCT\u2019s nearly new sales</a> (free for everyone but NCT members get 15 minutes\u2019 early access) and <a href=\"https://www.mum2mummarket.co.uk/nearly-new-sales.html\">Mum2Mum Market</a> (\u00a32 entry an adult, children go free) take place regularly across the country.</p> <p>Online, secondhand sites such as Vinted, Depop and Facebook Marketplace have the biggest choice. Using AI technology, <a href=\"https://faircado.com/\">Faircado</a> will help you find the best deals across 50 platforms selling secondhand products.</p>    <p>Create a list of things you need and stick to it, says Evol\u00e9na de Wilde d\u2019Estmael, the chief executive and co-founder of Faircado. \u201cThis will help you avoid buying impulsively.\u201d If you can\u2019t find an item at that moment and don\u2019t need it immediately, you can set a digital alert in the app.</p> <p>D\u2019Estmael recommends cross-checking with retail prices to see what is a good deal and checking seller\u2019s reviews before buying.</p> <p>Ruby Blaken, the founder of the secondhand and ex-stock clothing business Second Snuggle, says: \u201cIf you want to ensure your items are checked for marks and described well, check out the Instagram account @theclubpreloved, which showcases a wonderful collection of independent businesses selling quality secondhand pieces.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Get swapping</strong></h2> <p>Check out sites such as Facebook or Nextdoor to find local in-person clothes swaps, or host one yourself either at home or at your child\u2019s nursery or school.</p> <p>\u201cInvite a group of parents and focus on quality over quantity by setting a limit,\u201d says Alexandra Birtles, the co-founder of In Good Company, a free app for finding ethical and sustainable businesses and experiences. \u201cFor example, ask people to bring between two and 10 items, all in good condition. This ensures that everyone walks away with valuable, wearable items of clothing.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Buy out of season</strong></h2> <p>One of the best ways to get good deals is buying items out of season, especially when it comes to big-ticket items. For instance, winter coats are often discounted in high street shops from about February or March with up to 50% off.</p> <p>This also applies to buying secondhand pieces. \u201cYou can often find great coats in the summer months when people don\u2019t want to store them,\u201d Blaken says. \u201cKeep a list on your phone of items you know you need to buy for the coming season.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Sell on clothes</strong></h2> <p>While it\u2019s good to be a little cautious about buying ahead when you are unsure on sizing or changing preferences of your child, the good news is that clothes in good condition, or unused, can easily be resold on secondhand platforms.</p> <p>Good photos and accurate descriptions are key to success here. \u201cMake sure to iron items, have a clear background and take the photo with plenty of light,\u201d Blaken says.</p> <p>Bundling smaller items such as babygrows or T-shirts is often a quicker and easier way to sell cheaper or smaller pieces. For clothes in less good condition, taking them to stores that offer payback recycling schemes is a good option. Some shops offer incentives for recycling old clothes and shoes, such as H&amp;M and John Lewis, which give a \u00a35 voucher, and Asda, which offers 10% off any upcoming clothing purchases.</p> <h2><strong>Extend clothes\u2019 life cycle</strong></h2> <p>Looking after clothes correctly is one of the easiest ways to maximise their longevity both while your child needs them and for selling on. \u201cPay attention to care labels to make sure you\u2019re washing correctly and store clothes properly, avoiding stuffing them in overcrowded drawers or cupboards,\u201d D\u2019Estmael says.</p>    <p>If there are stains or small holes, you can rescue the item and maybe even improve it in the process. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as scary as it sounds,\u201d says Blaken. \u201cI am not great at sewing but have managed to save many trousers by patching knees (there\u2019s lots of fun patches with sequins and patterns you can buy and sew on) or tie-dying plain items to cover up&nbsp;marks.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Try renting</strong></h2> <p>For babies and small children growing at a rapid rate, member\u00adship services such as <a href=\"https://thelittleloop.com/\">Thelittleloop</a> and <a href=\"https://bundlee.co.uk/\">Bundlee</a> are a way to save money on quality clothes. Loop\u2019s prices start at \u00a318 a month for about seven items and insurance, plus \u00a33.29 for each delivery, while Bundlee charges from \u00a313 a month for five items, including insurance and delivery.</p> <p>\u201cYou choose the clothes to rent, and when they outgrow the items, you simply send the clothes back for the next size up,\u201d Birtles says.</p> <p>If you need something for a one-off activity like fancy dress, a sporting activity or camping, ask around to see who may have something or check out the sharing app Olio or your local Library of Things (<a href=\"https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/home-garden/library-things-directory\">Ethical Consumer\u2019s online directory lists</a> nearly 100 across the UK). Some schools have lending banks for these types of items, too, and if yours doesn\u2019t, you could suggest setting one up.</p> <h2><strong>Make clothes work harder</strong></h2> <p>When chosen wisely, the clothes themselves can also help you save money. \u201cBuy unisex or neutral items so you can easily pass them down to your other children,\u201d Blaken says.</p> <p>Whether you are buying new or secondhand, choosing brands that produce high-quality, hard-wearing items is often better value in the long-run too. \u201cAsk other parents for recommendations who can speak from experience,\u201d D\u2019Estmael says.</p> <p>Or look for multipurpose items. \u201cYou can often save money by buying items like three-in-one coats that incorporate a raincoat, gilet and fleece,\u201d Blaken says. Some high street shops such as Marks &amp; Spencer make vests with popper fastenings and fold over cuffs that mean you can buy two sizes in one and save buying so frequently.</p> <h2><strong>Shop around for uniforms</strong></h2>    <p>Recently the Observer found that parents are routinely <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/education/article/2024/aug/31/branded-uk-school-uniforms-cost-double-high-street-prices-analysis-reveals\">paying more than double the price for branded school uniforms</a> than the cost of similar items offered by supermarkets and high street stores. While some schools mandate the wearing of some branded items, you can save money by buying as many non-branded items as possible. Aldi and Lidl\u2019s \u00a35 uniform bundles, which tend to include two polo shirts, one sweatshirt and a choice of trousers, skirt or shorts, offer excellent value \u2013 they go on sale at the beginning of&nbsp;July and normally sell out quickly. For shoes, <a href=\"https://www.clarksoutlet.co.uk/\">Clarks outlet stores</a>, online and across the country, offer between 30% and 70% off school shoes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shop secondhand Charity shops can be a goldmine for bargains \u2013 use the Charity Retail Association\u2019s online search page to find ones that stock children\u2019s clothes, or in London, head to one of FARA\u2019s 14 stores that specialise in kids\u2019 clothes. Again you can find them listed online. Secondhand sales events can also offer great savings \u2013 NCT\u2019s nearly new sales (free for everyone but NCT members get 15 minutes\u2019 early access) and Mum2Mum Market (\u00a32 entry an adult, children go free) take place regularly across the country. Online, secondhand sites such as Vinted, Depop and Facebook Marketplace have the biggest choice. Using AI technology, Faircado will help you find the best deals across 50 platforms selling secondhand products. Create a list of things you need and stick to it, says Evol\u00e9na de Wilde d\u2019Estmael, the chief executive and co-founder of Faircado. \u201cThis will help you avoid buying impulsively.\u201d If you can\u2019t find an item at that moment and don\u2019t need it immediately, you can set a digital alert in the app. D\u2019Estmael recommends cross-checking with retail prices to see what is a good deal and checking seller\u2019s reviews before buying. Ruby Blaken, the founder of the secondhand and ex-stock clothing business Second Snuggle, says: \u201cIf you want to ensure your items are checked for marks and described well, check out the Instagram account @theclubpreloved, which showcases a wonderful collection of independent businesses selling quality secondhand pieces.\u201d Get swapping Check out sites such as Facebook or Nextdoor to find local in-person clothes swaps, or host one yourself either at home or at your child\u2019s nursery or school. \u201cInvite a group of parents and focus on quality over quantity by setting a limit,\u201d says Alexandra Birtles, the co-founder of In Good Company, a free app for finding ethical and sustainable businesses and experiences. \u201cFor example, ask people to bring between two and 10 items, all in good condition. This ensures that everyone walks away with valuable, wearable items of clothing.\u201d Buy out of season One of the best ways to get good deals is buying items out of season, especially when it comes to big-ticket items. For instance, winter coats are often discounted in high street shops from about February or March with up to 50% off. This also applies to buying secondhand pieces. \u201cYou can often find great coats in the summer months when people don\u2019t want to store them,\u201d Blaken says. \u201cKeep a list on your phone of items you know you need to buy for the coming season.\u201d Sell on clothes While it\u2019s good to be a little cautious about buying ahead when you are unsure on sizing or changing preferences of your child, the good news is that clothes in good condition, or unused, can easily be resold on secondhand platforms. Good photos and accurate descriptions are key to success here. \u201cMake sure to iron items, have a clear background and take the photo with plenty of light,\u201d Blaken says. Bundling smaller items such as babygrows or T-shirts is often a quicker and easier way to sell cheaper or smaller pieces. For clothes in less good condition, taking them to stores that offer payback recycling schemes is a good option. Some shops offer incentives for recycling old clothes and shoes, such as H&amp;M and John Lewis, which give a \u00a35 voucher, and Asda, which offers 10% off any upcoming clothing purchases. Extend clothes\u2019 life cycle Looking after clothes correctly is one of the easiest ways to maximise their longevity both while your child needs them and for selling on. \u201cPay attention to care labels to make sure you\u2019re washing correctly and store clothes properly, avoiding stuffing them in overcrowded drawers or cupboards,\u201d D\u2019Estmael says. If there are stains or small holes, you can rescue the item and maybe even improve it in the process. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as scary as it sounds,\u201d says Blaken. \u201cI am not great at sewing but have managed to save many trousers by patching knees (there\u2019s lots of fun patches with sequins and patterns you can buy and sew on) or tie-dying plain items to cover up marks.\u201d Try renting For babies and small children growing at a rapid rate, membership services such as Thelittleloop and Bundlee are a way to save money on quality clothes. Loop\u2019s prices start at \u00a318 a month for about seven items and insurance, plus \u00a33.29 for each delivery, while Bundlee charges from \u00a313 a month for five items, including insurance and delivery. \u201cYou choose the clothes to rent, and when they outgrow the items, you simply send the clothes back for the next size up,\u201d Birtles says. If you need something for a one-off activity like fancy dress, a sporting activity or camping, ask around to see who may have something or check out the sharing app Olio or your local Library of Things (Ethical Consumer\u2019s online directory lists nearly 100 across the UK). Some schools have lending banks for these types of items, too, and if yours doesn\u2019t, you could suggest setting one up. Make clothes work harder When chosen wisely, the clothes themselves can also help you save money. \u201cBuy unisex or neutral items so you can easily pass them down to your other children,\u201d Blaken says. Whether you are buying new or secondhand, choosing brands that produce high-quality, hard-wearing items is often better value in the long-run too. \u201cAsk other parents for recommendations who can speak from experience,\u201d D\u2019Estmael says. Or look for multipurpose items. \u201cYou can often save money by buying items like three-in-one coats that incorporate a raincoat, gilet and fleece,\u201d Blaken says. Some high street shops such as Marks &amp; Spencer make vests with popper fastenings and fold over cuffs that mean you can buy two sizes in one and save buying so frequently. Shop around for uniforms Recently the Observer found that parents are routinely paying more than double the price for branded school uniforms than the cost of similar items offered by supermarkets and high street stores. While some schools mandate the wearing of some branded items, you can save money by buying as many non-branded items as possible. Aldi and Lidl\u2019s \u00a35 uniform bundles, which tend to include two polo shirts, one sweatshirt and a choice of trousers, skirt or shorts, offer excellent value \u2013 they go on sale at the beginning of July and normally sell out quickly. For shoes, Clarks outlet stores, online and across the country, offer between 30% and 70% off school shoes.",

      "body": "<h2>Wakefield</h2> <p>Actors say \u201crhubarb\u201d to appear to be chatting. It\u2019s easy to say the word quietly. Here in the national capital of this tasty perennial the stalks are \u2013 right now \u2013 growing, blushing, sweetening silently in the dark. The harvest season starts in mid-February, when shed doors are prised open and the gathering-in commences, by candlelight.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jan/27/seasonal-food-rhubarb\">technique of forcing</a> was discovered in 1817, when horticulturists observed pink shoots sprouted from winter roots covered with manure. They were tastier than the summer crop. The Whitcliffe family of Leeds started forcing commercially in 1877. The result: a perfect filler for pies and crumbles at a time of the year when dessert options are scarce. In the green days before we feasted on New Zealand apples and year-round passion fruit, special trains freighted West Riding rhubarb <a href=\"https://alsilson.wordpress.com/rhubarb-introduction/\">to be sold at Covent Garden</a>. The region once produced 90% of the world\u2019s forced rhubarb. Today\u2019s \u201crhubarb triangle\u201d covers nine square miles between Morley, Rothwell and Wakefield \u2013 which sits in a \u201cfrost pocket\u201d, perfect for nurturing the plant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The area surrounding the Hepworth is being smartened up. Across the other side of town, the high wall of HMP Wakefield exerts its own force field</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Away from lurid pink loveliness, things are harder and darker. Wakefield is a prison town \u2013 Cat A; a rugby league town, Super League; a former mining town (cheap coal heated the rhubarb sheds). It is familiar to many thanks to David Storey\u2019s 1960 novel This Sporting Life.

Here in the national capital of this tasty perennial the stalks are \u2013 right now \u2013 growing, blushing, sweetening silently in the dark. The harvest season starts in mid-February, when shed doors are prised open and the gathering-in commences, by candlelight. The technique of forcing was discovered in 1817, when horticulturists observed pink shoots sprouted from winter roots covered with manure. They were tastier than the summer crop. The Whitcliffe family of Leeds started forcing commercially in 1877. The result: a perfect filler for pies and crumbles at a time of the year when dessert options are scarce. In the green days before we feasted on New Zealand apples and year-round passion fruit, special trains freighted West Riding rhubarb to be sold at Covent Garden. The region once produced 90% of the world\u2019s forced rhubarb. Today\u2019s \u201crhubarb triangle\u201d covers nine square miles between Morley, Rothwell and Wakefield \u2013 which sits in a \u201cfrost pocket\u201d, perfect for nurturing the plant. Away from lurid pink loveliness, things are harder and darker. Wakefield is a prison town \u2013 Cat A; a rugby league town, Super League; a former mining town (cheap coal heated the rhubarb sheds). It is familiar to many thanks to David Storey\u2019s 1960 novel This Sporting Life.

      "body": "<p>When I got engaged in 2002, I was 33. Somehow, after growing up on a self-sufficient farm in the 1970s, I had bolted to London at 17 and ended up in the fast lane as a freelance journalist, writing about sex, parties and cars. My 20s were full of stop-start love affairs and crazy jobs. I was unsure of who I was, scared, fun-seeking, defensively cynical and desperate to write, and I suspect I wasn\u2019t entirely lovable or reliable. But after meeting my fiance I thought I was on the home straight to a wedding and kids.</p> <p>About a year into our engagement, I pitched an idea to a women\u2019s magazine. What if I hosted a dinner party for 12 single people to \u201csee what happens\u201d? The magazine agreed, saying they\u2019d confirm the details later in the summer.</p> <p>My fiance was now living in Jerusalem, reporting on Middle East affairs. For months I had been flying out to see him, but things were getting tricky. Much as we loved each other, it seemed we argued more than we had fun: a terrible equation for a future marriage. At Easter I flew out to try to save our relationship, but we had to face facts. I was devastated by our split, crying for days until my flight home.</p> <p>My brother and best friend collected me at Heathrow to try to cheer me up. Frightened for my lonely and potentially childless future, I wailed that at 34 my time was running out. \u201cI\u2019ve got to start all over again, on the singles bandwagon.\u201d My brother corrected me. \u201cDon\u2019t get on that wagon,\u201d he said. \u201cForget about love. Concentrate on work. Do something different.\u201d So I did. I worked hard, got fit, joined a burlesque troupe and forgot about love.</p> <p>Around this time I was commissioned for an article that meant dealing with various publishers. One particular publicist went out of his way to help. Colin put me in touch with some of Britain\u2019s best writers, and reminded me we\u2019d once met at a book festival a few years before. I dimly remembered talking to him, but a lot had happened since.</p>    <p>We started emailing about other stuff. He revealed he\u2019d recently come to the end of a relationship. I told him about my failed engagement. And I found myself telling him strange secrets. I explained, for instance, how my mum and I often spoke to each other in the voice of a fictional, overly saccharine West Country author called Lamorna, who wrote books such as A Swansong at Sunset and Where My Pig Goes So Go I. Lamorna made Colin laugh a lot.</p> <p>In August, my editor confirmed they needed the dinner-party piece, so I contacted a variety of single people who might fancy it. The deal was that they\u2019d have makeup and photographs done, then food and champagne, and we could let our hair down once the photographer left. I\u2019d interview them the following week to see how everyone got on: snogs etc? Friends and strangers agreed, including Colin, whom I had yet to meet.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t have enough chairs, plates or cutlery for 12 people. Also, not only was I a rotten cook, but I was now one of the 12 singles. I\u2019d had to fill the last place myself. I ran around town, borrowing what I needed, terrified about cooking. But when the first guests arrived at 6pm, everything was ready. After seeing the makeup artist, and having their photographs taken, guests began gulping down champagne. Soon, it was my turn.</p> <p>I was having bronzer applied when a man walked into the room in a well-tailored three-piece vintage suit and open-neck shirt. His sideburns were good. He was carrying a bottle of champagne, a handful of loose flowers and had gorgeous blue eyes. Everything stopped, the world falling away while something peaceful fluttered into the room.</p> <p>I know that sounds like something Lamorna might have written, but that\u2019s exactly how it felt. His presence was beautiful to me. Peace is the operative word. There wasn\u2019t that sense of danger that usually attracted me to someone. It was a door opening to a happier, saner, more loving world.</p> <p>Everything sped up again. The evening kicked off and I rushed around. When the photographer left I announced we could now relax and have fun. Colin looked at me, gesturing to the seat beside him. He was so easy to be with, and hilarious. We talked and laughed all night.</p> <p>The irony, of course, was that no one at the singles party got together except us. In the article I wrote some cheesy line about how \u201cI felt like I was a winner because I met Colin\u201d, but that still holds true 21 years later. We can still talk and laugh all night and I\u2019m forever grateful we met.</p> <p>The volatility of my other relationships, followed by that summer on my own, all led to meeting him. Somehow I had finally learned \u2013 and was ready \u2013 to recognise the peaceful presence of someone who saw as much good in me as I saw in them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When I got engaged in 2002, I was 33. Somehow, after growing up on a self-sufficient farm in the 1970s, I had bolted to London at 17 and ended up in the fast lane as a freelance journalist, writing about sex, parties and cars. My 20s were full of stop-start love affairs and crazy jobs. I was unsure of who I was, scared, fun-seeking, defensively cynical and desperate to write, and I suspect I wasn\u2019t entirely lovable or reliable. But after meeting my fiance I thought I was on the home straight to a wedding and kids. About a year into our engagement, I pitched an idea to a women\u2019s magazine. What if I hosted a dinner party for 12 single people to \u201csee what happens\u201d? The magazine agreed, saying they\u2019d confirm the details later in the summer. My fiance was now living in Jerusalem, reporting on Middle East affairs. For months I had been flying out to see him, but things were getting tricky. Much as we loved each other, it seemed we argued more than we had fun: a terrible equation for a future marriage. At Easter I flew out to try to save our relationship, but we had to face facts. I was devastated by our split, crying for days until my flight home. My brother and best friend collected me at Heathrow to try to cheer me up. Frightened for my lonely and potentially childless future, I wailed that at 34 my time was running out. \u201cI\u2019ve got to start all over again, on the singles bandwagon.\u201d My brother corrected me. \u201cDon\u2019t get on that wagon,\u201d he said. \u201cForget about love. Concentrate on work. Do something different.\u201d So I did. I worked hard, got fit, joined a burlesque troupe and forgot about love. Around this time I was commissioned for an article that meant dealing with various publishers. One particular publicist went out of his way to help. Colin put me in touch with some of Britain\u2019s best writers, and reminded me we\u2019d once met at a book festival a few years before. I dimly remembered talking to him, but a lot had happened since. We started emailing about other stuff. He revealed he\u2019d recently come to the end of a relationship. I told him about my failed engagement. And I found myself telling him strange secrets. I explained, for instance, how my mum and I often spoke to each other in the voice of a fictional, overly saccharine West Country author called Lamorna, who wrote books such as A Swansong at Sunset and Where My Pig Goes So Go I. Lamorna made Colin laugh a lot. In August, my editor confirmed they needed the dinner-party piece, so I contacted a variety of single people who might fancy it. The deal was that they\u2019d have makeup and photographs done, then food and champagne, and we could let our hair down once the photographer left. I\u2019d interview them the following week to see how everyone got on: snogs etc? Friends and strangers agreed, including Colin, whom I had yet to meet. I didn\u2019t have enough chairs, plates or cutlery for 12 people. Also, not only was I a rotten cook, but I was now one of the 12 singles. I\u2019d had to fill the last place myself. I ran around town, borrowing what I needed, terrified about cooking. But when the first guests arrived at 6pm, everything was ready. After seeing the makeup artist, and having their photographs taken, guests began gulping down champagne. Soon, it was my turn. I was having bronzer applied when a man walked into the room in a well-tailored three-piece vintage suit and open-neck shirt. His sideburns were good. He was carrying a bottle of champagne, a handful of loose flowers and had gorgeous blue eyes. Everything stopped, the world falling away while something peaceful fluttered into the room. I know that sounds like something Lamorna might have written, but that\u2019s exactly how it felt. His presence was beautiful to me. Peace is the operative word. There wasn\u2019t that sense of danger that usually attracted me to someone. It was a door opening to a happier, saner, more loving world. Everything sped up again. The evening kicked off and I rushed around. When the photographer left I announced we could now relax and have fun. Colin looked at me, gesturing to the seat beside him. He was so easy to be with, and hilarious. We talked and laughed all night. The irony, of course, was that no one at the singles party got together except us. In the article I wrote some cheesy line about how \u201cI felt like I was a winner because I met Colin\u201d, but that still holds true 21 years later. We can still talk and laugh all night and I\u2019m forever grateful we met. The volatility of my other relationships, followed by that summer on my own, all led to meeting him. Somehow I had finally learned \u2013 and was ready \u2013 to recognise the peaceful presence of someone who saw as much good in me as I saw in them.",

      "body": "<p>Good morning. Last week, when violence erupted around a Europa League fixture in Amsterdam between Ajax and Israel\u2019s Maccabi Tel Aviv, a fairly ordinary football match became the locus for something much larger, and much darker.</p> <p>The story was initially characterised as an unprovoked and antisemitic attack on Israeli fans just trying to enjoy a football match in Europe; even Joe Biden called it \u201cdespicable\u201d and said it \u201cechoed dark moments in history when Jews are persecuted\u201d. And there is no doubt that an appalling strand of antisemitism ran through much of the violence that unfolded in Amsterdam, from fans ordered to show their passports to check if they were Israeli to beatings being handed out while the assailants shouted: \u201cJewish, Jewish, IDF, IDF.\u201d</p> <p>But the chronology of the story that emerged, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/11/what-happened-amsterdam-israeli-football-fans\">usefully set out here</a>, suggests another strand to the clashes: violence and anti-Palestinian racism from Maccabi fans in the buildup to the game, and images of marauding hooligans that reflect a much wider phenomenon attached to football in Europe and Israel alike.</p> <p>From the beginning, this story has been deeply politicised. But to make sense of what happened, it helps to understand something about contemporary football hooliganism, and how it intersects with wider societal currents. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to James Montague, author of <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/438255/1312-among-the-ultras-by-james-montague/9781785039188\">1312: Among the Ultras \u2013 A Journey with the World\u2019s Most Extreme Fans</a>, about what happened in Amsterdam \u2013 and whether it should even be classified as football violence. Here are the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Church of England</strong></em> | <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/12/justin-welby-step-down-archbishop-canterbury\">The archbishop of Canterbury is to step down</a> amid intense pressure over his handling of one of the church\u2019s worst abuse scandals.

The judges praised Harvey\u2019s tale of six astronauts on the International Space Station for its \u201cextraordinary intensity of attention to the precious and precarious world we share\u201d.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: \u2018Most hooligans are ultras, but many ultras are not hooligans\u2019</h2>    <p>The trouble in Amsterdam began the day before the match, police said, when some of the 3,000 visiting Maccabi supporters were involved in minor altercations in the city centre. Some Maccabi fans burned a Palestinian flag and pulled another down from a nearby building. A Muslim taxi driver\u2019s car was attacked, and there were chants of \u201clet the IDF win, we will fuck the Arabs\u201d. Amid growing anger in Amsterdam\u2019s large Muslim community, taxi drivers arrived outside a casino where about 400 Maccabi fans were gathered, and police had to intervene to break up fights.</p> <p>On the day of the game, Maccabi fans chanted \u201cFuck you Palestine\u201d and according to city officials shouted, \u201cWhy is there no school in Gaza? There are no children left there\u201d. Meanwhile, a pro-Palestinian demonstration calling for the match to be abandoned was moved away from the stadium, with the support of the \u201cF-side\u201d, Ajax\u2019s hardcore fan contingent.</p> <p>The match passed without major incident. But in the city centre around midnight, groups of attackers on scooters went looking for Maccabi fans returning to their hotels in what the mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, described as \u201cantisemitic hit-and-run assaults\u201d, which appear to have drawn no distinction between hooligans and ordinary fans. Dozens were chased or assaulted, and five were hospitalised; in a chat group co-ordinating the attack, one participant referred to a \u201cJew hunt\u201d. Meanwhile, footage showed some Maccabi fans taking iron pipes and planks from a building site and running through the streets swinging belts.</p> <p>Halsema said the events \u201cbrings back memories of pogroms\u201d and were \u201can outburst of antisemitism that I hope to never see again\u201d. The Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders blamed \u201cmulticultural scum\u201d and \u201ccriminal Muslims\u201d for the unrest. Another local politician, Sheher Khan, said that some Maccabi fans\u2019 inflammatory behaviour was \u201cnot an excuse for violence, but it is an explanation for it\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Was this football violence?</strong></p> <p>Clearly, a football match was the event around which the violence unfolded \u2013 and a group within Maccabi\u2019s contingent of ultras, the \u201cFanatics\u201d, were involved.</p> <p>But, James Montague said, \u201cI don\u2019t see this as football violence at all. There is no sense that what happened here was the \u2018Fanatics\u2019 and the \u2018F-side\u2019 deciding to meet up and have a fight: what you have instead is some of the Maccabi fans behaving in a provocative way, and then people in the city responding to that.\u201d</p> <p>Some of that response \u201cclearly had an antisemitic element\u201d, he added. \u201cI don\u2019t see how passport checks on people could be viewed in any other way. But it is also true that it\u2019s often the case that travelling hooligans will go to a city and say or do provocative things, and then you will see things escalate. I\u2019ve seen that in the Balkans and all over Europe. That is distinct from straightforward violence between hooligans.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Who are the Maccabi \u2018Fanatics\u2019?</strong></p> <p>The taxonomy of hooliganism is complicated, and distinctions between those who are primarily motivated by violence and those who are hardcore supporters of their clubs are often amorphous. But Montague draws a broad distinction between \u201cultras\u201d and the subset who are hooligans.</p> <p>\u201cUltras are the organised support,\u201d he said. \u201cThey arrange the show: the pyrotechnics, the tifos [giant signs and banners displayed in a stadium], the corteo [procession of fans], the choreography.\u201d That group includes many who are peaceful. \u201cThe hooligans are different. They are all about the violence: the hooligans are the muscle of the ultras.\u201d In other words: almost all hooligans are ultras; but many ultras are not hooligans.</p> <p>Within Israeli club fanbases, Montague said, \u201cthere are a wide range of political affiliations. You have a very highly developed, very political culture. There are traditionally leftwing teams, like Hapoel Tel Aviv, which have their roots in the union movement and fly a Che Guevara flag. And then you have Beitar Jerusalem, who arguably have the most racist fan group in the world.\u201d (Montague wrote about all this <a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/life-and-culture/football-in-israel-the-not-so-beautiful-game-lxuk5wz8\">for the Jewish Chronicle</a> in 2008.)</p> <p>Traditionally, he added, Maccabi fall somewhere in the middle. \u201cBut you have to understand that as the politics of Israel changes, so do the politics of the ultras. They are organised young men, many of whom have been in the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] because of conscription, and what they say and chant tracks where the country is.\u201d</p> <p>As a result, he said, there is a much stronger ultra-nationalist element within the Maccabi fanbase today. \u201cThat isn\u2019t something about the club, per se. It\u2019s something about how Israel is changing.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What about Ajax and hooliganism in the Netherlands?</strong></p> <p>There is no evidence as yet that Ajax fans were involved in the violence in a coordinated way \u2013 and that makes sense, Montague said. \u201cAjax has long had a connection to the Jewish community. You can go outside the Cruyff arena [Ajax\u2019s home stadium] and buy stickers with the Star of David on them.\u201d</p> <p>That is not to say that there is no hooliganism among Ajax fans \u2013 and more generally, the Netherlands has seen \u201ca kind of moral panic about ultras recently\u201d, Montague said. Last year, a match between Ajax and Feyenoord <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/24/flares-thrown-on-pitch-by-ajax-fans-force-feyenoord-clash-to-be-called-off\">was called off</a> because Ajax fans threw flares and fireworks; a repeat encounter in August was called off because of a police strike. A number of other matches have also been called off. \u201cThere have been questions about whether they need to look to a British policing model, and the Dutch authorities are very much on alert.\u201d</p> <p>Ultras in the Netherlands are subject to wider political forces that can be compared to those in play in Israel, with a concerted shift to the right in recent years and growing anti-immigrant sentiment. \u201cWhat you see, when you look at social media or Telegram, is that Ajax\u2019s \u2018enemies\u2019 like Feyenoord are attacking them by saying, you\u2019ve let this happen in your city,\u201d Montague said. \u201cThey use racist and anti-Islamic language about ethnic minority groups in the Netherlands, and they blame the \u2018F-side\u2019 for allowing it.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What does this story reveal about how football fits into wider political tensions?</strong></p> <p>There are still some progressive ultra groups, Montague said, particularly in Germany, \u201cbut the whole scene is moving. Across Europe, and the further east you go, the range is from right to extreme right.\u201d</p> <p>One of the curious accompaniments to that phenomenon is that the violence is becoming decoupled from the football \u2013 in a very different way from what unfolded in Amsterdam. \u201cFootball itself is becoming much less violent,\u201d Montague said. \u201cThese groups are being hived off and turning into fighting groups, who show up for carefully organised, almost MMA-style, fights, in secret, far away from the football, and not on the same day.\u201d</p> <p>But even if that is a broader trend, there is clearly a risk of similar violence at other matches involving Israeli teams in the future \u2013 a cocktail of extremist provocation and antisemitic response. \u201cAnyone who is paying attention should have known that a game like this would be a risk,\u201d Montague said. \u201cBut there are questions over how Uefa handles it. I live in Istanbul, and Maccabi were due to play [local side] Besiktas here later this month. That was obviously a problem, but Uefa seemed to be OK with it until the Turkish government said that they couldn\u2019t guarantee the visiting fans\u2019 safety.\u201d Now <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/maccabi-haifa-europa-league-besiktas-uefa-61972822dcd3814502aee2c5ca6be5a8\">the game has been moved to Hungary</a>, where it will be played behind closed doors.</p> <p>Tomorrow night, the Israeli national team will play France in Paris. \u201cThat could be a flashpoint, but the policing has been hugely increased \u2013 so I suspect it will pass without incident,\u201d Montague said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t seem likely that this is over. It is going to be something that follows Israeli teams when they play in Europe for a long time.\u201d</p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>As <strong>the assisted dying bill</strong> makes its way through parliament, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/12/denied-being-with-her-in-last-moments-campaigners-on-assisted-dying-bill\">Harriet Sherwood spoke with</a> campaigners and supporters of the law change about why the issue is so important to them. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/12/donald-trump-trumpism-danger-president-elect\">this lucid, wide-ranging piece</a>, Randeep Ramesh argues that <strong>Donald Trump\u2019s</strong> victory doesn\u2019t signal a realignment in American politics yet \u2013 but if the Democrats reject a bolder economic platform, it easily could do before the end of his term. <em><strong>Archie</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Israel\u2019s bombardment of <strong>Lebanon</strong> has ravaged agricultural areas, destroying fields and crops and leaving farmers struggling and destitute. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/nov/12/cattle-crops-and-ancient-olive-groves-lebanons-farmers-lose-everything-to-israeli-bombs\">Jenny Gustafsson reports</a> from Hammana. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>In the first of a series about the consequences of long <strong>ambulance waiting times</strong>, Sam Wollaston <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/13/nine-hours-52-minutes-did-dave-strachan-ambulance-wait-cost-him-his-life\">tells the enraging story of Dave Strachan</a>, who died after a delay of nearly 10 hours. <em><strong>Archie</strong></em></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/12/will-elon-musk-fire-a-third-of-the-us-government\">In this week\u2019s TechScape</a>, Blake Montgomery explores <strong>Elon Musk</strong>\u2019s growing influence on US politics, with Donald Trump reportedly considering him as a potential \u201csecretary of cost-cutting\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Last week, when violence erupted around a Europa League fixture in Amsterdam between Ajax and Israel\u2019s Maccabi Tel Aviv, a fairly ordinary football match became the locus for something much larger, and much darker. The story was initially characterised as an unprovoked and antisemitic attack on Israeli fans just trying to enjoy a football match in Europe; even Joe Biden called it \u201cdespicable\u201d and said it \u201cechoed dark moments in history when Jews are persecuted\u201d. And there is no doubt that an appalling strand of antisemitism ran through much of the violence that unfolded in Amsterdam, from fans ordered to show their passports to check if they were Israeli to beatings being handed out while the assailants shouted: \u201cJewish, Jewish, IDF, IDF.\u201d But the chronology of the story that emerged, usefully set out here, suggests another strand to the clashes: violence and anti-Palestinian racism from Maccabi fans in the buildup to the game, and images of marauding hooligans that reflect a much wider phenomenon attached to football in Europe and Israel alike. From the beginning, this story has been deeply politicised. But to make sense of what happened, it helps to understand something about contemporary football hooliganism, and how it intersects with wider societal currents. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to James Montague, author of 1312: Among the Ultras \u2013 A Journey with the World\u2019s Most Extreme Fans, about what happened in Amsterdam \u2013 and whether it should even be classified as football violence. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Church of England | The archbishop of Canterbury is to step down amid intense pressure over his handling of one of the church\u2019s worst abuse scandals. Justin Welby had been under scrutiny since the publication last week of a damning report on the church\u2019s cover-up of decades of abuse by John Smyth. US politics | Elon Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, Donald Trump said on Tuesday. Experts say cuts on the scale promised by Musk, of $2tn, could result in deregulation and policy changes that would directly impact the companies he owns. Environment | New data released at Cop29 indicates that there is \u201cno sign\u201d of a transition away from fossil fuels promised at last year\u2019s climate conference, with emissions from coal, oil and gas on track to rise by 0.8% in 2024. In stark contrast, emissions have to fall by 43% by 2030 for the world to have any chance of keeping to the 1.5C temperature target. Labour | Keir Starmer\u2019s former chief of staff Sue Gray has decided not to take up the post of nation and regions envoy after it became clear the prime minister was planning to withdraw his offer, the Guardian understands. Literature | Orbital by Samantha Harvey, the only shortlisted British writer, has won the 2024 Booker prize. The judges praised Harvey\u2019s tale of six astronauts on the International Space Station for its \u201cextraordinary intensity of attention to the precious and precarious world we share\u201d. In depth: \u2018Most hooligans are ultras, but many ultras are not hooligans\u2019 The trouble in Amsterdam began the day before the match, police said, when some of the 3,000 visiting Maccabi supporters were involved in minor altercations in the city centre. Some Maccabi fans burned a Palestinian flag and pulled another down from a nearby building. A Muslim taxi driver\u2019s car was attacked, and there were chants of \u201clet the IDF win, we will fuck the Arabs\u201d. Amid growing anger in Amsterdam\u2019s large Muslim community, taxi drivers arrived outside a casino where about 400 Maccabi fans were gathered, and police had to intervene to break up fights. On the day of the game, Maccabi fans chanted \u201cFuck you Palestine\u201d and according to city officials shouted, \u201cWhy is there no school in Gaza? There are no children left there\u201d. Meanwhile, a pro-Palestinian demonstration calling for the match to be abandoned was moved away from the stadium, with the support of the \u201cF-side\u201d, Ajax\u2019s hardcore fan contingent. The match passed without major incident. But in the city centre around midnight, groups of attackers on scooters went looking for Maccabi fans returning to their hotels in what the mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, described as \u201cantisemitic hit-and-run assaults\u201d, which appear to have drawn no distinction between hooligans and ordinary fans. Dozens were chased or assaulted, and five were hospitalised; in a chat group co-ordinating the attack, one participant referred to a \u201cJew hunt\u201d. Meanwhile, footage showed some Maccabi fans taking iron pipes and planks from a building site and running through the streets swinging belts. Halsema said the events \u201cbrings back memories of pogroms\u201d and were \u201can outburst of antisemitism that I hope to never see again\u201d. The Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders blamed \u201cmulticultural scum\u201d and \u201ccriminal Muslims\u201d for the unrest. Another local politician, Sheher Khan, said that some Maccabi fans\u2019 inflammatory behaviour was \u201cnot an excuse for violence, but it is an explanation for it\u201d. *** Was this football violence? Clearly, a football match was the event around which the violence unfolded \u2013 and a group within Maccabi\u2019s contingent of ultras, the \u201cFanatics\u201d, were involved. But, James Montague said, \u201cI don\u2019t see this as football violence at all. There is no sense that what happened here was the \u2018Fanatics\u2019 and the \u2018F-side\u2019 deciding to meet up and have a fight: what you have instead is some of the Maccabi fans behaving in a provocative way, and then people in the city responding to that.\u201d Some of that response \u201cclearly had an antisemitic element\u201d, he added. \u201cI don\u2019t see how passport checks on people could be viewed in any other way. But it is also true that it\u2019s often the case that travelling hooligans will go to a city and say or do provocative things, and then you will see things escalate. I\u2019ve seen that in the Balkans and all over Europe. That is distinct from straightforward violence between hooligans.\u201d *** Who are the Maccabi \u2018Fanatics\u2019? The taxonomy of hooliganism is complicated, and distinctions between those who are primarily motivated by violence and those who are hardcore supporters of their clubs are often amorphous. But Montague draws a broad distinction between \u201cultras\u201d and the subset who are hooligans. \u201cUltras are the organised support,\u201d he said. \u201cThey arrange the show: the pyrotechnics, the tifos [giant signs and banners displayed in a stadium], the corteo [procession of fans], the choreography.\u201d That group includes many who are peaceful. \u201cThe hooligans are different. They are all about the violence: the hooligans are the muscle of the ultras.\u201d In other words: almost all hooligans are ultras; but many ultras are not hooligans. Within Israeli club fanbases, Montague said, \u201cthere are a wide range of political affiliations. You have a very highly developed, very political culture. There are traditionally leftwing teams, like Hapoel Tel Aviv, which have their roots in the union movement and fly a Che Guevara flag. And then you have Beitar Jerusalem, who arguably have the most racist fan group in the world.\u201d (Montague wrote about all this for the Jewish Chronicle in 2008.) Traditionally, he added, Maccabi fall somewhere in the middle. \u201cBut you have to understand that as the politics of Israel changes, so do the politics of the ultras. They are organised young men, many of whom have been in the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] because of conscription, and what they say and chant tracks where the country is.\u201d As a result, he said, there is a much stronger ultra-nationalist element within the Maccabi fanbase today. \u201cThat isn\u2019t something about the club, per se. It\u2019s something about how Israel is changing.\u201d *** What about Ajax and hooliganism in the Netherlands? There is no evidence as yet that Ajax fans were involved in the violence in a coordinated way \u2013 and that makes sense, Montague said. \u201cAjax has long had a connection to the Jewish community. You can go outside the Cruyff arena [Ajax\u2019s home stadium] and buy stickers with the Star of David on them.\u201d That is not to say that there is no hooliganism among Ajax fans \u2013 and more generally, the Netherlands has seen \u201ca kind of moral panic about ultras recently\u201d, Montague said. Last year, a match between Ajax and Feyenoord was called off because Ajax fans threw flares and fireworks; a repeat encounter in August was called off because of a police strike. A number of other matches have also been called off. \u201cThere have been questions about whether they need to look to a British policing model, and the Dutch authorities are very much on alert.\u201d Ultras in the Netherlands are subject to wider political forces that can be compared to those in play in Israel, with a concerted shift to the right in recent years and growing anti-immigrant sentiment. \u201cWhat you see, when you look at social media or Telegram, is that Ajax\u2019s \u2018enemies\u2019 like Feyenoord are attacking them by saying, you\u2019ve let this happen in your city,\u201d Montague said. \u201cThey use racist and anti-Islamic language about ethnic minority groups in the Netherlands, and they blame the \u2018F-side\u2019 for allowing it.\u201d *** What does this story reveal about how football fits into wider political tensions? There are still some progressive ultra groups, Montague said, particularly in Germany, \u201cbut the whole scene is moving. Across Europe, and the further east you go, the range is from right to extreme right.\u201d One of the curious accompaniments to that phenomenon is that the violence is becoming decoupled from the football \u2013 in a very different way from what unfolded in Amsterdam. \u201cFootball itself is becoming much less violent,\u201d Montague said. \u201cThese groups are being hived off and turning into fighting groups, who show up for carefully organised, almost MMA-style, fights, in secret, far away from the football, and not on the same day.\u201d But even if that is a broader trend, there is clearly a risk of similar violence at other matches involving Israeli teams in the future \u2013 a cocktail of extremist provocation and antisemitic response. \u201cAnyone who is paying attention should have known that a game like this would be a risk,\u201d Montague said. \u201cBut there are questions over how Uefa handles it. I live in Istanbul, and Maccabi were due to play [local side] Besiktas here later this month. That was obviously a problem, but Uefa seemed to be OK with it until the Turkish government said that they couldn\u2019t guarantee the visiting fans\u2019 safety.\u201d Now the game has been moved to Hungary, where it will be played behind closed doors. Tomorrow night, the Israeli national team will play France in Paris. \u201cThat could be a flashpoint, but the policing has been hugely increased \u2013 so I suspect it will pass without incident,\u201d Montague said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t seem likely that this is over. It is going to be something that follows Israeli teams when they play in Europe for a long time.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading As the assisted dying bill makes its way through parliament, Harriet Sherwood spoke with campaigners and supporters of the law change about why the issue is so important to them. Nimo In this lucid, wide-ranging piece, Randeep Ramesh argues that Donald Trump\u2019s victory doesn\u2019t signal a realignment in American politics yet \u2013 but if the Democrats reject a bolder economic platform, it easily could do before the end of his term. Archie Israel\u2019s bombardment of Lebanon has ravaged agricultural areas, destroying fields and crops and leaving farmers struggling and destitute. Jenny Gustafsson reports from Hammana. Nimo In the first of a series about the consequences of long ambulance waiting times, Sam Wollaston tells the enraging story of Dave Strachan, who died after a delay of nearly 10 hours. Archie In this week\u2019s TechScape, Blake Montgomery explores Elon Musk\u2019s growing influence on US politics, with Donald Trump reportedly considering him as a potential \u201csecretary of cost-cutting\u201d. It\u2019s a great read on the tech mogul\u2019s increasing political power. Nimo Sport Women\u2019s Champions League | Frida Maanum, Stina Blackstenius, Mariona Caldentey and Caitlin Foord were on target as Arsenal ran out 4-0 winners against Juventus in Italy. Goals from Manchester City\u2019s Laura Blindkilde Brown and Aoba Fujino saw off a determined Hammarby side 2-0 in the Women\u2019s Champions League. Cricket | The England head coach, Jon Lewis, said his players experienced a \u201csharp learning curve\u201d about handling growing scrutiny of women\u2019s cricket as they dealt with the fallout from their disastrous group stage exit in last month\u2019s T20 World Cup. Premier league | Barney Ronay writes that the coverage of referee David Coote\u2019s remarks about J\u00fcrgen Klopp has been presented in a tone that would suit \u201creporting on the breaking news that Father Christmas has been found naked under a pile of cocaine holding the gun that killed Bobby Kennedy\u201d. He urges caution: \u201cCoote is also a fragile, breakable human being like the rest of us and this incident is going to make his life incredibly difficult for a long time.\u201d The front pages There\u2019s a full round-up of coverage of Justin Welby\u2019s resignation online this morning.

Today in Focus The briefcase, the Porsche and the collapse of the German government Der Spiegel journalist Regina Steffens and author John Kampfner explain how Germany\u2019s traffic light coalition came to an end, and the profound problems facing whichever government comes next Cartoon of the day | Martin Rowson The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world\u2019s not all bad Great Britain has approved new subsea power cables to connect its offshore windfarms with grids in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Germany, to help share renewable electricity across borders. These high-voltage cables will expand Britain\u2019s capacity significantly in the coming years, helping power millions of homes and advancing the goal of becoming a net exporter of green electricity. The hope is that these cables will make Britain\u2019s energy supply more stable, reduce reliance on foreign gas, and support energy imports as a backup when needed. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 November 2024.

Tabcorp was fined over $260,000 for accepting bets on live tennis. The Greens announced a $100m per year plan to ensure public hospitals can provide abortion services. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers announced funding of $900m for states and territories through a new national productivity fund to boost competition and productivity across the economy. Peter Dutton says he supports the right of women to access legal abortion but will not require the Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and the South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic to withdraw a sponsored bill to change abortion law. Australia\u2019s biggest lender, Commonwealth Bank, recorded a quarterly $2.5bn cash net profit backed by \u201cstrong momentum\u201d in home lending.

The wage price index for the September quarter has come in at 3.5% compared with a year earlier, the ABS reported.

Independent senator David Pocock says he will be opposing the government\u2019s misinformation and disinformation bill \u201cunless major changes are made to the legislation\u201d. Sydney trains will run 24 hours for the next three days amid an industrial dispute. Nacc releases fact sheet to dispel misinformation Earlier today, the National Anti-Corruption Commission put out its \u201ccorrections to misinformation\u201d factsheet. In its weekly update, the federal integrity body said a \u201csignificant amount of misinformation\u201d circulates about the Nacc. While it could not \u201ccorrect everything\u201d, it wanted to address some of the primary issues it had by countering it with \u201cfacts and evidence\u201d. Interestingly, one of the points related to a recent finding about the Nacc commissioner, Paul Brereton. The Nacc inspector, the watchdog\u2019s watchdog, found his involvement in a decision not to start a corruption investigation into robodebt referrals resulted in the process being \u201caffected by apprehended bias\u201d. Read more: The Nacc says media references saying Brereton submitted a conflict of interest declaration because one of the persons referred to the Nacc was a \u2018close personal friend\u2019 are misinformation. The Nacc helpfully supplied this correction: The commissioner declared immediately and repeatedly that he had a perceived (not actual) conflict of interest, arising from a prior professional, not personal, relationship with one of the referred persons. The commissioner and that individual have never socialised other than at official functions, nor visited each other\u2019s homes. So, what did the inspector\u2019s report say? In its executive summary, it referenced Brereton\u2019s own words about \u201cperson one\u201d. That included that Brereton said he had a \u201cclose association\u201d with person one, that they were someone he \u201cknows well\u201d, and \u201cwho is well known to me\u201d. The language changed when the Nacc provided a submission to the inspector in August 2024. Brereton said his relationship with person one was a \u201cprior professional association, and not a close personal relationship\u201d. In a report prepared by Alan Robertson SC, the former federal court judge said the change in the Nacc\u2019s language was \u201cgloss\u201d and the conflict existed in \u201cthe terms it was disclosed\u201d. Round-the-clock Sydney train services explained If you\u2019re confused as to why Sydney trains is running 24 hours for the next three days, AAP reports it was one of the demands of the union. The union wants a 32 % pay rise over four years and a 35-hour working week and has accused the government of \u201cdragging its heels\u201d on an improved offer. But RTBU NSW secretary Toby Warnes said commuters should not pay the price for that and would instead benefit from the \u201cnovel\u201d industrial action. Our protected industrial action is always about causing a headache for the government, so they actually listen to the needs of their workforce; it\u2019s never about disrupting the travelling public. Our call for 24-hour transport has the benefit of being a pain for management and the government, while also resulting in improved services for commuters. Previous industrial action was avoided when the government agreed to a union demand to have 50c fares for a weekend. Planned industrial action on light rail services, which will see limited services run on Friday and Saturday, are still set to continue. Pandas bid farewell to Australia Wang Wang and Fu Ni\u2019s love affair with Australia has ended with a final farewell to visitors at Adelaide zoo, AAP reports. As a final treat, the pair \u2013 on loan from China since 2009 \u2013 were given a special meal on Wednesday enriched with letters, messages and drawings from more than 1000 adoring fans. Zoo keepers provided an emotional farewell to the animals in a video on social media. Senior primate keeper Pij Olijnik said he loved greeting the pandas each morning. I just love rocking up to work and opening the door and having pandas there that greet you. They verbally greet you and seem happy to see you and welcome you into that environment. There were long-held hopes that Wang Wang, 19, and Fu Ni, 18, would breed while in Australia, as part of a global conservation program for the vulnerable species. But despite many attempts during their brief annual mating window, several \u201cfalse pregnancies\u201d, and failed artificial insemination procedures for Fu Ni, parenthood remained out of reach for the popular pair. Adelaide Zoo will welcome new giant pandas, male Xing Qiu (pronounced shing chee-y-ull) and female Yi Lan (ee-lun), later this year. Both are from the Chinese city of Chengdu and are aged three, with Xing Qiu turning four just before his arrival. The Bureau of Metereology has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for parts of Queensland. Richard Marles congratulates Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary The defence minister and deputy prime minister has congratulated Fox News host, Pete Hegseth for being picked by Donald Trump to be defense secretary in the incoming Trump administration. Marles told the ABC that he had not met Hegseth but extended his congratulations: Representing the United States government as the secretary of defense is a huge responsibility. And this will be an amazing opportunity for Pete Hegseth and certainly from my point of view, I worked more closely with my American counterpart, Lloyd Austin then I would have with any other defence minister around the world. I\u2019m sure that will be the case when Pete Hegseth becomes the secretary of defense. It is a critically important part of the way in which our bilateral relationship exists, so much of what happens between our two companies happens through the prism of defence. I very much look forward to meeting him in building a relationship which will help us take the alliance into the future. On the future for US ambassador Kevin Rudd, Marles said Rudd had attended the Republican National Convention earlier this year, and had been important to introducing the government to a number of figures who may play a part in a future Trump administration. He said Rudd will build the best relationship Australia can with the future Trump administration. The NSW transport minister, Jo Haylen, has said rail services in suburban parts of the Sydney train network will need to run for 24 hours a day during planned industrial action from Thursday to Saturday otherwise \u201cthere will be no services at all\u201d due to some of the work bans being put in place by the Rail, Tram and Bus Union. She said: We want confidence and certainty for passengers and for the transport workforce, we have made very good progress across some 28 bargaining meetings, all day long, meetings now for over six months. In fact, the bargaining room is in operation today. I feel we are close to a resolution, but we need to round this out by Christmas. The commitment of the government Sydney trains, New South Wales trains, and I understand the unions, is to resolve this as quickly as possible, but we also want passengers to be able to get where they need to go. Haylen said there could be major delays, but the current plan was for a normal timetable to run across Sydney on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and in the evening and in particular between midnight and 4am when there wouldn\u2019t normally be operating trains, there will be a train every 30 minutes. Matt Longland, chief executive of Sydney trains said track work planned over the weekend had been cancelled, and urged customers to plan ahead in order to not be too put out by delays. The period that we\u2019re entering into is one in which a number of new bans will take place from tomorrow \u2026 will make it increasingly difficult to operate a reliable network. Safety is always our number one priority, and none of our team will operate services where it\u2019s not safe to do so, but we do expect that there will be some delays. Another TV news executive has resigned suddenly from Nine Entertainment. The resignation leaves the Sydney and the Brisbane TV newsrooms of Nine News without a leader. \u201cNine can confirm further leadership changes were communicated to its TV News division today,\u201d a spokesperson for Nine said. \u201cAn internal and external recruitment process is now under way for news directors in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth.\u201d The Perth news director position is vacant because of the internal promotion of Gareth Parker. Brisbane news director Amanda Paterson left Nine a week ago after a 31-year career in TV news and current affairs including a stint as a reporter on A Current Affair. On Wednesday staff were told the Sydney news director, Simon Hobbs, will leave the business on Friday. Here\u2019s the video of shadow foreign affairs minister, Simon Birmingham, speaking on whether US ambassador, Kevin Rudd, should stay in the job after Donald Trump\u2019s election victory last week in the US. Police called in over allegations of vote tampering in Victorian council elections The Victorian Electoral Commission has referred allegations of suspected postal vote tampering in two Melbourne council elections to police. The VEC on Wednesday afternoon said it had detected a high number of multiple returned votes in Knox city council, in Melbourne\u2019s east, and Whittlesea city council \u2013 which was overseen by administrators between 2020 and 2024 after governance issues, in Melbourne\u2019s north, after voting closed in the state\u2019s council elections last month. Both elections have been declared by the VEC and on Wednesday it requested the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (Vcat) review the results in Whittlesea\u2019s Lalor ward and Knox\u2019s Baird ward. Peter Lockwood won Baird ward on a margin of 1.87% while Stevan Kozmevski secured a victory in Lalor on a 0.16% margin. There is no suggestions of wrongdoing by either candidate. Asio using AI in data processing The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) has revealed it has been using artificial intelligence to process vast amounts of counter-terrorism data since April this year. In its 2024 annual report, released at the end of October, the spy agency said it had deployed AI \u201cin support of a high-priority counter-terrorism investigation\u201d to triage terabytes of data and \u201cidentify the intelligence-needle in a field of digital-haystacks.\u201d Asio said: The AI capabilities efficiently prioritised security-relevant information within hours, enabling Asio officers to go straight to the most security-relevant product that would otherwise take hundreds of hours to find. The agency said an Asio officer reviews all results, and a human is responsible and accountable for Asio\u2019s decision-making, but the use of AI significantly reduced the time between the collection and analysis of intelligence. Treasurer says \u2018direction of travel is pretty clear\u2019 in uptake of renewable energy Jim Chalmers also talked about the \u201cGreat Fragmentation\u201d that has unwound over the past fifteen years or so since the global financial crisis (followed by the Covid pandemic and global inflation spike after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine). We couldn\u2019t help wondering whether the incoming/returning Trump administration would create a particularly big fragmentation of global climate policy given Trump\u2019s promise to pull the US out of the Paris Climate agreement for a second time, and his \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d mantra that echoes in parts of Australia too. Chalmers said the change of administration \u201cdoes introduce another element of uncertainty in the global net zero transformation. That said, \u201cthe weight of the world\u2019s direction, more broadly \u2026 encourages us and convinces us that we\u2019re on the right track\u201d, Chalmers said. \u201cNo one, I think, can really argue against the role that cheaper and cleaner energy will play in our own industrial and economic development, or indeed, more broadly,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe direction of travel is pretty clear in the world [and] in the global economy\u201d. Overall, this will be the defining change and challenge in our economy over a longer time frame than governments in either country. Physics, it should be said, also don\u2019t pay heed to electoral cycles \u2013 even though that might get lost in the coming political campaign. Guess we\u2019ll find out soon enough on this matter too. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has been giving a speech to economists in Sydney this afternoon in the wake of some generally positive wages data from the September quarter. (See earlier posts here and our article here.) Guardian Australia managed to squeeze a couple of late questions in, including about how tough a message was it to convince Australians that a recovery in real wages would help households (when a similar message by incumbent US Democrats failed to cut through) Chalmers, after all, had just shown this chart to the audience, and the red bits are some ways off making up for the black bits (which began prior to the Albanese government taking office in May 2022. Chalmers said the September quarter numbers were \u201ca great outcome\u201d, and the four quarters in a row of gains in real terms \u201cvery, very encouraging\u201d. Real wages growth is one of the things I focus most on. I read a lot of stuff over a period of time that said you couldn\u2019t have strong wages growth and have inflation moderating. We\u2019ve shown that\u2019s possible. We\u2019ve shown it\u2019s happening. \u201cThere is not a whiff of a wage-price spiral in our economy, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe\u2019ve got a lot of ground to make up\u201d. Guess we\u2019ll learn soon enough whether the electorate thinks the current government is more likely to deliver on-going real wage growth \u2013 or the coalition. Nurses reject pay offer Striking nurses have rejected an offer to fund their requested pay rise in return for delaying the rollout of their \u201cbig ask\u201d for more staff, NSW\u2019s health minister says. AAP reports, hundreds of surgeries are expected to be postponed as more than 50,000 nurses and midwives campaign for better pay. The 24-hour strike across NSW public hospitals began at 7.30am on Wednesday, with nurses and midwives calling for a one-off pay bump of 15% after large wage increases for teachers, paramedics and, most recently, police officers. The strike is estimated to force the postponement of 600 to 700 surgeries, according to NSW Health. Emergency department wait times are also expected to blow out and people with non-life threatening conditions are urged to contact Healthdirect before arriving at hospitals. Minimal, life-preserving staffing will be maintained in all public hospitals and health services during the 24-hour strike. The health minister, Ryan Park, said he was disappointed the union walked away from its commitment to negotiate before the Industrial Relations Commission: We honoured our end of the bargain \u2026 there was an expectation, though, that this industrial action was not going to take place. The government delivered the union\u2019s \u201cbig ask\u201d to begin the rollout of staffing ratios despite the billion-dollar cost, but the sought pay rise was not possible to implement in a single year, Park said. The union rejected an offer for the 15% increase to be provided over multiple years and for a slightly larger boost for early career nurses, the health minister said. But the union said the government had not entered negotiations willing to use extra money to fund pay increases. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Josh Taylor will be here to take you through the rest of our rolling coverage. Take care. The Bureau of Meteorology has provided an updated severe thunderstorm warning for eastern NSW. It said severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds, large hailstones and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding over the next several hours \u2013 affecting Grafton, Batemans Bay, Tenterfield, Moree, Parkes and Maclean. 3cm large hailstones were recorded at Parkes around 1pm, it said, while 24.4mm of rain was recorded at Jerangle in the 30 minutes to 12:16pm. Steggall says Labor and Coalition must disclose what 2035 target they will each take to next election At Cop29, UK prime minister Keir Starmer will pledge to cut emissions by 81% compared with 1990 levels by 2035, a target in line with the recommendations of the Climate Change Committee. Independent MP for Warringah, Zali Steggall, welcomed the move in a statement, and said: The world is on track for 3.1 degrees of warming if nations do not increase their commitments to reduce emissions. The Albanese government and the Coalition must come clean with the Australian public and announce what 2035 target they will take to the next election. Australians deserve to know whether they are fair dinkum about acting on climate risk or pandering to the fossil fuel industry. The Australian Fashion Council (AFC) has responded to news that IMG will abandon Australian Fashion Week after nearly 20 years, leaving its future uncertain. IMG made the announcement after owning and operating AFW since 2005. The AFC said the event provided \u201ca critical platform for Australian designers to showcase their talent and innovation, and [positioned] Australia as a key player on the global fashion stage.\u201d AFC chair Marianne Perkovic and CEO Jaana Quaintance-James issued a joint statement on the decision, and said: [AFC] has learnt today of IMG\u2019s decision to not proceed with Australian Fashion Week (AFW) in 2025 \u2026 Turning to the future, we know we need a platform to profile and celebrate Australian fashion. This moment signals an opportunity for the industry to reimagine and reshape how Australian fashion is represented, and provides us all with an opportunity to explore new ways in which to showcase emerging and established Australian talent. The AFC, as the peak body for fashion and textiles in Australia, will lead this conversation. We will work with members, government and other stakeholders to consider the future platform needed to position and elevate Australian fashion internationally. Master Builders welcomes new national productivity fund to boost productivity Master Builders Australia says it strongly supports the announcement by treasurer Jim Chalmers today of a new national productivity fund to boost competition and productivity across the economy. Paul Karp had all the details on this earlier in the blog, here. In a statement, Master Builders Australia CEO Denita Wawn said the advocacy group had consistently called for incentives to support reform and lift productivity in the building and construction industry \u2013 with labour productivity down 18% over the last decade. Productivity is more than a buzzword. When productivity is down, prices go up and our ability to build the homes and surrounding infrastructure communities need is slowed down. We thank the treasurer for putting productivity back on the national agenda and listening to our concerns around barriers to building. Master Builders analysis of build times found that 15 years ago, it took on average 9 months to build a stand-a-alone house from approval to completion, while today it now takes 12.7 months \u2013 an increase of over 40%. There are currently three severe weather warnings in place for NSW, Queensland and Victoria. The Bureau of Meteorology has alerted: Severe thunderstorms are likely to cause heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding over the next several hours in parts of the NSW south coast, southern tablelands and Snowy Mountains regions. In Queensland, scattered thunderstorms are set to develop along the seat, with severe thunderstorms expected over the south-east into the afternoon and evening. This is likely to produce large hailstones, damaging winds and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding. And in Victoria, severe thunderstorms are likely to produce heavy rainfall and could lead to flash flooding around Buchan, Gelantipy and Bonang. Meanwhile, the NSW SES has issued a \u201cmonitor conditions\u201d alert for Parkes and Peak Hill amid the forecast heavy rain, damaging winds and large hailstones. Brumbies cull wins approval in NSW, but rift remains A multi-party report backing the counting and shooting of feral horses in national parks should put to bed \u201cridiculous anti-science questioning\u201d from critics, environmental advocates say. As AAP reports, the NSW parliamentary inquiry report has found the state was using global best-practice methods to count brumbies and there was no clear evidence of any animal-welfare breaches under current culling methods. At least 5,800 \u2013 or an estimated one in three \u2013 brumbies have been killed in NSW since aerial shooting resumed in November 2023. Ecologists estimate about that number will need to be culled annually to reach a 3000-horse cap by 2027 due to high birthrates. The inquiry broadly dismissed concerns about distance sampling being used to measure the population annually, although it welcomed the trial of new methods in the most recent count. The Invasive Species Council advocacy director, Jack Gough, said strong cross-party support from Liberals to the Greens and independents for effective brumby control reflected public backing for native wildlife to be protected from feral horses: This report should once and for all end the ridiculous anti-science questioning of the feral horse count figures by a small minority that do not want to see a single feral horse removed from the national park. Committee chair and Animal Justice MP Emma Hurst hit out at the Labor, Liberal and Shooters-backed report, saying the findings and recommendations did not reflect her views. Along with Nationals MLC Wes Fang, Hurst backed a finding that aerial shooting of brumbies could not be ethically justified. The federal government will make an announcement on university funding in the coming weeks, the education minister has flagged, cementing student debt as a key election issue. Speaking to a TEQSA conference in Melbourne on Wednesday, Jason Clare reiterated that, if Labor won next year\u2019s election, the first piece of legislation it would introduce would be to cut student debts by 20%. But he said there was \u201cmore to do\u201d to make the system fairer. When Hecs was first created students paid an average of about 24% of the cost of degree. This increased to about 36% in the late 1990s. And now, because of the changes the previous government made, it\u2019s about 45%. Cutting student debt by 20% fixes that for a generation of Australians. But there is more to do. That includes changing the way we fund universities. Part of that is uncapping the number of places at university for students from disadvantaged backgrounds \u2026 part of that is a new needs-based funding system \u2026 and part of that is a new Australian Tertiary Education Commission (ATEC) \u2026 to drive reform over the long term. And I hope to provide you with more detail on all of that before the end of the year. Clare has previously stated ATEC would be tasked with scrapping the Coalition\u2019s Job Ready Graduates Scheme, which has driven arts degrees above $50,000. Birmingham says Israeli settlements in Gaza \u2018should not be undertaken\u2019 Simon Birmingham was asked about comments from members of the Netanyahu government, advocating the establishment of Israeli settlements in Gaza. He responded that \u201cAustralian governments, Coalition and Labor, have long been clear that settlement activity that is counter-productive to achieving longstanding settlement of issues should not be undertaken\u201d. That position has not changed and shouldn\u2019t change. He also said the Coalition has \u201cno plans\u201d to change Australian laws in regard to supplying weapons or ammunition to Israel. But if the Israeli government was to ask for help? He responded: The structure is indeed as to how those defence export laws operate and, you know, that is the consistency that we would apply. And with that, Birmingham\u2019s appearance at the National Press Club has wrapped up. Birmingham says decision on further tax cuts yet to be made Simon Birmingham was asked about comments from Peter Dutton on the radio this morning that the Coalition was rethinking stage-three tax cuts and getting inflation under control was more important. What is the Coalition\u2019s stance? He criticised the Albanese government for breaking an election promise and added: We accepted at the time we were not going to stand in the way of Australians receiving those funds. Spend the money, they have, and I think what Peter was rightly alluding to this morning is, as it comes into the next campaign, we will have to have a look, carefully, at the state of the books as we make those final budget decisions, and where we can go in terms of further tax cuts will be one of those big key points in terms of those final budget decisions. Asked if he is underestimating how difficult and challenging the next four years under Trump may be, Simon Birmingham said he is optimistic about working with the administration and hopes to make success of it. And yes, there are disrupters like president [Donald] Trump who is clearly bringing in to disrupt things like government efficiency in the US government through the role that he has given to Elon Musk. I wouldn\u2019t mind having a bit of disruption of efficiency in the Australian government at times either. I\u2019m not saying it will be the right pathway, but who knows? Maybe there will be glimmers of lessons that could be learned along the way. Birmingham says Coalition \u2018clear in principles\u2019 on Israel-Gaza war despite civilian death toll Our own Sarah Basford Canales has asked Simon Birmingham a series of questions on the Coalition\u2019s response to the conflict in Gaza: Is there a red line for the opposition in terms of that death toll continuing to rise by the thousands in the coming months and potentially years? Does the opposition still think this is the best way to peace and a two-state solution in the situation? And what would a Dutton government do differently if it were to be elected next election? Birmingham answered the last question first and said the Coalition\u2019s view is that any prospect of a two-state solution should be \u201cfully negotiated, and negotiated by settling questions of borders, of security guarantees and rights of return, but also that we should be engaging in what other regional processes and pathways might be possible\u201d. He said the Coalition is \u201cresolute in terms of our position around Israel\u2019s right to self-defence\u201d. We equally want to see the tragic loss of life come to an end and for a breakthrough point. But you can see by statements out of Qatar just in the last week the frustration that exists in relation to Hamas\u2019 unwillingness to release hostages, to lay down arms and to stop using Palestinian civilians as human shields in this conflict. Is the civilian death toll a consideration that might affect the Coalition\u2019s resoluteness on that position? Birmingham replied: The civilian death toll is something that pains absolutely all of us and, of course, it is a tragedy in any and all conflict and a very significant tragedy in this one, but we\u2019re clear in terms of the principles we stand by and the outcomes we ultimately seek. Birmingham says Coalition aiming to deter invasion of Taiwan and be \u2018principled and predictable with China\u2019 One reporter asked if the Coalition is elected at the next election and faces a \u201chorror scenario\u201d of an invasion of Taiwan, would it move to defend Taiwan if attacked by China? Simon Birmingham responded that \u201cyou\u2019re taking us forward quite a few steps in that regard\u201d, but added: Principled and predictable is the framework that I\u2019ve outlined for how our engagement with China should be and should operate \u2026 [and] part of that is that we would not wish to see any unilateral change to Taiwan and its circumstances and not wish to see an invasion of the sort that you\u2019ve characterised. And clearly it \u2026 should be entirely predictable to Beijing that Australia would condemn such action, oppose such action and, indeed, do everything we can to deter such action from occurring in the first place. Birmingham said that if an invasion occurred \u201cwhat the nature of conflict is, what role the US or others undertake, are all unknowns before we get to the question of how Australia would respond\u201d. Our prime job is to deter it in the first place and to work with our partners to try to deter that from happening in the first place. Birmingham says he has tried to keep an open mind over whether Kevin Rudd stays as ambassador Q: If the president-elect in the last year has referred to our ambassador in the US as \u201cnot the brightest bulb\u201d, is it really tenable for that person to be at the forefront of our engagement in Washington? Simon Birmingham responded: The president-elect has just named a secretary of state who had some pretty sharp things to say about him, but who ultimately campaigned alongside him. He\u2019s been elected alongside a vice-president who had very sharp and pointed things to say about him, but who he chose to make his running mate. So I think we\u2019ve got to be conscious of keeping an open mind, which is what we have tried to do in relation to the question around Kevin. Birmingham says Coalition does not want to politicise Kevin Rudd\u2019s role Simon Birmingham was asked to respond to the tweet from senior Trump adviser Dan Scavino overnight, suggesting time was running out for Kevin Rudd\u2019s tenure as ambassador. You can read more on this earlier in the blog, here. Birmingham was asked for the Coalition\u2019s position on Rudd\u2019s tenure, and whether he should stand aside amid his now-deleted commentary on Trump? He responded that \u201cwhat we have here is a need for Australia not to be debating the who, but the what, and the outcomes and the effectiveness of getting those outcomes\u201d. Peter Dutton and I have been very clear that we have wanted to see Kevin Rudd succeed all along. We have acknowledged and praised some of his successes, acknowledged his work in getting the export trade restrictions eased between Australia and the US and big Aukus breakthroughs that have been really important in that regard. And we want to see that success continue and that\u2019s what matters in Australia\u2019s national interest. Now, ambassador Rudd and the prime minister are the ones who are in the box seat to best make the assessment in coming weeks or months about how effectively he is going to be able to continue to have the influence and get the outcomes that Australia needs. Birmingham said the Coalition was not seeking to politicise the role. In terms of the tweet from Scavino specifically, he said: A significant member of the incoming president\u2019s campaign team posted that. What we are to make of the image, well, I think I\u2019ll leave it for others to comment on the image. I\u2019ve spoken to the substance. Birmingham says climate ambition must not end in broken promises On the climate, Simon Birmingham sought to reinforce that the upcoming election would be about how Australia gets to net zero \u2013 not if. That that is a really important message to drive home to those Pacific nations, that the construct of debate in this country is focused on actually achieving that \u2026 That\u2019s how we need to really make sure we take a careful and thoughtful approach to framing that election contest. Speaking about Paris agreements, Birmingham said \u201cbeing upfront about what is achievable in the time horizons that are there\u201d is important. It is no more helpful \u2013 in fact, arguably it\u2019s more counter-productive \u2013 to be in a situation where targets are made but not realised and you\u2019ve broken your promise to nations, than it is to have been realistic in the first place. And of course we want to stretch to maximum ambition, and I\u2019ve been clear about my desire to see maximum ambition at all times, but it\u2019s not going to go down well if maximum ambition simply translates into broken promises. Birmingham says Australia still \u2018a few steps away\u2019 from being interlocutor between US and China Back at the National Press Club, Simon Birmingham has been taking questions from reporters. He was asked about comments from the prime minister today that Australia is a trusted middle power that could help manage the strategic competition between the US and China. Does he agree with this, or is it a naive view and great powers will just do what great powers do? Birmingham replied that \u201cAustralia should always seek to play as constructive a role as we possibly can\u201d: But I think at this point of change and contest we also need to be realistic about the challenges that we face. He said when it comes to the Trump administration in the US there are immediate priorities to address, including Aukus and tariffs. Beyond those bilateral points of engagement, there will be ways in which we want to seek to encourage the US as to how they engage in our region. Active engagement remains critical and important across particularly the Asean nations, and no doubt there will be times for discussion about the nature of their engagement with China and the implications of that with other nations and on the global economy. But are we going to step up and be able to fulfil some situation that is foreseeable as a significant interlocutor between the two? I think we\u2019re a few steps away from that at this point in time. Tasmanian independent labels funding for Maugean skate as \u2018self-serving handout\u2019 Breaking away from the National Press Club: independent MP Andrew Wilkie has labelled government funding aimed at saving the endangered Maugean skate as an \u201cexpensive and self-serving handout\u201d. Yesterday, Anthony Albanese announced a $28m boost for new measures in Macquarie harbour, including scaling up oxygenation to offset the effects of human activities on the Maugean skate. During his second press conference of the day, protesters were heard chanting various slogans including what sounded like \u201csave the Maugean skate\u201d. In a post to X today, Wilkie \u2013 the federal member for Clark in Tasmania \u2013 said: $28m to Macquarie harbour is just an expensive and self-serving handout to try and win Braddon, while at the same time kowtowing to Labor\u2019s mates in the salmon industry. Again, the loser is the imperilled Maugean skate. Simon Birmingham argued that the United Nations is \u201cfailing to meet its charter to maintain international peace and security\u201d. With the UN paralysed, effective peace-keeping initiatives no longer enjoy international momentum. To avoid a repeat of the world wars of last century, deterrence and diplomacy must be more effective today than appeasement was then. Birmingham says its more important than ever China act with \u2018great responsibility\u2019 On China, Simon Birmingham said Australia\u2019s approach should be \u201cboth principled and predictable\u201d. Ideally, China would respect international rulings on maritime boundaries and its forces would not engage in acts of aggression or actions that risk miscalculation. Ideally, China would use its influence and relations with countries like Russia, Iran and North Korea to stem the rise in conflict, not enable it. Ideally, China\u2019s systems would operate with integrity and transparency, whether in matters of cyber security, or market competitiveness. Australia\u2019s position on issues like these should be of no surprise. As China continues its growth, including the rapid growth of its nuclear armed military capabilities, it becomes more important than ever that this great power act with great responsibility. Birmingham welcomed China\u2019s decision to restore ministerial level dialogue with Australia and said it was \u201ccounterproductive of them to have chosen to cease it in the first place.\u201d He said this dialogue should continue, but later noted \u201csuch ambitions for cooperation may be thwarted if the current trajectory of global conflict continues.\u201d Birmingham said no reason to \u2018catastrophise\u2019 over second Trump presidency Moving to a second Donald Trump presidency, Simon Birmingham labelled him a \u201cdisrupter\u201d who is \u201cprone to pursuing less conventional policies and making bolder pronouncements\u201d \u2013 but said this is not a reason to \u201ccatastrophise\u201d. The Turnbull and Morrison governments demonstrated how to work with a Trump administration. There are opportunities in the second Trump administration. He said Aukus must play a key role into the future, and for the case to be made to Trump as follows: No other US ally in this region is investing to expand their defence capability like Australia is. No other US ally is investing directly in US defence industrial capabilities like Australia is. And no other US ally is investing to build defence industrial capabilities that complement those of the US like Australia is \u2026 Prime Minister [Anthony] Albanese should be making [these] points to President Trump in person, at the earliest opportunity. Birmingham wants formal trilateral cooperation between India, Indonesia and Australia Simon Birmingham says the contest for influence in the Pacific is symbolic of a greater global contest, and that the world we live in today \u201cis profoundly different from the established order that I, or most of us, grew up with\u201d. He said trilateral cooperation between India, Indonesia and Australia should be sought \u201cto secure the open maritime domain that we all rely upon, the security we desire, and the growth we all seek\u201d. The significant roles India, Indonesia and Australia play within our region, coupled with our different alliances and partnerships, can aid our ability to navigate and shape the contested world we face. Such a minilateral partnership can complement our work in the Quad, and other partnerships, especially our relations across our fellow Asean nations. Simon Birmingham addresses National Press Club The shadow foreign affairs minister, Simon Birmingham, is addressing the National Press Club in Canberra today, about preserving Australia\u2019s interests in a contested world. He has been outlining work done by previous leaders throughout the decades to secure Australia\u2019s standing, and said that \u201cnowhere is the creation of a partisan distinction in foreign policy \u2026 more counterproductive than the Pacific\u201d. Birmingham said the contest for Pacific influence and engagement was \u201centrenched\u201d: China\u2019s model of elite capture and less regulated funding is enticing to some. In contrast, Australia\u2019s ethical, values-based approach is better policy but harder politics. To advance our interests, we must be at one in promoting the bipartisanship of Australia\u2019s investment in \u2013 and respect for \u2013 Pacific Island nations, their sovereignty and their people. He said the singular message of Australian leaders to Pacific leaders \u201cmust be one of enduring and reliable partnership, above all politics\u201d. Chrisian and Muslim faith leaders in Queensland say they have \u201cprofound concerns\u201d about the new LNP government\u2019s call to abolish the state\u2019s First Nations Truth-telling and Healing Inquiry. A statement from 13 religious leaders \u2013 including from the Catholic and Anglican churches, and the Council of Imams \u2013 acknowledges that faith-based organisations \u201care historically complicit\u201d in the suffering of First Nations people \u201cincluding in the way that churches have collaborated with the state\u201d. The premier, David Crisafulli, had promised before the state election to end the inquiry. The new government has since directed it to end its hearings, including sessions planned in remote communities in the coming weeks. The church leaders\u2019 statement says the inquiry would be vital for listening and recording stories and \u201ccollating evidence to shine a light on our past\u201d. Before abolishing this independent inquiry, we believe the new state government needs to clarify to all Queenslanders what will be implemented in its place \u2026 noting the advanced age and physical frailty of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander inquiry contributors. How all Queenslanders will be able to heal and move forward together \u2013 with dignity and respect \u2013 and understand our shared history in all its challenges and richness. In the midst of the tragic impacts of displacement, dispossession, the forcible removal of children and policies of assimilation \u2026 there are also stories of appreciation, reconciliation and triumph in adversity. All these stories need to continue to be heard. We believe Queensland remains ready to hear the experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and that in the sharing of stories that a more compassionate and resilient Queensland will emerge. Public schools will \u2018never reach\u2019 full funding under proposed forms, senate inquiry hears Public schools will \u201cnever reach\u201d full funding under the federal government\u2019s proposed reforms, a senate inquiry has heard. Labor\u2019s bill allows the commonwealth to provide extra funding to public schools in excess of 20%, making the figure a floor, not a ceiling. States and territories front 75%, leaving a 5% gap. All jurisdictions except Victoria, NSW and Queensland have agreed to Labor\u2019s proposal to bring its contribution 2.5% above the floor to 22.5%, leaving the remaining 2.5% gap to be filled by the states by 2029. But peak bodies including Save Our Schools, the Isolated Children\u2019s Parents\u2019 Association and the Australian Secondary Principals\u2019 Association told the enquiry the federal government should lift its funding floor to 25% and remove \u201caccounting tricks\u201d in the bill. National Convenor of Save Our Schools, Trevor Cobbold, said even with a 5% increase in funding public schools wouldn\u2019t reach the dream of Gonski, citing a 4% loophole retained in the agreement which allows jurisdictions to claim funding on non-school expenditures like capital depreciation. 18 years after Gonski public schools still won\u2019t be funded according to need. It\u2019s a devastating outcome. President of the Australian Secondary Principals\u2019 Association, Andy Mison said the body was also concerned about the 4%, arguing schools would \u201cnever reach\u201d 100% funding if it were retained. I think it\u2019s appalling. Public schools \u2026 bear the brunt of social inequities and are increasingly being asked to do more with less \u2026 the concentration of disadvantage is increasing. We urge greater ambition ... I don\u2019t think it passes the pub test to include capital depreciation More on the wages figures As always, some industries reported higher wage increases than others. Perhaps surprisingly, the highest quarterly increase was 2.5% for those in accommodation and food services \u2013 a sector that might be considered \u201cdiscretionary\u201d. Financial and insurance services posted a 0.5% quarterly rise, or the least of all industries. At an annual rate, those in electricity, gas and water posted the largest increase at 5%, while (sadly for some close to this blog) arts and recreation lagged other industries with a 2.9% rise. And, as for the different regions of this great browned-off land, Queensland posted the largest quarterly wage rise at 1.6% (though it seemed to do the Labour government there no favours). The ACT, with all its public servants, managed a 1% rise \u2013 or the least among the jurisdictions. For annual increases, Tassie was the place to be, with wages up 4%. At the other end of the country, the Northern Territory posted the smallest annual rises at 3%. We\u2019ll return to the workers\u2019 tale roughly this time tomorrow, when we get October labour market numbers. CBA reckons the economy added 20,000 jobs last month, or not quite enough to stop the jobless rate ticking higher to 4.2% (from 4.1% in September). Watch out for those numbers then on your favourite blog (yes, this one). Coles to launch \u2018AI-powered\u2019 trolley Coles is launching a trial of an \u201cAI-powered\u201d smart trolley that will allow customers to scan and pay all from their trolley beginning in 2025. The tech will be first trialled at Coles\u2019 Richmond Traders store in Melbourne from January, with customers able to learn how to use the trolleys from today until the trial commences. The trolley has sensors, an in-built scale to scan groceries including fresh produce, and a digital screen, which shows aisle locations and specials. Severe storms in parts of Queensland and NSW The Bureau of Meteorology has published a severe weather update, as thunderstorms are forecast across the east today: More on the latest wage numbers The Reserve Bank should be content with these wage numbers as they have come in slightly on the lower side of expectations for both the annual and quarterly figures. Stocks have pared their losses for the day a bit (a sign that investors were a bit more hopeful of a near-term interest rate cut), while the Australian dollar is hovering a bit above 65.2 US cents. The easing in wage price increases were also matched across both the public and private sectors. Wages for the former were up a seasonally adjusted 3.7%, the least since the September quarter of 2022. For the private sector (which is about four in five jobs), wages were up 3.5%, or matching the increase in the September quarter of 2023. Independent senator David Pocock says he will be opposing the government\u2019s misinformation and disinformation bill \u201cunless major changes are made to the legislation\u201d. In the video posted to YouTube, Pocock said that as it stands, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it takes the right approach to dealing with misinformation.\u201d Freedom of speech and the freedom to protest are critical parts of our democracy. And in Australia, we don\u2019t have an overarching Human Rights Act that entrenches these rights. So we need to tread very carefully whenever we make changes that may impact on them. He said that Labor and Liberal governments have cracked down on the right to protest at a state level and while misinformation and disinformation causes harm, \u201cpeople are also entitled to their opinion, whatever it may be.\u201d Pocock argued the issue is not so much with individuals spreading misinformation but the social media algorithms that boost this content \u2013 so \u201cI find it very strange that the government wants to trust these giant corporations who have at best very questionable reputations with deciding what is or isn\u2019t mis and disinformation\u201d. He also criticised the government for delaying changes to the Privacy Act, which he argued would go further to protecting Australians online. The truth is really hard to define and often changes over time, so there\u2019s a risk platforms could just end up unintentionally censoring people. The wage price index for the September quarter has come in at 3.5% compared with a year earlier, the ABS has just reported. That figure compared with the 3.6% pace expected by economists and the 4.1% clip reported by the ABS for the June quarter. At that rate, wages were increasing more than the headline inflation rate as they have since the final three months of 2023. The September quarter consumer price index rose at an annual pace of 2.8%. A similar story was true for the quarter alone, with the WPI up 0.8%, or well ahead of the 0.2% pace of CPI. Economists had tipped that to come in at 0.9% or similar to the 0.8% rate recorded by the ABS for the June quarter. Only 13% of health and medical research workforce in regional areas An audit of the Australian health and medical research workforce shows only 13% of the workforce is based in regional, rural or remote areas. The National Rural Health Alliance says this is insufficient to serve Australia\u2019s 30% rural population, with the audit also pointing to additional barriers that exist for regional researchers. Conducted by the Department of Health and Aged Care, the audit found the health and medical research workforce is highly mobile, moving jobs every 1.6 years \u2013 suggesting researchers may be willing to move to rural areas. The National Rural Health Alliance chief executive, Susi Tegen, said: The underrepresentation of rural researchers is worrying given that rural communities face distinct health challenges that require tailored and place-based solutions \u2026 Funding for research does not adequately flow to the regions. Rural researchers become a secondary consideration for funding. They have difficulty accessing the same opportunities available to researchers in metropolitan locations. The limited access to training, funding and collaborative networks in regional areas means that researchers may be left behind, and the needs of these communities may remain unmet. Tegen called on the government to increase funding access, provide targeted training and development, and opportunities for collaborative networks to the regional workforce and researchers. Multilateral trade liberalisation \u2018right strategy for geopolitical environment\u2019: Leigh Andrew Leigh was also asked about trade with the US \u2013 as has been discussed much this morning \u2013 following Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on imports. How can Australia stop that? Leigh said \u201cthe periods of open markets have been the periods of greatest prosperity\u201d in history, which was achieved \u201cnot just by doing cosy bilateral deals, but by engaging in broad multilateral reform\u201d. You see us supporting the entry of the UK into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, broadening out the networks through the World Trade Organisation. Multilateral trade liberalisation doesn\u2019t just work better, it\u2019s also the right strategy for the current geopolitical environment. So, engaging in that with open markets is going to be what we\u2019ll do. You\u2019ve seen us broadening out the trading relationships through the Asia Pacific and dealing with some of the issues that we faced with around $20bn of trade blockages to China when we came to office now being dealt with steadily, methodically, by Don Farrell as trade minister. Andrew Leigh says he \u2018absolutely\u2019 expected domestic airfares to increase after collapse of Rex The assistant competition minister, Andrew Leigh, was on ABC RN earlier this morning where he discussed the increase in capital city route flights. The ACCC has found the average domestic airfare increased by 13% after the collapse of Rex flights between capital cities. Adelaide-Melbourne jumped 95% to $296, Melbourne-Gold Coast was up 70% to $432, and Canberra-Melbourne rose 54% to $298. Leigh said he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d expecting things to get this bad this quickly: \u2026 when you move from a monopoly carrier on a route to three carriers on the route, then the price per kilometre is halved, goes down from 40 cents a kilometre to 19 cents a kilometre. So, it\u2019s expected and disappointing that when you had that collapse that you immediately saw prices for flyers increase. Asked what the government would do about the growing cost of airfares until a new airline emerges as a serious third competitor, he said it would be a \u201cmatter for the commercial market\u201d as to who fills that gap \u2013 and \u201cclearly the government is looking at creating settings that make it attractive for competitors\u201d. We\u2019re talking now about airlines, but we\u2019ve been talking previously about supermarkets or banks. And if you go to baby food and beer, the same challenge occurs. And that\u2019s why the government\u2019s focus on competition isn\u2019t just to go sector by sector, but to revitalise national competition policy in order to see the gains right across the economy. We had more on this from treasurer Jim Chalmers earlier in the blog, here. South Australian CFA testing warning systems The South Australian Country Fire Service says it is testing its warning system today from 10.30am to 1pm: Please disregard any warnings issued during this time. Melbourne police address media after alleged armed stand-off Earlier, Melbourne police spoke to the media after an alleged armed stand-off with officers in Weir Views. Yesterday, police were monitoring a stolen vehicle when a man allegedly got out of the car and fired shots at police, who were not injured. The man then allegedly entered a house where two occupants, a man and a toddler not known to him, were inside. Police negotiated with him as the occupants left uninjured. The man allegedly fired shots at police again, with police returning fire (which did not hit him) and deploying a police dog to assist with the arrest just after 6pm. Speaking to the media, the officer said the man \u2013 a 26-year-old man from Snake Valley \u2013 is known to police but couldn\u2019t provide further details. He said the occupant was in his 30s or early 40s and is the father of the one-year-old. He added it is \u201cextremely lucky\u201d that no police were injured: It is lucky, and it is completely unacceptable that members were exposed to such dangers. In terms of the negotiations police had with the man, police alleged: We attempted for him to surrender and put the firearm down. We provided safe passage for that to occur. That did not occur prior to the incident unfolding. It was two and a half hours from when the alleged offender entered the home to when he was arrested. He said the man was jumping on a trampoline at one point and \u201cthere was a period of time where he was behaving erratically in the back yard of the premises\u201d. The officer said it is expected the alleged offender will be charged today with a range of offences including aggravated carjacking, aggravated burglary and conduct endangering life and firearms offences. The Catholic church has won a landmark case limiting its liability for the abuse of children by priests not under its direct employment. Last year, the highest Victorian court delivered an unprecedented ruling that the church was vicariously responsible for the abuse of a five-year-old child, known as DP, by assistant priest Father Bryan Coffey. The ruling was significant because Coffey, as an assistant parish priest, was not directly employed by the church. Vicarious liability is typically used to hold employers responsible for the wrongful or negligent actions of their employees during the course of their employment, regardless of whether the employer is at fault. The Victorian courts held that Coffey was a \u201cservant of the church\u201d, despite the lack of a formal employer-employee relationship, and that his church position gave him \u201cpower and intimacy\u201d to access and abuse children. The high court rejected that ruling on Wednesday morning, finding in the church\u2019s favour, and declining to expand the concept of vicarious liability beyond employer-employee relationships. It said doing so would create uncertainty and indeterminacy. Sydney Water says it has a dedicated team working to address a mosquito outbreak in south-west Sydney. The Daily Telegraph reported that the infestation has been linked to a Warwick Farm settling pond owned by Sydney Water, and neglected pools in the area. Social media users have reported an outbreak of mozzies about the south-west, and Liverpool mayor Ned Mannoun has been providing daily updates to social media on the situation. Sydney Water said in a statement that it has taken immediate action, including herbicide spraying, larvicide deployment, helicopter spraying, and aquatic vegetation removal. Operational staff and licenced contractors have deployed boats, helicopters, excavators, and other specialised machinery to clear around half of the aquatic material contributing to mosquito breeding. These measures are starting to reduce mosquito populations around the Liverpool Water Resource Recovery Facility. Sydney Water staff are on the ground talking directly with customers in the impacted areas. It said the mosquito impact is \u201cexpected to improve significantly over the next two weeks\u201d. The former prime minister Tony Abbott has defended Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US Kevin Rudd for his now-deleted tweets about Donald Trump. Among the deleted comments, Rudd had in 2020 described Trump as \u201cthe most destructive president in history\u201d. On an episode of his podcast Australia\u2019s Future with Tony Abbott, the former PM defended Rudd and said it would be \u201cunusual for our closest ally to start being prescriptive about who can and can\u2019t be our ambassador\u201d. Sure, Rudd has said some injudicious things about the incoming president, but a lot of people have. A lot of people, including a lot of people on my side of politics here in Australia, have said I think injudicious and ill-advised [things] about president Trump. I\u2019ve always taken the view that the American president is the leader of the free world. In effect he\u2019s our president as well as the American president. And we should be careful, very careful, about public criticism of an American president \u2013 or indeed an American ex-president. Certainly, if we have to disagree let\u2019s disagree on politics rather than the personalities. Abbott also said that whatever you think of Rudd, \u201cyou couldn\u2019t say that the guy is not hyper active\u201d. I am confident that Kevin has been hyper active on our behalf as he sees it in Washington. So I would be surprised if there is any pressure from the Americans to change our ambassador. I have no reason to think that Kevin is not doing a good job at present. He will do whatever he humanly can to win over senior people in the incoming administration. And he\u2019s already done everything he humanly can to row back his previous ill-advised remarks about the incoming president. Wages data today likely to mark one year of pay rising faster than headline inflation Australia\u2019s workers should receive some good news later today with ABS data likely to show wages have risen faster than the annual headline inflation rate for four consecutive quarters. Economists are expecting the wage price index will have risen 0.9% for the September quarter alone and 3.6% from the same quarter a year ago. Compare that increase with the 0.2% gain in the headline consumer price index numbers for the quarter and 2.8% annual rise \u2013 as we saw a couple of weeks ago \u2013 and it would be a big surprise if wages were advancing at a faster clip. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, as it happens has a speech in Sydney starting about 90 minutes after the wage price index figures land at 11.30am. In the US it has been difficult for the Biden administration (and losing Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris) to get voter \u201ccut-through\u201d with real income gains. So it\u2019ll be understandable for Chalmers to talk up any positive signs of the cost of living crunch easin, with an Australian federal election looming over the next six months. (As we noted here recently, there are some indications of things improving.) Anyway, stay tuned for the numbers to land here later this morning. Wrap of commentary on US-Australia relationship this morning There\u2019s been much talk this morning about the Australia-US relationship under a second Trump presidency, and the future of Kevin Rudd\u2019s role as ambassador after his now-deleted tweets. In case you missed it: opposition leader Peter Dutton said Rudd had \u201can incredible work ethic, but he\u2019s made disparaging comments, and that\u2019s an issue for for the government to deal with\u201d. Dutton said: Following [Rudd\u2019s] term, that\u2019s an issue for the government of the day to decide who would be in that role. I think Joe Hockey, for example, did a great job when he was ambassador. Australia\u2019s former ambassador to the US Arthur Sinodinos described Trump as a \u201ctransactional figure\u201d and suggested he would be focused on the relationship going forward and \u201cit would not be a good look to just suddenly yank the ambassador out.\u201d You can read more earlier in the blog, here. As we flagged just earlier, a senior Trump adviser has posted a gif of an hourglass in response to Rudd\u2019s congratulation message to the incoming president. And as AAP reports, Anthony Albanese said he remained optimistic about the trading relationship under a Trump presidency, telling ABC Radio Sydney that he and the president-elect discussed trade in their first phone call. I pointed out the United States has a trade surplus with Australia so it\u2019s in the United States\u2019 interest that they trade fairly with Australia. The United States is a major investor here in Australia [and] that investment creates economic activity and creates jobs. \u2018Nurses and midwives are more than disappointed with this government\u2019 The NSW Nurses and Midwives Association\u2019s secretary, Shaye Candish, has spoken with ABC News Breakfast amid the strike action, which began this morning. The union has been negotiating with the state government since April, with the government not budging on a blanket 10.5% pay rise offered over three years for all NSW public-sector workers. Candish said nurses and midwives were asking for 15% and \u201cit comes at a time when Queensland and Victoria are paid at least 18% above nurses here in NSW\u201d. Nurses and midwives are more than disappointed with this government. This government committed to sit down in good faith and negotiate on pay and conditions for nurses and midwives, but has not happened \u2026 We have been bleeding nurses and midwives and that has been part of the problem. After the strike ends tomorrow morning, Candish said she hopes \u201cthe government comes to the table and finds a way to resolve this issue and put new money on the table\u201d. That is ultimately where we hope this goes but should that not be the case, our members are determined to continue undertaking action. It will not stop until we are in a situation where members can actually have parity with other states. School anti-vaping program will teach \u2018how to say no\u2019 and to recognise addiction in friends Continuing from our last post, Mark Butler said kids often vaped thinking it wasn\u2019t harmful: We know from our research is that teenagers think vaping is harmless. They think smoking\u2019s bad, and they think vaping is a relatively harmless product. \u2026 The real facts about vaping [is there are] 200 very harmful chemicals in them. But also it\u2019s a pathway to smoking \u2026 that\u2019s important. The program goes on to teach them how to say no effectively, how to recognise addiction in friends who might be addicted to vapes and to talk to them about it. It really is an important sort of socialisation about not just how to recognise risky behaviour or risky products like vapes or alcohol or drugs for that matter, but also how to go through the process of resisting peer pressure, resisting temptation, and taking the healthy choice. A new anti-vaping program for teenagers will be run in high schools across Australia next year. The health minister, Mark Butler, gave more details about the program the government in launching today on ABC Brisbane Breakfast: This is a program targeted at year seven and eight students, a really formative age as you\u2019re starting to be exposed to some of these risky behaviours, but also take decisions about whether you go into them or whether you say no. The program is a partnership with the University of Sydney who have been working with kids for years in areas of alcohol and illicit drug use and have now reshaped their program to around vaping. The launch of the program nationally comes after trialling it with about 5,000 high school students over the past year Butler said was \u201cextraordinarily positive\u201d with very high ratings from students. But also, importantly, teachers who\u2019ve been crying out for some supports, given that they were saying right across the country vaping is now the number one behavioural issue in schools, not just high schools, too in primary schools as well, increasingly, which is just terrifying. We\u2019re rolling out the programme now to all high schools in 2025. When the new academic year begins, all high schools will be able to do that. And I know they\u2019re really keen to do that because when we opened up the trial, we were just overwhelmed with high schools reaching out to these providers and saying, we want something, we want to be a part of the trial. Severe thunderstorms are expected to continue throughout eastern parts of the country today. Senior meteorologist Jonathan How from the Bureau of Meteorology said thunderstorms are forecast from northern Queensland through central parts of the state, through much of eastern and inland New South Wales, eastern Victoria and potentially parts of Tasmania. In Queensland there is the possibility of severe thunderstorms around the southeast, including the border with NSW. How said \u201cisolated very dangerous thunderstorms\u201d could occur in Brisbane and the Gold Coast. In NSW, severe thunderstorms are likely across the north-east \u2013 including the Northern Rivers and north of Lismore. A senior Trump adviser has posted a gif of an hourglass in response to Kevin Rudd\u2019s congratulation message to the incoming president. In a post to X on 7 November, Rudd \u2013 Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US \u2013 shared a statement congratulation Donald Trump on his election win. This came as he deleted comments he previously made on X about Trump, saying they did not reflect the view of the Australian government. Dan Scavino, a senior advisor to Trump, quoted the post with this gif overnight: Muswellbrook mayor says region has experienced more than 50 earthquakes in three months The mayor of Muswellbrook Shire council, Jeffrey Drayton, spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier after the town experienced a 4.1 magnitude earthquake yesterday. As Kate Lyons reported in yesterday\u2019s blog, the earthquake was the fourth event over magnitude four in three months in the NSW Hunter region \u2013 and was likely part of an \u201cearthquake swarm\u201d that has been affecting the region for several months. Drayton said the region has experienced more than 50 earthquakes in three months: There doesn\u2019t appear to be as much damage as there was with the first two earthquakes, it was a little bit smaller. It was 4.1 versus 4.9 earlier on. But certainly people felt it and it probably was felt \u2026 in a much wider area this time \u2026 The mayor also said residents are reporting to council that their insurance claims are not being accepted: There\u2019s been a number of stories, you know, stories like \u2026 we think the damage is from movement of the earth, but it\u2019s more likely blasting in the mines, so there was obviously an attempt to try and push away that liability \u2026 We\u2019ve had some examples of people in the community who are in their 70s and 80s, been paying insurance all their life and tell us they\u2019ve never, ever made a claim. You can only imagine that people expect the comfort of what insurance brings and certainly when they do need to claim, the insurance companies should be doing the right thing and making sure they accept these claims when they are reasonable and genuine. Ministers write to principals and parents associations about social media age limit The education minister, Jason Clare, and communication minister, Michelle Rowland, have written to peak principals and parents associations to quell concerns about Labor\u2019s proposed ban of social media to under-16s. The move to restrict access to social media follows the decision by education ministers last year to ban access to mobile phones in public schools, in line with OECD data indicating boosted academic performance. Clare said schools were \u201cseeing the difference\u201d from the phone ban. Ask any teacher, any principal, ask most students and they will tell you this was the right decision. And that it\u2019s making a difference. But when school finishes, students get their phone back and they\u2019re back in that social media cesspit. That\u2019s why setting a minimum age limit for social media is so important. Pat Murphy, president of the Australian Government Primary Principals Association, said more than half of his body\u2019s students in years five and six were regularly using social media sites. Our students are facing unprecedented challenges with social media influencing their self-esteem, relationships, and concentration in the classroom. With social media\u2019s constant comparisons and pressures, many primary school students feel overwhelmed, and they are not mature enough to deal effectively with these pressures. Man charged with murder of 75-year-old man A man has been charged with murder after the body of a 75-year-old man was found at Parkes at the weekend. The man\u2019s body was discovered inside a home on Alluvial Street about 1.40pm last Sunday. Officers established a crime scene and following inquiries, a 28-year-old man was arrested at a home in Tullamore \u2013 about 100km north-west of Parkes \u2013 yesterday. He was taken to Parkes Police Station where he was charged with murder. He has been refused bail to appear at Parkes Local court today. The NSW Nurses and Midwives strike has officially begun, kicking off about 45 minutes ago. You can read more about this below: ABC Melbourne Breakfast presenter Sammy J has announced he is leaving his radio show after five years. Hosting Melbourne Breakfast was an unexpected opportunity that became an unexpected joy. But radio demands all of you and deserves nothing less, and after five years I\u2019m ready to trade the 4:15 am alarm for more regular hours. Sammy farewelled listeners in his usual fashion, with a song. ABC Radio Melbourne acting manager Shelley Hadfield said Sammy had connected with the audience on 774 in a unique way: Sammy has asked the questions we never knew we wanted answered. He\u2019s grilled the Prime Minister and the Premier, he broke the news to Melbourne of the Queen\u2019s death, and he interviewed musicians, magicians, meat workers and mathematicians. Australia\u2019s biggest lender, Commonwealth Bank, has recorded a quarterly $2.5bn cash net profit backed by \u201cstrong momentum\u201d in home lending. Credit card and personal loan arrears fell slightly, despite enduring cost-of-living pressures, as consumers benefited from income tax rate changes. Home loan arrears were stable over the three-month period. The CBA chief executive, Matt Comyn, said: Growth in the Australian economy remains slow, as higher rates continue to weigh on consumer demand and bring inflation back to the target range. We remain optimistic on the overall outlook and the Australian economy remains fundamentally sound. The bank recorded growth in home loans and deposits during the quarter, helping its earnings. The September quarter result was in line with last year\u2019s corresponding period. Former US ambassador Sinodinos on second Trump presidency Australia\u2019s former ambassador to the US, Arthur Sinodinos, was on ABC RN earlier this morning to discuss the second Trump presidency. Sinodinos said Trump \u201csays what he means and means what he says\u201d and policies around tariffs and immigration are core promises of his \u2013 but Trump thinks other countries pay tariffs when in fact they\u2019re passed on to US consumers: We\u2019ll have a bit of a challenge to explain some of this to him but he\u2019s determined to do this \u2026 The big focus will be on what he tries to do with China \u2026 Complicated is one way to describe it. On the Australia-US relationship and Kevin Rudd\u2019s deleted tweets, Sinodinos said the president was a \u201ctransactional figure\u201d and he would be focused on the relationship going forward. In relation to Australia I think he has a benign view of Australia \u2026 we\u2019re a strong partner in defence, we more than pull our weight, so we\u2019re in reasonably good shape compared to other countries \u2026 It would not be a good look to just suddenly yank the ambassador out. He said Australia would have to tout its benefits to the US, rather than relying on them: I think we should always talk about the value we provide [and] our value as a middle power \u2026 the important regional groupings. We have a lot of influence, we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to use it \u2026 and we should have the ambition that goes with that. One-third of referred telco complaints unresolved A third of complaints made by telco consumers to the sector\u2019s ombudsman remained unresolved at the end of the latest reporting period, AAP reports. The figures, between July and September of 2024, found 30%, or 3,389, of complaints returned unresolved after a referral to a telco in relation to issues including poor customer service, problems with bills or equipment, and service drop outs. This followed the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman beginning a new follow-up process with consumers to get a better picture of resolutions at the end of the referral period. A total of 13,541 complaints about phone and internet services were lodged between July and September of 2024. This figure constitutes a 4.6% increase on complaints in the same period in 2023, or a total of 599 additional complaints. More than half the complaints made by customers related to no or delayed action from a telco, followed by complaints about service and equipment fees and complaints about no phone or internet service. Complaints raised in relation to failure to cancel a service, where a customer claims a telco has not terminated an agreement properly, jumped by 7% since the previous quarter. The top five local government areas with the highest number of complaints were Brisbane (426), Gold Coast (279), Moreton Bay (251), Sunshine Coast (199) and Wyndham (198). These five areas alone contributed 10% of all the complaints received in this reporting period. Albanese on social media ban: \u2018We don\u2019t pretend this is easy [or] you can just flick a switch\u2019 Anthony Albanese was also asked about moves to ban under-16s from social media, and the privacy concerns around this \u2013 will everyone need to prove they are over 18? How would this policy actually be implemented and regulated? He responded that there will be one year to develop the details, and that there would be a trial of age verification: There\u2019ll be detail in the legislation but we don\u2019t pretend this is easy [or] you can just flick a switch \u2026 Parents won\u2019t be penalised, people won\u2019t be penalised, the onus will be on these social media companies. \u2018Increasingly we\u2019re seeing \u2026 opinion reported as fact\u2019 Moving to the misinformation bill, Anthony Albanese said what is important is that \u201cthere is a distinction between fact and opinion\u201d. Increasingly we\u2019re seeing in the media things that are opinion reported as fact and that is a concern for people. The changing media landscape where everyone can be a producer as well with their device means society has to respond to that. It\u2019s not easy, the whole world is grappling with this. Albanese says Australia can play a role in US and China \u2018competition\u2019 Anthony Albanese is speaking with ABC Sydney before he leaves for South America to attend APEC and the G20 leaders\u2019 summit. Asked if he would be meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping, Albanese said the \u201cstrategic competition\u201d between the US and China is \u201csomething we\u2019re dealing with\u201d and that Australia can play a role as a middle power, because \u201cwe\u2019re trusted and our word matters\u201d. The prime minister said that during his recent call with Donald Trump after his US election win, he told him it was in the US\u2019s interest to trade with Australia and that Australia was in one of the fastest growing regions in human history. Dutton on Rudd as US ambassador: \u2018He\u2019s got an incredible work ethic, but he\u2019s made disparaging comments\u2019 Peter Dutton was also asked if ambassador Kevin Rudd would remain in his role as US ambassador under a Coalition government. This comes after Rudd deleted comments he previously made about Trump after the Republican\u2019s election win, saying they did not reflect the view of the Australian government. Dutton told ABC RN the Coalition has supported Rudd in his role as ambassador and \u201cit\u2019s important that he does work in our country\u2019s name\u201d: He\u2019s been a very effective contributor to public debate, particularly as a former prime minister is well respected, and I hope that he\u2019s able to form a relationship with the new administration, as he\u2019s done with with the current one. He\u2019s got an incredible work ethic, but he\u2019s made disparaging comments, and that\u2019s an issue for for the government to deal with. Asked if the opposition would like to see Scott Morrison in the role, Dutton said Rudd has a term to finish: Following that term, that\u2019s an issue for the government of the day to decide who would be in that role. I think Joe Hockey, for example, did a great job when he was ambassador. Peter Dutton says he supports the right of women to access legal abortion but will not (NOT) require the Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and the South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic to withdraw a sponsored bill to change abortion law. The opposition leader old ABC RN earlier that Canavan and Antic were entitled to sponsor the bill, which has been on the Senate notice paper for two years, and he would not be issuing instructions either for or against presenting it: I\u2019m not advocating that they withdraw their bill or put it forward. They as senators \u2013 as the Labor senators, the Green senators, David Pocock, the independents \u2013 have the right to put forward a private member\u2019s bill. In most cases \u2013 99% of the cases \u2013 the bill won\u2019t get forward unless it\u2019s got the support of the government. So if the government\u2019s playing games, then that\u2019s an issue for them, but for us, our senators have a right to put their own bills forward and it can be voted on on that basis. Last week, Dutton used his weekly private address to coalition MPs to urge them to show more \u201cdiscipline\u201d and stop speaking publicly about the abortion issue because it was potentially politically damaging. This morning, he offered his personal view on the issue: I support a women\u2019s right - a woman\u2019s right to choose. And I\u2019ve been in very difficult circumstances, where, as a detective working in the sex offender squad, I\u2019ve dealt with women who have been raped. I\u2019ve dealt with women in domestic relationships who have been raped. It\u2019s a very, very difficult situation, and ultimately, that\u2019s a choice and a decision for that individual to make, and that\u2019s the position I support. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers will today announce funding of $900m for states and territories through a new national productivity fund to boost competition and productivity across the economy. Launching the plan in a speech to the Australian Business Economists in Sydney, Chalmers is hoping the plan will will incentivise states to achieve productivity gains through pro-competitive policies such as streamlining commercial planning and zoning, and removing barriers to the uptake of modern construction methods. This is noteworthy, recalling Australia\u2019s competition policy in the late 90s under John Howard, paying states for microeconomic reform. The Albanese government already has payments to incentivise states to build houses \u2013 could this now extend to zoning too? Chalmers will say that the government has been \u201crevitalising national competition policy with states and territories since last December\u201d. In March this year, on behalf of the Council on Federal Financial Relations, I asked the Productivity Commission to model the potential impacts of a revitalised NCP. Its final report landed this month and the benefits on offer are substantial, if not staggering. The PC found a revitalised NCP could boost GDP by up to $45bn a year and reduce prices by 1.45 percentage points. That GDP boost represents about $5,000 per household, per year. But it reflects tough reforms and takes commitment from the Commonwealth, states and territories. On 29 November I will meet with my counterparts to kick off this work. While not every option modelled by the PC will become policy, we want to make meaningful progress where we can. I expect we\u2019ll start by fast-tracking the adoption of trusted international product safety standards and developing a general right to repair \u2013 both Commonwealth-led reforms. Both involve small implementation costs but provide significant benefits: in the order of $5bn over the next 10 years for product safety; and over $400m per annum for right to repair. Full Story podcast: the high cost of Australia\u2019s dental care divide In today\u2019s Full Story podcast, we look at why dental care in Australia is largely privatised and nearly always expensive. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, almost one in five adults delay or don\u2019t see a dentist due to cost. For those who can access the public system, staff are often overstretched and the long wait times mean crucial appointments come far too late. Guardian Australia health reporter Natasha May speaks to Reged Ahmed about how the perfect smile is a privilege increasingly available only to the wealthy: The Greens will announce a $100m a year plan to ensure public hospitals across the country will be able to provide abortion services. The party\u2019s spokesperson for women, Larissa Waters, said access to affordable abortion services should not be a \u201cpostcode lottery\u201d or \u201cculture war\u201d debate after it was raised as an issue by some in the Coalition. The Greens expect the announcement to fund hospitals who don\u2019t yet offer the services would cost around $307m to 2027-28 if it was adopted from July 2025. While the minor party cannot form government in its own right, it could influence the next federal government if it were to pick up a number of seats to form a minority government with one of the major parties. Waters said those living in rural and regional areas often had to travel far or pay for expensive private services in order to access an abortion: Reproductive healthcare must not be a culture war or a postcode lottery. No one should fall through the cracks when it comes to accessing vital healthcare ... We\u2019ve seen conservatives in Queensland, South Australia and the USA open the culture war again and it\u2019s critical Labor take this opportunity to make sure every person in the country can access the reproductive healthcare they need. The NT Country Liberal party senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price recently reopened debate at the federal level after she condemned later-term abortion, which she described as anything after the first trimester. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, told Coalition MPs earlier this month not to fuel a federal debate on abortion laws, declaring there would be no change to the opposition\u2019s policy if he wins government. Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties \u2013 thanks to Martin for kicking things off. I\u2019ll be with you through most of our rolling coverage today. See something that needs attention? You can always get in touch via X, @emilywindwrites, or you can send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Let\u2019s get started. The gambling comapny Tabcorp has been fined more than $260,000 for accepting bets during 69 tennis matches over a six-month period. Australian law prohibits bets being placed during live sport matches to limit gambling harm and the risk of match fixing. The Australian Communications and Media Authority\u2019s Carolyn Lidgerwood said she was concerned the breach \u2013 which was due to a technical error in Tabcorp\u2019s systems \u2013 was not fixed for six months. Tabcorp is a major wagering operator and it is concerning that it took some 6 months for the system error to be identified and fixed. There has been significant growth in online sports betting in recent years and it\u2019s important all online wagering services have systems in place so that illegal in-play bets are not accepted. According to the regulator, Tabcorp voided all bets, which meant consumers did not suffer losses and the company did not profit from its error. In 2021, Tabcorp escaped punishment for accepting in-play bets on a US college basketball game as it promised to fix an error that allowed them to be accepted. Australian Federal Police raided multiple locations in Melbourne\u2019s western suburbs last night as part of an investigation into alleged fraud against the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). The searches were led by the National Disability Insurance Agency\u2018s (NDIA) anti-fraud taskforce and supported by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission and other agencies. Government agencies worked to ensure the safety of NDIS participants during the operation. The NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, told Guardian Australia the raids were \u201cpart of an investigation into alleged fraudulent activity against the NDIS\u201d. I established the fraud fusion taskforce (FFT) two years ago to combat any attempts by serious criminals attempting to infiltrate the NDIS and other government support systems. The FFT has wide-reaching powers, with the taskforce now comprising 21 government agencies working together and sharing information. I have complete confidence in the FFT as they undertake this important work to tackle any serious criminal activity that comes at the expense of Australians who rely on such supports. No arrests were made during the operation and the investigation is ongoing. A two-year-old boy has died after being pulled from a dam in regional New South Wales, police have said. In a statement, NSW police said emergency services were called to a property on Pipers Flat Road, Portland in the state\u2019s central west, about 3pm on Tuesday. They were responding to reports of a concern for welfare, police said, adding that they found the child had been pulled from a dam on the property when they arrived. Police said the boy was treated at the scene by NSW Ambulance paramedics before being taken to Bathurst Hospital in a critical condition, where he later died. Police have said their inquiries into the incident continue, with a report to be prepared for the coroner. Guardian Australia understands police are not treating the boy\u2019s death as suspicious. Girls are now seeing porn for the first time at 13.6 years, on average \u2013 two years younger than they were in 2018. And more than 70% of young people say porn often shows aggression and violence towards women, a new report from Our Watch has found. Patty Kinnersly, the chief executive of Our Watch, said young people are using porn to learn about sex, and that it has been normalised with greater online access. She said: Our Watch\u2019s concern is with the representation of certain people, particularly women, rather than porn itself. It\u2019s the frequent viewing of violent porn, that is sexist and derogatory, [and] associated with a greater likelihood of men and boys holding attitudes that can lead to violence against women. Kinnersly said porn overwhelmingly shows women as submissive, and men as controlling, and that it has made the dangerous practice of choking mainstream. Research published earlier this year found almost 60% of people under 35 had been choked at least once. Parents might not realise the extent of porn use, and the extent to which the internet and porn is \u201cflooded with misogyny and hate for women, for LGBTI+\u201d and others, Kinnersly said: The line between IRL [in real life] and online is very blurry, so we can\u2019t just say certain types of porn are bad\u2026 we\u2019ve actually got to take proactive actions across the rest of a young person\u2019s life so they can critique it. Our Watch wants to see pornography literacy integrated into nation-wide education about respectful relationships, and for parents to understand the new world their children are in. The New South Wales health minister, Ryan Park, said last night he was preparing the state\u2019s hospital system to cope with today\u2019s nurses\u2019 strike. He said the industrial action \u2013 due to start at 7.30am \u2013 would mean planned surgeries being postponed and longer wait times in emergency departments. I want to assure the community that we are doing everything we can to minimise the impact of this on their care. NSW Health is working hard to ensure postponed surgeries are rescheduled as quickly as reasonably possible. I also remind the community of pathways to care for non-life-threatening conditions outside of the emergency department \u2013 by first phoning Healthdirect on 1800 022 222, where you can speak to a registered nurse about your care options \u2013 potentially avoiding an unnecessary wait in the hospital. He added that over the course of four weeks of negotiations the state government had reached agreement on all of the nurses\u2019 non-wage claims, and put forward options to fund and deliver a new increased wage offer. He claimed that the Nurses &amp; Midwives Association had previously agreed to cease industrial action contingent on the government paying nurses and midwives an interim increase while work towards a final settlement remained ongoing. But feeling among nurses has been inflamed by news that the police force have been given a 40% pay rise. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer bringing you some of the top overnight stories and then it\u2019ll be Emily Wind to take over. Nurses and midwives in New South Wales will stage a 24-hour strike from 7.30am this morning amid anger over the state government\u2019s decision to grant NSW police a 40% pay deal. Members of the NSW Nurses and Midwives\u2019 Association are calling on the Minns government to address the wage disparity that has left the state\u2019s nurses and midwives the lowest paid in the country. The NSW health minister, Ryan Park, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d about the strike. More coming up. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will today announce funding of $900m for states and territories through a new national productivity fund to boost competition and productivity across the economy. He hopes the plan will encourage states to achieve productivity gains through pro-competitive policies such as streamlining planning laws. More coming up.

      "bodyText": "In the hours since a 63-year-old man rammed his car into a sports centre in Zhuhai, killing 35 people and severely injuring 43 others, questions have swirled on Chinese social media about why it took authorities so long to reveal the details. The driver, identified by his family name of Fan, was discovered in the car with self-inflicted knife wounds to his neck. Police said their preliminary investigation suggested he was dissatisfied with the split of assets in his divorce. But little of that, or the full scale of the casualties, was known until a full day later. Immediately after the incident, the deadliest mass killing in a decade, searches about what had happened were heavily censored, videos of the scene posted to social media were deleted, and early state media reports were removed from the internet. It was only after the police released their report on Tuesday evening that news articles appeared in state media, and social media users could discuss the event more freely. \u201cThis happened yesterday, but we only found out about it today. If it happened in other places, our media might have been following the news all day long,\u201d said one Weibo user shortly after the police statement was released on Wednesday. After the details emerged, people flocked to light candles and lay flowers at a makeshift vigil outside the sports centre, the site of the apparently deliberate car attack. There was a light police presence outside the complex, which was closed until further notice, but the number of officers increased as the morning passed. After initially allowing journalists to briefly speak to the people laying the flowers, a handful of security personnel sporting light blue uniforms and caps told reporters not to talk to the people or to film specific messages on the bouquets. While police allowed people to leave bouquets of flowers in memory of the dead just outside the entrance , volunteers then quickly moved the flowers inside to the sports center. Delivery drivers on motor-bikes kept dropping off fresh flowers on Wednesday morning, even as authorities erected temporary barriers around the makeshift vigil area. People asked on social media to ask why they didn\u2019t know about the attack sooner. A 50-year-old man who identified himself as Zheng who brought flowers to the site said: \u201cThe authorities hadn\u2019t released any information \u2013 some colleagues mentioned it and I couldn\u2019t believe it at first, but it was confirmed later.\u201d \u201cIf I remember correctly, the Itaewon stampede at the end of 2022 was on the [Weibo] hot search for at least a week,\u201d said one, referring to the deadly incident in Korea. \u201cThere is an airshow in Zhuhai today, maybe they are afraid of affecting its activities,\u201d said another, referring to the People\u2019s Liberation Army airshow scheduled to begin on Tuesday.

Foreign media efforts to cover the attack were also stymied. A video report from the BBC\u2019s correspondent Stephen McDonell shows an unnamed Chinese man \u2013 who McDonell suggests is likely a local party official \u2013 yelling and trying to physically block him and his crew from filming. Monday\u2019s incident was the latest among a number of recent attacks in China in which suspects appeared to target random people, including schoolchildren. In October, a 50-year-old man was detained after he allegedly used a knife to attack children at a school in Beijing.

Monday\u2019s attack is the largest lost of life in an apparent deliberate incident since 2022, when a China Eastern pilot flew his plane into the ground killing all 132 passengers and crew on board, including himself. Analysis of the black box flight recorders by US officials \u2013 who were helping the Chinese investigation \u2013 suggested the pilot had forced the Boeing 737-800 plane into its catastrophic dive. But in more than two years Chinese authorities have never released a final report. Under the increasing authoritarianism of China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, the release of negative news and information has become particularly fraught, with frequent punishment of officials and media outlets. During the pandemic, key information about the initial outbreak was not reported to global health authorities. Citizen journalists were arrested for reporting from Wuhan, and in subsequent years there was high skepticism over China\u2019s infection figures. When a massive outbreak came in 2022 after Covid-19 restrictions were abruptly dropped, authorities stopped reporting cremation figures. With Associated Press and Reuters",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m a 27-year-old woman. Each of my relationships starts out with a new, exciting honeymoon stage, which eventually gives way to me not caring about sex. Life gets in the way, with the kids and family problems, but why am I never, ever aroused like before? I have a recent disability that causes me pain, which isn\u2019t helping the situation with my current partner. But I\u2019m at the point where I think there\u2019s something wrong internally, such as hormonal issues. I\u2019m only 27, so getting a professional to check this out is nearly impossible. Pain will certainly diminish sexual desire, so at the moment it is not surprising that you do not feel desirous or have difficulty becoming aroused or achieving orgasm. There are some strategies for managing the pain in order to try to enjoy sex, such as using heat pads, or timing sex for those moments when your medication is working most efficiently. If you suspect there is something physiologically wrong, then do have a check-up, as your experience may or may not be related to your disability. And do not underestimate the role of family life \u2013 children, ageing parents, financial stress and lack of privacy are all likely culprits, so plan time for sex when you have arranged childcare and take steps to eliminate any other stressors. Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments). Each week, Pamela chooses one problem to answer, which will be published online. She regrets that she cannot enter into personal correspondence. Submissions are subject to our terms and conditions.",

Sen Const Kristian James Samuel White is on trial accused of the manslaughter of Clare Nowland, who died in May 2023 after being tasered. White has pleaded not guilty. Appearing as a witness on Wednesday, the registered nurse Rosaline Baker told the court she had questioned why police were attending the rest home, and at first thought the Taser was a torch. \u201cIn my years of experience as a nurse, almost 50 years, I\u2019ve never seen anything like that,\u201d Baker told the New South Wales supreme court. \u201cI was very, very concerned when she was falling to the ground.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email White tasered the great-grandmother \u2013 who moved with the aid of a walking frame and weighed 47.5kg \u2013 in a Snowy Mountains nursing home in May 2023 after repeated requests for her to put down a steak knife. Nowland had been carrying the serrated steak knife in one hand and was supporting herself on her walker with the other hand when White discharged the Taser to disarm her. Nowland died a week later from a head injury caused by being tasered, the court has heard. White\u2019s barrister, Troy Edwards SC, has told the court it is not in dispute that the injuries caused by White tasering Nowland ultimately killed her. But he argued that White\u2019s use of the Taser involved a reasonable use of force. The prosecutor, Brett Hatfield SC, has argued that White was guilty of manslaughter by way of criminal negligence or by way of an unlawful and dangerous act. Prof Susan Kurrle, a geriatrician who appeared as a witness on Wednesday, told the court that Nowland displayed behaviour consistent with moderate to severe dementia. She said it had impeded her ability \u201cto understand what was happening to her and to comply with instructions\u201d. The court heard Nowland had made several attempts to escape the aged care home and there were incidents where she was agitated, aggressive, refused assistance from staff, wandered and disturbed other people. The jury was shown CCTV of Nowland climbing into a tree and becoming stuck. Footage also showed her ramming a staff member with her walker. Kurrle told the court these instances were increasing ahead of the night she was tasered. \u201cIt is clearly in the three months before her death that the behaviours changed fairly dramatically,\u201d Kurrle said. When cross-examined by White\u2019s barrister, the geriatrician said Nowland\u2019s medication had been reduced. Kurrle agreed when asked if Nowland\u2019s increased aggressive behaviour could have been caused by the reduced dosage. Kurrle also agreed under cross-examination that, given her behaviour, it would have been appropriate for Nowland to have been in a dementia-specific unit. The Yallambee Lodge nursing home in Cooma, however, did not have one. The court heard that people with dementia could show increased strength when they were upset or angry. Baker was one of three staff working the evening Nowland was Tasered. Baker told the court she was responding to a call for help from another resident at about 3am when she found Nowland \u201cmoving slowly\u201d in the corridor with her walker. She was holding two steak knives and a jug of prunes. \u201cI just greeted her and asked her if she needed any help,\u201d Baker told the court. Baker detailed how on multiple occasions she tried to coax Nowland, who began wandering into residents\u2019 rooms and around the facility, to hand over the knives. Baker tried to call Nowland\u2019s daughter for support and, after she was unable to reach her, she called triple 0 to request an ambulance. \u201cThe officer told me that the police was coming and I actually inquired \u2018why them\u2019 \u2026 the police officer said \u2018you said she had a knife, that\u2019s why they are also coming to assist with the ambulance officers\u2019,\u201d Baker told the court. Baker said she had told police that when she asked Nowland to hand over the knives she had pointed it at her. The trial, before Justice Ian Harrison, continues.",

Suspected vote-tampering in Melbourne council elections | The Victorian Electoral Commission said it had referred allegations to police after it detected a high number of multiple returned postal votes in Knox and Whittlesea councils after voting closed in local government elections last month.

Aboriginal organisations across NSW are calling for urgent and meaningful reforms to the child protection system, urging that leadership of these vital changes be transferred from government control to the hands of Aboriginal communities. The review, undertaken by the state\u2019s Aboriginal child, family and community peak organisation AbSec, the Aboriginal Legal Service, UTS Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education and the Justice and Equity Centre found that Aboriginal children are almost 12 times more likely to be placed in out-of-home care than their non-Aboriginal peers, an increase from 9.5 times in 2017-18. The organisations are calling for NSW to appoint an independent child protection commission and a commissioner for Aboriginal children and young people to hold the government to account. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cWe envision a future where our communities are empowered to keep our children safe and cared for \u2013 where they grow up connected to their cultures, on Country, and surrounded by love and support,\u201d John Leha, the CEO of AbSec, said. \u201cThis is our call to action for true self-determination, accountability, and meaningful partnership \u2013 because the wellbeing of our children is at stake,\u201d Leha said. Karly Warner, the CEO of the Aboriginal Legal Service (NSW/ACT), said the government had five years to take action but had failed to do so. \u201cFive years is an eternity in the life of a child. The past five years presented countless opportunities to take decisive action and protect Aboriginal children from the trauma and lifelong harm of being torn away from their families, but the NSW government has willingly let another generation fall victim to bureaucratic inertia,\u201d Warner said. Dr Paul Gray from UTS Jumbunna Institute said urgent action was needed. \u201cBusiness as usual, or small tweaks at the margins, will not deliver the transformative change that children and families need,\u201d he said. The NSW families minister, Kate Washington, was approached for comment. The 2019 Family is Culture report was a three-year study of the case files of 1,144 Aboriginal children who entered the NSW out-of-home care system between 2015 and 2016. The review found children who did not appear to be at risk of harm were removed from their families, the children\u2019s court was misinformed about vitally important information, and in some cases \u201cthe location of young people under the care and protection of the minister was unknown\u201d. The review, led by the University of NSW law professor Megan Davis, said the system lacked transparency, had no effective regulator and its reforms were regularly devised and implemented with little or no genuine consultation with the Aboriginal community. Davis found \u201cwidespread noncompliance\u201d with law and policy by caseworkers and managers, many of whom routinely ignored the requirement to consult regularly with Aboriginal families and communities, and routinely chose removal over other, less intrusive, options. Disturbingly, in almost a quarter of cases, Aboriginal babies were taken at birth or from the hospital soon after, and almost a fifth were in the system before they were six months old.",

The nurses and midwives union had asked for an immediate 15% wage increase, citing higher rates of pay in other states and the cost-of-living crisis. The union rejected an offer for the 15% increase to be delivered over multiple years and to deliver a slightly larger boost for early career nurses, the NSW health minister, Ryan Park, said. But the union said the government had not entered negotiations willing to use extra money to fund pay increases. Park said he was disappointed the union walked away from its commitment to negotiate before the Industrial Relations Commission. \u201cWe honoured our end of the bargain \u2026 there was an expectation, though, that this industrial action was not going to take place,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday.

Candish said nurses and midwives have been leaving NSW for better pay elsewhere, amid struggles to \u201cput food on the table\u201d. Candish said many were \u201cinfuriated\u201d by the Minns government\u2019s refusal to budge on its offer to the \u201cbiggest female-dominated workforce\u201d in the country, describing it as \u201cvery clearly gendered\u201d. \u201cWe cannot get the government to sit down and negotiate with us meaningfully,\u201d she said. \u201cMeanwhile, we\u2019ve got paramedics, firies and police able to sit down and negotiate with the government \u2026 There\u2019s very clear difference in how the gendered workforces are being treated.\u201d The statewide strike, the third major stop-work action from the union under the current Labor government, was estimated to force the postponement of 600 to 700 surgeries, according to NSW Health. Rallies were also planned for Sydney and in regional centres including Armidale, Broken Hill, Coffs Harbour, Crookwell, Moruya, Lismore, Port Macquarie, Taree and Tweed.

Minimal, life-preserving staffing were being maintained in all public hospitals and health services during the 24-hour strike. Members are calling on the Minns government to address the wage disparity that has left NSW nurses and midwives the lowest paid in the country. When pressed on the issue by reporters, the premier, Chris Minns, repeatedly pointed to the government\u2019s election promise of improving nurse-to-patient ratios, saying the union had not brought up wage increases before the election. \u201cWhen we spoke to nurses and their association, they said to us \u2026 our number one priority is ratios, and that was a billion-dollar promise.\u201d He said the NSWNMA was \u201cnot prepared to make changes\u201d like other unions across the state, leaving his government with \u201cless to play with\u201d.

In a letter \u2013 signed by more than 20 community and national environment groups \u2013 to the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, and senior ministers, the Sydney Basin Koala Network accused the government of a \u201cdevelopment first, koalas later\u201d mindset that was accelerating the species\u2019 decline. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The network said koala deaths from vehicle strikes on Appin Road, which links Campbelltown and Sydney\u2019s western suburbs with Wollongong, had increased from 11 in 2022 to 19 so far in 2024, based on data from the government database BioNet. The rise follows the start of clearing for major housing developments in Gilead and Appin. About 70,000 houses are planned for construction in south-western Sydney in coming decades as the state government works to increase housing supply and ease affordability pressures. But the area is also home to some of Sydney\u2019s healthiest koala populations and advocates want the government to ensure the most important habitat is protected. At least 207 koalas have been struck by vehicles across south-western Sydney since 2021, according to the groups\u2019 analysis. They want protection and restoration of koala habitat corridors, construction of five underpasses on Appin Road and changes to the state\u2019s planning system that would require councils to protect koala habitat from clearing and development. Stephanie Carrick, a project manager at the Sydney Basin Koala Network, said: \u201cWe\u2019re not opposed to housing. Koalas are also facing a housing crisis and we need their homes protected too by protecting their important migratory corridors and allowing them to safely travel through the landscape.\u201d Jeff Angel, the director of the Total Environment Centre, said developers were knocking down habitat, resulting in koalas running away and \u201cbeing run over and killed on the roads\u201d. \u201cPeople are having to rescue koalas or are finding them dead on the road,\u201d he said. The letter to the government notes an \u201calarming\u201d increase in female and joey deaths and said the road deaths were \u201chaving a significant impact on this important chlamydia free population\u201d. \u201cThey cannot, over time, sustain this level of population decline,\u201d the letter says. Carrick said the Minns government had been in power long enough to start acting on its commitments to improve koala protections. A parliamentary inquiry in 2020 found the species was on track for extinction in the state by 2050. Carrick said that while development of housing had begun along Appin Road, the single underpass that was planned for koalas moving between habitat on either side of the road near Gilead had not been built yet. Two further underpasses are proposed in other areas of Appin Road. The network wants five underpasses for koalas, including one at Mallaty Creek, an area the government has proposed fencing out koalas. Environment groups want the Mallaty Creek habitat corridor preserved as it provides one of the most direct corridors from the Georges River to the Nepean River. Saul Deane from Save Sydney\u2019s Koalas said the plan to fence koalas out of the area was \u201cinexplicable\u201d. A Transport for NSW spokesperson acknowledged koala deaths on Appin Road were a \u201cgrowing issue\u201d. \u201c[The agency] is looking at options to change driver behaviour and increase awareness including improved static and visual messaging signs, and road markings indicating koalas in the area,\u201d the spokesperson said. The issue is being addressed by three projects, they said, which will deliver continuous koala exclusion fencing between Rosemeadow and Appin township. \u201cThis work will also include three koala underpasses at Noorumba Reserve, Beulah biobank site and Ousedale Creek.\u201d The remaining two safety projects around Mount Gilead are in the planning stage and construction is expected to start next year.",

      "body": "<p>On the evening of 15 March 2022, Lucille and Dave Strachan had supper in their north Wales home, watched their favourite TV show, Dogs Behaving (Very) Badly, then went upstairs to bed. Apart from one bout of food poisoning in the 1970s, Dave had never been ill before. But at about 11.20pm he woke up and told Lucille he had chest pains and difficulty breathing.</p> <p>Lucille called their daughter Hilary, a doctor, before dialling 999 and asking for an ambulance. Was Dave breathing, the call operator asked. Yes, but he has chest pains and he\u2019s cold, said Lucille. The call operator asked her to monitor Dave, to tell them every time he took a breath, information which was then fed into a computer.</p> <p>Lucille was told the ambulance would take about four hours to arrive. \u201cI thought: \u2018I\u2019m not going to wait four hours!\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cSo I rang my 86-year-old neighbour, Gareth the farmer.\u201d It was past midnight now, but Gareth came immediately with his son Tudor and daughter-in-law Nia. If they could just get Dave downstairs and into the car, thought Lucille, she could drive him to hospital herself. But looking at the steep stairs inside and the slate steps and darkness outside, while considering Dave\u2019s height \u2013 6ft 2in \u2013 they decided they couldn\u2019t manage. They would wait.</p> <p>The neighbours stayed and Tudor headed into the lane outside with a torch so the ambulance could see which way to come. When he saw blue lights flashing in the valley below he thought: \u201cHere it is.\u201d But the ambulance carried on along the valley road to the nearby nursing home. \u201cThen it left without the blue lights going, which didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d says Lucille. \u201cIt obviously wasn\u2019t transporting a person, otherwise they would have had the lights on the way back as well.\u201d</p> <p>Lucille kept phoning the emergency services about the ambulance. At about 4.30am \u2013 almost five hours after she had first called \u2013 she sent the neighbours home. There was nothing much they could do and they had work the next day. She waited alone with Dave for a few more hours, while he drifted in and out of consciousness, rambling about physics. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what he was saying, except when he said he was cold and I put some more blankets on him.\u201d</p> <p>She and Dave had been together for 52 years and were both 76. After Dave retired from his job as an engineer for Shell and Lucille from hers as a French teacher, they would get in their motorhome every year and head off to Italy for holidays. They loved their motorhome. Lucille remembers one evening when they were both reading in bed: \u201cI had my motorhome magazine and there was this letter from a man who was 90 and still driving his. I said to Dave: \u2018Do you think that\u2019ll be us, will we still be doing that when we\u2019re 90?\u2019 And he said: \u2018Well, I jolly well hope so.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Dave would have been reading something more intellectual than a motorhome magazine, Lucille says. \u201cHe loved anything to do with history, and mysticism, but also crime stories.\u201d And computing; Dave built his own computers.</p>    <p>Just before 7am, after a wait of more than seven hours, an ambulance finally pulled up to the gate. \u201cI thought: \u2018Thank God.\u2019\u201d says Lucille. Their decorator Paul, who had turned up earlier, rushed out and told the two paramedics to hurry because Dave was really ill. \u201cBut before the two men got out of the ambulance, another call came in and they said: \u2018We\u2019ve got to go.\u2019 I said: \u2018What do you mean, you\u2019ve got to go?\u2019 They said: \u2018Because we haven\u2019t put our foot out of the cab, we have to obey orders and go to another case.\u2019 I said: \u2018Dave is really ill.\u2019 They were embarrassed. One of them said: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, this is a red call.\u2019 I said, \u2018What\u2019s a red call?\u2019 He said, \u2018It\u2019s when they\u2019ve stopped breathing.\u2019 I said to him: \u2018I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t lie and say Dave had stopped breathing.\u2019 They turned the ambulance around and drove off.\u201d</p> <p>Lucille didn\u2019t know about the <a href=\"https://111.wales.nhs.uk/localservices/informationinotherlanguages/LSInfoOtherLanguagePage10#:~:text=Red%20calls%20are%20things%20like,Not%20serious%20or%20life%2Dthreatening\">colour codes in Wales for prioritising cases</a>. \u201cBecause there was such a backup of cases and ambulances, Dave had been triaged down from red to amber.\u201d Red denotes an immediately life-threatening situation. In those cases, they try to reach the patient within eight minutes. Amber is still life-threatening or serious, but there\u2019s no target response time in Wales apart from \u201cas soon as we can\u201d.</p> <p>The wait continued. Paul drove to Manchester to pick up the Strachans\u2019 other daughter, Fiona. Hilary was getting a lift to their home. Because the house is on a steep hill, the valley below is visible, and some time later Lucille was relieved to see another ambulance starting up the road to them. Then that one turned back too.</p> <p>\u201cThey decided it was the wrong hill,\u201d she says, \u201cit was too steep.\u201d It is a steep hill, although not too steep for the previous ambulance, or for the Strachan\u2019s motorhome, for Tesco deliveries, or for the ambulance when it eventually made it up. But first it went off down the A5 towards Corwen, then doubled back and into Llangollen, and then it was driven up an old drover\u2019s road, which really is too steep. The people in the ambulance were lost, probably because they weren\u2019t local, they\u2019d come from the other side of the Berwyn mountains. (Although at this point I\u2019m going to say I travelled from London and got to the house no trouble, I just went where my phone told me to.)</p> <p>Eventually, at 9.10am, nine hours and 52 minutes after Lucille\u2019s first call, the ambulance arrived. The two paramedics went upstairs, assessed Dave, said he was very ill, and got him down in a wheelchair. They told Lucille they would take him to Glan Clwyd \u2013 which is not the nearest hospital, but has a coronary care unit. Then they asked her for directions. Lucille wanted to go with them, but they said no. She thinks perhaps they thought they might have to perform CPR on Dave during the journey.</p> <p>Dave had an oxygen mask on and had come round. He gave Lucille a thumbs up and a big smile. \u201cI thought: \u2018Oh good. It\u2019s going to be all right.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>It is no secret the NHS is facing huge, even existential challenges. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/sep/11/darzi-review-says-the-nhs-is-in-a-critical-condition-but-sets-out-a-treatment-plan\">Lord Darzi\u2019s report</a>, published in September, found it to be in a critical condition and hardly a day goes by without a headline containing words such as crisis and broken. See also: underfunding, underinvestment, staff shortages, burn out, outdated buildings, computer problems, cancellations and backlogs. Plus, an awful lot of waiting. Waiting for GP appointments, waiting on the phone, waiting for mental health care, waiting in A&amp;E, waiting to get in to hospital, waiting to get out of hospital, waiting to get on a waiting list. The <a href=\"https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/nhs-delivery-and-workforce/pressures/nhs-backlog-data-analysis\">latest Referral to Treatment (RTT) figures</a>, just for England, show a waiting list of 7.64m cases, made up of 6.33 million individual patients. Of those, 3.19 million people have been waiting for more than 18 weeks and 282,700 have been waiting for more than a year.</p> <p>A lot of people, like Dave, have had to wait for an ambulance. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clynn73ydd2o?at_campaign_type=owned&amp;at_link_id=73B9BC2E-560F-11EF-82EE-973635DA1B7C&amp;at_link_origin=BBCWalesNews&amp;at_link_type=web_link&amp;at_medium=social&amp;at_bbc_team=editorial&amp;at_ptr_name=twitter&amp;at_campaign=Social_Flow&amp;at_format=link\">One patient in Wales waited 46 hours and 46 minutes</a> after a fall.

This included people who had been in accidents, and victims of strokes and heart attacks.</p> <p>In August, the head of the ambulance service in Wales said the <a href=\"https://jcc.nhs.wales/the-committee/committee-papers/september-2024/422-appendix-2-ambulance-performance-report/\">number of hours lost because crews were waiting to hand over patients had quadrupled since 2018</a>. Handovers \u2013 the time it takes for a patient arriving by ambulance to be handed into the care of A&amp;E staff \u2013 are regarded as a key indicator of a system under pressure, <a href=\"https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/resource/ambulance-handover-delays\">according to the Nuffield Trust</a>, as delays occur \u201cas a result of a mismatch between A&amp;E/hospital capacity and the number of elective or emergency patients arriving.\u201d An A&amp;E full to bursting causes queues \u2013 and a lack of social care means people have to stay in hospital beds even when they might be physically well enough to go home. Not unlike coronary circulation itself, it is all interconnected; a decrease in flow or a blockage here leads to failure or arrest there.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Some time after Dave was driven away, Lucille and her daughters Fiona and Hilary \u2013 who had now reached their parents\u2019 home \u2013 got a call from the hospital. They were told that Dave had arrived, was being looked after and that they should wait. Half an hour later, another call. Lucille needed to come immediately. \u201cI knew straight away it was too late.\u201d</p> <p>Paul drove them the 35 miles over the Horseshoe Pass to Glan Clwyd hospital. \u201cThe doctor,\u201d says Lucille, \u201cDr Das, he was amazing. He took us into a side room and explained \u2026\u201d</p>    <p>Fiona is sitting with us today, and she helps her mum out, taking over. \u201cHe said they\u2019d tried to stabilise him so that they could operate, but he was struggling to breathe, he was just too ill. So he said he\u2019d given him some morphine to make him comfortable and held his hand as he passed over. He was such a nice man, it\u2019s comforting to know Dad was with someone so kind.\u201d</p> <p>Dave died of acute myocardial infarction and coronary artery atheroma. A heart attack in lay terms, although that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. At the inquest last year, the coroner concluded that, \u201cThe time it took for an ambulance to be dispatched and arrive and convey him to hospital meant that there was a missed opportunity to have probable life-saving medical treatment.\u201d In other words, he probably should be alive today. Fiona says Dr Das seemed frustrated when he gave evidence at the inquest, saying if Dave had got to hospital within two hours, \u201cthere\u2019s every chance he would still be here\u201d.</p> <p>After Dave\u2019s inquest, the coroner wrote a Report to Prevent Future Deaths, copies of which were sent to both the Welsh Ambulance NHS Trust and the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which provides NHS services in north Wales. The report highlighted areas of concern and two reasons for the delay were given.</p> <p>First was that, \u201cAll available resources were managing incidents of a higher acuity or the same category but registered prior.\u201d Red calls, in other words, or amber calls that were made before Lucille first dialled 999. Lucille questions the whole process of calls being categorised and prioritised. \u201cYou\u2019re asking a traumatised wife with no medical training to talk to a medically unqualified call handler with a computer algorithm and a script, and that decides whether he lives or dies. That\u2019s basically it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>The other reason why it took so long for Dave\u2019s ambulance to come, wrote the coroner, was that \u201cthere were significant handover delays across all Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board sites.\u201d If an ambulance crew is unable to hand over a patient at the hospital, it can\u2019t go and pick up the next one. \u201cDeaths are occurring and will continue to occur as a result of delayed ambulance attendances caused by these multifactorial issues.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The NHS is in the blood of Lucille\u2019s family. One daughter is a hospital consultant; Lucille\u2019s mother was a district nurse in Wales, with stories of battling across snowy moors to deliver babies. An uncle was a mental health nurse. \u201cI still think of the NHS as one of our treasures,\u201d she says, \u201cone of the jewels in the crown in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Does she feel differently about it since Dave\u2019s death? \u201cI still think it\u2019s a wonderful system. In this country, you have the luxury of knowing that your illness will be looked after and you won\u2019t be made bankrupt, you won\u2019t have to sell your house. In the US, it\u2019s very different.\u201d</p> <p>Lucille makes it clear she doesn\u2019t blame anybody personally. At the end of the inquest, one of the paramedics spoke to her. \u201cA junior ambulance lady, who hadn\u2019t been there for very long, came over and said: \u2018I want to apologise, I\u2019ve been having sleepless nights about this.\u2019 I said: \u2018Well, you can stop that right now, Dave would not want that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Nor does she blame anyone at the hospital Dave was taken to. \u201cThere was a highly trained specialist waiting in an operating theatre, and the theatre staff, all waiting for him, but he couldn\u2019t get there. It\u2019s the system and the organisation that\u2019s at fault.\u201d She criticises people who go to A&amp;E when it\u2019s unnecessary. \u201cIt\u2019s accident and emergency, not you\u2019ve had a little bit too much to drink, come and clog up the system.\u201d Plus the lack of social care places. \u201cThere are too many people in hospital who don\u2019t need to be there.\u201d Responding to the coroner in north Wales, the health board reported that, at the time of Dave\u2019s death, a third of its beds were occupied by people waiting to be discharged from hospital.</p> <p>Lucille shows me pictures of Dave. He is wearing a cap and looking mischievous. Dave could never be serious for photos. \u201cHe was very witty, cheerful, respected and \u2026 yeah, loved by everybody. I sound boring, don\u2019t I? But he was just a lovely man, my other half.\u201d After Dave died, Lucille felt \u201cnumb for about a year\u201d and she still hasn\u2019t got used to life without him. \u201cIt feels as if he\u2019s on a business trip, and he\u2019s going to come through the door at any minute and say: \u2018I\u2019m back.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Fiona is helping her pack up the house, so she can move into a smaller place down in Llangollen. Lucille says the motorhome has already gone. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go on my own.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "On the evening of 15 March 2022, Lucille and Dave Strachan had supper in their north Wales home, watched their favourite TV show, Dogs Behaving (Very) Badly, then went upstairs to bed. Apart from one bout of food poisoning in the 1970s, Dave had never been ill before. But at about 11.20pm he woke up and told Lucille he had chest pains and difficulty breathing. Lucille called their daughter Hilary, a doctor, before dialling 999 and asking for an ambulance. Was Dave breathing, the call operator asked. Yes, but he has chest pains and he\u2019s cold, said Lucille. The call operator asked her to monitor Dave, to tell them every time he took a breath, information which was then fed into a computer. Lucille was told the ambulance would take about four hours to arrive. \u201cI thought: \u2018I\u2019m not going to wait four hours!\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cSo I rang my 86-year-old neighbour, Gareth the farmer.\u201d It was past midnight now, but Gareth came immediately with his son Tudor and daughter-in-law Nia. If they could just get Dave downstairs and into the car, thought Lucille, she could drive him to hospital herself. But looking at the steep stairs inside and the slate steps and darkness outside, while considering Dave\u2019s height \u2013 6ft 2in \u2013 they decided they couldn\u2019t manage. They would wait. The neighbours stayed and Tudor headed into the lane outside with a torch so the ambulance could see which way to come. When he saw blue lights flashing in the valley below he thought: \u201cHere it is.\u201d But the ambulance carried on along the valley road to the nearby nursing home. \u201cThen it left without the blue lights going, which didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d says Lucille. \u201cIt obviously wasn\u2019t transporting a person, otherwise they would have had the lights on the way back as well.\u201d Lucille kept phoning the emergency services about the ambulance. At about 4.30am \u2013 almost five hours after she had first called \u2013 she sent the neighbours home. There was nothing much they could do and they had work the next day. She waited alone with Dave for a few more hours, while he drifted in and out of consciousness, rambling about physics. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what he was saying, except when he said he was cold and I put some more blankets on him.\u201d She and Dave had been together for 52 years and were both 76. After Dave retired from his job as an engineer for Shell and Lucille from hers as a French teacher, they would get in their motorhome every year and head off to Italy for holidays. They loved their motorhome. Lucille remembers one evening when they were both reading in bed: \u201cI had my motorhome magazine and there was this letter from a man who was 90 and still driving his. I said to Dave: \u2018Do you think that\u2019ll be us, will we still be doing that when we\u2019re 90?\u2019 And he said: \u2018Well, I jolly well hope so.\u2019\u201d Dave would have been reading something more intellectual than a motorhome magazine, Lucille says. \u201cHe loved anything to do with history, and mysticism, but also crime stories.\u201d And computing; Dave built his own computers. Just before 7am, after a wait of more than seven hours, an ambulance finally pulled up to the gate. \u201cI thought: \u2018Thank God.\u2019\u201d says Lucille. Their decorator Paul, who had turned up earlier, rushed out and told the two paramedics to hurry because Dave was really ill. \u201cBut before the two men got out of the ambulance, another call came in and they said: \u2018We\u2019ve got to go.\u2019 I said: \u2018What do you mean, you\u2019ve got to go?\u2019 They said: \u2018Because we haven\u2019t put our foot out of the cab, we have to obey orders and go to another case.\u2019 I said: \u2018Dave is really ill.\u2019 They were embarrassed. One of them said: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, this is a red call.\u2019 I said, \u2018What\u2019s a red call?\u2019 He said, \u2018It\u2019s when they\u2019ve stopped breathing.\u2019 I said to him: \u2018I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t lie and say Dave had stopped breathing.\u2019 They turned the ambulance around and drove off.\u201d Lucille didn\u2019t know about the colour codes in Wales for prioritising cases. \u201cBecause there was such a backup of cases and ambulances, Dave had been triaged down from red to amber.\u201d Red denotes an immediately life-threatening situation. In those cases, they try to reach the patient within eight minutes. Amber is still life-threatening or serious, but there\u2019s no target response time in Wales apart from \u201cas soon as we can\u201d. The wait continued. Paul drove to Manchester to pick up the Strachans\u2019 other daughter, Fiona. Hilary was getting a lift to their home. Because the house is on a steep hill, the valley below is visible, and some time later Lucille was relieved to see another ambulance starting up the road to them. Then that one turned back too. \u201cThey decided it was the wrong hill,\u201d she says, \u201cit was too steep.\u201d It is a steep hill, although not too steep for the previous ambulance, or for the Strachan\u2019s motorhome, for Tesco deliveries, or for the ambulance when it eventually made it up. But first it went off down the A5 towards Corwen, then doubled back and into Llangollen, and then it was driven up an old drover\u2019s road, which really is too steep. The people in the ambulance were lost, probably because they weren\u2019t local, they\u2019d come from the other side of the Berwyn mountains. (Although at this point I\u2019m going to say I travelled from London and got to the house no trouble, I just went where my phone told me to.) Eventually, at 9.10am, nine hours and 52 minutes after Lucille\u2019s first call, the ambulance arrived. The two paramedics went upstairs, assessed Dave, said he was very ill, and got him down in a wheelchair. They told Lucille they would take him to Glan Clwyd \u2013 which is not the nearest hospital, but has a coronary care unit. Then they asked her for directions. Lucille wanted to go with them, but they said no. She thinks perhaps they thought they might have to perform CPR on Dave during the journey. Dave had an oxygen mask on and had come round. He gave Lucille a thumbs up and a big smile. \u201cI thought: \u2018Oh good. It\u2019s going to be all right.\u2019\u201d *** It is no secret the NHS is facing huge, even existential challenges. Lord Darzi\u2019s report, published in September, found it to be in a critical condition and hardly a day goes by without a headline containing words such as crisis and broken. See also: underfunding, underinvestment, staff shortages, burn out, outdated buildings, computer problems, cancellations and backlogs. Plus, an awful lot of waiting. Waiting for GP appointments, waiting on the phone, waiting for mental health care, waiting in A&amp;E, waiting to get in to hospital, waiting to get out of hospital, waiting to get on a waiting list. The latest Referral to Treatment (RTT) figures, just for England, show a waiting list of 7.64m cases, made up of 6.33 million individual patients. Of those, 3.19 million people have been waiting for more than 18 weeks and 282,700 have been waiting for more than a year. A lot of people, like Dave, have had to wait for an ambulance. One patient in Wales waited 46 hours and 46 minutes after a fall. Ambulance response times vary across the UK. In England they rose sharply in September, and emergency care performance is also down, as the NHS heads into a difficult winter. A Guardian investigation found that, in 2022, the year Dave Strachan spent nine hours and 52 minutes waiting for an ambulance, more than 500 patients in England died after a delayed ambulance response. This included people who had been in accidents, and victims of strokes and heart attacks. In August, the head of the ambulance service in Wales said the number of hours lost because crews were waiting to hand over patients had quadrupled since 2018. Handovers \u2013 the time it takes for a patient arriving by ambulance to be handed into the care of A&amp;E staff \u2013 are regarded as a key indicator of a system under pressure, according to the Nuffield Trust, as delays occur \u201cas a result of a mismatch between A&amp;E/hospital capacity and the number of elective or emergency patients arriving.\u201d An A&amp;E full to bursting causes queues \u2013 and a lack of social care means people have to stay in hospital beds even when they might be physically well enough to go home. Not unlike coronary circulation itself, it is all interconnected; a decrease in flow or a blockage here leads to failure or arrest there. *** Some time after Dave was driven away, Lucille and her daughters Fiona and Hilary \u2013 who had now reached their parents\u2019 home \u2013 got a call from the hospital.

In a document seen by the Guardian, party officials said officers from West Midlands police left the count on polling day before Mahmood, a close ally of Keir Starmer, and members of her family were barracked by political opponents in the seat of Birmingham Ladywood. The alleged incidents happened amid a tense campaign between Mahmood and Akhmed Yakoob, the solicitor who campaigned primarily against Labour\u2019s policies on Israel-Palestine. Officers declined on three occasions to intervene after intimidation of Mahmood\u2019s canvassers by supporters of Yakoob, the submission to the Electoral Commission said. It is also claimed that a Labour canvasser who was a black woman was told by a Yakoob supporter she should not be in a mainly Asian area because the residents were \u201cnot her people\u201d. The document, written by Labour officials in Mahmood\u2019s constituency, paints a picture of seven tense confrontations with political opponents in the central Birmingham constituency in the weeks leading up to 4 July, particularly in areas dominated by communities of Pakistani and Kashmiri descent. It comes as a report from the Electoral Commission released on Wednesday found that more than half of candidates (55%) in the general election and the May local elections said they were abused or intimidated during the election campaign, with women and ethnic minorities particularly targeted. On Tuesday 25 June, it is alleged in the document that Shabana\u2019s father, Mahmood Ahmed, was one of a group of canvassers who called the police after being verbally abused by a supporter of Yakoob. \u201cWhen police officers arrived some time later, rather than addressing the individual who had been harassing the activists, they attempted to disperse everyone from the street,\u201d the document compiled by the constituency party claims.

Yakoob, 37, a criminal defence lawyer with a large social media following, is facing an investigation from the Solicitors Regulation Authority after he used social media to promote a false claim of racism against a young teacher. The probe was triggered by a video promoted by Yakoob to his thousands of followers on TikTok, Facebook, X, formerly Twitter, and other platforms. He has previously shared videos in support of Andrew Tate, the influencer awaiting charges of trafficking and rape in Romania. In a podcast aired in March, Yakoob said: \u201cEveryone has got a role in society, everyone has got a role in the household. In my household, I\u2019m the man, I\u2019m the king. \u201cIt\u2019s natural for men to be attracted to females, so keep our queens at home.\u201d Yakoob has been approached for a comment. Mahmood regained the seat but saw her 28,000 majority cut to about 3,000. A spokesperson for West Midlands police said the force was aware of \u201ca number of allegations\u201d relating to the general election. \u201cA number of the matters were dealt with during the campaign, with people being spoken to at the time and crimes recorded and investigated where appropriate,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cOther matters are the subject of an ongoing review involving other agencies and enquiries continue. \u201cThroughout the campaign, our priority was to ensure public safety and the integrity of the democratic process. \u201cWe were in touch with candidates throughout the run-up to the election.\u201d A spokesperson for the Electoral Commission said there was \u201cunacceptable abuse and intimidation of some candidates\u201d, including incidents in Birmingham.

      "bodyText": "Australians\u2019 wages have increased faster than inflation for a fourth quarter in a row, bringing some relief to households battling with cost-of-living pressures. The wage price index rose at an annual rate of 3.5% in the September quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. That result compared with a pace of 3.6% expected by economists and the 4.1% rate reported by the ABS for the June quarter. Annual headline consumer inflation was 2.8% for the July-September period. On a quarterly basis, the WPI was up 0.8%, compared with market expectations of a 0.9% increase and the June quarter\u2019s 0.8% advance. Quarterly CPI was just 0.2%. The easing in wage price increases was roughly matched across both the public and private sectors. Public sector employees saw their wages rise a seasonally adjusted 3.7%, the lowest annual rate since the September quarter of 2022. For the private sector, where about four in five people are employed, wages were up 3.5%, or matching the annual increase in the September quarter of 2023. The latest wage increase marks a year of rises after adjusting for inflation. While welcome, the gain will only partly claw back some of the retreat when prices took off much faster than wages in late 2022 into 2023. The Reserve Bank of Australia will home that real wage increases don\u2019t stoke inflation, meaning interest rates would have to stay high for longer. Prior to Wednesday\u2019s data, investors weren\u2019t fully pricing in a cut to the cash rate until July. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email National Australia Bank\u2019s monthly business survey, released on Tuesday, though, found that labour cost growth has continued to ease, dropping from a quarterly pace of 1.9% in the three months to September to 1.4% in the three months to October. The RBA will likely be content that wage increases are continuing to ebb, albeit at a slower pace than headline inflation. Employer-worker wage agreements tend to make wage increases a lagging indicator in the economy, particularly with the jobless rate close to the lowest in half a century. Stocks pared some of their losses in midday trading on Wednesday, in a modest sign investors were a bit more hopeful of a near-term interest rate cut. The Australian dollar was little changed, hovering a bit above 65.2 US cents. \u201cWage rises for many jobs can be directly or indirectly linked to the outcomes of the Fair Work Commission Annual Wage Review decision,\u201d said Michelle Marquardt, head of prices statistics at ABS.

      "bodyText": "Florida\u2019s department of education has released a list of more than 700 books that were \u201cremoved or discontinued\u201d from schools across the state after changes to a state law last year that allows parents and residents to challenge the content of library books. This year\u2019s list, which has doubled in size from last year, includes titles such as Beloved by Toni Morrison, Normal People by Sally Rooney, and Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut. The list comes after House Bill 1069 went into effect last July, requiring school districts to set up a mechanism for parents to object to anything they consider pornographic or inappropriate. Since then hundreds of titles have been removed from elementary, middle and high school libraries. In Florida, 33 out of about 70 school districts banned books. American classics such as Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain are among those that have been pulled. Contemporary novels by bestselling authors such as Margaret Atwood and Stephen King have also been removed. Members of the Florida Freedom to Read Project, a group comprised of public school parents, said the measure has led to an unprecedented rise in censorship, mostly driven by conservative interest groups, and has limited students\u2019 access to diverse literature. \u201cWe believe in a fair, thorough, and public objection process that ensures decisions reflect the needs of each school community - not the broad, district-wide censorship we see today that\u2019s inspired by the vague language in HB 1069 and \u2018bad book\u2019 lists like this one,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cCensorship is happening right here in Florida.

Despite the name, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/trump-appoints-elon-musk-government-efficiency-department\">the department will not be a government agency</a>. Trump said the pair will work from outside the government to offer the White House \u201cadvice and guidance\u201d and will partner with the Office of Management and Budget to \u201cdrive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to government never seen before.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>Trump has tapped Fox News host <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/trump-appoints-mike-huckabee-ambassador-israel\">Pete Hegseth to be secretary of defense</a>.</strong> Hegseth, 44, is a co-host of \u201cFox &amp; Friends Weekend\u201d and has been a contributor with the network since 2014, where he developed a friendship with Trump, who made regular appearances on the show.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Trump has confirmed that he has chosen South Dakota governor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kristi-noem\">Kristi Noem</a>, to serve as the next secretary of the homeland security department.</strong> The choice was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/kristi-noem-homeland-security-donald-trump\">widely reported yesterday</a>, but not yet announced by Trump.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Biden administration said Tuesday it won\u2019t limit weapons transfers to Israel</strong> because the US says its key ally has made good but limited progress in increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza. That is despite eight international aid groups saying Israel has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/12/aid-groups-accuse-israel-of-ignoring-us-ultimatum-on-apocalyptic-gaza-crisis\">failed to meet US demands for greater humanitarian access</a> to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, where hunger experts say the north may already be experiencing famine.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump named the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as the next US ambassador to Israel</strong>. Huckabee has a track record of hardline, occasionally provocative, pro-Israel rhetoric and previously said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a> has a rightful claim to the West Bank, which he refers to by its Hebrew and biblical name of Judea and Samaria.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Trump chose a real-estate mogul as Middle East envoy. </strong>Donald Trump has picked Steven Witkoff, a New York City-based real estate executive and longtime friend, to serve as Middle East envoy in his upcoming administration.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Trump</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/12/donald-trump-marco-rubio-juan-merchan-stormy-daniels-us-politics-live?page=with:block-67337b9b8f081746a2e89efd#block-67337b9b8f081746a2e89efd\">will reportedly oppose</a> a US law that could lead to popular social media app TikTok being banned, despite bipartisan support for the measure.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Wisconsin Republican Eric Hovde refused to concede defeat on Tuesday to Democratic incumbent Tammy Baldwin in their US Senate race</strong>, saying he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the election results but that seeking a recount was a \u201cserious\u201d decision and he was still reviewing his options, the Associated Press reports.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The judge who presided over Donald Trump\u2019s hush money case <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/12/donald-trump-marco-rubio-juan-merchan-stormy-daniels-us-politics-live?page=with:block-67336df48f08a71aa0e1f978#block-67336df48f08a71aa0e1f978\">has paused</a> legal proceedings at the request of prosecutors and the president-elect\u2019s attorneys,</strong> both of whom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/12/donald-trump-marco-rubio-juan-merchan-stormy-daniels-us-politics-live?page=with:block-673370ba8f081746a2e89e5a#block-673370ba8f081746a2e89e5a\">pointed to</a> his victory in last week\u2019s presidential election.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Samuel Alito</strong>, <strong>a long-serving conservative justice on the supreme court, has no plans to step down, the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/12/donald-trump-marco-rubio-juan-merchan-stormy-daniels-us-politics-live?page=with:block-67336a938f081746a2e89dc2#block-67336a938f081746a2e89dc2\">reported</a>.</strong> If he changes his mind, Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate could confirm a replacement and likely prolong the court\u2019s conservative supermajority.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-13T04:03:36.832Z\">at 4.03am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-67341bf68f082c1a66381ce0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-13T03:41:13.339Z\">3.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Elon Musk has been posting busily on X, even by his own standards, in the hours after president-elect Donald Trump announced he will head up the newly created government efficiency department. </p> <p><a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1856520760656797801\">Posting on X</a>, which the billionaire owns, Musk pledged to document all actions of the department online for \u201cmaximum transparency\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAnytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful, just let us know!\u201d he said, while also promise to keep \u201ca leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars\u201d.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-673415448f082c1a66381cb2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-13T03:08:57.168Z\">3.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Associated Press has also called the race in Colorado\u2019s 8th congressional district for Republican Gabe Evans.

It also tested Republicans\u2019 and Democrats\u2019 appeal to Latinos, who make up nearly 40% of the district\u2019s population.</p> <p>The AP\u2019s tally now has the Republicans on 216 seats, just two shy of the 218 needed to secure control of the House of Representatives. </p> <p>Republicans have already secured a majority in the 100-member US senate, though it is shy of the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation in that chamber. That means Democrats will retain some leverage in Washington next year even if Republicans win the House majority.</p> <p>But keeping hold of the House would give Republicans sweeping powers to potentially push through a broad agenda of tax and spending cuts, energy deregulation and border security controls.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/11/progressive-caucus-democrats-populist-economic-policies\">US progressives urge Democrats to back populist policies as party reels from loss</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-673413018f084e2f44269841\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-13T02:53:14.863Z\">2.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Republican David Valadao has won reelection in California\u2019s 22nd congressional district, Associated Press reports, defeating Democrat Rudy Salas for the second time.

Trump said the agency will be conducting a \u201ccomplete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government, and making recommendations for drastic reforms\u201d.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://x.com/CollinRugg/status/1854716187512651808\">video posted on X</a> two days after the election, Trump said he would \u201cimmediately re-issue my 2020 executive order, restoring the president\u2019s authority to remove rogue bureaucrats\u201d. He wants to \u201cclean out the deep state\u201d.

He cut staff at X, formerly Twitter, by 80% after buying it in 2022, a move he said <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-21/musk-says-cost-cutting-averted-3-billion-twitter-shortfall?sref=fqqmZ8gi\">prevented a $3bn shortfall</a>, but which has not otherwise paid off. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/technology/linda-yaccarino-x-ceo-elon-musk.html#:~:text=Internal%20documents%20obtained%20by%20The,decline%20from%20the%20previous%20year.\">Revenue is in steep decline</a> and advertisers have absconded, making a comeback seem unlikely.

The president-elect said on Monday that Homan, a former law enforcement official who has served in immigration enforcement under multiple presidencies, would be \u201cin charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin\u201d.</p> <p>Homan has been describing mass deportation in stark terms for the past year, angling for a role in helping Trump with his signature campaign promise. Asked about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/30/trump-deportation-plan-economic-disaster\">high price tag</a> of a mass deportation, he turned the question back on 60 Minutes: \u201cWhat price do you put on our national security? Is it worth it?\u201d When the outlet followed up to ask if there was a way for mass deportations not to separate families with mixed immigration statuses, Homan responded: \u201cFamilies can be deported together.\u201d</p> <p>It is a likely next step for a man who served as acting director of Ice for 16 months under Trump in what was seen as a period of intense controversy for the agency. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/09/trump-administration-family-separation-policy-immigration/670604/\">The Atlantic documented</a> how Homan was the \u201cfather\u201d of the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy, tracing its roots to a 2014 meeting during which Homan pushed the idea.

      "bodyText": "This blog has now closed. Thanks for reading. Here is a summary of the latest developments: Elon Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, Donald Trump said on Tuesday. Despite the name, the department will not be a government agency. Trump said the pair will work from outside the government to offer the White House \u201cadvice and guidance\u201d and will partner with the Office of Management and Budget to \u201cdrive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to government never seen before.\u201d Trump has tapped Fox News host Pete Hegseth to be secretary of defense. Hegseth, 44, is a co-host of \u201cFox &amp; Friends Weekend\u201d and has been a contributor with the network since 2014, where he developed a friendship with Trump, who made regular appearances on the show. Trump has confirmed that he has chosen South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem, to serve as the next secretary of the homeland security department. The choice was widely reported yesterday, but not yet announced by Trump. The Biden administration said Tuesday it won\u2019t limit weapons transfers to Israel because the US says its key ally has made good but limited progress in increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza. That is despite eight international aid groups saying Israel has failed to meet US demands for greater humanitarian access to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, where hunger experts say the north may already be experiencing famine. Donald Trump named the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as the next US ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has a track record of hardline, occasionally provocative, pro-Israel rhetoric and previously said Israel has a rightful claim to the West Bank, which he refers to by its Hebrew and biblical name of Judea and Samaria. Trump chose a real-estate mogul as Middle East envoy. Donald Trump has picked Steven Witkoff, a New York City-based real estate executive and longtime friend, to serve as Middle East envoy in his upcoming administration. Trump will reportedly oppose a US law that could lead to popular social media app TikTok being banned, despite bipartisan support for the measure. Wisconsin Republican Eric Hovde refused to concede defeat on Tuesday to Democratic incumbent Tammy Baldwin in their US Senate race, saying he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the election results but that seeking a recount was a \u201cserious\u201d decision and he was still reviewing his options, the Associated Press reports. The judge who presided over Donald Trump\u2019s hush money case has paused legal proceedings at the request of prosecutors and the president-elect\u2019s attorneys, both of whom pointed to his victory in last week\u2019s presidential election. Samuel Alito, a long-serving conservative justice on the supreme court, has no plans to step down, the Wall Street Journal reported. If he changes his mind, Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate could confirm a replacement and likely prolong the court\u2019s conservative supermajority. Elon Musk has been posting busily on X, even by his own standards, in the hours after president-elect Donald Trump announced he will head up the newly created government efficiency department. Posting on X, which the billionaire owns, Musk pledged to document all actions of the department online for \u201cmaximum transparency\u201d. \u201cAnytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful, just let us know!\u201d he said, while also promise to keep \u201ca leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars\u201d. The Associated Press has also called the race in Colorado\u2019s 8th congressional district for Republican Gabe Evans. Evans flipped the seat north of Denver for the Republicans, defeating Democratic incumbent Yadira Caraveo in one of the nation\u2019s most-watched races. The toss-up race for Colorado\u2019s 8th congressional district, which was created after redistricting in 2020, was a crucial part to Republican\u2019s goal of retaining control of the House. It also tested Republicans\u2019 and Democrats\u2019 appeal to Latinos, who make up nearly 40% of the district\u2019s population. The AP\u2019s tally now has the Republicans on 216 seats, just two shy of the 218 needed to secure control of the House of Representatives. Republicans have already secured a majority in the 100-member US senate, though it is shy of the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation in that chamber. That means Democrats will retain some leverage in Washington next year even if Republicans win the House majority. But keeping hold of the House would give Republicans sweeping powers to potentially push through a broad agenda of tax and spending cuts, energy deregulation and border security controls. Republican David Valadao has won reelection in California\u2019s 22nd congressional district, Associated Press reports, defeating Democrat Rudy Salas for the second time. Valadao is an anomaly \u2013 an elected Republican in a heavily Democratic district in a heavily Democratic state. Democrats hold a 14-point registration edge in the Central Valley district, but Valadao has kept a grip on the seat nonetheless. Valadao held the seat from 2013 until 2019, lost it for a term, then won it back in a 2020 rematch with Democrat TJ Cox. Valadao stressed his efforts to secure more water for farmers and his willingness to work across the aisle, while painting Salas as a tax-and-spend Democrat. As we reported earlier, Donald Trump has selected South Dakota Gover Kristi Noem to head the Department of Homeland Security, one of the biggest government agencies that will be integral to his vow to secure the border and carry out a massive deportation operation. The 52-year-old was born in Watertown, South Dakota, and raised on a ranch and farm outside the city. Her father died in a grain-bin collapse at the age of 49. She was involved in a number of family businesses before successfully running for the South Dakota House of Representatives in 2006. In 2010, she won the state\u2019s at-large House seat, and in 2018, she was elected the state\u2019s first female governor. She was reelected in 2022. After becoming governor, Noem started working closely with Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign manager. Then, during the pandemic, she rose to prominence in conservative circles for resisting most government regulations to slow the spread of infections. She has since become a regular presence in Trump\u2019s political world and at one point was considered to be his running mate. She was criticised this year for a story she told in her book about killing her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket. Noem has been a key Trump supporter, including backing his tough immigration talk. \u201cPresident Trump will deport the most dangerous illegal aliens first \u2013 the murderers, rapists, and other criminals that Harris and Biden let into the country. They do not belong here, and we will not let them back in,\u201d Noem said in a post on X after Trump was elected. Here is our full story on Trump selecting Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead his efficiency department: Donald Trump, president-elect of the US, announced on Tuesday that he has selected Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, with plans to reduce bureaucracy in the federal government by roughly a third. Musk had pushed for a government efficiency department and has since relentlessly promoted it, emphasizing the acronym for the agency: Doge, a reference to a meme of an expressive Shiba Inu. Trump said the agency will be conducting a \u201ccomplete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government, and making recommendations for drastic reforms\u201d. In a video posted on X two days after the election, Trump said he would \u201cimmediately re-issue my 2020 executive order, restoring the president\u2019s authority to remove rogue bureaucrats\u201d. He wants to \u201cclean out the deep state\u201d. His promises echo his slogan on The Apprentice: \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d And Project 2025, an influential and controversial blueprint for Trump\u2019s second term, lays out ways to make bureaucrats fireable. Musk has extensive experience slashing corporate spending, and he has promised to cull federal payrolls in much the same way. He cut staff at X, formerly Twitter, by 80% after buying it in 2022, a move he said prevented a $3bn shortfall, but which has not otherwise paid off. Revenue is in steep decline and advertisers have absconded, making a comeback seem unlikely. As the CEO of SpaceX, however, he has garnered a reputation for launching rockets more cheaply than competitors by negotiating with suppliers and keeping operations lean. The billionaire does not seem to be under any illusions of what will happen after his proposed cuts, admitting that reducing spending \u201cnecessarily involves some temporary hardship\u201d. Americans do want to spend less \u2013 of their own money. Do they want austerity and less financial assistance from the federal government? Do they want the world\u2019s richest person admonishing them to cut their expenses? A senior adviser to US president-elect Donald Trump has fuelled speculation about the future of Australia\u2019s ambassador to Washington, former prime minister Kevin Rudd, by reposting Rudd\u2019s congratulatory statement to Trump on social media with a gif of an hourglass. The provocative time-is-running-out post by former Trump deputy chief of staff for communications Dan Scavino reignited suggestions that the incoming president may prefer another Australian representative in Washington when he takes office in January. Scavino spoke at Trump\u2019s now-infamous Madison Square Garden rally in New York ahead of the election and was billed as a \u201csenior adviser\u201d. A new video emerged earlier this week of Rudd in an interview in 2021 describing Trump as \u201ca village idiot\u201d and \u201cnot a leading intellectual force\u201d. Rudd last week \u2013 following the US election \u2013 deleted old social media posts criticising Trump. It\u2019s not clear how the new efficiency department will operate. The Associated Press reports that it could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public. Federal employees are generally required to disclose their assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations. The president-elect has often said he would give Musk a formal role overseeing a group akin to a blue-ribbon commission that would recommend ways to slash spending and make the federal government more efficient. Musk at one point suggested he could find more than $2tn in savings \u2013 nearly a third of total annual government spending. Trump had made clear that Musk would likely not hold any kind of full-time position, given his other commitments. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can get him full-time because he\u2019s a little bit busy sending rockets up and all the things he does,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Michigan in September. \u201cHe said the waste in this country is crazy. And we\u2019re going to get Elon Musk to be our cost cutter.\u201d Ramaswamy suspended his campaign in January and threw his support behind Trump. Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk have responded to the announcement on X, the social media platform owned by Musk. Ramaswamy said, \u201cWe will not go gently, @elonmusk\u201d and added an American flag emoji. Musk said, \u201cThreat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!\u201d. Here is what we know about the new Department of Government Efficiency, and the two men Trump has chosen to lead it: Trump said on Tuesday Elon Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency. Musk and Ramaswamy \u201cwill pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,\u201d Trump said in a statement. Trump said their work would conclude by 4 July 2026, adding that a smaller and more efficient government would be a \u201cgift\u201d to the country on the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The appointments reward two Trump supporters from the private sector. Musk leads electric car company Tesla, social media platform X and rocket company SpaceX, while Ramaswamy is the founder of a pharmaceutical company who ran for the Republican presidential nomination against Trump and then threw his support behind the former president after dropping out. Musk gave millions of dollars to support Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and made public appearances with him. Trump had said he would offer Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, a role in his administration promoting government efficiency. The acronym of the new department \u2013 DOGE \u2013 coincides with the name of the cryptocurrency Dogecoin that Musk promotes, and the internet meme after which the cryptocurrency is named. \u201cThis will send shock waves through the system, and anyone involved in government waste, which is a lot of people!\u201d Musk said, according to Trump\u2019s statement, which called the new government initiative \u201cpotentially \u2018The Manhattan Project\u2019 of our time,\u201d referring to the US plan to build the atomic bomb that helped end the second world war. John Ratcliffe served as director of national intelligence (DNI) for the final months of Trump\u2019s first term, leading the US government\u2019s spy agencies during the coronavirus pandemic. His position as DNI also made him responsible for detecting and countering foreign efforts to interfere in American politics. That experience makes him a more traditional pick for the job, which requires Senate confirmation, than some rumored loyalists pushed by some of Trump\u2019s supporters. As DNI, Ratcliffe participated in an unusual night-time news conference just weeks before the 2020 presidential election in which he and other officials accused Iran of being responsible for a barrage of emails meant to intimidate voters in the US. Also while in that role, Ratcliffe faced criticism for declassifying Russian intelligence that purported to reveal information about Democrats during the 2016 election even as he acknowledged it might not be true. Democrats decried the move as a partisan stunt that politicized intelligence. Ratcliffe was elected to Congress in 2014, but his visibility rose in 2019 as an ardent defender of Trump during the House\u2019s first impeachment proceedings against him. He was a member of Trump\u2019s impeachment advisory team and strenuously questioned witnesses during the impeachment hearings. When former special counsel Robert Mueller appeared before the House judiciary ommittee to testify about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Ratcliffe was one of the more ardent Republican interrogators, forcefully questioning the prosecutor and blasting the report he produced. Ratcliffe has repeatedly sounded the alarm about China, calling the country the top threat to US interests and the rest of the free world. The Associated Press has called the race for Democrat George Whitesides. The former Nasa chief of staff, who had the support of national Democrats, has won a tough race to unseat Republican incumbent represenative Mike Garcia in California\u2019s 27 congressional district. As we reported earlier, Garcia conceded on Monday, saying he had congratulated Whitesides and would ensure a smooth handoff. Whitesides said on Monday in a statement that he had spoken with Garcia and thanked him for his service to the district and the nation. He said he would fight in Congress for good jobs and lower household costs. Whitesides, who is also a former CEO of Virgin Galactic, said during the campaign that he would use his business experience to solve problems. He spotlighted Garcia\u2019s opposition to abortion rights, calling him an extremist. Some background: Elon Musk\u2019s super political action committee (Pac) spent about $200m to help elect Donald Trump to a second presidency, according to a person familiar with the group\u2019s spending, funding an effort that set a new standard for how billionaires can influence elections. The billionaire chief executive officer of Tesla and SpaceX provided the vast majority of the money to America Pac, which focused on low-propensity and first-time voters, according to the Associated Press source, who was not authorized to disclose the figure publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. In turn, as CNBC reported, Musk\u2019s net worth jumped $70bn since Trump\u2019s victory in the 5 November election. Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, whose companies have billions of dollars of federal contracts, has been a constant presence at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate this week. Some see Musk as the second-most influential figure in Trump\u2019s immediate orbit after his campaign chief-turned-incoming chief of staff, Susie Wiles. The \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d \u2013 essentially an independent advisory panel \u2013 that Musk will help lead, is intended to \u201cdrive out the massive waste and fraud\u201d. \u201cThis will send shockwaves through the system,\u201d said a statement from Musk. As we reported, Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur who ran for president himself, is helping Musk lead the department. Trump is expected to return to public view on Wednesday, when he goes to the White House to meet with President Joe Biden and visits Capitol Hill to consult with House speaker Mike Johnson and Republican legislators. Overall, Trump is laying the groundwork for his second presidency at a much faster clip than his first. More now on Pete Hegseth, the Fox News host Trump has just announced as his nominee for secretary of defense, via the Associated Press: Trump\u2019s selection of Hegseth, who lacks senior military or national security experience, was sure to draw questions about his qualifications to lead the department. Hegseth, 44, is a co-host of Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox &amp; Friends Weekend\u201d and has been a contributor with the network since 2014, where he developed a friendship with Trump, who made regular appearances on the show. If confirmed by the Senate, he would inherit the top job during a series of global crises \u2014 ranging from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the ongoing attacks in the Middle East by Iranian proxies to the push for a cease-fire between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah and escalating worries about the growing alliance between Russia and North Korea. Hegseth is also the author of \u201cThe War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free,\u201d published earlier this year. The book, according to its promo, combines \u201chis own war experiences, tales of outrage, and an incisive look at how the chain of command got so kinked,\u201d and bills itself as \u201cthe key to saving our warriors \u2014 and winning future wars.\u201d While the Pentagon is considered a key coveted post in any administration, the defense secretary was a tumultuous post during Trump\u2019s first term. Five men held the job during his four years only to resign, be fired or serve briefly as a stopgap. Just two of them were actually confirmed by the Senate. Trump\u2019s relationship with his civilian and military leaders during those years was fraught with tension, confusion and frustration, as they struggled to temper or even simply interpret presidential tweets and pronouncements that blindsided them with abrupt policy decisions they weren\u2019t prepared to explain or defend. Many of the generals who worked in his first administration \u2014 both on active duty and retired \u2014 have slammed him as unfit to serve in the Oval Office and he has condemned them in return. Hegseth was an infantry captain in the Army National Guard and served overseas in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He was formerly head of the Concerned Veterans for America, a group backed by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, and he unsuccessfully ran for the Senate in Minnesota in 2012. \u201cWith Pete at the helm, America\u2019s enemies are on notice \u2014 Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cNobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our \u2018Peace through Strength\u2019 policy.\u201d Hegseth has \u201can excellent background as a junior officer but does not have the senior national security experience that secretaries need,\u201d said Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cI think Trump was tired of fighting with his secretaries of defense and picked one who would be loyal to him.\u201d Cancian said the lack of experience might make it more difficult for Hegseth to get through Senate confirmation. Trump has confirmed that he has chosen South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem, to serve as the next secretary of the homeland security department. The choice was widely reported yesterday, but not yet announced by Trump. In his statement, Trump says: I am pleased to announce that the Governor and former congresswoman from South Dakota, Kristi Noem, will be appointed to serve as the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Kristi has been very strong on Border Security. She was the first Governor to send National Guard Soldiers to help Texas fight the Biden Border Crisis, and they were sent a total of eight times. She will work closely with \u201cBorder Czar\u201d Tom Homan to secure the Border, and will guarantee that our American Homeland is secure from our adversaries. I have known Kristi for years, and have worked with her on a wide variety of projects - She will be a great part of our mission to Make America Safe Again. Trump, in his statement, lays out a vision of the department as \u201cpotentially \u2018The Manhattan Project\u2019 of our time\u201d. The Manhattan Project was the second world war research program that developed nuclear weapons. Only this one is named after an internet meme and type of cryptocurrency. Here is more from Trump\u2019s statement: It will become, potentially, \u2018The Manhattan Project\u2019of our time. Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of \u201cDOGE\u201d for a very long time. To drive this kind of drastic change, the Department of Government Efficiency will provide advice and guidance from outside of Government, and will partner with the White House and Office of Management &amp; Budget to drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before. I look forward to Elon and Vivek making changes to the Federal Bureaucracy with an eye on efficiency and, at the same time, making life better for all Americans. Importantly, we will drive out the massive waste and fraud which exists throughout our annual $6.5 Trillion Dollars of Government Spending. They will work together to liberate our Economy, and make the U.S. Government accountable to \u201cWE THE PEOPLE.\u201d Their work will conclude no later than July 4, 2026 - A smaller Government, with more efficiency and less bureaucracy, will be the perfect gift to America on the 250th Anniversary of The Declaration of Independence. I am confident they will succeed! Trump has announced that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency. In a statement, Trump said: I am pleased to announce that the Great Elon Musk, working in conjunction with American Patriot Vivek Ramaswamy, will lead the Department of Government Efficiency (\u201cDOGE\u201d). Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies \u2013 Essential to the \u201cSave America\u201d Movement. \u201cThis will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!\u201d Musk said. Here is a bit more on Trump\u2019s Pentagon pick: Pete Hegseth, 44, is a co-host of Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox &amp; Friends Weekend\u201d and has been a contributor with the network since 2014, where he developed a friendship with Trump, who made regular appearances on the show. He is also the author of The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free. Hegseth was an infantry captain in the Army National Guard and served overseas in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. He was formerly head of the Concerned Veterans for America, a group backed by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, and he unsuccessfully ran for the Senate in Minnesota in 2012. Hegseth deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and unsuccessfully ran for Senate in Minnesota in 2012 before joining Fox News. Trump has just announced another cabinet pick: Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense. Hegseth is a Fox news host. We\u2019ll have information shortly. In a statement, he says: I am honored to announce that I have nominated Pete Hegseth to serve in my Cabinet as The Secretary of Defense. Pete has spent his entire life as a Warrior for the Troops, and for the Country. Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First. With Pete at the helm, America\u2019s enemies are on notice - Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down. A pregnant woman in Kentucky seeking an abortion filed a lawsuit on Tuesday asking a court to strike down the state\u2019s abortion bans. The woman, who is known in court records as Mary Poe and is about seven or eight weeks pregnant, is challenging Kentucky\u2019s near-total abortion ban and the six-week ban simultaneously in effect. These bans, Poe argues, violate the Kentucky constitution\u2019s rights to privacy and self-determination and should not be enforced. \u201cFor many individuals, the bans altogether foreclose the ability to access abortion, thus forcing them to carry their pregnancies to term and give birth, which carries a risk of death up to 14 times higher than that associated with abortion,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201cOthers, pushed by the bans to travel out of state for legal care, bear the burdens both of increased health risks from being pushed later into pregnancy and of the cost and logistical difficulties of long-distance travel.\u201d The lawsuit also requests class-action status for all people who may be pregnant or can become so but are unable to get a abortion in Kentucky. \u201cI feel overwhelmed and frustrated that I cannot access abortion care here in my own state, and I have started the difficult process of arranging to get care in another state where it\u2019s legal,\u201d Poe said in a statement. \u201cThis involves trying to take time off work and securing child care, all of which place an enormous burden on me. This is my personal decision, a decision I believe should be mine alone, not one made by anyone else.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Kentucky, and the law firm Kaplan, Johnson, Abate &amp; Bird are representing Poe. Read the full story here: After spending four months in federal prison for snubbing a congressional subpoena, conservative strategist Steve Bannon has spoken to media outside a New York court where he\u2019s facing a state conspiracy trial as soon as next month. \u201cYou wait. The hunted are about to become the hunters,\u201d Bannon said, according to the Associated Press. He stepped into a waiting car without elaborating on what \u201cthe hunters\u201d intend to do. The longtime Trump ally\u2019s latest trial is scheduled to start 9 December \u2013 but could be postponed after a hearing Monday \u2013 at the same Manhattan courthouse where the past-and-next president was convicted in his hush-money case. Separately, a judge Tuesday delayed a key ruling in the hush-money case for at least a week as prosecutors ponder how to proceed in light of Trump\u2019s impending presidency. Trump has spent most of his first week as president-elect behind closed doors at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, where he\u2019s working the phones, reconnecting with foreign leaders and building his new administration, the Associated Press reports. Trump is hardly in seclusion. He\u2019s surrounded by advisers, friends and paying members of his club, who weigh in with advice as he selects people for top government jobs. Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, whose companies have billions of dollars of federal contracts, has been a constant presence. Some see Musk as the second-most influential figure in Trump\u2019s immediate orbit after his campaign chief-turned-incoming chief of staff, Susie Wiles. \u201cVery productive day of work by the transition team,\u201d Musk posted on X, his social media company, on Monday evening. Trump is expected to return to public view on Wednesday, when he goes to the White House to meet with Joe Biden and visits Capitol Hill to consult with House speaker Mike Johnson and Republican legislators. Overall, Trump is laying the groundwork for his second presidency at a much faster clip than his first. Trump is also expected to meet with Republicans on Capitol Hill as they prepare for his day one priorities in a potentially unified government with a sweep of GOP power in Washington. Eight international aid groups said on Tuesday that Israel has failed to meet US demands for greater humanitarian access to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, where hunger experts say the north may already be experiencing famine, the Associated Press reports. However, the Biden administration said Tuesday it won\u2019t limit weapons transfers to Israel because the US says its key ally has made good but limited progress in increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Last month, Washington told Israel to boost aid to Gaza within 30 days, or else it could trigger US laws requiring it to scale back American military support as Israel wages war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israeli strikes killed at least 46 people in Gaza in the past 24 hours, and killed at least 33 people in Lebanon, local health officials said Tuesday. Two people in northern Israel also died from rockets fired from Lebanon. Israel\u2019s relentless bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. More than half of those killed were women and children. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on 8 October 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. Since then, more than 3,200 people have been killed in Lebanon and more than 14,200 wounded, the country\u2019s health ministry reported. Hovde pointed to what he claimed were irregularities with the vote results. There is no evidence of any wrongdoing in the election, the results of which are still being reviewed by counties before they submit the canvassed totals to the state by 19 November for certification by 1 December. Democrats, and even some Republicans, immediately called out Hovde for what they said was a perpetuation of lies about the integrity of the election. \u201cStop trying to erode trust in our elections (and I say that as someone who supported Hovde),\u201d said Jim Villa, a longtime Republican who previously worked in the legislature and Milwaukee county executive\u2019s office under Scott Walker before Walker became governor. \u201cThat grift needs to stop!\u201d Villa posted on X. Baldwin campaign spokesperson Andrew Mamo accused Hovde of \u201csowing doubt about our very democracy\u201d. \u201cLeaders on both sides of the aisle should condemn the lies he\u2019s spreading and the pathetic campaign he continues to run,\u201d Mamo said. \u201cTammy Baldwin has won this race and there is only one thing for Eric Hovde to do: concede.\u201d Wisconsin Republican Eric Hovde refused to concede defeat on Tuesday to Democratic incumbent Tammy Baldwin in their US Senate race, saying he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the election results but that seeking a recount was a \u201cserious\u201d decision and he was still reviewing his options, the Associated Press reports. Hovde can request a recount because his margin of defeat was less than 1 percentage point, at about 29,000 votes. But he hasn\u2019t said yet whether he will request one, explaining in a video directed at his supporters that he wants to review all of the information and options that are available. \u201cThis is a difficult decision because I want to honor your support and, at the same time, bring closure to this election for our state,\u201d Hovde said in the video posted on X. Here is a summary of the key recent developments: The judge who presided over Donald Trump\u2019s hush money case has paused legal proceedings at the request of prosecutors and the president-elect\u2019s attorneys, both of whom pointed to his victory in last week\u2019s presidential election. Republicans are getting ready for Trump\u2019s visit to the White House, with House speaker Mike Johnson saying he planned to have Trump address his lawmakers. Speaking of Congress, we still do not know for sure which party will control the House for the next two years. Counting of ballots in key races remains ongoing, though Republicans seem on track to keep their majority. Samuel Alito, a long-serving conservative justice on the supreme court, has no plans to step down, the Wall Street Journal reported. If he changes his mind, Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate could confirm a replacement and likely prolong the court\u2019s conservative supermajority. Trump will reportedly oppose a US law that could lead to popular social media app TikTok being banned, despite bipartisan support for the measure. Despite taking office with Republicans in control of Congress in 2017, Trump\u2019s first years in office were marked by legislative chaos. Johnson vowed that won\u2019t happen again when Trump returns to the White House in January. Trump chose an ex-national intelligence chief as CIA director. Trump has named John Ratcliffe, who served as the director of national intelligence during Trump\u2019s first term, as his pick for CIA director, and William Joseph McGinley, who served as cabinet secretary in the first term, to serve as White House counsel. Trump chose a real-estate mogul as Middle East envoy. Donald Trump has picked Steven Witkoff, a New York City-based real estate executive and longtime friend, to serve as Middle East envoy in his upcoming administration. Trump announced that he will nominate Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, to be the US ambassador to Israel. Huckabee \u201cloves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him,\u201d the president-elect said in a statement on Tuesday. Trump advisers mulling a \u2018warrior board\u2019 to organize purge of top military officers \u2013 report. Donald Trump\u2019s transition team is working on an executive order that would create a new body tasked with naming military leaders who should be demoted, the Wall Street Journal reports. The reported proposal for a \u201cwarrior board\u201d staffed by former military officers loyal to the president-elect is the latest sign that Trump may make due on his threat to retaliate against leaders at all levels of government who have broken with him, or who are perceived as disloyal. Trump issued a statement announcing his appointment of Mike Waltz to serve in his cabinet as the national security adviser. Waltz \u201chas been a strong champion of my America First Foreign Policy agenda, and will be a tremendous champion of our pursuit of Peace through Strength!\u201d the president-elect said in a statement on Tuesday. Trump has also named John Ratcliffe, who served as the director of national intelligence during Trump\u2019s first term, as his pick for CIA director, and William Joseph McGinley, who served as cabinet secretary in the first term, to serve as White House counsel. Donald Trump has picked Steven Witkoff, a New York City-based real estate executive and longtime friend, to serve as Middle East envoy in his upcoming administration. \u201cSteve is a Highly Respected Leader in Business and Philanthropy, who has made every project and community he has been involved with stronger and more prosperous,\u201d Trump said in a statement announcing the appointment. \u201cSteve will be an unrelenting Voice for PEACE, and make us all proud.\u201d Witkoff has longtime ties to Trump and the Trump organization, serving as a major donor and as an adviser. He testified as an expert witness in the New York attorney general\u2019s case against the Trump family and its namesake business. Donald Trump has tasked Howard Lutnick, a longtime friend, with recruiting officials who will deliver, rather than dilute, his agenda. During his first term, several of Trump\u2019s key appointees tried to convince Trump out of his more extreme plans. Here\u2019s a look at those who have been and could be offered key positions when Trump takes office: The House is scheduled to vote today on a bill targeting non-profit organizations deemed to be supporting \u201cterrorism\u201d. Civil rights advocates have raised alarm that bill, which was first introduced in response to nationwide protests on college campuses against Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza, could be used against pro-Palestinian groups as well as those that environmental groups, reproductive rights groups and other human rights organizations during the upcoming Trump administration. The language in the bill would give the Treasury Department broad authority to determine which organizations are \u201cterrorist-supporting\u201d without requiring evidence, and allow the agency to revoke tax-exempt status from those non-profits. Republicans drafted the policy as part of a popular measure to prevent the IRS from issuing fines and tax penalties to Americans held hostage by terrorist groups. The measure, which is being fast-tracked in the House, would need a two-thirds majority in the Senate to pass. \u201cThis bill requires no oversight. No due-process. No justification. In Trump\u2019s hands, it would be a weapon of mass destruction against dissent,\u201d said Andrew O\u2019Neill, legislative director of the group Indivisible. \u201cThe vote today requires a two-thirds threshold to pass, so Democrats really do have agency here. The question is whether they\u2019ll use it to stand up against authoritarian overreach, or if they\u2019ll sit back and hand Trump more power.\u201d \u201cPassing this bill would hand the incoming Trump administration a dangerous new tool it could use to stifle free speech, target political opponents, and punish disfavored groups,\u201d said Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel at ACLU. \u201cThe freedom to dissent without fear of government retribution is a vital part of any well-functioning democracy, which is why Congress must block HR 9495 before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s transition team is working on an executive order that would create a new body tasked with naming military leaders who should be demoted, the Wall Street Journal reports. The reported proposal for a \u201cwarrior board\u201d staffed by former military officers loyal to the president-elect is the latest sign that Trump may make due on his threat to retaliate against leaders at all levels of government who have broken with him, or who are perceived as disloyal. Here\u2019s more on the proposal, from the Journal: If Donald Trump approves the order, it could fast-track the removal of generals and admirals found to be \u201clacking in requisite leadership qualities,\u201d according to a draft of the order reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. But it could also create a chilling effect on top military officers, given the president-elect\u2019s past vow to fire \u201cwoke generals,\u201d referring to officers seen as promoting diversity in the ranks at the expense of military readiness. As commander in chief, Trump can fire any officer at will, but an outside board whose members he appoints would bypass the Pentagon\u2019s regular promotion system, signaling across the military that he intends to purge a number of generals and admirals. The draft order says it aims to establish a review that focuses \u201con leadership capability, strategic readiness, and commitment to military excellence.\u201d The draft doesn\u2019t specify what officers need to do or present to show if they meet those standards. The draft order originated with one of several outside policy groups collaborating with the transition team, and is one of numerous executive orders under review by Trump\u2019s team, a transition official said. The warrior board would be made up of retired generals and noncommissioned officers, who would send their recommendations to the president. Those identified for removal would be retired at their current rank within 30 days. Karoline Leavitt, the Trump-Vance Transition spokeswoman, declined to comment on this draft executive order but said \u201cthe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver.\u201d At the White House, Karine Jean-Pierre is taking questions from reporters who are asking for an idea of what to expect when Joe Biden meets Donald Trump tomorrow. But the US press secretary does not have much to say. Responding to a reporter who wanted to know if they would discuss foreign policy issues such as US assistance to Ukraine and Israel, she said: I\u2019m not going to get into the details of what\u2019s going to be discussed tomorrow. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to get into here. What about concerns about Trump\u2019s contacts with foreign leaders, many of whom have spoken to him by phone since he won the election? Jean-Pierre didn\u2019t have much of a comment on that question, either: He\u2019s the president-elect. Every president-elect receives calls from world leaders, takes calls from world leaders, has calls from world leaders. It is not unusual. [I] don\u2019t have a comment beyond that, any specifics or details. That\u2019s something for the \u2026 Trump transition. Donald Trump plans to begin his second presidential term with a bang, the Guardian\u2019s Robert Tait reports: Donald Trump will mark the first day of his return to the White House by signing a spate of executive orders to reinstate signature policies from his first presidency that were revoked by Joe Biden, according to his incoming chief of staff. Susie Wiles\u2019s disclosure came in a closed-door meeting in Las Vegas of the Rockbridge Network, a group of conservative donors co-founded by Trump\u2019s running mate, JD Vance, the New York Times reported. She did not specify which policies were likely to be reintroduced in the flurry of signing that is expected on Trump\u2019s first day back in the Oval Office. But several of Trump\u2019s higher-profile executive orders that Biden revoked include leaving the Paris climate agreement, withdrawing from the World Health Organization (WHO) and banning entry to citizens from a list of predominantly Muslim countries. Did a majority of Latino men support Donald Trump, as some national exit polls suggest? No, according to the researchers behind the 2024 American Electorate Voter Poll, a survey of more than 9,400 voters that emphasizes accurately representing Black, Latino and AAPI voters. \u201cThe national exit polls are wrong about Latinos in general and Latino men in particular. They did shift more Republican, however a majority of Latino men continued to vote Democrat in 2024,\u201d said Matt Baretto, a co-founder of BSP Research, told reporters on a call in which he presented the survey\u2019s findings. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely confident that our sample is accurate \u2013 that it is an accurate portrait of Latino men and Latino women and that it is balanced to measure the demographics and that it was available in Spanish at every stopping point in the survey.\u201d According to the survey, Hispanic men supported Kamala Harris over Trump by a 13-point margin, compared with the 34-point margin among Hispanic women. Among Hispanic men under 40, Harris held an only four-point margin. Baretto said it was \u201cincorrect, categorically\u201d to suggest that any cohort of Latino men supported Trump over Harris. Even as he acknowledged Trump had made clear gains with Hispanic voters, he noted that Democrats performed worse this election cycle with \u201cevery single racial and ethnic group\u201d than they did four years ago. The poll also found an uptick in support for Harris among Puerto Ricans, particularly in Pennsylvania, which Hispanic organizers attributed to a surge in fundraising after a shock-jock comic made disparaging comments about the island during Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally. \u201cThe participation rate of Puerto Ricans and Latinos in Pennsylvania increased noticeably after the Madison Square Garden rally \u2013 a nine-point shift in Latino voter sentiment in Pennsylvania towards Harris,\u201d said Frankie Miranda, president and CEO at Hispanic Federation, on the call. \u201cThe effect is undeniable, but it took a fluke very late in the game to get the attention of the campaigns and funders to provide investment desperately needed to ensure mobilization. Newly elected senators are in Washington DC for orientation, and true to form, West Virginia\u2019s Jim Justice brought along his bulldog, Babydog. The dog has been by Justice\u2019s side throughout his term as West Virginia\u2019s governor, and the senator-elect was hoping to bring Babydog into the Senate chambers. But Axios reports that is against the rules: Justice was told by Senate floor staff that only service dogs are allowed onto the floor of the Senate, and that even in that case there would need to be an analysis on potential allergies. Justice had no such problems at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee this past summer, where Babydog was by his side throughout. Mike Johnson has congratulated congressman Mike Waltz on being selected as Donald Trump\u2019s national security advisor. \u201cCongressman Mike Waltz is a brilliant and faithful patriot, who has served our country as a Green Beret and a member of Congress. It has been his life\u2019s mission to help protect the United States, and he will continue to do so as the President\u2019s National Security Advisor,\u201d the Republican House speaker said. He added that the Florida congressman is \u201cthe perfect person to advise President Trump and defend our interests on the world stage. I look forward to continuing to engage with him as Congress works to implement America First national security policies under the new Trump administration\u201d. Waltz just won re-election to his district just north of Orlando, and his departure from Congress will trigger a special election to replace him. But Democrats are unlikely to win in Waltz\u2019s district, which is sharply Republican. A new Louisiana law that requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public classroom by the beginning of 2025 has been temporarily blocked after a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction on Tuesday. The judge said the law was \u201cunconstitutional on its face\u201d \u2013 and plaintiffs were likely to win their case with claims that the law violates the US constitution\u2019s first amendment, which bars the government from establishing a religion and guarantees the right to religious freedom. The ruling marks a win for opponents of the law, who argue that it is a violation of the constitutionally mandated separation of church and state. They also argue that the poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments would isolate students, especially those who are not Christian. Proponents say that the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance to the foundation of US law. Donald Trump has announced that he will nominate Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, to be the US ambassador to Israel. Huckabee \u201cloves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him,\u201d the president-elect said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cMike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!\u201d Trump added. Huckabee, who served as Arkansas governor from 1996 to 2007, is two-time Republican presidential hopeful and father to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the current governor of the state and Trump\u2019s former White House press secretary. He is an outspoken settlement backer; in 2018, he said he dreamed of building a \u201choliday home\u201d in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Several hundred White House staffers loudly cheered for the vice-president, Kamala Harris, who was arriving for her lunch with Joe Biden. Staffers shouted \u201cMVP\u201d, for Madame vice-president, as she got out of her SUV and clapped and waved, per pool report. \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do,\u201d Harris addressed staffers. \u201cSo thank you all very much. \u201cListen, we do the best work anybody could do, which is to dedicate ourselves to the people, to public service, to lifting folks up, knowing we have the power, and when we do that work, we make a difference, and you all are a part of doing that work every single day, and I am so grateful to each of you. \u201cSo let\u2019s get back to work, because we still have work to get done. And I am sending all my love and thanks. Thank you, everyone.\u201d Joni Ernst, the Republican senator for Iowa, has privately expressed interest in becoming Donald Trump\u2019s defense secretary, according to multiple reports. If nominated and confirmed, Ernst, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, Iraq War veteran and member of the Senate\u2019s armed services committee, would be the first woman to serve in the role. National security leaders have told Ernst that she would be a good fit for the job, but those conversations have not yet escalated to anything official, Notus reported. A source told the Washington Post on Tuesday that the idea started \u201cgaining a life of its own yesterday\u201d, but it\u2019s not clear whether Trump will consider her for the role. Donald Trump has issued a statement announcing his appointment of Mike Waltz to serve in his cabinet as the national security adviser. Waltz \u201chas been a strong champion of my America First Foreign Policy agenda, and will be a tremendous champion of our pursuit of Peace through Strength!\u201d the president-elect said in a statement on Tuesday. Waltz, a Republican congressman representing east-central Florida and Trump loyalist who served in the national guard as a colonel, has criticized Chinese activity in the Asia-Pacific and voiced the need for the US to be ready for a potential conflict in the region. Waltz is a combat-decorated Green Beret and a former White House and Pentagon policy adviser. He was first elected in 2018, replacing Ron DeSantis, who ran for governor, in Florida\u2019s sixth congressional district. Waltz served multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, and he was awarded four bronze stars. He was one of the lawmakers appointed in July to serve on a bipartisan congressional taskforce to investigate the attempted assassination of Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. The judge who presided over Donald Trump\u2019s hush money case has paused legal proceedings at the request of prosecutors and the president-elect\u2019s attorneys, both of whom pointed to his victory in last week\u2019s presidential election. Republicans are getting ready for Trump\u2019s visit to the White House, with House speaker Mike Johnson saying he planned to have Trump address his lawmakers. Speaking of Congress, we still do not know for sure which party will control the House for the next two years. Counting of ballots in key races remains ongoing, though Republicans seem on track to keep their majority. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Samuel Alito, a long-serving conservative justice on the supreme court, has no plans to step down, the Wall Street Journal reported. If he changes his mind, Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate could confirm a replacement and likely prolong the court\u2019s conservative supermajority. Trump will reportedly oppose a US law that could lead to popular social media app TikTok being banned, despite bipartisan support for the measure. Despite taking office with Republicans in control of Congress in 2017, Trump\u2019s first years in office were marked by legislative chaos. Johnson vowed that won\u2019t happen again when Trump returns to the White House in January. As Donald Trump appoints his cabinet, and searches for a treasury secretary, the billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson \u2013 a key backer of the president-elect \u2013 has withdrawn his name. He had been widely tipped as a likely candidate for the role. \u201cAlthough various media outlets have mentioned me as a candidate for secretary of the treasury, my complex financial obligations would prevent me from holding an official position in President Trump\u2019s administration at this time,\u201d Paulson told The Wall Street Journal in a statement. He pledged to remain \u201cactively involved\u201d with Trump\u2019s economic team, however, and in helping to implement the incoming administration\u2019s policy agenda. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, Bob Casey still is not conceding, despite grim signs for the Democratic senator\u2019s prospects of re-election. The Associated Press has already called the race for Republican challenger David McCormick, but ballot counting is ongoing. In a new statement, Casey signaled he is waiting for that process to finish: My priority has always been standing up for the people of Pennsylvania. Across our Commonwealth, close to seven million people cast their votes in a free and fair election. Our county election officials will finish counting those votes, just like they do in every election. The American democratic process was born in Pennsylvania and that process will play out. I want to thank the election workers across our Commonwealth who have been working diligently over the weekend. Their work will ensure Pennsylvanians\u2019 voices are heard.\u201d If Donald Trump follows through on his promise to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrations, his \u201cborder tsar\u201d Tom Homan will play a leading role. Here\u2019s more about his rise to power, from the Guardian\u2019s Rachel Leingang: In 2018, then acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) Thomas Homan told HuffPost that Congress needed to fix immigration laws because: \u201cI\u2019m the first one to say, I can\u2019t arrest 11 million people.\u201d Now, newly tapped as Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cborder tsar\u201d, he will be tasked with just that. The president-elect said on Monday that Homan, a former law enforcement official who has served in immigration enforcement under multiple presidencies, would be \u201cin charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin\u201d. Homan has been describing mass deportation in stark terms for the past year, angling for a role in helping Trump with his signature campaign promise. Asked about the high price tag of a mass deportation, he turned the question back on 60 Minutes: \u201cWhat price do you put on our national security? Is it worth it?\u201d When the outlet followed up to ask if there was a way for mass deportations not to separate families with mixed immigration statuses, Homan responded: \u201cFamilies can be deported together.\u201d It is a likely next step for a man who served as acting director of Ice for 16 months under Trump in what was seen as a period of intense controversy for the agency. The Atlantic documented how Homan was the \u201cfather\u201d of the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy, tracing its roots to a 2014 meeting during which Homan pushed the idea. He defended the policy to the outlet by saying: \u201cThe goal wasn\u2019t to traumatize. The goal was to stop the madness, stop the death, stop the rape, stop the children dying, stop the cartels doing what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Donald Trump on Sunday announced that Tom Homan, a proponent of hardline immigration policies including separating migrant parents from their children, will become his \u201cborder tsar\u201d. Homan has made clear he\u2019ll continue pushing for policies that would crack down on people who have entered the United States illegally. Yesterday, he told the New York Post that he would surge immigration officers onto the streets of cities that refuse to allow them into their jails: Homan \u2014 whom Trump tasked with both securing the border and carrying out the deportation of millions of migrants who are in the US illegally \u2014 told The Post that he wants his boss to put maximum pressure on the leaders of New York and other sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with efforts to lock up and deport migrants who commit crimes in the US. \u201cI\u2019m hoping the president files a lawsuit against them and withholds federal funding,\u201d Homan said. He said that he would rather work with local cops to identify migrants who have been arrested and take them into ICE custody. But, if police are barred from helping the feds identify suspects, \u201cthen we\u2019ll wait til they get out of jail, then we\u2019ll go out into the neighborhoods and get them.\u201d He added: \u201cIf they\u2019re not willing to do it then get out of the way \u2014 we\u2019re coming.\u201d Homan said enforcing immigration laws like that will require a lot of manpower, \u201cso if I have to flood agents to the sanctuary cities to get the job done then that\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do.\u201d Earlier, at the Capitol, Republican House speaker Mike Johnson pledged that his lawmakers will do all they can to help Donald Trump enact his policies. \u201cThis leadership will hit the ground running to deliver President Trump\u2019s agenda in the 119th Congress, and we will work closely with him and his administration to turn this country around and unleash, as he says, a new golden age in America,\u201d Johnson said. Trump began his first term in 2017 with both houses of Congress in Republican control, a situation that appears to be on track to happen again next year, since the GOP has recaptured the Senate and appears on course to preserve their house majority. But Trump and the Republicans were criticized for a chaotic and disorganized approach during his first two years in office (before the GOP lost control of the House in 2018 and, with it, the ability to pass major Trump-backed legislation) that led to many legislative priorities stalling. Johnson said that once Trump takes office next year, he will not let that happen again: When President Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, we all look back and recognize that the Republican Party was not fully prepared for that moment, and precious time was wasted in the beginning of that Congress. I know it well, because that was my freshman year in Congress \u2013 we began in 2017. We are not going to make those mistakes again. We will be ready on day one. We are prepared this time. And as we wind down, the 118th Congress will be ready to take the ball and run full speed in the 119th Congress that begins in January. Donald Trump will attempt to block a recently passed US law that could lead to popular social media app TikTok being banned, the Washington Post reports. The measure enacted with bipartisan support earlier this year imposes a 19 January deadline for Chinese firm ByteDance to sell its stake in TikTok or face a ban in the United States on national security grounds. The Post heard from Kellyanne Conway, a former advisor to Trump who now advocates for TikTok. She said: He appreciates the breadth and reach of TikTok, which he used masterfully along with podcasts and new media entrants to win \u2026 There are many ways to hold China to account outside alienating 180 million U.S. users each month. Trump recognized early on that Democrats are the party of bans \u2014 gas-powered cars, menthol cigarettes, vapes, plastic straws and TikTok \u2014 and to let them own that draconian, anti-personal choice space. TikTok is currently in court over the law, though no decision has yet been made: The Republican House speaker Mike Johnson said that their lawmakers are planning to meet with Donald Trump on Wednesday, before he heads to the White House to discuss the presidential transition with Joe Biden. \u201cPresident Trump is going to meet with President Biden at the White House. And so it was suggested \u2013 in fact \u2026 I think he said it first before I did \u2013 but that he wanted to come and visit with House Republicans. So, we\u2019re working out the details of him gathering with us potentially tomorrow morning before he goes to the White House, and that would be a great meeting and a moment for all of us,\u201d Johnson said. The speaker and other top Republicans just held a press conference at the Capitol to tout their victories in last Tuesday\u2019s election. While all the ballots have not been counted yet, the GOP appears on course to continue their majority in the House. New York Judge Juan Merchan halted proceedings in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money case after a request from the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, who cited the former president\u2019s victory in the presidential election, Reuters reports. The president-elect had asked Bragg to agree to the delay, and Merchan paused all proceedings through 19 November. Trump had been scheduled to be sentenced on 26 November. New York judge Juan Merchan has paused the proceedings in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money case, Reuters reports. Merchan was today expected to decide whether Trump\u2019s conviction on 34 felony charges related to falsifying business documents would be thrown out under the supreme court\u2019s ruling earlier this year granting presidents immunity for official acts. The judge\u2019s decision comes after Trump won the presidential election a week ago. Samuel Alito intends to continue serving on the supreme court, the Wall Street Journal reports, despite fears from liberals that the 74-year-old conservative justice will soon step down and allow Donald Trump and the newly Republican-controlled Senate to confirm a younger replacement. Such a decision by Alito could prolong the conservative dominance of the supreme court, where they have a six-justice supermajority and the liberals a three-justice minority. But the Journal says that Alito plans to stick around: \u201cDespite what some people may think, this is a man who has never thought about this job from a political perspective,\u201d said one person close to Alito. \u201cThe idea that he\u2019s going to retire for political considerations is not consistent with who he is.\u201d Trump\u2019s election last week set off renewed discussions over the future of the Supreme Court, where the three eldest justices are in their 70s. With Republicans set to take both the White House and Senate come January, there will be at least a two-year span when the GOP can fill vacancies without need of compromise with Democrats. Some Republicans have suggested that would be a good time for Alito, appointed in 2006 by President George W. Bush, and Justice Clarence Thomas, 76, a 1991 appointee of President George H.W. Bush, to step aside for younger nominees who could perpetuate the court\u2019s conservative direction for decades to come. A majority of Americans view the Supreme Court as politically motivated, public opinion surveys have shown. But across the ideological spectrum, the justices prefer to see themselves as standing apart from partisan politics, and Washington\u2019s postelection chatter is proving irksome within the court, people familiar with the matter said. The supreme court has turned down an effort by Donald Trump\u2019s former chief of staff Mark Meadows to move the Georgia election meddling case to federal court. Meadows first made the petition earlier this year, after the supreme court ruled that presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts. The case brought by Atlanta-area district attorney Fani Willis against Meadows, Trump and more than a dozen others for allegedly plotting to overturn the results of the election in Georgia has since stalled, and it is unclear if it will continue now that Trump is headed back to the White House. Here\u2019s more about Meadows\u2019s petition: The GOP is on track to maintain its majority in the House of Representatives, even as Democrats managed to claim a hotly contested seat in the Los Angeles suburbs. Yesterday, Republican congressman Mike Garcia conceded to his challenger George Whitesides in California\u2019s 27th congressional district, flipping a district that Democrats have wanted to conquer for the past two elections. But it may not be enough to return the party to the majority in Congress\u2019s lower chamber, and give them the ability to block Donald Trump\u2019s legislative agenda. The Associated Press reports that the GOP had won 214 seats in the House, four shy of the majority, while the Democrats have 205. Counting in 16 races is ongoing, many of which are swing seats where every vote will matter, but Republicans are generally seen as having the edge in several crucial races. We\u2019ll let you know if the AP calls any outstanding House races over the course of today. Joe Biden is meeting with two foreign leaders at the White House today. At 11.15am, he will speak with Israel\u2019s president Isaac Herzog, then with Indonesia\u2019s president, Prabowo Subianto, at 2pm. Biden is also scheduled to have a private lunch with Kamala Harris around noon. The vice-president has no other meetings publicly scheduled. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, the Democratic former Florida congresswoman who mounted an unsuccessful bid to unseat Republican Senator Rick Scott in last week\u2019s election, had a few words for Marco Rubio as he heads to the state department. \u201cCongrats @marcorubio on your appointment as US Secretary of State. I\u2019m sure in a few weeks, after January 20, you\u2019ll finally take down Maduro\u2019s narco-regime and free the Cuban people from D\u00edaz-Canel\u2019s communist dictatorship. It\u2019s been all talk so far\u2014let\u2019s see if you\u2019re actually ready to do something about it,\u201d she wrote on X. Those are references to Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicolas Maduro, and Cuba\u2019s president, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, both of whom leads governments Rubio is opposed to. Mucarsel-Powell lost badly to Scott last week, picking up just under 43% of the vote to the Republican\u2019s 55%, further confirming the strength of the Republican party in Florida. Should Florida senator Marco Rubio become Donald Trump\u2019s next secretary of state, Arkansas\u2019s Tom Cotton is set to become the chair of the Senate intelligence committee, Punchbowl News reports. Cotton, who is known for his hardline views on the US relationship with China, was seen as a potential contender for a cabinet post in a second Trump administration, but reportedly withdrew his name following the ex-president\u2019s election victory. Donald Trump is reportedly considering making North Dakota\u2019s governor, Doug Burgum, his new \u201cenergy tsar\u201d. The Financial Times were the first to report this on Friday. The outlet said that Burgum, who last year ran a short-lived campaign for the Republican nomination for president, is the president-elect\u2019s preferred candidate for the role, though former energy secretary Dan Brouillette is also said to be a strong contender. The role and its powers have yet to be finalised but the FT reports that role would likely replace the \u201cclimate tsar\u201d \u2013 or National Climate Advisor \u2013 established by the Biden administration. You can read more on Trump\u2019s (potential) cabinet picks here. As my colleagues Dharna Noor and Oliver Milman note in this story, Trump has pledged to deregulate the energy sector, allow the oil and gas industry to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d, and pull the US from the Paris climate agreement, which committed countries to taking steps to avoid the worst impacts of the crisis. Vietnam\u2019s Communist Party head To Lam has congratulated Donald Trump on his US presidential election victory in a phone call and the two discussed ways their countries could boost economic ties, according to the communist party. The US is Vietnam\u2019s largest export market, and the two countries upgraded their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership last September, the highest level in Vietnam\u2019s ranking. \u201cVietnam is ready to promote stable and long-term development of bilateral relations for the benefit of the people of the two countries,\u201d Lam said during the call, which took place on Monday, according to a statement posted on the communist party\u2019s website. Lam stated that Vietnam is ready to promote the stable and long-term development of the bilateral ties for the sake of the two peoples, as well as for regional and global peace, cooperation, and sustainable development\u2026 Trump expressed his satisfaction with the positive development in the bilateral relations, and affirmed the importance he attaches to the relationship with Vietnam, particularly economic cooperation. He highlighted specific areas of economic and trade collaboration that the US seeks to advance. Last week, officials and supply chain experts told Reuters Vietnam could face trade volatility with a new Trump presidency, as it could become \u201ccollateral damage\u201d of protectionist measures. Both leaders invited the other to visit their country, according to the party statement. Trump travelled to Vietnam twice in his first term as president, first to attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit and then for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. My colleague Rachel Leingang has done a profile on Tom Homan, the former law enforcement official who has been selected to be in charge of the country\u2019s borders following Trump\u2019s inauguration in January. Here is an extract from her piece: Homan has been describing mass deportation in stark terms for the past year, angling for a role in helping Trump with his signature campaign promise. Asked about the high price tag of a mass deportation, he turned the question back on 60 Minutes: \u201cWhat price do you put on our national security? Is it worth it?\u201d When the outlet followed up to ask if there was a way for mass deportations not to separate families with mixed immigration statuses, Homan responded: \u201cFamilies can be deported together.\u201d It is a likely next step for a man who served as acting director of Ice for 16 months under Trump in what was seen as a period of intense controversy for the agency. The Atlantic documented how Homan was the \u201cfather\u201d of the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy, tracing its roots to a 2014 meeting where Homan pushed the idea. He defended the policy to the outlet by saying: \u201cThe goal wasn\u2019t to traumatize. The goal was to stop the madness, stop the death, stop the rape, stop the children dying, stop the cartels doing what they\u2019re doing.\u201d This year, his speech to the Republican national convention started with a folksy \u201chow you doin\u2019\u201d and a shoutout to New York, his home state. He then launched into an impassioned speech defending Trump and lambasting the Biden administration on immigration, saying Joe Biden\u2019s policies were essentially \u201cnational suicide\u201d. \u201cAs a guy who spent 34 years deporting illegal aliens, I got a message to the millions of illegal aliens that Joe Biden\u2019s released in our country in violation of federal law: you better start packing now \u2013 you\u2019re damn right \u2013 because you\u2019re going home,\u201d he said, to raucous applause. To the cartels in Mexico trafficking fentanyl, he said: \u201cWhen President Trump gets back in office, he\u2019s going to designate you a terrorist organization. He\u2019s going to wipe you off the face of the earth. You\u2019re done.\u201d The Republicans already have a majority in the Senate and need to win just a few seats to take control of the 435-member House (a party needs 218 seats to win a House majority). According to our latest tally, Republicans have 214 seats, while the Democrats have 205. Keeping hold of the House would give Republicans sweeping powers to potentially enact a broad agenda of tax and spending cuts, energy deregulation and border security controls. As well as giving the party the power to initiate spending legislation, control of the House would allow Republicans to launch impeachment proceedings against officials. Steve Bannon is due in court today ahead of his trial on criminal fraud charges over a push to fund Trump\u2019s border wall, weeks after he was released from prison on a separate conviction. Bannon, the 70-year-old former Trump adviser, is scheduled to stand trial starting on 9 December in New York state court in Manhattan. Prosecutors allege that he deceived donors who contributed more than $15 million in 2019 to a private fundraising drive to build a barrier along the US-Mexico border. Bannon has pleaded not guilty. He is set to appear for a final pretrial conference before acting justice April Newbauer at 2:15 pm EST (1915 GMT). Last month, Bannon was released from prison, following a four-month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena in an investigation of the 6 January 2021 US Capitol attack. Robert Tait is a journalist based in Washington DC Donald Trump has demanded that the three frontrunners to lead the Senate allow him to appoint officials to his new administration without confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill, as a future Republican government began to take shape the week after his election victory. In a demonstration of his political muscle, the US president-elect urged support for \u201crecess appointments\u201d, which allow the president to make appointments while the Senate is temporarily paused, and can be used to circumvent the confirmation process, which can result in appointments being delayed or blocked. The demand amounted to a full-frontal intervention in this week\u2019s GOP\u2019s election for a new Senate leader to replace Mitch McConnell, the party\u2019s longtime leader who is retiring. The three men tipped to lead the Senate \u2013 Rick Scott, John Thune and John Cornyn \u2013 all quickly agreed to Trump\u2019s request. It also signalled Trump\u2019s determination to press ahead with his agenda without being encumbered by congressional oversight, which is mandated by the US constitution. You can read the full story here: Good morning, and welcome to our US politics blog. US President-elect Donald Trump announced several new members of his incoming administration on Monday, and is reportedly expected to name Marco Rubio \u2013 a one time challenger in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries \u2013 as secretary of state. It comes as justice Juan Merchan, a New York judge, is set to decide later today whether Trump\u2019s criminal conviction on charges involving hush money paid to a porn star should be overturned in light of the US Supreme Court\u2019s July ruling on presidential immunity. Meanwhile, officials at the US justice department are assessing how to wind down the two federal criminal cases brought against Trump by special counsel Jack Smith due to its longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting president. A separate case in Georgia involving state criminal charges concerning Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss remains in limbo. We will give you more on the developments in the legal cases Trump faces when news breaks throughout the day. Here are the main political appointments Trump has already made or is expected to announce shortly: The New York Times reports that Trump is expected to name Florida senator Marco Rubio his secretary of state. The paper cites three unnamed sources \u201cfamiliar with [Trump\u2019s] thinking\u201d. Rubio has said that Ukraine needs to seek a negotiated settlement with Moscow rather than focus on regaining all territory that Russia has taken in the last decade. He was also one of 15 Republican senators to vote against a $95 billion military aid package for Ukraine, passed in April. Rubio serves as the vice-chairman of the Senate intelligence committee and sits on the foreign relations committee. The US president-elect has reportedly asked US Representative Michael Waltz, a retired Army National Guard officer and war veteran, to be his national security adviser. Waltz, regarded by many in Washington as hawkish on China and Iran, has also been a member of the intelligence and foreign affairs committees. Trump picked South Dakota governor Kristi Noem to serve as the next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, CNN reported on Tuesday, citing two sources. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for a range of issues, including border protection, immigration, disaster response and the US secret service. Noem, once seen as a possible running mate for Trump, made headlines after refusing to impose a statewide mask mandate during the pandemic. Trump announced that the former New York congressman Lee Zeldin will be selected to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump, who oversaw the rollback of more than 100 environmental rules when he last was US president, said Zeldin was a \u201ctrue fighter for America First policies\u201d and that \u201che will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions\u201d. Stephen Miller, the author of Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cMuslim ban\u201d immigration policy during his first term, is set to be his deputy chief of staff with a broad portfolio. Trump said on Sunday that Tom Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), will be in charge of the country\u2019s borders in his new administration. Homan told Fox News: \u201cIf sanctuary cities don\u2019t want to help us, then get the hell out of the way, because we\u2019re coming.\u201d New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, 40, has been made ambassador to the United Nations. Stefanik, a Trump-skeptic turned Trump-ally, is the House Republican Conference chair, making her the fourth-ranking House Republican. On Thursday, Trump made his first appointment, naming Susie Wiles, who has worked on Republican campaigns since the days of Ronald Reagan, White House chief of staff. She was previously the campaign manager for his victorious bid for re-election.",

Pressure on Welby had intensified since the publication last week of a damning report on the Church of England\u2019s cover-up of abuse by John Smyth in the UK in the late 1970s and early 80s, and later in Zimbabwe and, it is suspected, South Africa. The Daily Express and the Mirror both splash on Welby\u2019s \u201cprofound sense of shame\u201d at what the Express calls \u201chis failure to bring a child abuser to justice\u201d. The Mirror highlights the finding of a report released last week that Smyth could have faced justice before his death in 2018 if Welby had formally reported it to police. Welby could lose his seat in the House of Lords, the Daily Mail says, dedicating its front page to a \u201cchurch in crisis\u201d.

The Times reports that the resignation is \u201cwithout precedent\u201d and attributes Welby\u2019s decision to \u201cgrowing pressure from priests serving on the church\u2019s General Synod and, crucially, from the Bishop of Newcastle\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A senior adviser to US president-elect Donald Trump has fuelled speculation about the future of Australia\u2019s ambassador to Washington, former prime minister Kevin Rudd, by reposting Rudd\u2019s congratulatory statement to Trump on social media with a gif of an hourglass. The provocative time-is-running-out post by former Trump deputy chief of staff for communications Dan Scavino reignited suggestions that the incoming president may prefer another Australian representative in Washington when he takes office in January. Scavino spoke at Trump\u2019s now-infamous Madison Square Garden rally in New York ahead of the election and was billed as a \u201csenior adviser\u201d. A new video emerged earlier this week of Rudd in an interview in 2021 describing Trump as \u201ca village idiot\u201d and \u201cnot a leading intellectual force\u201d. Rudd last week \u2013 following the US election \u2013 deleted old social media posts criticising Trump. There are no formal protocols for challenging the status of incumbent foreign diplomats upon a change of US administration. But Trump has already banished one high-profile diplomat from a significant ally in the past, effectively forcing the withdrawal of then-British ambassador Kim Darroch in 2019 after leaked cables revealed past personal criticisms of the president. Darroch\u2019s situation was different to Rudd\u2019s because the British ambassador\u2019s criticisms were contemporary, not historical. Nevertheless, there is now concern in Australian government and diplomatic circles that the personal nature of some of Rudd\u2019s past criticisms of Trump may be a bigger problem than first feared.

The groundings affected Jetstar, Qantas and Virgin Australia flights on Tuesday and Wednesday, leaving passengers stranded. The emergency began on Sunday when Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki volcano erupted, spewing an ash column 9km high. The event in East Nusa Tenggara province, which is about 500km from Bali, killed nine people and prompted the evacuation of more than 15,000 people close to the crater. A Bureau of Meteorology spokesperson said the Lewotobi Volcano had continued to erupt over the past fortnight. Easterly winds have brought volcanic ash over Denpasar airport and the airspace to the south of the airport. It was due to hit Bali and parts of northern Australia across Wednesday, according to the BoM. \u201cVolcanic ash is expected to move over Bali and adjacent maritime environment to the south including parts of northern Australian airspace until dissipating late tonight,\u201d the bureau said. \u201cFlights in and out of Denpasar, Bali have been disrupted today due to volcanic ash currently approaching Denpasar airport and airspace. Airlines and airport operators continue to conduct their own risk assessment of the situation.\u201d Two Qantas return flights had been delayed, one flight on Tuesday and one on Wednesday, scheduled to go from Australia to Denpasar. Ten Virgin flights in and out of Indonesia on Wednesday were cancelled, with a spokesperson citing \u201cadverse weather.\u201d \u201cThe safety of our guests and crew is our highest priority.

It is a delight to see this young woman with the soul of a high romantic \u2013 who positively swoons over music, books and the trappings of a cultural life \u2013 shun love in favour of a deeper connection to the self. She has much in common with Henry James\u2019s Isabel Archer and George Eliot\u2019s Dorothea Brooke, but she doesn\u2019t let the marriage plot overwhelm her as they do.

His wooing of her takes place over years and the will she/won\u2019t she tension of his proposal becomes the engine that keeps the show moving.</p> <p>It\u2019s good the story is so simple, because the music is intricate and complex, ranging from that rock-inflected opening through folk, pop and even a moment or two of hip-hop. It has its fair share of traditionally structured musical theatre numbers that establish a primary mood and resolve neatly, but it also has sweeping solos full of jagged, lurching rhythms and oddly digressive phrasing.

The first act is raucous and mercurial, highly spirited and broadly comic. The second act is more delicate and naturalistic, save a hilarious discursion involving Sybylla\u2019s aborted time as a governess of the M\u2019Swat children (cue a brilliant barrage of hard, flat rhymes like grot and snot).

Russian troops were focusing on the areas around Vremivka, Gulyaipole and Robotyne. He said Ukraine had bolstered its defensive lines in the frontline sector.</p></li> <li><p><strong>More than 10,000</strong> <strong>North Korean troops have begun engaging in combat operations alongside Russian forces</strong>, mostly in the far western Kursk oblast, the US state department said.

He will hold talks in Brussels on Wednesday on how to boost support for Ukraine, leaving the same day for a conference in Latin America.</p></li> <li><p>Ukraine said on Tuesday that a <strong>Russian strike on Kryvyi Rih killed a 32-year-old mother and her three children, including a newborn</strong>. The strike a day earlier ripped into the upper storeys of a Soviet-era residential building in the industrial town, burying victims beneath debris.</p></li> <li><p>A <strong>majority of Ukrainians</strong><strong> oppose giving up any land captured by Russia in exchange for peace</strong>, a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology has found. \u201cAs of the beginning of October 2024, despite all the difficult circumstances, the majority of Ukrainians \u2013 58% \u2013 opposed any territorial concessions,\u201d the survey said. There were 32% ready for territorial concessions \u2013 at the beginning of the war it was 10%. While a majority of Ukrainians answered no when asked if they would approve generic territorial concessions, <strong>the numbers varied when pollsters asked if giving up some regions would be difficult, but acceptable</strong>. About 46% would be ready to accept giving up Donbas and Crimea, the poll said, with 39% saying such a compromise would be difficult.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has said \u201cnothing should be decided about Ukraine without the Ukrainians, nor about Europe without the Europeans\u201d.</strong> Speaking in Paris alongside the Nato chief, Mark Rutte, Macron said building up homegrown military capacity would be \u201ca long-term effort\u201d but Europe had for \u201ctoo long avoided bearing the burden of its own security\u201d.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Macron joined Rutte in calling North Korean troops\u2019 appearance alongside Russian soldiers \u201ca serious escalation\u201d</strong> in the Ukraine conflict that widened the threat to the Pacific, increasingly the Americans\u2019 priority theatre. \u201cWe must do more than just keep Ukraine in the fight.

Russian troops were focusing on the areas around Vremivka, Gulyaipole and Robotyne. He said Ukraine had bolstered its defensive lines in the frontline sector. More than 10,000 North Korean troops have begun engaging in combat operations alongside Russian forces, mostly in the far western Kursk oblast, the US state department said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine\u2019s president, meanwhile warned that Russia has prepared about 50,000 troops, including North Korean fighters, for an effort to expel Ukrainian forces from the Russian region of Kursk. Antony Blinken, Joe Biden\u2019s secretary of state, is heading to Europe on a flying visit for urgent meetings on Ukraine with Nato and EU officials. He will hold talks in Brussels on Wednesday on how to boost support for Ukraine, leaving the same day for a conference in Latin America. Ukraine said on Tuesday that a Russian strike on Kryvyi Rih killed a 32-year-old mother and her three children, including a newborn. The strike a day earlier ripped into the upper storeys of a Soviet-era residential building in the industrial town, burying victims beneath debris. A majority of Ukrainians oppose giving up any land captured by Russia in exchange for peace, a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology has found. \u201cAs of the beginning of October 2024, despite all the difficult circumstances, the majority of Ukrainians \u2013 58% \u2013 opposed any territorial concessions,\u201d the survey said. There were 32% ready for territorial concessions \u2013 at the beginning of the war it was 10%. While a majority of Ukrainians answered no when asked if they would approve generic territorial concessions, the numbers varied when pollsters asked if giving up some regions would be difficult, but acceptable. About 46% would be ready to accept giving up Donbas and Crimea, the poll said, with 39% saying such a compromise would be difficult. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has said \u201cnothing should be decided about Ukraine without the Ukrainians, nor about Europe without the Europeans\u201d. Speaking in Paris alongside the Nato chief, Mark Rutte, Macron said building up homegrown military capacity would be \u201ca long-term effort\u201d but Europe had for \u201ctoo long avoided bearing the burden of its own security\u201d. Macron joined Rutte in calling North Korean troops\u2019 appearance alongside Russian soldiers \u201ca serious escalation\u201d in the Ukraine conflict that widened the threat to the Pacific, increasingly the Americans\u2019 priority theatre. \u201cWe must do more than just keep Ukraine in the fight. We need to raise the cost for Vladimir Putin and his enabling and authoritarian friends by providing Ukraine with the support it needs to change the trajectory of the conflict \u2026 Russia, working together with North Korea, Iran and China, is not only threatening Europe \u2026 but also the Indo-Pacific and North America. So we must stand together.\u201d Kaja Kallas, the EU\u2019s incoming foreign policy chief, has called for China to face \u201ca higher cost\u201d for supporting Russia in the war against Ukraine, Jennifer Rankin writes from Brussels. In an overture to the future Donald Trump administration in the US, she said support for Ukraine was in Washington\u2019s interest. \u201cIf the US is worried about China, or other actors, then they should also be worried about how we respond \u2026 [to] Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, because we see how Iran, North Korea, China \u2013 more covertly \u2013 and Russia are working together.\u201d It comes after Donald Trump apparently chose a pair of establishment Republicans for senior roles in his administration.

      "bodyText": "The Catholic church has won a landmark case limiting its liability for the abuse of children by priests not under its direct employment. Lawyers immediately warned the case could have \u201cfar-reaching\u201d consequences for abuse survivors and called for legislative change to ensure institutions were held to account. Last year, Victoria\u2019s highest court delivered an unprecedented ruling that the church was vicariously responsible for the abuse of a five-year-old child, known as DP, by assistant priest Father Bryan Coffey. Vicarious liability is typically used to hold employers responsible for the wrongful or negligent actions of their employees during the course of their employment \u2013 regardless of whether the employer was at fault. The 2023 ruling was significant because Coffey, as an assistant parish priest, was not directly employed by the church. The Victorian court said that despite the lack of a formal employment arrangement, the church was vicariously liable for Coffey\u2019s actions because he was a \u201cservant of the diocese\u201d whose role gave him the \u201cpower and intimacy\u201d to access and abuse children. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The Victorian court of appeal said the diocese was \u201call-powerful in the management of clergy within a diocese\u201d and that the activities of an assistant parish priest were under the \u201cdirect control\u201d of the priest, who reported to the bishop. \u201cIn a real and relevant sense, Coffey was the servant of the diocese, notwithstanding that he was not, in a strict legal sense, an employee of it,\u201d the court ruled. The decision was expected to pave the way for countless survivors to seek greater compensation for their abuse. But the Catholic church on Wednesday successfully appealed the ruling in the high court. In a summary of its judgment, the high court said that expanding vicarious liability beyond the employer-employee relationship would create \u201cuncertainty and indeterminacy\u201d. \u201cA majority of the high court held that the principles of vicarious liability are confined to employment relationships, holding that the high court has repeatedly refused to extend the boundaries of the doctrine of vicarious liability to include independent contractors, or by reference to policy considerations,\u201d the summary stated. \u201cExpanding the doctrine to accommodate relationships that are \u2018akin to employment\u2019 would produce uncertainty and indeterminacy. As the priest was not an employee, there could be no finding of vicarious liability on the part of the diocese.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s decision prompted calls for law reform. The lawyers for DP, Ken Cush and Associates, said their client was \u201cdisappointed that the compensation for the sexual abuse of Coffey has been taken away by the law in Australia being unable to find the Bishop vicariously liable\u201d. \u201cHe hopes the Australian parliament will swiftly fix the law to help others,\u201d the firm said. DP said the case had been a \u201chard journey\u201d but thanked the court for its consideration and his legal team for their advocacy. Other firms raised concerns about the consequences of Wednesday\u2019s ruling for survivors. Maurice Blackburn principal lawyer John Rule, who specialises in abuse cases, said it put Australia at odds with similar jurisdictions such as the UK and Canada which allowed institutions to be held vicariously liable for abuse that occurred on their watch. \u201cThe church has known about its priests abusing children for centuries and did nothing to stop it,\u201d Rule said. \u201cUnfortunately, this decision means that in some cases the church will be able to again evade responsibility for the scourge of child abuse in its ranks.\u201d Ross Koffel, executive chairman at Koffels Solicitors and Barristers, said the decision was a \u201ccatastrophic blow\u201d to the victims of abuse by religious clergy and volunteers at other institutions. He said the NSW government had already changed the law to hold organisations vicariously liable. But those laws were not retrospective, he said, something that could be changed with a \u201csimple amendment\u201d. Jason Parkinson, principal at Porters Lawyers, said state government needed to urgently consider reforms to make clear that \u201ca priest or anyone in a religious capacity is the equivalent of an employee for the purposes of vicarious liability\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s up to each state government to urgently pass that legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise we\u2019re going to have despondent people taking their own lives. There\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d The high court delivered two separate rulings on Wednesday relating to another legal argument commonly used by the church \u2013 the use of permanent stays to halt abuse compensation claims. Permanent stays are granted in cases where a court rules no fair trial is possible, including due to the passage of time and the death of key witnesses. In two separate cases, the high court rejected the use of stays by the Queensland government and the Salvation Army to block survivors\u2019 claims for compensation. The Salvation Army had sought to permanently stay \u2013 or halt \u2013 a compensation claim brought by an abuse survivor known as RC, who alleged abuse at a residential home in 1959 and 1960. He alleged he reported the abuse and that the Salvation Army had a duty of care to protect him from harm. The Salvation Army applied for a permanent stay because of the death of the alleged perpetrator and other witnesses. It argued the deaths meant it was unable to mount a fair defence to the claim. Guardian Australia revealed last year that this argument was being adopted regularly in historical abuse cases, causing profound harm to survivors, who face enormous barriers delaying their ability to come forward. The high court overturned the decision granting the Salvation Army a permanent stay on Wednesday. It also partially overturned a decision to grant the Queensland government a permanent stay for an abuse case brought by a former resident of a state dormitory in the 1950s.",
