      "body": "<p>Welcome to the Sisterhood \u2013 equal parts nunnery, finishing school, psychic gymnasium and political thinktank. Run by wise older ladies decked out in austere black, educating impulsive young women to become the sage leaders of the future, its project is to nurture a heroine who can run the Sisterhood\u2019s home planet, as well as all the neighbouring ones. It might just save humanity.</p> <p>In 10 millennia\u2019s time, the Sisterhood will become the Bene Gesserit, a band of women with formidable mind-control abilities who feature in Frank Herbert\u2019s 1965 book Dune and its film adaptations: Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Rampling and L\u00e9a Seydoux played BG members in the Denis Villeneuve movies. Dune: Prophecy \u2013 a six-part drama inspired, vaguely controversially, not by Herbert\u2019s own canonical writing, but by a spin-off book co-written by his son Brian in 2012 \u2013 provides the Bene Gesserit\u2019s foundation story.</p> <p>There is backstory to plough through, however, before we can settle into the corridors, libraries and dojos of the Sisterhood. Two generations ago, war raged between sentient machines and humans \u2013 in the aftermath, the Sisterhood\u2019s Mother Superior laid down a grave deathbed pronouncement, warning of a reckoning, an awful judgment by a tyrannical power. Only her anointed successor, Valya Harkonnen, could stop it. Now Valya is scheming to take over the Imperium, the region\u2019s government, at a time when its leader, Emperor Corrino, has been weakened by military misadventure. But just as she plans the Sisterhood\u2019s big move, it seems the reckoning might have arrived.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzVHWNosS2o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CzVHWNosS2o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Dune: Prophecy trailer \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Dune: Prophecy, developed by Alison Schapker and Diane Ademu-John, is dominated by women at every level. As well as the community leaders being female, key characters such as rebel double agent Mikaela (Shalom Brune-Franklin), powerful clairvoyant \u201ctruthsayer\u201d Kasha (Jihae) and the emperor\u2019s disruptive old flame Francesca (Tabu) are women as well, something that would have been unthinkable in a show like this had it aired 20 or even 10 years ago, although a gender imbalance the other way round would have gone unnoticed.</p> <p>But its critique of patriarchy, where the men in charge are drawn to waging war as a way to compensate for personal weakness, is a subtle one \u2013 as is any assessment of the dynamics of an all-female hierarchical establishment. At its core, Dune: Prophecy is a fantasy saga much like any other, albeit with a little more thoughtfulness and a lot less machismo.</p> <p>The drama revolves around the relationship between Valya (Emily Watson) and her sister and second-in-command, Tula (Olivia Williams), siblings with temperaments that jar enough to cause perennial friction, but not enough to split them apart. Valya is the leader, restlessly ambitious, her compassion hidden behind several layers of hard-won realism; Tula is her conscience, lacking her elder sibling\u2019s killer instinct and forever looking to temper it, without necessarily disapproving altogether. Watson and Williams, one steely but soft-centred and the other the opposite, interlock precisely: you relax into the sheer quality of both performances whenever they\u2019re on screen together.</p>    <p>The interplay between Emperor Corrino (Mark Strong), a chest-first army man who insists on being in charge but wavers at key moments, and his cannier wife, Natalya (Jodhi May), who yearns to take over and kick a few people up in the air, is fascinating as well. But are these delicate contrasts enough, particularly when the early episodes have a ton of exposition and world-building to deal with, most of which is done verbally?

      "bodyText": "Welcome to the Sisterhood \u2013 equal parts nunnery, finishing school, psychic gymnasium and political thinktank. Run by wise older ladies decked out in austere black, educating impulsive young women to become the sage leaders of the future, its project is to nurture a heroine who can run the Sisterhood\u2019s home planet, as well as all the neighbouring ones. It might just save humanity. In 10 millennia\u2019s time, the Sisterhood will become the Bene Gesserit, a band of women with formidable mind-control abilities who feature in Frank Herbert\u2019s 1965 book Dune and its film adaptations: Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Rampling and L\u00e9a Seydoux played BG members in the Denis Villeneuve movies. Dune: Prophecy \u2013 a six-part drama inspired, vaguely controversially, not by Herbert\u2019s own canonical writing, but by a spin-off book co-written by his son Brian in 2012 \u2013 provides the Bene Gesserit\u2019s foundation story. There is backstory to plough through, however, before we can settle into the corridors, libraries and dojos of the Sisterhood. Two generations ago, war raged between sentient machines and humans \u2013 in the aftermath, the Sisterhood\u2019s Mother Superior laid down a grave deathbed pronouncement, warning of a reckoning, an awful judgment by a tyrannical power. Only her anointed successor, Valya Harkonnen, could stop it. Now Valya is scheming to take over the Imperium, the region\u2019s government, at a time when its leader, Emperor Corrino, has been weakened by military misadventure. But just as she plans the Sisterhood\u2019s big move, it seems the reckoning might have arrived. Dune: Prophecy, developed by Alison Schapker and Diane Ademu-John, is dominated by women at every level. As well as the community leaders being female, key characters such as rebel double agent Mikaela (Shalom Brune-Franklin), powerful clairvoyant \u201ctruthsayer\u201d Kasha (Jihae) and the emperor\u2019s disruptive old flame Francesca (Tabu) are women as well, something that would have been unthinkable in a show like this had it aired 20 or even 10 years ago, although a gender imbalance the other way round would have gone unnoticed. But its critique of patriarchy, where the men in charge are drawn to waging war as a way to compensate for personal weakness, is a subtle one \u2013 as is any assessment of the dynamics of an all-female hierarchical establishment. At its core, Dune: Prophecy is a fantasy saga much like any other, albeit with a little more thoughtfulness and a lot less machismo. The drama revolves around the relationship between Valya (Emily Watson) and her sister and second-in-command, Tula (Olivia Williams), siblings with temperaments that jar enough to cause perennial friction, but not enough to split them apart. Valya is the leader, restlessly ambitious, her compassion hidden behind several layers of hard-won realism; Tula is her conscience, lacking her elder sibling\u2019s killer instinct and forever looking to temper it, without necessarily disapproving altogether. Watson and Williams, one steely but soft-centred and the other the opposite, interlock precisely: you relax into the sheer quality of both performances whenever they\u2019re on screen together. The interplay between Emperor Corrino (Mark Strong), a chest-first army man who insists on being in charge but wavers at key moments, and his cannier wife, Natalya (Jodhi May), who yearns to take over and kick a few people up in the air, is fascinating as well. But are these delicate contrasts enough, particularly when the early episodes have a ton of exposition and world-building to deal with, most of which is done verbally? The early episodes do have some treacherous sex and a few nasty deaths, but even the fatalities are cerebral: the doomed meet their fate by having visions so vivid they prove to be lethal, or \u2013 when the killer is in the room with them \u2013 by being willed to die by an opponent with stronger mental powers than their own. With much of the dialogue concerning psychic insights, cryptic prophecies, religious beliefs and political strategies, at times Dune: Prophecy feels like a show where people discuss what has happened and will happen more than they make things happen themselves. It\u2019s slowed further when, having started by briefly introducing the young-adult Tula (Emma Canning) and Valya (Jessica Barden) in an establishing preamble, it skips back to this earlier timeline later on, in scenes that struggle to add anything not already demonstrated by the characters\u2019 older selves. Dune: Prophecy looks great, with its crisp monochrome styling and its nicely alien architecture, the latter based around the hairpin curves evoked by the franchise\u2019s title font. The world it builds \u2013 intense, intellectual, unforgivingly meritocratic and yet tinged with the unpredictable and supernatural \u2013 is a template for a bracingly different kind of science fiction.

      "bodyText": "Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run interior ministry has said that at least 20 people have been killed in an operation targeting \u201cgangs\u201d accused of looting trucks bringing aid into the war-torn territory which is facing the threat of famine. Gunmen attacked and looted about 100 trucks carrying desperately needed supplies over the weekend, the biggest such attack during 13 months of war in the territory and new evidence of the growing power of Gaza\u2019s criminal gangs. In a statement late on Monday, the Gaza interior ministry said that more than 20 people had been killed \u201cin a security operation carried out by security forces in cooperation with tribal committees\u201d. The statement said that thefts had \u201cseverely affected society and led to signs of famine in southern Gaza\u201d, and warned that the operation was the start of a broader campaign to tackle the problem. An interior ministry source told AFP the 20 were killed in connection with the looting on Saturday of a convoy which was transporting thousands of tonnes of food provided by the UN agencies Unrwa and the World Food Programme (WFP). It was attacked shortly after entering Gaza on Saturday, UN officials and local community leaders said. Ninety-eight trucks of the 109-truck convoy were looted and some transporters were injured during the incident, said Louise Wateridge, Unrwa\u2019s senior emergency officer. The incident \u201chighlights the severity of access challenges of bringing aid into southern and central Gaza\u201d, she told Reuters. \u201cThe urgency of the crisis cannot be overstated; without immediate intervention, severe food shortages are set to worsen, further endangering the lives of over 2 million people who depend on humanitarian aid to survive.\u201d Community leaders in central Gaza said local people had fought back against the looters of the convoy, who were armed with automatic rifles, and managed to retrieve some of the stolen trucks which were then returned to the WFP. A spokesperson for the Internally Displaced Civilians Association (IDCA) in Deir al-Balah said the attack meant that two bakeries serving roughly 1 million people in central Gaza had announced they would not be able to provide any bread until they receive new supplies. The IDCA, one of a number of informal groups that have sprung up to represent the interests of Gaza\u2019s 1.8 million displaced people, said Israeli authorities had been repeatedly warned that armed gangs were operating along roads leading into Gaza from specific entry points. \u201cA better route for aid was repeatedly proposed, but [the Israelis] have refused all these requests,\u201d the spokesperson said. UN officials said the convoy had been instructed by Israel to depart at short notice through an unfamiliar route from the Kerem Shalom border crossing. Gaza is facing deepening anarchy as the last remnants of civil order break down, leaving a vacuum increasingly filled by armed gangs, clans, powerful families and criminals. In April, aid officials said they feared Gaza would become \u201cMogadishu on the Mediterranean\u201d. The 13-month Israeli military offensive has removed Hamas from power in most of Gaza but the Islamist militant group has not been replaced by any other form of governance. Systematic targeting of Gaza\u2019s police force, which Israel considers part of Hamas, and the release of hundreds of prisoners from jails by the group early in the conflict have exacerbated the chaos. Waterbridge did not identify the attackers but UN officials have said that powerful families in the south of Gaza long known for their involvement in looting had been behind a series of attacks on convoys in recent weeks. \u201cThis isn\u2019t desperate people looking to feed themselves or their families. It is pure organised crime, by people who are heavily armed and making a lot of money. They are taking supplies paid for by member states. It\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d one senior aid official said earlier this month. Aid officials in Gaza describe the situation in much of the territory, where more than 80% of the population of 2.3 million have been displaced and more than two-thirds of buildings have been destroyed or damaged in 13 months of war, as \u201capocalyptic\u201d. An Israeli official said Israel had been working to address the humanitarian situation since the start of the war, but blame aid organisations and the UN for failing to distribute aid that is cleared for entry to Gaza. A WFP spokesperson confirmed the looting and said that many routes in Gaza were currently unpassable because of security issues. A UN aid official said on Friday that delivering aid across Gaza was now more difficult than ever before, with parts of the besieged north of the territory almost impossible to reach. Israel\u2019s devastating military campaign in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel last year.",

No progress has been made on the deal since early this year after the last round of talks concluded. As prime minister, Boris Johnson promised a swift deal, but Rishi Sunak was said to be deeply uneasy with some of the provisions that had been negotiated by his predecessor. Talks were put on hold in March while both countries prepared for general elections. The deal was originally believed to be based on broad agreement for lower tariffs on whisky and cars from the UK and tariff reductions on Indian textiles, as well as more visas for tech workers and students. But there were significant concerns about the deal for UK services, which make up 80% of the economy, to give them access to the Indian market. India has a population of 1.4 billion and its economy is predicted to become the world\u2019s third largest by 2050.

The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, will be questioned by MPs on the cross-party Treasury select committee on Tuesday and is expected to be asked about the impact of the budget on Bank policy. Bailey caused a stir last week when he waded into the debate about the impact of Brexit, saying it was \u201cweighing\u201d on the UK economy and urging the government to strike up a closer relationship with the EU. The outlook for the global economy has been clouded significantly by the election of Trump, who plans to impose tariffs \u2013 import taxes \u2013 on all foreign goods flowing into the US.",

      "bodyText": "Pennsylvania counties must not count mail-in ballots from voters who did not date their envelopes, the state supreme court ruled on Monday, ending a simmering issue in which some Democratic counties were ignoring prior court rulings and counting the ballots anyway. \u201c[W]e have clarified that mail-in and absentee ballots that fail to comply with the requirements of the Pennsylvania Election Code, shall not be counted for purposes of the election held on November 5, 2024,\u201d the majority wrote. Democrats hold a 5-2 majority on the Pennsylvania supreme court and Monday\u2019s decision was 4-3. Three of the five Democrats on the court dissented because they said it was premature for the court to intervene. The decision came after at least three counties in the state \u2013 Philadelphia, Montgomery and Bucks \u2013 all voted in recent days to count the undated ballots. While the state supreme court had ruled as recently as 1 November that undated mail-in ballots should not count for the 2024 election, Democrats in those counties had claimed there was some ambiguity and they should be counted.

      "body": "<p>Scotland had contributed far too much to the Nations League to finish bottom of Group A1. That was the harsh reality until Andy Robertson leapt like a Loch Tay salmon to meet John Souttar\u2019s superb stoppage-time cross, securing a famous win over Poland with a bullet header which rendered Lukasz Skorupski helpless. Steve Clarke\u2019s team live on, courtesy of a playoff berth. The scale of jubilation which greeted Robertson\u2019s winner told any onlooker how much that means.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to go to another tournament,\u201d Clarke said afterwards. \u201cThe playoff in March to stay at the highest level of the Nations League will set us up for a tough World Cup qualifying campaign. We are ready for it.\u201d When John McGinn sent Scotland ahead, thoughts were of another outcome. Had the result gone their way between Croatia and Portugal, it was conceivable Clarke\u2019s men could finish second. Ultimately that other tie was immaterial but this one was not. Scotland and their support celebrated in epic style courtesy of Robertson\u2019s late intervention, which instead sends Poland into the second tier. Their coach, Michal Probierz, may pay for that with his job.</p> <p>Scotland had no points after three group games and closed with seven. Clarke was public enemy No 1 after the trauma of the Euros in the summer. What transpired in Warsaw served as the latest triumph for Scotland\u2019s management. It was poetic for Robertson, on the site of his Scotland debut and, this time, his 80th cap.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/18/bullish-craig-bellamy-challenges-wales-to-be-one-of-the-top-national-teams\">Bullish Craig Bellamy challenges Wales to be \u2018one of the top national teams\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of good moments over my five-and-a-half years and this is just another step on the journey,\u201d Clarke said.</p> <p>The Scotland manager had indulged in pre-match kidology by suggesting Ben Doak might not start this tie. Leaving the 19-year-old among Scotland\u2019s substitutes would have ranked among the most bizarre managerial decisions of all, such was Doak\u2019s impact during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/15/scotland-croatia-nations-league-match-report\">last Friday\u2019s win over Croatia</a>. Doak was always going to play, primarily because of the panic his pace triggers among opposition defenders. Doak has gained exalted standing among the Tartan Army.</p> <p>It was quickness of thought that allowed Doak to create Scotland\u2019s dream start. Billy Gilmour found the teenager with a fine pass. Doak looked up, spotted McGinn and cut the ball inside. The Aston Villa midfielder stroked home his 20th international goal from 18 yards. For context, that haul is one ahead of Ally McCoist. It is within 10 of Denis Law and Kenny Dalglish.</p> <p>Scotland played with swagger during those early exchanges. If Poland were rocked, it was totally understandable given their 5-1 Friday loss to Portugal. The hosts briefly found their feet, Karol Swiderski slamming wide after a Robertson error. Swiderski was then unable to beat an advancing Craig Gordon. Doak shot tamely at Skorupski as Scotland pursued leeway. Gilmour almost supplied it, with an outrageous long-range effort that rebounded off the crossbar. Scotland rightly sensed Polish defensive weakness. </p> <p>Doak fed Scott McTominay, who flicked the ball over Sebastian Walukiewicz but met his match in Skorupski. During a wildly entertaining pre-interval spell, McTominay cracked a post and Robertson had a shot bound for the top corner deflected wide. Poland were not without threat, Gordon once again belying his 41 years by frustrating Adam Buksa. That only one goal had been scored by the time the half-time whistle blew felt like an incredible anomaly.</p> <p>Souttar, a standout in Scotland\u2019s Nations League campaign, prevented a Poland equaliser within two minutes of the restart, blocking on the line as Jakub Kaminski seemed certain to score. With just 51 minutes played, the teams had shared 20 attempts at goal. Number 21 saw Doak play in McTominay, whose first-time shot flew high and wide. The flow of the game meant Scotland\u2019s single-goal advantage was unlikely to be sufficient.</p> <p>Kamil Piatkowski proved that very point in emphatic fashion. After Scotland only half-cleared a cross, Piotr Zielinski spotted the marauding defender. Piatkowski did not break stride, lashing the ball beyond Gordon from the edge of the penalty area. Poland were worthy of parity but Clarke\u2019s men were now in position to rue earlier wasted opportunities.</p> <p>It took a wonderful Skorupski save to prevent Lyndon Dykes from nodding the visitors back in front from a Gilmour cross. Dykes\u2019s continued prominence supplies tacit admission of the job Clarke is doing with Scotland, given this is a striker who has not scored a single League One goal for Birmingham this season. McTominay limped off 14 minutes from time. Exhaustion was commonplace. A Croatia equaliser in Split effectively closed the door on Scotland finishing second. Third was alive though: oh, how it was alive.</p>  ",

      "bodyText": "Scotland had contributed far too much to the Nations League to finish bottom of Group A1. That was the harsh reality until Andy Robertson leapt like a Loch Tay salmon to meet John Souttar\u2019s superb stoppage-time cross, securing a famous win over Poland with a bullet header which rendered Lukasz Skorupski helpless. Steve Clarke\u2019s team live on, courtesy of a playoff berth. The scale of jubilation which greeted Robertson\u2019s winner told any onlooker how much that means. \u201cWe want to go to another tournament,\u201d Clarke said afterwards. \u201cThe playoff in March to stay at the highest level of the Nations League will set us up for a tough World Cup qualifying campaign. We are ready for it.\u201d When John McGinn sent Scotland ahead, thoughts were of another outcome. Had the result gone their way between Croatia and Portugal, it was conceivable Clarke\u2019s men could finish second. Ultimately that other tie was immaterial but this one was not. Scotland and their support celebrated in epic style courtesy of Robertson\u2019s late intervention, which instead sends Poland into the second tier. Their coach, Michal Probierz, may pay for that with his job. Scotland had no points after three group games and closed with seven. Clarke was public enemy No 1 after the trauma of the Euros in the summer. What transpired in Warsaw served as the latest triumph for Scotland\u2019s management. It was poetic for Robertson, on the site of his Scotland debut and, this time, his 80th cap. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of good moments over my five-and-a-half years and this is just another step on the journey,\u201d Clarke said. The Scotland manager had indulged in pre-match kidology by suggesting Ben Doak might not start this tie. Leaving the 19-year-old among Scotland\u2019s substitutes would have ranked among the most bizarre managerial decisions of all, such was Doak\u2019s impact during last Friday\u2019s win over Croatia. Doak was always going to play, primarily because of the panic his pace triggers among opposition defenders. Doak has gained exalted standing among the Tartan Army. It was quickness of thought that allowed Doak to create Scotland\u2019s dream start. Billy Gilmour found the teenager with a fine pass. Doak looked up, spotted McGinn and cut the ball inside. The Aston Villa midfielder stroked home his 20th international goal from 18 yards. For context, that haul is one ahead of Ally McCoist. It is within 10 of Denis Law and Kenny Dalglish. Scotland played with swagger during those early exchanges. If Poland were rocked, it was totally understandable given their 5-1 Friday loss to Portugal. The hosts briefly found their feet, Karol Swiderski slamming wide after a Robertson error. Swiderski was then unable to beat an advancing Craig Gordon. Doak shot tamely at Skorupski as Scotland pursued leeway. Gilmour almost supplied it, with an outrageous long-range effort that rebounded off the crossbar. Scotland rightly sensed Polish defensive weakness. Doak fed Scott McTominay, who flicked the ball over Sebastian Walukiewicz but met his match in Skorupski. During a wildly entertaining pre-interval spell, McTominay cracked a post and Robertson had a shot bound for the top corner deflected wide. Poland were not without threat, Gordon once again belying his 41 years by frustrating Adam Buksa. That only one goal had been scored by the time the half-time whistle blew felt like an incredible anomaly. Souttar, a standout in Scotland\u2019s Nations League campaign, prevented a Poland equaliser within two minutes of the restart, blocking on the line as Jakub Kaminski seemed certain to score. With just 51 minutes played, the teams had shared 20 attempts at goal. Number 21 saw Doak play in McTominay, whose first-time shot flew high and wide. The flow of the game meant Scotland\u2019s single-goal advantage was unlikely to be sufficient. Kamil Piatkowski proved that very point in emphatic fashion. After Scotland only half-cleared a cross, Piotr Zielinski spotted the marauding defender. Piatkowski did not break stride, lashing the ball beyond Gordon from the edge of the penalty area. Poland were worthy of parity but Clarke\u2019s men were now in position to rue earlier wasted opportunities. It took a wonderful Skorupski save to prevent Lyndon Dykes from nodding the visitors back in front from a Gilmour cross. Dykes\u2019s continued prominence supplies tacit admission of the job Clarke is doing with Scotland, given this is a striker who has not scored a single League One goal for Birmingham this season. McTominay limped off 14 minutes from time. Exhaustion was commonplace. A Croatia equaliser in Split effectively closed the door on Scotland finishing second. Third was alive though: oh, how it was alive.",

      "bodyText": "Ewan Murray has filed his match report in double-quick time so I\u2019ll leave you with that. Goodnight. Full time: Croatia 1-1 Portugal It\u2019s all over in Split, which confirms that Scotland have finished third in Group A1. Portugal 14pts Croatia 8 Scotland 7 Poland 3 Scotland will now play one of the League B runners-up in a two-legged tie in March, with the second leg at home. Their potential opponents are: Greece Austria Turkey/Wales/Iceland Czech Republic/Georgia/Albania/Ukraine The entire Scotland party \u2013 players, staff and fans - are beaming with joy. For once Scotland have inflicted late heartbreak instead of suffering it. Poland are relegated to the second tier, an objectively harsh outcome after a pulsating game that could have gone either way. Not that Scotland will care. They picked up one point from the first four games, then added six more in four days by beating Croatia and Poland. And they revealed Ben Doak to the world. Scotland go into the relegation playoffs after a famous win in Warsaw! 90+4 min McGinn is booked for timewasting. He wasn\u2019t on a yellow. In fact none of the players who started the game on a yellow have been booked tonight. Robertson has looked shattered for the last half hour but he still had the will to produce a famous winner. John Souttar, deep on the right wing, curled a De Bruyneish cross towards the far post, where Robertson leapt in front of Zalewski and slammed a header into the net via the post. What a finish! The elemental force named Andy Robertson has won it for Scotland! 90 min Four minutes of added time. 90 min Another Scotland corner is flapped away by Skorupski. The ball bounces up at McLean, whose clever lobbed header ripples the roof of the net. A nice effort but it was really difficult to score from there. 89 min The corner is headed away to Gauld on the edge of the area. He tries to lob it back towards Hanley at the far post but overhits it; goalkick to Poland. 88 min Robertson\u2019s cross is headed behind by Puchacz for a corner\u2026 87 min: Scotland substitution One last push. Stuart Armstrong replaces the superb Billy Gilmour, who looks shattered. His last contribution was to wheeze about 60 yards towards his own goal to make a crucial interception and thwart a dangerous break. 86 min A lovely cross from McGinn on the left is met by Christie, stooping in front of Walukiewicz at the far post, but it hits him on the shoulder rather than the head and bounces into the hands of Skorupski. That was Scotland\u2019s best chance for a while, althorugh it was still relatively tricky. 84 min Robertson shoots wastefully over the bar from 20 yards with Scotland in a half-decent position. 82 min As things stand Scotland will go into Pot 3 for the World Cup qualification draw next month. There are no terrifying teams in to Pot 2 (famous last words) so, while it\u2019s not ideal, it\u2019s not a devastating blow. 81 min Maybe the substitutions have interrupted the flow of the game, or maybe the players who started are completely shattered. Either way, Scotland don\u2019t look like scoring at the moment; nor do Poland in truth. 79 min Zielinski is booked, I didn\u2019t see what for. Normally matches of this importance crescendo but the last 10 minutes have been the least eventful of the match. 76 min: Double substitution for Scotland Nicky Devlin and Ryan Gauld replace Anthony Ralston and the limping Scott McTominay. 76 min: Poland substitution Kacper Urbanski comes on for Karol Swiderski, who was dangerous but wayward. 74 min Nothing much has happened in the last few minutes, and the players who started the game are looking very tired. Scotland still have plenty to play for: if they win they will avoid automatic relegation and have a better chance (in theory) of qualifying for the World Cup. it\u2019s off 70 min Christie is booked for a foul on Puchacz. He wasn\u2019t on a yellow card\u2026 he is now! 69 min Robertson\u2019s corner from the right is headed dangerously across goal towards Hanley. A Poland defender heads it up in the and Souttar, running beyond the near post, can\u2019t twist his neck sufficiently to get his header back on target. Very difficult chance. 68 min A reminder that a draw is about as much use to Scotland as a marzipan di- chocolate teapot. 66 min: Double substitution for Scotland Lawrence Shankland and Ryan Christie come on for Lyndon Dykes and Ben Doak. Very surprised to see Doak come off. 66 min Buksa volleys over from beyond the far post. A very tight angle. 65 min: Brilliant save by Skorupski! Gilmour, on the right side of the area, teases a ross towards Dykes. There\u2019s no pace on the ball but he strains his neck muscles to force the header as far across goal as possible. He does a pretty good job, too, but Skorupski springs dramatically to his left to make a terrific save. 63 min: Poland substitution Tymoteusz Puchacz replaces the impressive wing-back Jakub Kaminski. He\u2019s only 22 and \u2013 you\u2019re welcome, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion - looks like one to watch. 61 min Zalewski\u2019s shot is desperately blocked after a dangerous run infield from the right. This game is a rare old slugfest. That\u2019s an awesome strike from Piatkowski, as true as a dying man\u2019s final words Scotlland struggled to clear a cross from the left and were unable to get out. Szymanski, on the edge of the area, played an inviting square pass to his right for the onrushing Piatkowski. He ran onto the ball and smashed a rising drive across Gordon and into the top corner. I doubt any goalkeeper in history would have saved that. Kamil Piatkowski equalises with a heatseeker! 58 min Kaminski cuts inside from the left, gets into the area and backheels the ball to Szymanski. His precise cutback is crucially cut out by the stretching McLean. Poland have played some really neat football at times. 57 min A quiet few minutes, as if the two boxers are taking a round off to recharge for the final push. 55 min No chance this game ends 1-0. Both teams look really dangerous, particularly in transition. 53 min McTominay curls over from the edge of the box after another good Scotland break. Doak\u2019s pass was slightly behind him. 51 min This game is being shown on YouTube on the official Scotland National Team channel. A colleague tells me they had the comments bar open to everyone for the first half, England fans included. You can imagine the level of sophisticated discourse that ensued. For the first 10 minutes the only topics of discussion were Ben Doak, the lyrics of Leonard Cohen and the D\u00fcsseldorf School of painting. It\u2019s now been switched to subscriber-only mode\u2026 which appears to be pretty much the same. Oh, Scotland National Team. 49 min: Chance for Scotland! This match is a belter. McGinn leads a break, gets a return pass from McGinn and angles a cross towards McTominay (I think), waiting in front of an open goal at the far post. Kiwior slides in at the near post to concede a corner. Another brilliant bit of defending, especially as he risked an own goal. 47 min: Off the line by Souttar! Scotland are living so dangerously. Kaminski beats Robertson a bit too easily with a stepover and sweeps a low shot across goal from about 12 yards. It beats Gordon but is blocked in the six-yard box by the sliding Souttar. Sensational defending! 46 min Peep peep! Scotland begin the second half. Poland have brought on Bartosz Slisz for Jakub Moder. Half-time reading (Home Nations department) Kaminski flashes a curling shot just wide from the edge of the area. Gordon had it covered but it was a fine effort, one of many in a pulsating first half. John McGinn gave Scotland an early lead after great work from Billy Gilmour and Ben Doak, then Gilmour and Scott McTominay hit the woodwork. Despite that it was Poland who had the clearest chances in a ceaselessly entertaining half. As it stands, with Portugal 1-0 up in Split, Scotland are one goal away from finishing second in the group. 45 min: Great tackle by Souttar! This is a cracking game. Poland slice through Scotland in the centre of the pitch, not for the first time, with Zalewski playing a superb pass between the lines to Szymanski. He quickly moves the ball to his left for Swiderski, whose early shot is brilliantly blocked by the lunging Souttar. 42 min Scotland have been terrific in the last 10 minutes. Doak plays in the underlapping Ralston, whose low cross is desperately cut out by a Poland defender in the six-yard box. McGinn eventually collects and lays the ball to McTominay on the edge of the area, right of centre. He takes a touch and whistles an almost nonchalant drive across goal that thumps off the post. In fact, replays show it was a fantastic save by Skorupski, who dived low to his right to get a slight but decisive touch. Robertson\u2019s follow up goes just wide as well. 41 min As things stand, Croatia are ahead of Scotland only on goals scored. Away goals no longer count in head-to-heads, which is why other tiebreakers need to be used. Croatia beat Scotland 2-1 in the first game, Scotland won 1-0 on Friday night. While Scotland remain third in the group, it is truly, madly, deeply, undeniably, demonstrably, incontroveribly ON!!! 38 min Gordon makes another fine save, this time with his right foot, to keep out a low shot from Buksa. Scotland were suddenly exposed when Szymanski found space between the lines. He drew defenders towards him and teed up Buksa, whose shot was kicked behind by Gordon. Goal given! Croatia 0-1 Portugal 37 min A replay of Gilmour\u2019s shot suggests it took a slight deflection off a defender, which would explain the dramatic dip onto the crossbar. VAR check: Croatia 0-1 Portugal There\u2019s a never-ending VAR check going on in Split. 36 min Now it\u2019s McTomigol\u2019s turn to threaten. Doak curled a clever pass around Kiwior to find McTominay, who knocked the bouncing ball past Walukiewicz and pinged a low shot from 20 yards that was kicked away by Skorupski. Really good effort from McTominay, who had to take the short early with Piatkowski coming around. In the words of the greatest football liveblogger on the planet, IT\u2019S ON!!!! 33 min Almost a marvellous goal for Scotland. Gilmour received a short pass 30 yards from goal on the half turn \u2013 he\u2019s always on the half turn \u2013 pushed the ball into space and belted a dipping drive that beat the flying Skorupski and hit the underside of the crossbar. 33 min: Good effort by Dykes! Doak scurries down the right and crosses early to Dykes, back to goal 15 yards out. He turns smartly and spanks a shot that brushes the side netting at the near post. The keeper had it covered I think. 30 min Kenny McLean is booked for a foul on Szymanski. Scotland now have six players who are a yellow card away from missing the next game, if there is one. 29 min No news is good news for Scotland, who have had something resembling a breather for the last couple of minutes. 27 min Szymanski curls a decent effort from 25 yards that drifts not far wide. Poland have been the better team, certainly in the last 15 minutes. 23 min: Excellent save by Gordon! Swiderski runs onto a long ball over the top, controls the ball in mid air and screws a shot that is really well blocked by the outrushing Gordon. That\u2019s his best save so far. 22 min McGinn barrels forward on the break, past two players, and finds McTominay. He plays an angled pass to Doak, who half-beats his man with a stepover but then dribbles a shot into the arms of Skorupski. Another really promising run for Doak, even if the finish wasn\u2019t great. 21 min It feels like a goal is coming. The underlapping Zielinski gets away on the left of the area and cuts the ball back towards Szymanski (I think). His mishit half-volley across goal is booted away by somebody on the six-yard line. 20 min This is a good spell for Poland, who are pinning Scotland back and winning plenty of set pieces in the final third. 18 min: Swiderski misses a great chance! A very risky crossfield pass from Robertson is intercepted and pushed first time towards Zwaderski on the edge of the area. He\u2019s through on Gordon, no defender near him, but crashes a shot into the side netting at the near post. The \u2018at the near post\u2019 is entirely redundant there, isn\u2019t it. Not even Roy Race could crash an off-target shot into the side netting at the far post. 17 min That early goal was John McGinn\u2019s 20th for his country, taking him past Ally McCoist. Only Denis Law, Kenny Dalglish, Hughie Gallacher and Lawrie Reilly have scored more. 15 min Still goalless between Croatia and Portugal in Split. The permutations are complicated, even by permutations\u2019 standards, but as things stand Scotland are third in the group. 13 min Poland appeal for a penalty when a corner is flicked on at the near post and hits the hand of Gilmour. It was right in front of his face and, while you never quite know with handball in Uefa competitions, it looks like it\u2019s been cleared by VAR. 11 min: Good save by Gordon! A better effort from Piatkowski, a rising drive from 25 yards, is tipped off to his left by Gordon. 10 min Kaminski cuts inside dangerously from the right but shoots straight at Gordon from the edge of the area. It\u2019s end-to-end stuff, really exciting. 7 min Ben Doak, bloody hell! He absolutely roasts Zalewski on the left, gets to the byline in the area and slides a low cross that is kicked away. For a split-second it looked like Zalewski was going to bundle him over for a penalty. It\u2019s not just that Scotland may have found one that is so exciting; it\u2019s that he\u2019s a proper old-fashioned Scottish winger. What a fine goal, made by two of Scotland\u2019s brightest young things. Gilmour fired a brilliant pass between the lines to find Doak on the edge of the area. He got his head up and laid the ball back invitingly to McGinn, who dragged a precise first-time shot into the bottom corner with his right foot. Superb goal! And it\u2019s in there! 2 min Szymanski makes a really dangerous off-the-ball run, beyond the centre halves, and it needs Robertson to come across and make an important challenge. Actually, replays show Robertson was the reason Szymanski was onside in the first place so let\u2019s not overdo the praise eh. 1 min Peep peep! The match is under way. Mood music Look, it\u2019s dead simple: Scotland have to win. They just don\u2019t know what the prize will be if they do. Five of the Scotland XI are on a yellow card, which means another booking would rule them out ofthe first leg of a potential relegation playoff. They are: Anthony Ralston, Andy Robertson, Scott McTomigol, Grant Hanley and Billy Gilmour. Five of the Scotland XI are on a yellow card, which means another booking would rule them out of the quarter-final if Sc- no, I can\u2019t go there, this is getting silly. Let\u2019s try again. Ben Doak\u2019s performance on Friday night was missing only one thing. Imagine if somebody did this now. My favourite bit is the matter-of-fact way the commentator Arthur Montford says, \u201cMurray having a seat on the ball\u201d, as if it was as commonplace as a throw-in. Read Ewan Murray on Ben Doak Doak has searing pace and a direct style that appeals to the paying punter. What you see is what you get. His working-class roots are a welcome antidote to the sense football has become overpriced or unappealing to that group in society. Supporters can relate to Doak\u2019s personality and approach to the game. But he is also hugely effective; Josko Gvardiol looked terrified at times in Glasgow. Steve Clarke makes two changes to the team that beat Croatia: John McGinn and Lyndon Dykes replace Ryan Christie and Tommy Conway. Poland, who are without the injured Robert Lewandowski for this international break, make seven changes to the team that was hammered by Portugal on Friday. And if you think I\u2019m going to list them all, you\u2019ve got another thing coming. The survivors are the captain Piotr Zielinski, Jakub Kiwior, Nicola Zalewski and Kamil Piatkowski. Poland (3-5-2) Skorupski; Piatkowski, Walukiewicz, Kiwior; Kaminski, S Szymanski, Moder, Zielinski, Zalewski; Buksa, Swiderski. Substitutes: Bulka, Dragowski, Wieteska, Gurgul, Slisz, Urbanski, Bogusz, Puchacz, Kozubal, Kapustka, Marczuk, Piatek. Scotland (4-2-3-1) Gordon; Ralston, Souttar, Hanley, Robertson; Gilmour, McLean; Doak, McTominay, McGinn; Dykes. Substitutes: Slicker, Robby McCrorie, Shankland, Christie, Hendry, Barron, Taylor, McKenna, Armstrong, Conway, Gauld, Devlin. Referee Christian Dingert (Germany) The state of play in Group A1 Portugal 13pts Croatia 7 Poland 4 (GD-6) Scotland 4 (-2) Scotland\u2019s goal difference is superior, mainly because Poland were walloped 5-1 in Portugal, but the first tiebreaker is head-to-head record so they are in third place. It also means they can\u2019t go above Croatia \u2013 but Scotland can if they win and Portugal beat Croatia by in Split. Hang on, the quarter-finals of the Nations League: when did that happen? It\u2019ll be a 32-team jamboree by 2031, mark our words. So you\u2019re saying there\u2019s a chance? Scotland\u2019s dramatic victory over Croatia on Friday kept alive their hopes of avoiding automatic relegation from Group A1 of the Nations League. All they have to do now is beat Poland in Warsaw. If they manage that, they could yet qualify for the quarter-finals \u2013 and go into Pot 1 for the World Cup qualifiers as well. Scotland\u2019s campaign started with an exasperating 3-2 defeat at home to Poland, with Nicola Zalenski scoring the winner from the penalty spot in the 97th minute. That goal looks even more significant; without it, Scotland would only need a draw tonight to finish third in the group. No matter. Scotland are still alive and they have the thing their fanbase needs more than most: hope. Right now it comes in the peedie, speedy form of Ben Doak, the teenage winger whose sizzling performance against Croatia was like a modern reworking of Jinky Johnstone. The kid\u2019s only 19 so we shouldn\u2019t get carried away. And we certainly shouldn\u2019t point out that he has the same initials as the trophy Messi and Ronaldo monopolised from 2008\u201323. Kick off 7.45pm.",

      "bodyText": "Britain is expected to supply Storm Shadow missiles for use by Ukraine on targets inside Russia, now that the US president, Joe Biden, has agreed to do the same for the similar American long-range Atacms weapon. Keir Starmer, the prime minister, said at the G20 summit that the UK recognised it needed to \u201cdouble down\u201d on its support for Ukraine, while diplomatic sources briefed they expected other European countries to follow the US lead. The prime minister said that, while he was \u201cnot going to get into operational details\u201d, he recognised the need to do more to help Ukraine, whose electricity network was seriously damaged by a wave of Russian bombing on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ve been really clear for a long time now, we need to double down. We need to make sure Ukraine has what is necessary for as long as necessary, because we cannot allow Putin to win this war,\u201d the prime minister said. Russia, however, accused the west of escalation and said that Biden risked adding \u201cfuel to the fire\u201d in Ukraine, and while Donald Trump remained silent on the issue, his son Don Jr accused the military industrial complex of wanting to get \u201cworld war three going\u201d. Storm Shadow missiles have a range of about 250km (155 miles), similar to the US Atacms, and have in the past been given to Kyiv by the UK and France to strike targets inside Ukraine\u2019s internationally recognised borders. But the US retained an effective veto on their use because it supplies a guidance system and repeated lobbying by the UK had failed to shift the US position, which has only begun to soften after the election victory of Donald Trump earlier this month. Ukraine wants to be able to strike barracks, fuel and logistics hubs, and airbases deeper inside Russia to blunt Moscow\u2019s relentless attacks on their country. Russia, by contrast, is able to strike targets anywhere in Ukraine. Biden had refused to allow permission for long-range missiles to be used inside Russia for years but finally relented on Sunday, and said that Ukraine could use Atacms missiles to try to halt an expected counter-offensive by an estimated 50,000 Russian and North Korean forces in Kursk. Ukraine had also become increasingly exasperated with Britain on the issue of long-range missiles, complaining earlier this month that not only had there been no progress on their use inside Russia but that the UK had stopped supplying them at all. Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused the US of escalation. \u201cIt is clear that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps to continue to add fuel to the fire and to further inflame tensions around this conflict.\u201d He added: \u201cThis decision is reckless, dangerous, aimed at a qualitative change, a qualitative increase in the level of involvement of the United States.\u201d Peskov said Putin had expressed his position clearly in September when the Russian leader warned that the move to let Kyiv use longer-range weapons against targets inside Russia would mean Nato would be directly \u201cat war\u201d with Moscow. Putin had said Moscow would \u201ctake the appropriate decisions based on the threats that we will face\u201d and previously suggested Moscow could supply long-range weapons to other countries with the aim of attacking western targets. Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, France\u2019s foreign minister, said that the country\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, had already said Paris was open to consider greenlighting the use of its missiles to strike on Russian soil. Storm Shadow missiles are manufactured by MBDA, a company with UK, French and Italian shareholders. \u201cWe openly said that this was an option that we would consider if it was to allow Ukraine to strike targets from where Russians are currently aggressing Ukrainian territory,\u201d Barrot told reporters in Brussels. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, described Biden\u2019s decision as \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201cessential\u201d. She said in Brussels: \u201cThe decision from the American side, and I would like to emphasise that this is not a rethink but an intensification of what has already been delivered by other partners, is so important at this moment.\u201d A German government spokesperson said, however, that Germany was sticking with its decision not to supply Kyiv with long-range Taurus missiles. The decision by the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to withhold its most powerful missile has been a significant point of contention in Germany. But there was also criticism in Europe from Hungary, seen as Putin\u2019s closest EU ally. \u201cThe pro-war mainstream has launched its last, desperate attack on the new reality,\u201d the Hungarian foreign minister, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, wrote on Facebook, referring to the recent victory of Donald Trump. \u201cThe hawkish politicians ousted from power refuse to take note of the will of the people.

      "bodyText": "More babies in England could die from issues caused by unlicensed medicines if providers are not required to report problems, a coroner has warned. The conclusions were reached at the end of an inquest held after three infants died due to receiving contaminated feed. The babies were all receiving hospital care after being born prematurely and died after receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) feed contaminated with Bacillus cereus, Southwark coroners court heard. Three-month-old Aviva Otte, one-month-old Oscar Barker and nine-day-old Yousef Al-Kharboush were being provided critical nutrition via TPN. Aviva\u2019s mother, Jedidajah Otte, is a Guardian journalist. Otte has spoken previously of how she encountered a \u201cstubborn refusal\u201d by doctors and nurses at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London to tell her what was happening with Aviva\u2019s health. Aviva died in January 2014 at St Thomas\u2019 and received TPN \u201cprovided and compounded\u201d by the NHS establishment under a section 10 exemption, according to a preventing future deaths (PFD) report by the senior coroner, Dr Julian Morris. The exemption under the Medicines Act 1968 allows organisations to legally produce bespoke medicines without a licence for specific patients facing niche problems. Yousef, who in June 2014 also died at St Thomas\u2019, and Oscar, who died at Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge the same month, received TPN produced by a \u201ccommercial provider\u201d \u2013 ITH Pharma, which is a licensed provider and not subject to the section 10 exemption.

There was a risk that future deaths could occur unless action was taken in respect of the highlighted concerns. Recipients have to respond to the report by 8 January. ITH Pharma was fined \u00a31.2m by a crown court in 2022 after providing TPN from which 19 premature babies became infected across nine hospitals in 2014.

      "bodyText": "The Wisconsin supreme court heard arguments on Monday in a case that could determine the fate of the state\u2019s top election administrator \u2013 a widely respected official who for the past four years has faced intense conspiracy-theory fueled backlash from Trump\u2019s base. The Wisconsin elections commission administrator, Meagan Wolfe, drew ire in the wake of the 2020 election when pro-Trump activists made her a scapegoat in their false claims of a stolen election. Activists who supported Trump and rejected the results of the election protested against her role on the commission and pressured Republican lawmakers \u2013 who had previously appointed Wolfe unanimously to head the WEC \u2013 to oust her. As administrator, Wolfe can offer guidance and expertise to the bipartisan commission, but ultimately serves at their direction. After Wolfe\u2019s term on the commission concluded in June last year, the three Democrats on the commission abstained from voting on a motion to pass her name along to the state senate for reappointment, deadlocking the vote in anticipation that the senate would reject Wolfe. The six-member commission requires a four-vote majority. In September 2023, the GOP-controlled state senate took a vote on Wolfe\u2019s appointment despite a previous supreme court ruling that the expiration of a term did not create a vacancy or trigger a new appointment process. In a party-line vote, and with many Democrats in the senate calling the move illegitimate, the senate voted to oust Wolfe \u2013 leading to a legal battle over Wolfe\u2019s status as Wisconsin\u2019s top elections official. In January, a Dane county judge ruled that Wolfe\u2019s ongoing tenure was legitimate, and on Monday, the liberal justices who control the state supreme court by a narrow majority seemed sympathetic. During oral arguments, Misha Tseytlin, the attorney representing the state senate majority leader, Devin LeMahieu, claimed that by declining to allow for a senate vote on Wolfe\u2019s appointment, Democrats on the elections commission had violated the state statute on WEC appointments. \u201cThey will never send an administrator over to the senate unless the senate promises to confirm them, which is, of course, not the purpose and design of advice and consent,\u201d claimed Tseytlin. Tseytlin did not ask the court to overturn the court\u2019s 2022 decision to allow appointees to remain in office past the end of their term, instead arguing that Wisconsin\u2019s statute, which states that the commissioner \u201cshall be appointed by a majority of the members of the commission\u201d required the commissioners to advance Wolfe\u2019s appointment to the senate. The attorney representing the Wisconsin elections commission, Charlotte Gibson, argued that the statute does not require the commission to advance an appointment to the legislature, but merely grants them the authority to do so. \u201cThis role is not a part-time policy making position,\u201d said Gibson. \u201cThis is an intense, full-time job requiring expertise and experience, and it just doesn\u2019t work if there are frequent changes in personnel and sudden vacancies.\u201d If the court agrees that Wolfe lawfully holds her position and that the commission can withhold appointments at their discretion, Wolfe could probably hold office indefinitely \u2013 staving off the Republican push to oust her.",

      "bodyText": "Morning, everyone. Some measure of how Australians feel about another Donald Trump presidency is offered today by our latest Guardian Essential poll which shows voters are worried about the impact he will have on security and the world economy. It comes as he has suggested he will use the military to enforce the deportation of illegal immigrants. In other news, Russia reacted angrily to Kyiv getting the green light for long-range missile strikes, Anthony Albanese met Xi Jinping, and Sam Kerr and her partner are having a baby. Australia Exclusive | Tim Winton and Charlotte Wood are among a group of more than 90 writers and literary supporters who have paid for every federal parliamentarian to receive a carefully curated package of books on the Middle East to expand their knowledge of the history of the conflict. Guardian Essential poll | Almost half of voters want the Australian government to review Aukus and the acquisition of nuclear submarines after Donald Trump\u2019s election win, with most believing he will be bad for the global economy and conflict resolution. Social reset | A parliamentary committee examining the impact of social media has recommended users be given the power to alter, reset or turn off algorithms but has stopped short of recommending a ban for under-16s. Cost-of-living hit | Young Australians aged 18 to 29 have cut back the most due to financial pressures while older people are shopping more, data compiled by Australia\u2019s biggest bank shows. Diplomatic drudgery | Domestic workers employed in the households of overseas diplomats in Canberra are being exploited by oppressive working conditions which in some cases sees them working for as little as 65c an hour, lawyers and activists say. World Russian warning | The Kremlin has said Joe Biden\u2019s outgoing administration wants to escalate the conflict in Ukraine by allowing Kyiv to use long-range missiles for strikes inside Russia. Assassination plot | Canadian authorities have foiled an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate a former justice minister and rights activist who has been a strong critic of Tehran, the Globe and Mail newspaper has reported. Trump threat | Donald Trump has backed up a social media post extolling the use of military force to deport illegal migrants, and concerns are rising about how his choice of Matt Gaetz as attorney general means he might abuse his powers to target political foes for \u201cretribution\u201d. The Morning Joe hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough have revealed that they met Trump about \u201ca new approach\u201d after their public opposition to the incoming president, while Fox News is riding high after it championed Trump\u2019s cause. Climate miss | The goal to keep the world\u2019s temperature rise below 1.5C is now \u201cdeader than a doornail\u201d, with this year almost certain to be the first above the threshold, climate scientists have concluded even as world leaders gather to discuss the matter. Rio talks | The president of Brazil, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has opened the G20 meeting in Rio de Janeiro with the launch of an alliance to combat hunger, which he described as the \u201cultimate symbol of our collective tragedy\u201d. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, raised human rights issues with Xi Jinping, while Anthony Albanese talked trade with the Chinese president. Resolute test | An Australian gold mining company has agreed to give $247m to the government of Mali after its chief executive and two other employees were detained by authorities in the West African country. Full Story Trump\u2019s new cabinet: \u2018authoritarianism and chaos\u2019 The Guardian\u2019s Washington DC bureau chief, David Smith, speaks to Nour Haydar about what Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet picks tell us about his plans for his second term as president. In-depth Almost half of Australians (49%) believe immigration is too high but the large majority (71%) still think that migrants make the country stronger and that multiculturalism has benefited the nation (85%). These are perhaps contradictory findings from the Scanlon Foundation Research Institute\u2019s annual survey, Mapping Social Cohesion, out today. One of the lead authors said that despite the stresses caused by the Middle East crisis, the findings \u201cspeak to the resilience\u201d of Australian society. Karen Middleton looks into the details. Not the news Australian houses are now, on average, the biggest in the world having gone in six decades from 100 sq metres to 236 sq metres. In an architectural artwork-cum-provocation called Home Truth, a Melbourne studio has built a labyrinthine, oppressive 236 sq m house in the back of the National Gallery of Victoria next to a smaller one. Sian Cain speaks to the designers and finds out why there has never been a time \u201cso ripe for innovation in housing\u201d. Sport Football | The Matildas captain, Sam Kerr, and her partner, the USA and West Ham footballer Kristie Mewis, have announced they are having a baby due next year. Cricket | A hamstring injury to Glenn Maxwell was the only dampener as Marcus Stoinis helped Australia thrash Pakistan by seven wickets to seal a clean sweep in their three-game Twenty20 series. Football | The Socceroos can still qualify for the World Cup directly but the lifelines are running out with a difficult away tie in Bahrain coming up. Media roundup Two Melbourne teenagers are in a critical condition in Laos after suspected methanol poisoning, according to the Age. The South Australia Liberals\u2019 disastrous defeat in the Black byelection at the weekend exposes deep problems they can\u2019t blame on the premier, Peter Malinauskas, the Advertiser opines. What\u2019s happening today Economy | The minutes of the RBA monetary policy meeting are due at 11.30am. Brisbane | An International Space Symposium will discuss AI, robotics and automation. Media | The Walkley award winners will be announced tonight.

      "body": "<p>As an Israeli airstrike killed at least 30 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg5lw7edrlo\">people</a> in a northern Gaza residential block, Pope Francis called for an <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/pope-urges-investigation-to-determine-whether-israel-has-committed-genocide-in-gaza-13255646\">investigation</a> into whether genocide is being carried out under the cover of war. The staggering death toll in Gaza \u2013 an estimated 44,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children \u2013 underscores the urgency of his call for accountability. While the pope has <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-pope-told-herzog-last-month-israel-cant-respond-to-terror-with-terror/\">criticised</a> Israel\u2019s war before, this marks his first public call for a deeper investigation of the conflict ignited by Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack last year that killed 1,200 people. Legal scrutiny of the conflict requires access to Gaza, which has been sealed off for 13 months in defiance of the international court of justice\u2019s calls to permit entry to investigate a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/world-courts-interim-ruling-on-genocide-in-gaza-key-takeaways-icj-israel\">plausible risk of genocide</a>.</p> <p>The pope did not give a definitive judgment on whether the situation legally qualifies as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/genocide\">crime of crimes</a>\u201d. Others, including noted <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/378913/israel-gaza-genocide-icj\">scholars</a>, have been less circumspect. A UN <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/11/un-special-committee-finds-israels-warfare-methods-gaza-consistent-genocide\">committee</a> last week said that Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza fit the definition of genocide, with widespread civilian deaths and harsh conditions deliberately forced on Palestinians. However, while the UN plainly stating its case might feel satisfying, it could backfire by further angering Israelis.</p> <p>Numerous Jewish Israelis reject the label of genocide, though many are likely shielded from the full picture. The UN pointed out that Israeli media had reported the death toll of just about 1,000 Palestinian civilians, including fewer than 50 children, obscuring the broader reality. While a callous belief in collective punishment persists, it cannot erase the reality of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/12/israel-hamas-gaza-un-ceasefire-plan\">war crimes</a>. The question remains whether any court will hold Israel \u2013 or Hamas \u2013 accountable.</p> <p>Last week, Human Rights Watch <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/11/14/israels-crimes-against-humanity-gaza\">accused</a> Israeli authorities of war crimes and crimes against humanity and of the \u201corganized, violent displacement\u201d of Palestinians. The report warned that if such actions were to become permanent, they would constitute ethnic cleansing. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5154065\">concerns</a> grow over the deliberate starvation of Gaza, and reports in <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2024-11-13/ty-article-magazine/.premium/idf-gearing-up-to-remain-in-gaza-until-end-of-2025-at-least-this-is-what-it-looks-like/00000193-2230-d76d-a7db-637196a00000\">Haaretz</a> suggest the Israeli military plans to turn the enclave into occupied, fortified zones.

      "bodyText": "As an Israeli airstrike killed at least 30 people in a northern Gaza residential block, Pope Francis called for an investigation into whether genocide is being carried out under the cover of war. The staggering death toll in Gaza \u2013 an estimated 44,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children \u2013 underscores the urgency of his call for accountability. While the pope has criticised Israel\u2019s war before, this marks his first public call for a deeper investigation of the conflict ignited by Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack last year that killed 1,200 people. Legal scrutiny of the conflict requires access to Gaza, which has been sealed off for 13 months in defiance of the international court of justice\u2019s calls to permit entry to investigate a plausible risk of genocide. The pope did not give a definitive judgment on whether the situation legally qualifies as the \u201ccrime of crimes\u201d. Others, including noted scholars, have been less circumspect. A UN committee last week said that Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza fit the definition of genocide, with widespread civilian deaths and harsh conditions deliberately forced on Palestinians. However, while the UN plainly stating its case might feel satisfying, it could backfire by further angering Israelis. Numerous Jewish Israelis reject the label of genocide, though many are likely shielded from the full picture. The UN pointed out that Israeli media had reported the death toll of just about 1,000 Palestinian civilians, including fewer than 50 children, obscuring the broader reality. While a callous belief in collective punishment persists, it cannot erase the reality of war crimes. The question remains whether any court will hold Israel \u2013 or Hamas \u2013 accountable. Last week, Human Rights Watch accused Israeli authorities of war crimes and crimes against humanity and of the \u201corganized, violent displacement\u201d of Palestinians. The report warned that if such actions were to become permanent, they would constitute ethnic cleansing. Meanwhile, concerns grow over the deliberate starvation of Gaza, and reports in Haaretz suggest the Israeli military plans to turn the enclave into occupied, fortified zones. With roads and bases now occupying a quarter of Gaza, the rising religious right in Israel is openly eyeing Palestinian land for settlement. Donald Trump\u2019s return to power bodes ill for both Palestinians and Israelis. For Palestinians, his early appointments signal little hope for allies in addressing their plight. For Israelis \u2013 particularly those striving for a nation free from ruling over another people \u2013 hope also remains elusive. Before leaving office, Joe Biden might urge the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to conclude the war in Lebanon, framing Iran\u2019s weakened position as a justification for claiming victory. Yet, Mr Biden\u2019s record of setting \u201cred lines\u201d that Mr Netanyahu repeatedly ignored casts doubt on his ability to wield leverage effectively. Despite being Israel\u2019s primary arms supplier, the US has failed to secure a ceasefire or hostage deal in Gaza, exposing Mr Biden\u2019s lack of influence. Israel\u2019s unchecked war has unified Arab and Iranian positions on Palestine \u2013 unthinkable under the first Trump White House \u2013 and fuelled the far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich\u2019s push to annex West Bank settlements. Sanctioning extremists in the Israeli cabinet \u2013 a step supported by European allies \u2013 could help and would be difficult for Mr Trump to reverse.

      "bodyText": "The UK government did not fully suspend export licences to Israel as it would undermine US confidence in the UK and Nato and have a \u201cprofound impact\u201d on international peace and security, court documents reveal. On Monday the UK government returned to the high court in legal action by the Palestinian human rights organisation Al-Haq and the UK-based Global Legal Action Network (Glan) over the decision to continue arms exports to Israel. In September the government suspended 30 existing arms licences because of a \u201cclear risk\u201d they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law (IHL). But an exemption was made for some licences related to components of F-35 fighter jets, and about 330 others continued unaltered, which concerned items such as training and air defence equipment. Al-Haq is now seeking to challenge the decision not to suspend all licences in September, the move to \u201ccarve out\u201d licences for F-35 components from the suspension, and decisions by the former Tory government not to suspend licences in December 2023 and April and May this year. The government is opposing the legal challenge, with its lawyers telling the court that the licensing of arms exports to Israel \u201cis being kept under close and continuous review\u201d. According to court documents, the defence secretary\u2019s advice resulting in the September decision concluded it was not possible to suspend licensing of F-35 components without affecting the global F-35 programme to which 20 countries belong, including the US, Israel, Canada and the Netherlands. The advice said a F-35 licensing suspension would \u201chave a profound impact on international peace and security\u201d and \u201cwould undermine US confidence in the UK and Nato at a critical juncture in our collective history and set back relations\u201d. A key point in the September decision said: \u201cThe F-35 carve-out accepts that there is clear risk that F-35 components might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of IHL but determines that in the exceptional circumstances outlined by the defence secretary, these exports should nonetheless continue.\u201d In her written submissions, Phillippa Kaufmann KC, for Al-Haq, said the government was using a \u201ccategorically wrong\u201d and \u201chighly improper\u201d approach to assess whether Israel had breached IHL, which led to \u201cflawed\u201d decisions being made as to whether to suspend licences. She said: \u201cWhat is in question here is whether its [Israel\u2019s] stated commitment is a true commitment, and in order to make that determination the best evidence is how has it gone about these hostilities. As of September 2024, there were 361 extant licences for exports to Israel, of which 34 export licences were identified as \u201cred licences\u201d, or assessed as those which could be used for military operations for the conflict in Gaza, including components for combat aircraft, military helicopters and targeting equipment, among others. Five of those related to F-35 components, according to court documents. The remaining 29 licences were suspended, or amended to remove Israel as an end-user. Existing licences or \u201cgreen licences\u201d include components for trainer aircraft, air defence systems and IED disposal equipment, which the government says are \u201cclearly unrelated\u201d to military operations in Gaza. The F-35 programme is worth billions annually to the UK arms industry, according to Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), which has said 15% of every F-35 produced is made in the UK. \u201cThis is the litmus test of your commitment to comply with international law,\u201d Yasmine Ahmed, UK director of Human Rights Watch, which has intervened in the case with Oxfam and Amnesty International, said before the hearing. Last week, the organisation accused Israel of crimes against humanity over forced displacement in Gaza, as the death toll from Israeli attacks in the year-long conflict in Gaza approaches 44,000. \u201cPrioritising a contractual relationship with the US over the lives of Palestinian civilians is shocking,\u201d said Ahmed. On Monday, the court decided the government had until 16 December to respond to the grounds and provide further evidence. A final decision is expected the week of 13 January.",

It ensures taxpayer money goes to the areas in most need, where it will have the most impact and where passengers will most benefit.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is the first stop on our journey to support local areas to take back control of services and deliver better buses across the country.

Reeves\u2019 first job after she left university was as an economist at the Bank of England, but when she worked as HBOS she had an administrative role, <a href=\"https://order-order.com/2024/10/24/rachel-reeves-bank-economist-myth-busted/#:~:text=Reeves%20held%20a%20mid-level,according%20to%20records%20last%20week.\">Guido Fawkes said.</a></p> \n  <p>The story attracted little attention at the time. But in her Mansion House speech last week Reeves referred to having worked \u201cas an economist at the Bank of England, and then in financial services\u201d and after that Guido Fawkes discovered that Reeves had <a href=\"https://order-order.com/2024/11/15/chancellor-caught-changing-linkedin-cv-after-economist-myth-exposed/\">changed her LinkedIn profile</a>. Instead of saying that she worked as an economist at the Bank of Scotland when she was at HBOS, it now says for that period that she was in retail banking at Halifax.</p> \n  <p>This was more widely followed up, and the Sunday Telegraph then ran<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/16/rachel-reeves-accused-exaggerating-work-bank-of-england/\"> a follow-up story</a> saying that in an interview three year ago Reeves referred to spending a \u201cdecade\u201d as a Bank of England economist, even though her career at the Bank only lasted six years, including a year studying for a master\u2019s at the LSE. That led <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong>, the former Tory leadership candidate, to <a href=\"https://x.com/RobertJenrick/status/1857777649373856203\">accuse Reeves of lying.</a></p> \n  <p>Asked if the PM was concerned that Reeves had exaggerated her CV, the <strong>PM\u2019s spokesperson</strong> told journalists at the morning lobby briefing:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The prime minister is very clear that the chancellor has restored financial stability.</p> \n   <p>This is someone who on coming into office looked under the bonnet and exposed a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances, and has been straight with the public about what is necessary to balance the books and restore financial stability in the face of that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked again about the stories, the spokesperson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Starmer] is very clear that this is a chancellor that has been straight with the public about the state of the public finances and what is necessary to restore financial stability. That is most important.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Referring to Reeves\u2019s decision to change her LinkedIn profile, a <strong>Treasury source</strong> said: \u201cShe worked in retail banking covering various areas drawing on her background as an economist. Her LinkedIn has been updated to reflect that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked about the comment from Jenrick, a <strong>Labour source</strong> referred to Jenrick <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/robert-jenrick-reshuffle-cabinet-housing-b1920678.html\">being sacked as housing secretary three years ago</a> and said: \u201cThe chancellor won\u2019t take any lectures on honesty from a man whose scandals went too far for even Boris Johnson to stand by him.\u201d</p> \n  <p>There is no evidence that Reeves has gained any career advantage by people thinking she was working as an economist at HBOS when she was there in a different role. To get a job at the Bank of England as a graduate requires considerable ability, and Reeves has said she turned down a job offer from Goldman Sachs around the same time.

Speaking outside parliament, Mr Bradshaw told the PA news agency: \u201cThe planned demonstrations are definitely going ahead. It was a valuable meeting. It was a great opportunity to really spell out in black and white why their evidence is wrong, why it has to come forwards in consultation, and what the extreme human pressure is that this policy has created. Starmer has said that he understands changes to inheritance tax are \u201ccausing concern\u201d for farmers but insisted \u201cthe vast majority of farms\u201d will not be affected. Speaking to broadcasters at the G20 summit in Brazil on Monday, the prime minister said he is supporting farmers with money at the budget \u201calongside money to do with flooding and to do with the outbreak of disease.\u201d Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, has said she is likely to vote against the bill to legalise assisted dying, as Keir Starmer issued a veiled warning to cabinet ministers, such as Wes Streeting, to stay neutral on the issue. Starmer, speaking to reporters en route to the G20 summit in Brazil, confirmed for the first time that he would vote on the assisted dying bill later this month, but indicated he would not reveal his position in advance. Tax rises in the budget have sapped consumer confidence and will lead to sharp reductions in private sector pay growth next year, two separate reports have said. In a blow to Rachel Reeves\u2019s efforts to boost growth, a survey by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence showed that consumer confidence dropped this month after households said the outlook for the economy had deteriorated and the prospects for their own finances had worsened. More than one in three children and a quarter of adults are living in poverty in the UK as deprivation levels rise to the highest in the 21st century, according to a landmark report. The study by the Social Metrics Commission (SMC), which uses measures recently adopted by the UK government, found the cost of living crisis had plunged 2 million more people into severe hardship since 2019. That\u2019s all from me, Tom Ambrose, and the UK politics live blog for today. Thanks for following along. National Farmers\u2019 Union president Tom Bradshaw said planned demonstrations are \u201cdefinitely going ahead\u201d after he met with Environment Secretary Steve Reed in parliament on Monday evening, PA Media reported. Speaking outside parliament, Mr Bradshaw told the PA news agency: \u201cThe planned demonstrations are definitely going ahead. \u201cIt was a valuable meeting. It was a great opportunity to really spell out in black and white why their evidence is wrong, why it has to come forwards in consultation, and what the extreme human pressure is that this policy has created. \u201cWe have to have these conversations, but we\u2019re really concerned that at the moment, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any action. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any understanding from the Treasury of what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Bradshaw said he was \u201cdebating the data\u201d with the environment secretary during their meeting. He added: \u201cThe whole focus was on this abhorrent policy that\u2019s been put in place. We think it\u2019s a very ill considered policy. I don\u2019t believe that they intended the human consequences that there are within the policy they\u2019ve put forwards. \u201cI don\u2019t think they understand that family farms that are producing this country\u2019s food are right in the eye of this storm.\u201d Shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon said raising the bus fare cap to \u00a33 was \u201cnot an inevitability\u201d. He said: \u201cThe government seems at a loss as to why its policies are so unpopular and why, only a few months into this government, they are so deeply distrusted by the British public. Governing is tough and it requires taking real responsibility and considering the consequences of the decisions before you take them. \u201cFor example, the decision to increase the bus fare cap from \u00a32 to \u00a33. This will cost users more and perversely, will put at risk passenger services on certain routes, because it could counterproductively drive bus ridership down.\u201d Meanwhile, Keir Starmer has said there is \u201clots to discuss in our mutual interests as we go forward\u201d as he met Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese at the G20. At the top of a bilateral meeting with the Australian premier, Albanese said that Australia and the UK \u201care \u201cgreat friends, on security, on climate policy on our engagement.\u201d Starmer replied by saying \u201cwe can double down on that\u201d. Reform to bus services that will allow local authorities to adopt franchising models is \u201cthe biggest shake up of the sector for 40 years\u201d, transport secretary Louise Haigh has said. She told MPs: \u201cWe have called time on the way bus funding has historically been allocated. Previously, the government made councils compete for funding, wasting resources and delaying decisions. It was overly complicated, led to inconsistent funding and created uncertainty for authorities and operators. \u201cWe are taking a fundamentally different approach. We have allocated funding based on local need, population, the distance buses travel and levels of deprivation. This puts fairness at the heart of future funding, and ends the postcode Lottery on bus services. It ensures taxpayer money goes to the areas in most need, where it will have the most impact and where passengers will most benefit. \u201cThis is the first stop on our journey to support local areas to take back control of services and deliver better buses across the country. Finally, we will introduce our landmark buses bill in the coming weeks. It is the biggest shake up of the sector for 40 years. \u201cIt will allow councils across the country to adopt franchising models, as in Greater Manchester and London. That means local leaders taking back control of services, ensuring routes, fares and timetables are all geared towards local passenger needs.\u201d Keir Starmer has said that he understands changes to inheritance tax are \u201ccausing concern\u201d for farmers but insisted \u201cthe vast majority of farms\u201d will not be affected. Speaking to broadcasters at the G20 summit in Brazil on Monday, the prime minister said he is supporting farmers with money at the budget \u201calongside money to do with flooding and to do with the outbreak of disease.\u201d He went on: \u201cOn the question inheritance tax, look I do understand that it\u2019s causing concern. \u201cBut if you take a typical case of a couple wanting to pass a family farm down to one of their children, which would be a very typical example, with all of the thresholds in place, that\u2019s \u00a33m before any inheritance tax is paid. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m confident that the vast majority of farms and farmers will not be affected at all by that aspect of the budget. \u201cThey will be affected by the \u00a35bn that we\u2019re putting into farming, and I\u2019m very happy to work with farmers on that.\u201d Keir Starmer has said that he wants a \u201cserious and pragmatic\u201d relationship with China while \u201cbeing clear about the issues that we do not agree on\u201d. Speaking to broadcasters after his meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping on Monday, the prime minister said: \u201cI\u2019ve been clear that I want a serious and pragmatic relationship with China. \u201cIt\u2019s the second biggest economy in the world, it\u2019s one of our biggest trading partners, and therefore we have issues that we clearly need to discuss. \u201cWhilst, of course, being clear about the issues that we do not agree on. \u201cBut I will always act in the national interest, and that was the basis upon which we had our discussions this morning.\u201d The County Councils Network, which represents England\u2019s largest care authorities, has strongly welcomed Bridget Phillipson\u2019s plans to overhaul children\u2019s social care. (See 4.34pm.) In a statement Roger Gough, the Conservative leader of Kent county council and the CCN\u2019s spokesperson for children\u2019s services, said: The CCN strongly welcomes the government\u2019s intention to reform children\u2019s social care. Over a number of years our organisation has highlighted the need for the system to address market dysfunction, rebalance the system towards early help rather than late intervention, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 improve the experiences and outcomes of the country\u2019s most vulnerable children and families in contact with the care system. The government\u2019s intention to intervene more proactively in the children\u2019s social care placement market is particularly important. Our recent analysis showed that, unchecked, councils could be spending \u00a312bn a year on children in care by 2030, with local authorities having to operate in a false economy of increasingly paying astronomical sums for placements and less on preventative services. Whilst it is recognised the private sector is an important partner in delivering these goals, the clear signal that excess profiteering at the expense of threadbare local authority budgets will not be tolerated is necessary and long overdue. That is all from me for today. Tom Ambrose is now taking over. Louise Haigh, the transport secretary, is making a statement to MPs about funding for bus services. She says the Department for Transport is today explaining how the \u00a31bn for buses announced in the budget is being allocated in England. She goes on: Today, we distributing that funding. That means over \u00a3700m pounds for local councils to deliver bus service improvement plans and better meet local needs, and a further \u00a3243m pounds to bus operators, including funding a longstanding grant to drive down fares and drive up services. In many places, this is record investment and every region, every authority in England will benefit, especially those areas historically underserved, like rural areas and small towns. Councils such as Leicester, the Isle of Wight, Torbay and Cambridgeshire will see unprecedented levels of funding for services. At risk routes will be saved and passengers will see faster, more reliable journeys. We\u2019re also putting money into safer bus stops and more accessible passenger information, so our bus sector is fit for everyone. And I\u2019m delighted that metro mayors have welcomed this announcement, with city regions such as Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and Liverpool, receiving some of the biggest allocations. Full details of the spending allocations are here. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, has been making a statement to MPs about what she described as the biggest overhaul of children\u2019s social care in England for a generation. She said: Children\u2019s social care is struggling under an impossible weight. We have more children in care in this country than ever before, and with more and more money following children into the most expensive part of the system, resources are sucked out of preventative services, pushing yet more young people into care, and so the vicious cycle continues \u2013 higher costs, poorer outcomes. A cycle that [Labour MP Josh MacAlister] rightly identified in his review over two years ago, a broken market for care, vulnerable to the shameful profiteering of too many private companies. I am pleased to announce the publication of a policy statement that puts children\u2019s social care back in the service of children and families, breaking the cycle of crisis intervention. This is the biggest reform of children\u2019s social care in a generation, and it starts with the acknowledgment that wherever possible, children should remain with their families. Sally Weale explained the key points in a preview story overnight. And the Department for Education\u2019s press release is here. The DfE has also published various other documents as part of this announcement. They are: Keeping Children Safe, Helping Families Thrive \u2013 a 47-page policy paper explaining the new approach A report from the Office of the Children\u2019s Commissioner setting out the experience of children subject to deprivation of liberty orders A paper on the councils taking part in two regional care cooperative pathfinder pilots (Manchester, and the south-east) A report on progress made towards meeting recommendations made in the Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel\u2019s phase 2 report During defence questions Tan Dhesi, the Labour chair of the Commons defence committee, said he would like to see the government allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles supplied by Britain to hit targets in Russia. Referring to President Biden\u2019s decision to let Ukraine use American long-range missiles to attack sites in Russia, he said: Given the continuous bombing of Ukrainian communities by Russia, and given that we\u2019ve got thousands of North Korean troops fighting against our ally, in our continent, will Ukraine now be allowed to use those storm shadow missiles? Obviously within the confines of international law. Or are we expecting Ukraine to continue fighting and defending itself with one hand tied behind its back and to keep those storm shadows in safe storage? John Healey, the defence secretary, refused to say what the government would be doing. He replied: I will not compromise operations, security and comment on details of long-range systems today. The prime minister has been clear, as I do to the house today, that we must double down on the support for Ukraine, give Ukraine the support it needs, and do so for as long as it takes. And in doing so we will continue our close cooperation with the US and allies in providing that support to Ukraine. Healey also said that he was discussing this with his US and Ukrainian counterparts. The Foreign Office has announced that Iran\u2019s national airline, Iran Air, is being subject to asset freeze. In a news release, it says \u201cas a state-owned airline, Iran Air, is sanctioned in response to the government of Iran\u2019s transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia, following commitments outlined by the E3 in September\u201d. The government is also sanctioning the state-owned national shipping carrier of Iran, the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL). Here are some more pictures of Keir Starmer at the G20 summit today in Brazil. Here is video of Keir Starmer meeting Xi Jinping. Downing Street has released its readout of Keir Starmer\u2019s meeting with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president. Here is an extract with the most important lines. The prime minister set out that our approach would be consistent, respectful and pragmatic in order to advance these shared goals. On climate in particular, both said that this should be high on the agenda and there was more work to be done to accelerate global progress towards net zero. Both the UK and China have an important role to play in support of the global clean power transition. The prime minister said that he also wanted to engage honestly and frankly on those areas where we have different perspectives, including on Hong Kong, human rights and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. He reiterated that his approach would always be rooted in the national interests of the UK, but that we would be a predictable and pragmatic partner. As Patrick Wintour, the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, points out, the statement \u201cdoes not mention Jimmy Lai by name, referring instead to \u2018different perspectives\u2019 on human rights\u201d. Downing Street has defended the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as someone who\u2019s been \u201cstraight with the public\u201d in response to claims she embellished her CV. Last month the Guido Fawkes website said that Reeves was wrong to claim that she had worked as an economist at Halifax/Bank of Scotland (HBOS) before she became an MP. Reeves\u2019 first job after she left university was as an economist at the Bank of England, but when she worked as HBOS she had an administrative role, Guido Fawkes said. The story attracted little attention at the time. But in her Mansion House speech last week Reeves referred to having worked \u201cas an economist at the Bank of England, and then in financial services\u201d and after that Guido Fawkes discovered that Reeves had changed her LinkedIn profile. Instead of saying that she worked as an economist at the Bank of Scotland when she was at HBOS, it now says for that period that she was in retail banking at Halifax. This was more widely followed up, and the Sunday Telegraph then ran a follow-up story saying that in an interview three year ago Reeves referred to spending a \u201cdecade\u201d as a Bank of England economist, even though her career at the Bank only lasted six years, including a year studying for a master\u2019s at the LSE. That led Robert Jenrick, the former Tory leadership candidate, to accuse Reeves of lying. Asked if the PM was concerned that Reeves had exaggerated her CV, the PM\u2019s spokesperson told journalists at the morning lobby briefing: The prime minister is very clear that the chancellor has restored financial stability. This is someone who on coming into office looked under the bonnet and exposed a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances, and has been straight with the public about what is necessary to balance the books and restore financial stability in the face of that. Asked again about the stories, the spokesperson said: [Starmer] is very clear that this is a chancellor that has been straight with the public about the state of the public finances and what is necessary to restore financial stability. That is most important. Referring to Reeves\u2019s decision to change her LinkedIn profile, a Treasury source said: \u201cShe worked in retail banking covering various areas drawing on her background as an economist. Her LinkedIn has been updated to reflect that.\u201d Asked about the comment from Jenrick, a Labour source referred to Jenrick being sacked as housing secretary three years ago and said: \u201cThe chancellor won\u2019t take any lectures on honesty from a man whose scandals went too far for even Boris Johnson to stand by him.\u201d There is no evidence that Reeves has gained any career advantage by people thinking she was working as an economist at HBOS when she was there in a different role. To get a job at the Bank of England as a graduate requires considerable ability, and Reeves has said she turned down a job offer from Goldman Sachs around the same time. Before the general election Mark Carney, a former Bank of England governor, said Reeves was the right person to be next chancellor. Mervyn King, Carney\u2019s predecessor, has also spoken positively about working with Reeves at the Bank when he was in charge. As Steven Swinford from the Times reports, President Xi also used one of Keir Starmer\u2019s favourite slogans as he described what the Labour government is doing when he spoke about their meeting. President Xi channels Keir Starmer after their meeting on the fringes of the G20 summit in Rio, saying that Labour is \u2018working to fix the foundations\u2019 It\u2019s the first meeting between a British PM and Xi in five years \u2018The new UK government is working to fix the foundations of the economy and rebuild britain and has set the vision of Britain reconnected \u2018We should take fostering greater development better serving our peoples and contributing more to the world as our goal\u2019 Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, has said his country and the UK \u201cshare the dual responsibility\u201d of \u201caddressing global challenges\u201d, PA Media reports. According to a translation in the room at the top of his meeting with Keir Starmer on Monday, the president said there is \u201cbroad space for cooperation\u201d between the two countries, including on topics such as trade and clean energy, PA says. Xi said: The world has entered a new period marked by turbulence and transformation. As permanent members of the UN security council and major global economies, China and UK share the dual responsibility of advancing our respective national development and addressing global challenges \u2026 China and the UK have broad space for cooperation across various domains, including trade, investment, clean energy, financial services, healthcare and improving our peoples\u2019 wellbeing. We should take fostering greater development, better serving our peoples and contributing more to the world as our goal. Live up to our strategic partnership and commit to mutual respect, openness, cooperation, exchanges and mutual learning for shared benefit [\u2026] in doing so we will break new ground in the China-UK relationship amid a changing world and better underscore our relationship\u2019s relevance for the times and its significance for the world. Keir Starmer has confirmed that he will vote in the debate on the assisted dying bill on Friday week \u2013 but he has not yet said how. Speaking to reporters en route to the G20 summit in Brazil, the prime minister confirmed for the first time that he will vote on the assisted dying bill later this month, but indicated he would not reveal his position in advance. Starmer is known to be in favour of assisted dying in principle, having previously voted for it in 2015, but he has not confirmed he will back Kim Leadbeater\u2019s bill, which would legalise assisted death for those who are terminally ill and have less than six months to live. Starmer told reporters: The government is neutral, and it\u2019s a free vote, and it\u2019s very important that it remains a free vote, because people feel very strongly about this. He said the free vote meant it was \u201cnot a political divide, it\u2019s a sort of individual divide.\u201d He also said he had examined the issue closely when he was the director of public prosecutions because the Crown Prosecution Service had had to decide whether to prosecute family members involved in people killing themselves. I looked at every single assisted suicide case for five years that was investigated. I also did the biggest consultation in criminal justice when we did the consultation on assisted dying. It was the biggest response, because people felt so strongly, and I could feel that, and I\u2019ve always said getting the balance right is crucially important. Downing Street has refused to say whether President Biden\u2019s decision to allow Ukraine to use American missiles to strike Russia will lead to any change in what Kyiv can do with Storm Shadow missiles supplied by Britain. Speaking at the lobby briefing, asked if Ukraine would be allowed to use Storm Shadow weapons to hit targets in Russia, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said: We have been consistent throughout that providing specific details on operational matters would only serve to benefit [Vladimir] Putin during an ongoing illegal war. Asked if it was fair to say the UK would work in lockstep with the US, the spokesperson replied: It has always been the case we work closely with our allies and engage to ensure that strategically we are providing the support that Ukraine needs, and we do that in consultation both with Ukraine and with each other as allies. Keir Starmer has not spoken to Biden since Washington decided its new policy, the spokesperson said. Keir Starmer has raised concerns with Chinese president Xi Jinping about sanctions on MPs and the deterioration of British citizen and Hong Kong democracy activist Jimmy Lai in his meeting with the leader at the G20. British journalists were bundled out of the meeting by Chinese officials at the moment Starmer raised the plight of Lai, who is being held in Hong Kong. In the first meeting between the Chinese president and a British prime minister for six years, Starmer also raised human rights issues with Xi, including the sanctions on a number of Conservative MPs including the former security minister Tom Tugendhat and the Commons deputy speaker Nus Ghani. Starmer said the pair had agreed that they wanted \u201crelations to be consistent, durable, respectful, and as we have agreed, avoid surprises where possible\u201d. [See 12.33pm.] He proposed a full bilateral with Premier Li in Beijing or London, and for his chancellor Rachel Reeves to meet with her counterpart He Lifeng, which is expected to take place in Beijing in January. Speaking at the start of the meeting, Starmer said: I\u2019m keen that my chancellor should meet with Vice Premier He for the upcoming economic financial dialogue early next year to explore more investment projects and a more level playing field to help our businesses. I\u2019m very pleased that my Foreign Secretary and Foreign Minister Wang met recently to discuss respective concerns including on human rights and parliamentary sanctions, Taiwan, the South China Sea and our shared interest in Hong Kong. We are concerned by reports of Jimmy Lai\u2019s deterioration. Tugendhat and the former foreign affairs committee chair Alicia Kearns, both prominent Tory critics of China, had called on Starmer to use the meeting to raise with Xi the plight of UK nationals including Lai, the pro-democracy media owner detained and tried in Hong Kong. No British prime minister has met Xi since Theresa May visited Beijing in 2018 in the midst of a trade push during Brexit negotiations, though Boris Johnson spoke to the Chinese president during the pandemic. Since then, relations have significantly cooled because of cyber threats, a human rights crackdown in Hong Kong and the sanctions against British MPs. Rishi Sunak attempted to renew relations at the G20 summit in 2022 where a bilateral was planned but cancelled due to Ukraine developments. But Conservative leaders have toyed with designating China a threat to British security \u2013 stronger language than the US had used. The foreign secretary, David Lammy, visited China last month in the first signal that the new Labour government saw a renewal of better ties as a priority. Reeves, who is understood to be taking a leading role in pursuing new economic opportunities with China, will head to Beijing in January. Starmer and Reeves, have been pursuing a thawing of relations with the world\u2019s second-largest economy on pragmatic grounds, suggesting that the UK cannot achieve its growth ambitions without better terms with China. Keir Starmer has held his bilateral with Xi Jinping in Rio at the G20, offering to meet his counterpart, the Chinese premier Li Qiang, in Beijing or London at the earliest opportunity. But the PM also raised human rights issues with Xi, including the sanctions on parliamentarians and the persecution of Hong Kong and British citizen Jimmy Lai. In the first meeting by a British PM with China\u2019s president since 2018, Starmer said he wants \u201crelations to be consistent, durable, respectful, and, as we have agreed, avoid surprises where possible\u201d. Speaking at the start of the meeting, he said: A strong UK China relationship is important for both of our countries and for the broader international community. The UK will be a predictable, consistent, sovereign actor committed to the rule of law. He proposed a full bilateral with premier Li in Beijing or London, as well as a meeting between Rachel Reeves and her Chinese counterpart. As premier, Li is the second most senior figure in the Chinese system. Xi is Starmer\u2019s equivalent as the political leader of his country, but unlike Starmer he is also a head of state. Keir Starmer said that a \u201cstrong UK China relationship is important for both of our countries\u201d as he met Chinese President Xi Jinping on the fringes of the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, PA Media reports. If you are looking for something a bit lighter to break things up this morning, Simon Hattenstone\u2019s interview with the former Tory MP, and newbie reality TV star, Jacob Rees-Mogg is a good read. In her Today interview Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, claimed that Keir Starmer and Lucy Powell, the leader of the Commons, have both said that the assisted dying bill will get \u201cas much time as it needs\u201d for detailed, line-by-line debate, if it passes the second reading vote on Friday week. She said: I do not think the government is showing any signs of wanting to restrict the debate. It then goes to the Lords \u2026 The only time constraint is this needs to be finished by November next year. But on the same programme Nikki da Costa, a former Tory adviser who was director of legislative affairs in Downing Street under Theresa May and Boris Johnson, said she thought Harman was wrong. She pointed out that the bill is much longer than private members\u2019 bills (PMBs) normally are, but that the time allocated for it is just the standard PMB slot. She said only five hours have been set aside for report stage. If MPs cannot get through all the amendments in that time, the bill will go \u201cto the back of the queue\u201d, she said. Some MPs have asked the government to allocate extra time. But da Costa pointed that that Starmer, at PMQs last week, and Powell, at business questions on Thursday, have both refused to accept that is needed. Da Costa\u2019s assessment is in line with the assessment of the Hansard Society, the thinktank focusing on parliamentary matters. In its latest Parliamentary Matters podcast, Ruth Fox, the Hansard Society director, and Mark D\u2019Arcy, the former BBC journalist, discuss at length why, even if it gets a second reading, the bill will struggle to get through parliament without the government giving it extra time. \u201cIf the government isn\u2019t going to move to provide more time for this bill, frankly it\u2019s doomed,\u201d D\u2019Arcy says. Fox agrees. There is a transcript of the podcast here. Harriet Harman, the former Labour party deputy leader, used an interview on the Today programme this morning to criticise Wes Streeting, the health secretary, for his stance on the assisted dying bill. Echoing comments she made in an interview with the Observer, she said: I do think that [Streeting has] crossed the line and has given the impression that the government is not neutral \u2026 If government ministers, especially the secretary of state, for health, if they speak out, then the government\u2019s position of neutrality is compromised. Individual MPs will be feeling as if they have to support the government or be against the government, and this principle of neutrality on moral issues is very important. Tom Watson, another former deputy Labour leader who, like Harman, is now in the House of Lords, criticised her comments. In posts on social media this morning, he said that he has changed his mind on assisted dying, and is now in favour. But he also defended Streeting\u2019s right to speak out on this matter. 1/ After opposing assisted dying in the Commons a decade ago, I was convinced to change my view by a constituent while serving as an MP. Their story stayed with me and shaped my perspective. #AssistedDyingBill 2/ Today, I deeply admire the work of Kim Leadbeater and will support her bill. The proposed safeguards are thoughtful, thorough, and, if anything, more restrictive than I had anticipated. #TerminallyIllAdultsBill 3/ I am surprised to see my House of Lords colleague, Harriet Harman, making media appearances in recent days criticising Health Secretary Wes Streeting. He is doing his job and is entitled to his position. 4/ MPs should absolutely be made aware of the practicalities of new legislation. That is the essence of good governance and responsible debate. #AssistedDying 5/ I sincerely hope campaigners for the Bill focus on dialogue, not confrontation. Shouting down proper debate risks deterring those, like me, who have considered and changed their stance. #OpenDebate Amnesty International UK has urged Keir Starmer to raise the case of Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy activist and British national imprisoned in Hong Kong, when he meets the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Amnesty\u2019s chief executive Sacha Deshmukh said: The appalling state of human rights across China must be top of the agenda, including raising alarm about the industrial-scale repression of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet, the crushing of press freedom and hounding of activists and critics in Hong Kong and China. Prime Minister Starmer must also be clear that China\u2019s campaign of terrorising students and campaigners here in the UK will not be tolerated. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has more voters who like him than any other leading politician \u2013 but also more who dislike him than most other leading figures, according to polling from Ipsos. The figures show that 28% of people have a favourable view of him \u2013 but 48% have an unfavourable view of him, giving him a net score of -20. Keir Starmer\u2019s net score is -29, and Rachel Reeves\u2019 is -32. Kemi Badenoch has a net score of -18, but this could be partly because fewer people have a firm view about her one way or the other. The same factor applies to the Green party co-leaders, Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay, and the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, who all have much higher net approval ratings than the other people included in the Ipsos survey. On this measure, Denyer is the most popular leader (with a net score of -9), followed by Ramsay and Davey (both on -10). Last week similar polling by YouGov presented a very similar picture. Commenting on the figures, Keiran Pedley, director of UK politics at Ipsos, said: These numbers show that politicians are not a popular bunch in Britain right now, with more Britons holding unfavourable opinions than favourable for all of the ones on our list. Nigel Farage has the highest proportion favourable overall, but it remains to be seen whether he can convert that into increased support for Reform UK moving forward. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, has said is opposed to the private member\u2019s bill that would allow assisted dying. Asked for her stance on the bill, which will be debated in the Commons on Friday week, Phillipson said: As you\u2019ll know, the government takes a neutral position on this, so it\u2019s for individual members of parliament to arrive at their own conclusion, to come to their own view. Back in 2015 when this was last before parliament, I voted against the measure, and in that time, I haven\u2019t changed my mind. Asked why she was opposed to the bill, Phillipson said that she did not want to give too much detail, because the government as a whole is neutral on the bill, and so ministers are not meant to be trying to sway the argument. She said she was worried about people being coerced into taking their own life. But she acknowledged that supporters of the bill believe it contains safeguards that would address this problem. Peter Walker has the full story here. In her interview with Sky News this morning Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, was asked if the UK would follow Joe Biden in giving Ukraine permission to use missiles to attack targets in Russia. She replied: The prime minister and the defence secretary will always keep under review what the Ukrainian government asked of us by way of support. We have provided considerable military assistance to the Ukrainian people in their fight against that terrible Russian aggression that we have seen, and as we come up to that 1,000 days of the conflict, it\u2019s more stark than ever what the Ukrainian people have had to go through. It is thought that Starmer has been in favour of allowing Ukraine to fire Storm Shadow missiles at targets in Russia for some time, although the PM has not said that publicly. The missiles are made jointly made by the British and the French, but to attack targets in Russia they would need access to a US missile guidance system. As Dan Sabbagh explains, the Biden decision reportedly applies to US-made Atacms rockets. Good morning. Keir Starmer is in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil for the G20 summit, where later today he will become the first UK prime minister in six years to meet the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. As Jessica Elgot reports, Starmer says he wants \u201ca pragmatic and serious relationship\u201d with China. But, inevitably, not everyone is happy. The Daily Mail is splashing on criticism of the meeting from some Tories. When David Cameron was PM, he cultivated Xi with an eagerness and enthusiasm that makes Starmer look quite hostile towards China by comparison, but over the past decade Tory thinking about China has changed considerably, and the Mail story quotes Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former leader, saying \u201cthose suffering genocide and slave labour under the brutal hands of Xi will feel betrayed.\u201d Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, has been doing an interview round this morning. Speaking on Sky News, she defended Starmer\u2019s decision to meet Xi. She said he would be going into the meeting with his \u201ceyes wide open\u201d. She explained: China is a major player both in terms of the economy but also in the [UN] security council so it is right that we have that engagement, but that we do so on a pragmatic basis where we go into it with our eyes wide open. That does mean there will be challenge, constructive challenge, and there will be areas of profound disagreement. Here is the agenda for the day. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 1.30pm: Philip Barton, permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee. Afternoon: Starmer is in Rio de Janeiro, where most of the G20 events will take place in the afternoon or evening UK time. 2.30pm: John Healey, the defence secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 3.15pm: David Lammy, the foreign secretary, chairs a meeting of the UN security council on Sudan. After 3.30pm: Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, is expected to give a statement to MPs about plans to crack down on profiteering by firms running care home for children. 4pm: Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, gives evidence to the Lords international agreements committee. Also, at some point today, Steve Reed, the environment secretary, is meeting Tom Bradshaw, the NFU president. Tomorrow farmers are holding a major protest in London about the government\u2019s plans to subject some farms to inheritance tax.

It is getting on for three years since the Competition and Markets Authority found that children\u2019s home owners in England, Scotland and Wales were making excessive profits while carrying too much debt \u2013 exposing children and councils to unacceptable risks. Of all the failed experiments in privatisation of the past 30 years, this has a case to be considered the worst. A situation in which children are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/04/the-guardian-view-on-outsourced-childrens-homes-the-wrong-model\">regularly uprooted</a> from their areas due to services having been shaped by market forces \u2013 rather than their needs \u2013 should never have been allowed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/18/overhaul-of-childrens-social-care-in-england-will-crack-down-on-firms-profiteering\">Bridget Phillipson\u2019s announcement</a> on Monday that the government will seek to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/18/labour-ready-to-show-it-is-serious-about-child-social-care-reform\">limit the profits of providers</a> in England, and restrict the use of agency social workers to promote a more stable workforce, was the clearest indication so far of the direction that government reforms will take (children\u2019s social care is devolved, and the Scottish and Welsh governments are pursuing their own plans). Ofsted will gain new powers to issue fines and inspect chains as well as individual homes. Providers will be obliged to be more transparent about their finances.</p> <p>Following a whole series of scandals, including children inappropriately housed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/31/cornwalls-tent-home-for-teenager-woman-tells-of-anguish-for-son\">tents</a> and boats, and others exploited by criminal gangs, the whole package comes as a relief. While the last government knew there was a problem, it refused to fund the changes proposed in its own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/23/overhaul-of-childrens-social-care-in-england-urgent-and-unavoidable-review-finds\">review</a>.</p> <p>Ms Phillipson\u2019s approach is tougher, and rooted in acceptance that the private sector \u2013 which controls around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/04/the-guardian-view-on-outsourced-childrens-homes-the-wrong-model\">80% of all placements</a> in England, up from around half 20 years ago \u2013 must be brought out of the shadows. Children\u2019s social care businesses should have the brightest of lights shone on them \u2013 with opaque ownership structures and accounts outlawed. As with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/04/childcare-sector-england-not-playground-private-equity-experts-say\">early years and nurseries</a>, it is alarming that private equity businesses became so active in this sector in the first place. Labour should seek to strengthen state and not-for-profit alternatives.</p> <p>But in this as in other parts of the public sector, regulation is not the whole story. What happens next will depend on resources. Local government spending on looked-after children rose from \u00a33.1bn in 2009-10 to \u00a37bn in 2022-3, and shows no signs of easing. The recent budget offered only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/budget-2024-key-points-at-a-glance\">\u00a3600m in additional funding</a> for social care (including older and disabled people as well as children). The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/17/britain-austerity-labour-uk-economy-councils\">funding crisis faced by councils</a> should be expected to get worse rather than better.</p> <p>Boosting support for kinship carers is one means by which ministers hope they can reduce pressure on the overstretched care system.

      "bodyText": "Curbs on profiteering in the children\u2019s social care sector cannot come soon enough. It is getting on for three years since the Competition and Markets Authority found that children\u2019s home owners in England, Scotland and Wales were making excessive profits while carrying too much debt \u2013 exposing children and councils to unacceptable risks. Of all the failed experiments in privatisation of the past 30 years, this has a case to be considered the worst. A situation in which children are regularly uprooted from their areas due to services having been shaped by market forces \u2013 rather than their needs \u2013 should never have been allowed. Bridget Phillipson\u2019s announcement on Monday that the government will seek to limit the profits of providers in England, and restrict the use of agency social workers to promote a more stable workforce, was the clearest indication so far of the direction that government reforms will take (children\u2019s social care is devolved, and the Scottish and Welsh governments are pursuing their own plans). Ofsted will gain new powers to issue fines and inspect chains as well as individual homes. Providers will be obliged to be more transparent about their finances. Following a whole series of scandals, including children inappropriately housed in tents and boats, and others exploited by criminal gangs, the whole package comes as a relief. While the last government knew there was a problem, it refused to fund the changes proposed in its own review. Ms Phillipson\u2019s approach is tougher, and rooted in acceptance that the private sector \u2013 which controls around 80% of all placements in England, up from around half 20 years ago \u2013 must be brought out of the shadows. Children\u2019s social care businesses should have the brightest of lights shone on them \u2013 with opaque ownership structures and accounts outlawed. As with early years and nurseries, it is alarming that private equity businesses became so active in this sector in the first place. Labour should seek to strengthen state and not-for-profit alternatives. But in this as in other parts of the public sector, regulation is not the whole story. What happens next will depend on resources. Local government spending on looked-after children rose from \u00a33.1bn in 2009-10 to \u00a37bn in 2022-3, and shows no signs of easing. The recent budget offered only \u00a3600m in additional funding for social care (including older and disabled people as well as children). The funding crisis faced by councils should be expected to get worse rather than better. Boosting support for kinship carers is one means by which ministers hope they can reduce pressure on the overstretched care system. Putting more emphasis on early intervention, and involving families in decision-making when children are removed, are others. Ms Phillipson is also right that care leavers need more support if their life chances are to be improved. But this new entitlement, as well as the requirement for councils to consent to home education in households where there are child protection concerns, are policies that must be funded if they are to work. The children\u2019s social care system is shamefully flawed. Labour\u2019s efforts to repair it are welcome. But the grim reality is that private capital filled an opening created by a public retreat. Unless and until the state rebuilds its own children\u2019s social care provision, or offers new backing to non-profit partners, it is hard to see how these plans can deliver the change that is needed.",

Jasvinder Sanghera, a member of the C of E\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/09/safeguarding-crisis-church-of-england-archbishop-of-york\">now-disbanded independent safeguarding board</a>, said her concerns \u201cwent unheard\u201d.</p> <p>Cottrell said he was distressed by Sanghera\u2019s claims. An <a href=\"https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2023-12/isb-review-report-30-november-2023.pdf\">independent report on the termination of the board</a> published last December concluded that it was the result of a breakdown in relationships between members. It made no criticisms of individuals.</p> <p>The management of the 11 cases was passed to \u201cother appropriate safeguarding professionals, and Jasvinder is mistaken when she says I ignored them\u201d, Cottrell said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to resign. Like everyone who serves the church, I\u2019m subject to the discipline and authority of the church. If people read the [independent safeguarding board report], they can make their own conclusions.\u201d</p> <p>The C of E needed to \u201cmove towards greater independence of safeguarding functions and complete independence of scrutiny of them\u201d as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/08/uk-government-could-miss-chance-to-protect-children-says-ex-inquiry-chair\">recommended by Alexis Jay</a>, who chaired the <a href=\"https://www.iicsa.org.uk/\">independent inquiry into child sexual abuse</a>, he said. This would be discussed at the next meeting of the C of E\u2019s ruling body, the General Synod, in February. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we will restore confidence,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Over the past 10 years \u201can awful lot of lessons have been learned\u201d but the church was not complacent, he added.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a revolution in the way safeguarding is understood and practised \u2026 We now have a safeguarding officer in every single parish [and] every ordained person undergoes safeguarding training.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cI believe the church will come through this, but we need to be humbler, simpler and bolder. We have been humbled by this and we are ashamed. I want to play my part in becoming a church that looks and sounds a lot more like Jesus Christ, which for many people it doesn\u2019t at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cI believe if we focus on those things in an undefended and gracious way, and with a penitent heart, then the church will continue to be the presence it needs to be. At the local level, which is what really matters, the church remains trusted and strong, providing support for thousands and thousands of people.\u201d</p>",

That doesn\u2019t change my commitment over the coming years, and I realise that for this next period, I am the person that people will look to.\u201d He expected candidates to include some of his \u201cexcellent female colleagues\u201d. He said: \u201cI would welcome a woman into the role, not just because they\u2019re a woman but because they will be the best person for the job.\u201d Cottrell said he had not been given an advance copy of the report into Smyth\u2019s abuse and its cover-up before publication. \u201cI was shocked and horrified by what I read, and I\u2019m still in shock,\u201d he said. His first thoughts were with the victims and survivors, he added. However, since Welby\u2019s resignation, Cottrell has been accused of \u201cignoring\u201d complaints about 11 other abuse cases and has also been urged to resign. Jasvinder Sanghera, a member of the C of E\u2019s now-disbanded independent safeguarding board, said her concerns \u201cwent unheard\u201d. Cottrell said he was distressed by Sanghera\u2019s claims. An independent report on the termination of the board published last December concluded that it was the result of a breakdown in relationships between members. It made no criticisms of individuals. The management of the 11 cases was passed to \u201cother appropriate safeguarding professionals, and Jasvinder is mistaken when she says I ignored them\u201d, Cottrell said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to resign. Like everyone who serves the church, I\u2019m subject to the discipline and authority of the church. If people read the [independent safeguarding board report], they can make their own conclusions.\u201d The C of E needed to \u201cmove towards greater independence of safeguarding functions and complete independence of scrutiny of them\u201d as recommended by Alexis Jay, who chaired the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, he said. This would be discussed at the next meeting of the C of E\u2019s ruling body, the General Synod, in February. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we will restore confidence,\u201d he said. Over the past 10 years \u201can awful lot of lessons have been learned\u201d but the church was not complacent, he added. \u201cThere has been a revolution in the way safeguarding is understood and practised \u2026 We now have a safeguarding officer in every single parish [and] every ordained person undergoes safeguarding training.\u201d He said: \u201cI believe the church will come through this, but we need to be humbler, simpler and bolder. We have been humbled by this and we are ashamed. I want to play my part in becoming a church that looks and sounds a lot more like Jesus Christ, which for many people it doesn\u2019t at the moment. \u201cI believe if we focus on those things in an undefended and gracious way, and with a penitent heart, then the church will continue to be the presence it needs to be. At the local level, which is what really matters, the church remains trusted and strong, providing support for thousands and thousands of people.\u201d",

Any challenge you put in front of them is not too big that they can\u2019t produce. We have seen that. The challenge for them is to get back in March.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/18/statue-harry-kane-unveiled-after-storage\">\u2018Stuff of nightmares\u2019 statue of Harry Kane unveiled after five years in storage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That will be when Thomas Tuchel names his first squad as England manager, beginning his quest for victory at the 2026 World Cup. It will also be when a host of more established players are likely to be available again, taking in those that withdrew from Carsley\u2019s final camp because of fitness concerns, including Trent Alexander-Arnold, Declan Rice, Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden, Cole Palmer and Jack Grealish. The list did not feature those who were already injured and not called up \u2013 for example John Stones, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw and Kobbie Mainoo.</p> <p>Carsley had two objectives in interim charge: Nations League promotion \u2013 ideally without the need for a disruptive playoff in March \u2013 and to widen the pool of talent for Tuchel. He has ticked both boxes. And yet as Carsley talked about there being a fresher feel to the squad, the question nagged away. Will Tuchel show a similar faith in the kids? It has a rhetorical edge, mainly because of the gun-for-hire feel of Tuchel\u2019s appointment, the one-campaign contract, the talk of World Cup glory or bust. Tuchel will be a manager in a hurry and perhaps not inclined to pick inexperienced players likely to make mistakes as they find their feet.</p> <p>Tuchel will not ignore young players just because they do not have a lot of caps. In an area such as left-back, for example, where options are limited, it may be that there is room for Hall. Then again, if Shaw can put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/08/luke-shaw-manchester-united-england-euro-2024\">his injury issues behind him</a>, Tuchel will probably not believe he has a decision to make. Alexander-Arnold and Kyle Walker or Livramento at right-back? (Do not forget Reece James, another player who has been beset by fitness problems). Maguire or Harwood-Bellis in central defence?</p> <p>England are surely best stocked in the attacking midfield positions and it is inconceivable that Saka, Foden and Palmer will not return. Grealish will most likely come back, too. Saka or Madueke on the right wing? In terms of the starting role, there is not really a choice. Rogers is up against Anthony Gordon and Grealish on the left, not to mention Foden and Palmer if they were to be used there. Gibbs-White in the No 10 role? Or Jude Bellingham, Foden or Palmer?</p>    <p>Assuming Tuchel looks to Saka on the right and Harry Kane as the striker, his most interesting challenge will be how to accommodate Bellingham, Foden and Palmer. It was the question that Gareth Southgate struggled to answer at Euro 2024; Carsley, too, when he had all three available. It is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/12/it-was-never-me-against-him-lampard-and-gerrard-renew-rivalry-from-dugout\">Lampard-Gerrard conundrum</a> and talks to the nation\u2019s obsession with big-name players, especially in forward-thinking roles \u2013 and the reluctance to play just one. To find a way for two or more.</p> <p>Carsley had jammed the trio in for the first game against Greece at Wembley last month, albeit when he had room to manoeuvre with Kane out injured. The result was the messy 2-1 defeat upon which Carsley admits he will continue to dwell more than any of his five wins. On the other hand, maybe the Greece debacle was the most instructive of Carsley\u2019s matches for Tuchel as it showed what not to do, silencing, to an extent, the millions of pub England managers around the country. \u201cYeah, potentially,\u201d Carsley said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like it at the time. We probably didn\u2019t have enough time to work on it, and then to expect it just to work.\u201d</p> <p>In midfield, Southgate was vexed by who to play alongside Rice at the Euros. After the failed experiment with Alexander-Arnold, it did not work out with Conor Gallagher but was better with Mainoo. Carsley\u2019s introduction of Gomes and Jones has been significant. Could Tuchel see a way back for Mason Mount, a player he counted on at Chelsea?</p> <p>Carsley returned to an opinion he heard expressed by numerous coaches at Uefa\u2019s Euro 2024 tournament debrief in September \u2013 that England\u2019s talent reserves were a headache rather than a tonic. He will never see it that way and perhaps the lesson for Tuchel is about the overall blend; the kids can contribute by firing competition for places, ready to step in if needed.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of the international coaches at that Uefa thing I went to said: \u2018You\u2019ve got a lot of good players\u2019 as if that\u2019s a negative thing,\u201d Carsley said. \u201cIf they\u2019re all in form at exactly the same time then it\u2019s a challenge. But players do come in and out of form and it\u2019s putting them in the team when they\u2019re flying and resting them when they\u2019re not.\u201d</p>",

To Carsley, who knew them all from managing England Under-21s, the job he will now return to, it was easier to trust them. \u201cI did not see it as a gamble,\u201d he said after Sunday\u2019s 5-0 win over Republic of Ireland at Wembley, a result that confirmed England\u2019s promotion back into the Nations League\u2019s A section. \u201cThe biggest thing you notice about these young players is their mentality. Any challenge you put in front of them is not too big that they can\u2019t produce. We have seen that. The challenge for them is to get back in March.\u201d That will be when Thomas Tuchel names his first squad as England manager, beginning his quest for victory at the 2026 World Cup. It will also be when a host of more established players are likely to be available again, taking in those that withdrew from Carsley\u2019s final camp because of fitness concerns, including Trent Alexander-Arnold, Declan Rice, Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden, Cole Palmer and Jack Grealish. The list did not feature those who were already injured and not called up \u2013 for example John Stones, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw and Kobbie Mainoo. Carsley had two objectives in interim charge: Nations League promotion \u2013 ideally without the need for a disruptive playoff in March \u2013 and to widen the pool of talent for Tuchel. He has ticked both boxes. And yet as Carsley talked about there being a fresher feel to the squad, the question nagged away. Will Tuchel show a similar faith in the kids? It has a rhetorical edge, mainly because of the gun-for-hire feel of Tuchel\u2019s appointment, the one-campaign contract, the talk of World Cup glory or bust. Tuchel will be a manager in a hurry and perhaps not inclined to pick inexperienced players likely to make mistakes as they find their feet. Tuchel will not ignore young players just because they do not have a lot of caps. In an area such as left-back, for example, where options are limited, it may be that there is room for Hall. Then again, if Shaw can put his injury issues behind him, Tuchel will probably not believe he has a decision to make. Alexander-Arnold and Kyle Walker or Livramento at right-back? (Do not forget Reece James, another player who has been beset by fitness problems). Maguire or Harwood-Bellis in central defence? England are surely best stocked in the attacking midfield positions and it is inconceivable that Saka, Foden and Palmer will not return. Grealish will most likely come back, too. Saka or Madueke on the right wing? In terms of the starting role, there is not really a choice. Rogers is up against Anthony Gordon and Grealish on the left, not to mention Foden and Palmer if they were to be used there. Gibbs-White in the No 10 role? Or Jude Bellingham, Foden or Palmer? Assuming Tuchel looks to Saka on the right and Harry Kane as the striker, his most interesting challenge will be how to accommodate Bellingham, Foden and Palmer. It was the question that Gareth Southgate struggled to answer at Euro 2024; Carsley, too, when he had all three available. It is the Lampard-Gerrard conundrum and talks to the nation\u2019s obsession with big-name players, especially in forward-thinking roles \u2013 and the reluctance to play just one. To find a way for two or more. Carsley had jammed the trio in for the first game against Greece at Wembley last month, albeit when he had room to manoeuvre with Kane out injured. The result was the messy 2-1 defeat upon which Carsley admits he will continue to dwell more than any of his five wins. On the other hand, maybe the Greece debacle was the most instructive of Carsley\u2019s matches for Tuchel as it showed what not to do, silencing, to an extent, the millions of pub England managers around the country. \u201cYeah, potentially,\u201d Carsley said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like it at the time. We probably didn\u2019t have enough time to work on it, and then to expect it just to work.\u201d In midfield, Southgate was vexed by who to play alongside Rice at the Euros. After the failed experiment with Alexander-Arnold, it did not work out with Conor Gallagher but was better with Mainoo. Carsley\u2019s introduction of Gomes and Jones has been significant. Could Tuchel see a way back for Mason Mount, a player he counted on at Chelsea? Carsley returned to an opinion he heard expressed by numerous coaches at Uefa\u2019s Euro 2024 tournament debrief in September \u2013 that England\u2019s talent reserves were a headache rather than a tonic. He will never see it that way and perhaps the lesson for Tuchel is about the overall blend; the kids can contribute by firing competition for places, ready to step in if needed. \u201cA lot of the international coaches at that Uefa thing I went to said: \u2018You\u2019ve got a lot of good players\u2019 as if that\u2019s a negative thing,\u201d Carsley said. \u201cIf they\u2019re all in form at exactly the same time then it\u2019s a challenge. But players do come in and out of form and it\u2019s putting them in the team when they\u2019re flying and resting them when they\u2019re not.\u201d",

Rising incomes and busier workplaces have underpinned much of the improvement in consumer sentiment over the past two years, but job security is showing signs of waning.</p> <p>\u201cAny intensification of job worries, spurred perhaps the recent measures announced in the budget, including higher employer national insurance contributions, could result in a further loss of consumer confidence. This would likely in turn hit consumer spending and economic growth.\u201d </p> <p>The Goldman analysts said they feared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/nov/18/uk-mortgage-rates-creep-up-as-brokers-warn-of-possible-further-pain-interest-rates-inflation-figures\">mortgage rates would drift higher</a> as the Bank of England signalled high interest rates would be in place for a longer period.</p> <p>Before the slowdown next year, the UK will enjoy a mini boom after Reeves gave a boost to Whitehall budgets and increased public sector pay, Goldman said.</p> <p>Policymakers at the Bank of England have cut the cost of borrowing twice this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/07/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates\">to 4.75%</a>, but a further reduction in interest rates next month is no longer expected, delaying further cuts until the new year.</p> <p>Millions of mortgage payers due to refinance their loans in 2025 are hoping to benefit from lower borrowing costs.</p> <p>Williamson said: \u201cThe tough climate facing households has prompted a growing belief that interest rates will fall again, which should help alleviate some of the financial pressure on borrowers. However, the fact that confidence fell in November despite the Bank of England cutting interest rates suggests lower borrowing costs alone may be insufficient to turn the tide and lift sentiment.\u201d</p> <p>Trade tensions under the Trump administration will also hurt the UK economy next year, even if Britain avoids tough new tariffs, the Goldman analysts said.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough our base case is that the US only imposes very limited tariffs on the UK, the threat of more significant tariffs is likely to generate uncertainty in the near term, which should weigh on demand. And we expect that uncertainty around tariffs will notably reduce euro area growth, which is likely to generate spillovers to the UK.\u201d</p> <p>The Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy, has calculated that if the US imposes a 20% tariff on all imports and a 60% tariff on China, it could reduce the UK economy by 0.9% by the end of the Trump administration, even if other countries do not retaliate.</p> <p>The firm said Trump\u2019s re-election could reshape global dynamics, \u201cparticularly in trade, energy, and environmental policy\u201d. </p> <p>There is also a risk that energy prices are pushed higher, leading to higher bills, if retaliatory action is taken against US tariffs.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tax rises in the budget have sapped consumer confidence and will lead to sharp reductions in private sector pay growth next year, two separate reports have said. In a blow to Rachel Reeves\u2019s efforts to boost growth, a survey by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence showed that consumer confidence dropped this month after households said the outlook for the economy had deteriorated and the prospects for their own finances had worsened. The consultancy said the government had failed to build on the underlying improvement in consumer sentiment seen in the months before and after the general election. Goldman Sachs said in a separate report that the increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) announced in the budget, raising \u00a320bn for the Treasury, would force employers to pass on some of the cost in lower wage increases. Analysts at the investment bank said they believed wages growth would slow as a result. \u201cWe expect consumer spending growth to moderate in the second half of next year as real disposable income growth falls back,\u201d they said. \u201cThis partly reflects slowing real wage growth; we expect private sector pay increases to cool, partly because of the employer NICs increase being passed on to consumers.\u201d S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence said that since a high point in July, consumers had spent the rest of the summer and autumn more buoyant about their finances over the next 12 months than in the period before the Covid pandemic. However, the survey in November found the \u201congoing pressure on household finances has resulted in squeezed spending, higher debt and lower savings\u201d. The consumer sentiment index \u2013 a mix of surveys tracking consumer financial wellbeing, the jobs market, household spending, savings and debt \u2013 fell from 47.3 in October to 46.9 in November, where a number below 50 indicates contraction. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: \u201cA key concern going forward will be the labour market. Rising incomes and busier workplaces have underpinned much of the improvement in consumer sentiment over the past two years, but job security is showing signs of waning. \u201cAny intensification of job worries, spurred perhaps the recent measures announced in the budget, including higher employer national insurance contributions, could result in a further loss of consumer confidence. This would likely in turn hit consumer spending and economic growth.\u201d The Goldman analysts said they feared mortgage rates would drift higher as the Bank of England signalled high interest rates would be in place for a longer period. Before the slowdown next year, the UK will enjoy a mini boom after Reeves gave a boost to Whitehall budgets and increased public sector pay, Goldman said. Policymakers at the Bank of England have cut the cost of borrowing twice this year, to 4.75%, but a further reduction in interest rates next month is no longer expected, delaying further cuts until the new year. Millions of mortgage payers due to refinance their loans in 2025 are hoping to benefit from lower borrowing costs. Williamson said: \u201cThe tough climate facing households has prompted a growing belief that interest rates will fall again, which should help alleviate some of the financial pressure on borrowers. However, the fact that confidence fell in November despite the Bank of England cutting interest rates suggests lower borrowing costs alone may be insufficient to turn the tide and lift sentiment.\u201d Trade tensions under the Trump administration will also hurt the UK economy next year, even if Britain avoids tough new tariffs, the Goldman analysts said. \u201cAlthough our base case is that the US only imposes very limited tariffs on the UK, the threat of more significant tariffs is likely to generate uncertainty in the near term, which should weigh on demand. And we expect that uncertainty around tariffs will notably reduce euro area growth, which is likely to generate spillovers to the UK.\u201d The Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy, has calculated that if the US imposes a 20% tariff on all imports and a 60% tariff on China, it could reduce the UK economy by 0.9% by the end of the Trump administration, even if other countries do not retaliate. The firm said Trump\u2019s re-election could reshape global dynamics, \u201cparticularly in trade, energy, and environmental policy\u201d. There is also a risk that energy prices are pushed higher, leading to higher bills, if retaliatory action is taken against US tariffs.",

Russian military planners are likely to move anything they believe is at risk out of range if they can do so fast enough.</p> <p>That may be good value for the US also given that Atacms stockpiles are not plentiful and the missiles, at a cost of somewhere between $1m and$2m, are not cheap.</p> <p>There may also be a value in directly threatening North Korea, whose entry into the war is hugely significant, Barros said. \u201cSo far the western response has been lacklustre, and there are reports that North Korea may be willing to send as many as 100,000 to fight against Ukraine.\u201d With Russia and Ukraine\u2019s combat forces considered very roughly matched at somewhere between 600,000 and 700,000, dissuading North Korea from sending more troops could be significant.</p> <p>With a Donald Trump presidency looming, Ukraine also badly needs an opportunity to show what it can do, with western help, on the battlefield. \u201cThe Ukrainians need to convince the incoming US administration that they are still worth backing \u2013 in Trump\u2019s transactional view, a \u2018good investment\u2019,\u201d argued Matthew Savill, of the Royal United Services Institute thinktank.</p> <p>In response, the west has to contend with Russian threats of escalation, though the reality of the Ukraine war is that, as Savill points out, Moscow \u201chas already escalated\u201d. Russia is already engaged in a heightened sabotage campaign across Europe, with assassination plots targeting western arms makers and arson plots, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/04/incendiary-device-plot-targeting-uk-may-have-been-dry-run-for-us-canada-russia-dhl\">sending incendiary devices</a> via the DHL network to the UK.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Ukraine, the attacks on power plants and substations primarily affect civilians, particularly when electricity is lost. \u201cRussia\u2019s strategy of escalating attacks, especially around holidays or weekends, is intended to break the spirit of Ukrainians and remind them of the hardships of war,\u201d said Vladyslav Faraponov, the head of the board of Ukraine\u2019s Institute of American Studies.</p> <p>However, few experts believe that even allowing Ukraine to use Atacms more broadly inside Russia will have a decisive military effect. The US permission may well be followed by the UK, France and Italy agreeing to donate more of their Storm Shadow/Scalp missiles, which have a similar range, and allowing them to be used inside Russia. But again, stocks are limited, even if permission is given by the Europeans and the US, which provides a guidance system on which the missile relies.</p> <p>Ukraine remains under serious pressure in the east, with Russian forces threatening to form a pocket that would encircle Kurakhove in the south. Though Russian casualties are running at record levels of about 1,500 a day, as the Kremlin tries to persuade Trump and his team that its victory is inevitable with constant frontline attacks, Ukraine is also short on personnel numbers and has never obtained decisive western support at any point during the war.</p> <p>\u201cOver time, Ukrainians have learned to live with initial refusals on the delivery or use of critical weapons, followed by hesitant \u2018maybes\u2019, and only after countless lives are lost, a reluctant \u2018yes\u2019. Unfortunately, this reactive approach is not what Ukraine needs to preserve its independence or endure potential negotiations,\u201d Faraponov said. </p> <p>A late decision to loosen restrictions on one missile type is not obviously the kind of decisive support that Ukraine hopes for either.</p>",

The US permission may well be followed by the UK, France and Italy agreeing to donate more of their Storm Shadow/Scalp missiles, which have a similar range, and allowing them to be used inside Russia. But again, stocks are limited, even if permission is given by the Europeans and the US, which provides a guidance system on which the missile relies. Ukraine remains under serious pressure in the east, with Russian forces threatening to form a pocket that would encircle Kurakhove in the south. Though Russian casualties are running at record levels of about 1,500 a day, as the Kremlin tries to persuade Trump and his team that its victory is inevitable with constant frontline attacks, Ukraine is also short on personnel numbers and has never obtained decisive western support at any point during the war. \u201cOver time, Ukrainians have learned to live with initial refusals on the delivery or use of critical weapons, followed by hesitant \u2018maybes\u2019, and only after countless lives are lost, a reluctant \u2018yes\u2019. Unfortunately, this reactive approach is not what Ukraine needs to preserve its independence or endure potential negotiations,\u201d Faraponov said. A late decision to loosen restrictions on one missile type is not obviously the kind of decisive support that Ukraine hopes for either.",

Their success is certainly a reflection of the sheer quality provided by Boulter and Raducanu, but the camaraderie built within the team is also driving them. \u201cEach person does their own individual practices, but we work really well as a team and when we come together at the dinner table,\u201d said Raducanu. \u201cWe\u2019re always laughing and reflecting on the day and we have a few inside jokes kind of running through the team, so that\u2019s keeping us going.\u201d</p> <p>This congenial culture between players who are rivals most weeks on the tour has been deliberately fostered by the team captain, Anne Keothavong, after her own experiences in her playing career as part of Great Britain\u2019s leading duo alongside Elena Baltacha,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/05/elena-baltacha-liver-cancer-tennis\"> who died from liver cancer aged 30 in 2014</a>. </p> <p>Baltacha and Keothavong were born just a month apart and their longtime rivalry led to significant tension between them on their respective journeys to becoming top-50 players. In the latter stages of their careers, however, they forged a great friendship. </p>    <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret, when I was back playing, myself and Elena Baltacha had our ups and downs, but towards the end, we were pretty tight,\u201d said Keothavong. \u201cAs adults, because we were a bit older, more mature, we were able to reflect on how we could have been better, but also the \u00adpeople around us that influence us: who are the right people to listen to, who should we have just ignored? </p> <p>\u201cI think when she passed away, you just kind of think: \u2018Well, all of that \u2026 what was that?\u2019 It was just such a waste to spend so much time being angry and pissed off at each other and it was so totally unnecessary. I\u2019m pleased that before we both hung up our rackets we were able to really talk about all of that and during the last couple of years of our careers, we were very tight.\u201d</p> <p>Since she became captain in 2017, the 41-year-old Keothavong has commanded respect and authority, demanding high standards and ambition from her players, but she can also be found cracking jokes with them. On Tuesday her team will attempt to take Great \u00adBritain to the final of this competition for the first time since 1981.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see when you\u2019ve got your top two players genuinely getting on, and there\u2019s a huge amount of respect for each other,\u201d said Keothavong. \u201cWhat\u2019s important for me in this competition is that the girls find a way to gel and get on. From my previous experience as a player, that wasn\u2019t always the case, so it\u2019s always been important for me as captain that we do our best, and shape things up to make sure that the girls do walk away with good experience and good memories.\u201d</p>",

Their success is certainly a reflection of the sheer quality provided by Boulter and Raducanu, but the camaraderie built within the team is also driving them. \u201cEach person does their own individual practices, but we work really well as a team and when we come together at the dinner table,\u201d said Raducanu. \u201cWe\u2019re always laughing and reflecting on the day and we have a few inside jokes kind of running through the team, so that\u2019s keeping us going.\u201d This congenial culture between players who are rivals most weeks on the tour has been deliberately fostered by the team captain, Anne Keothavong, after her own experiences in her playing career as part of Great Britain\u2019s leading duo alongside Elena Baltacha, who died from liver cancer aged 30 in 2014. Baltacha and Keothavong were born just a month apart and their longtime rivalry led to significant tension between them on their respective journeys to becoming top-50 players. In the latter stages of their careers, however, they forged a great friendship. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret, when I was back playing, myself and Elena Baltacha had our ups and downs, but towards the end, we were pretty tight,\u201d said Keothavong. \u201cAs adults, because we were a bit older, more mature, we were able to reflect on how we could have been better, but also the people around us that influence us: who are the right people to listen to, who should we have just ignored? \u201cI think when she passed away, you just kind of think: \u2018Well, all of that \u2026 what was that?\u2019 It was just such a waste to spend so much time being angry and pissed off at each other and it was so totally unnecessary. I\u2019m pleased that before we both hung up our rackets we were able to really talk about all of that and during the last couple of years of our careers, we were very tight.\u201d Since she became captain in 2017, the 41-year-old Keothavong has commanded respect and authority, demanding high standards and ambition from her players, but she can also be found cracking jokes with them. On Tuesday her team will attempt to take Great Britain to the final of this competition for the first time since 1981. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see when you\u2019ve got your top two players genuinely getting on, and there\u2019s a huge amount of respect for each other,\u201d said Keothavong. \u201cWhat\u2019s important for me in this competition is that the girls find a way to gel and get on. From my previous experience as a player, that wasn\u2019t always the case, so it\u2019s always been important for me as captain that we do our best, and shape things up to make sure that the girls do walk away with good experience and good memories.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The US president, Joe Biden, has permitted Ukraine to use US-made Atacms ballistic missiles against Russian and North Korean forces inside Russian territory. Officials in Washington told reporters the weapons could be used in the region of Kursk, where Kyiv has launched an incursion, but that Biden may agree to their deployment elsewhere before Donald Trump comes to power in January. The Kremlin said the US\u2019s decision represented an escalation of the conflict. \u201cIt is clear that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps to continue to add fuel to the fire and to further inflame tensions around this conflict,\u201d Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters. \u201cThis decision is reckless, dangerous, aimed at a qualitative change, a qualitative increase in the level of involvement of the United States.\u201d The Russian foreign ministry said that Ukraine\u2019s use of long-range missiles to attack Russian territory, with US and allied support, would fundamentally alter the nature of the war and trigger \u201can adequate and tangible\u201d response from Russia. The German tabloid Bild is reported on what it calls a \u201ctop secret\u201d delivery to Ukraine of 4,000 strike drones, developed by the German artificial intelligence firm Helsing. The company reportedly received the contract from the Ukraine defence ministry in September and the order has been paid for out of a German government fund. Ukraine\u2019s state emergency services said that at least 10 people were killed and 43 people were injured in a Russian attack on Odesa, Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea port city. The Kremlin rejected a reported peace proposal from the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, to be put forward at the G20 summit in Brazil, to freeze hostilities at the current positions of both parties. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s plan reportedly consists of: freezing the frontline as it is, Ukraine agreeing not to join Nato for at least ten years, supplying Ukraine with weapons to provide for its defence and placing international peacekeepers in a demilitarised buffer zone in the Donbas. Earlier, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed reports that Erdo\u011fan was suggesting a freeze of the current tactical situation as a condition that would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d to the Russian Federation. Moscow has warned of an \u201cappropriate response\u201d if Ukraine fires western-supplied long-range missiles against Russian territory, hours after Joe Biden gave Kyiv permission for such strikes. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday: Kyiv\u2019s use of long-range missiles to attack our territory would represent the direct involvement of the United States and its satellites in hostilities against Russia, as well as a radical change in the essence and nature of the conflict \u2026 Russia\u2019s response in such a case will be appropriate and palpable. The US decision is being justified by the presence of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia against Ukraine. Briefings to US media outlets said permission to use the missiles would be limited to the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia in the summer, my colleagues Pjotr Sauer and Dan Sabbagh, write in this story. In this video report, Guardian video producer Josh Toussaint-Strauss finds out how Russia is using hybrid warfare alongside boosting its arms industry to outpace Nato, and what this means for the war in Ukraine: German chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s call with Vladimir Putin was a \u201cstrategic mistake\u201d that weakened European unity in the face of Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Estonian foreign minister Margus Tsahkna told Reuters on the sidelines of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels earlier. As my colleagues Pjotr Sauer and Kate Connolly write in this report, Scholz urged the Russian president to withdraw troops from Ukraine and negotiate with Kyiv to achieve a just and lasting peace, in the first call between a major western leader and Putin since December 2022. The one-hour phone call came after Putin reportedly spoke with the US president-elect, Donald Trump, whose incoming administration has vowed to push for a swift end to the war in Ukraine. Tsahkna said the call had damaged Western efforts to isolate Putin. \u201cIt was a strategic mistake,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cWe have had a principle agreed that we keep Putin in isolation.\u201d Tsahkna said that position should be maintained until Putin showed a willingness to take part in meaningful negotiations and withdraw his troops from Ukraine. But currently Putin was doing the opposite, Tsahkna said, pointing out that Russia mounted one of its most severe attacks on Ukraine in months in the days after Scholz\u2019s call. \u201cIt just weakened our unity and our positions,\u201d Tsahkna said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also criticised Scholz\u2019s call, saying it was \u201cexactly what Putin has long sought\u201d and could open a \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d of calls that would further undermine efforts to isolate him. We mentioned in an earlier post that Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been visiting the eastern frontline town of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region. Here is a little more on the strategic significance of the town: Pokrovsk lies at an intersection of roads and a railway that make it an important logistics point for the military and for civilians. Its coal mine is the only one in Ukraine that produces coking coal vital for the national steel industry. The Ukrainian military said its forces had repelled more than 30 Russian attacks near Pokrovsk in just the past day. In a battlefield update on Russia\u2019s attempt to seize Pokrovsk, the Institute for the Study of War wrote yesterday: Russian forces have not taken Pokrovsk after eight months of grinding but consistent advances in western Donetsk oblast. Ukrainian defensive operations, based on the integration of successful Ukrainian drone innovators and operators with ground forces combined with constraints on Russia\u2019s strategic and operational-level manpower and materiel reserves, have forced the Russian military command to abandon its original campaign design of a frontal assault on Pokrovsk. The Russian military command is currently attempting to envelop Pokrovsk from the southwest via Selydove and to even out the frontline west of Kurakhove and north of Vuhledar. As fears of escalation in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continue to mount, the UK and EU have taken action against Iran for aiding Russia\u2019s war efforts in Ukraine. The UK said Iran\u2019s national airliner Iran Air will be subject to an asset freeze in response to the country\u2019s transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia, while shipping carrier the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines has been sanctioned for its role in transporting Iranian military supplies. The Russian cargo ship Port Olya-3 has been also sanctioned for carrying missiles from Iran to Russia. Likewise, the EU has widened its sanctions, adding the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) and its director Mohammad Reza Khiabani to its sanctions list. The fresh sanctions by the EU are against vessels and ports used for transporting Iranian-made Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), missiles and related technologies and components. They include prohibiting any transaction with ports and locks owned, operated or controlled by the sanctioned individuals and entities. Reuters reports that Slovakia\u2019s prime minister Robert Fico has come out strongly against any decision to allow Ukraine to use longer-range weapons on targets inside Russia. He has described it as an \u201cunprecedented escalation of tensions\u201d, and said the clear aim of the reported move by Joe Biden\u2019s administration was to thwart or delay peace talks. He said he was in strong disagreement with it. Vyacheslav Volodin, the chair of the State Duma in Russia, has said that the US allowing use of longer-range weapons by Ukraine would not change the situation on the battlefield, but it would serve to finally destroy Russia-US relations, Tass reports. There is currently a ballistic missiles warning in effect in Ukraine\u2019s Sumy region in the north-east of the country. The city of Sumy was struck overnight in an attack which killed at least eleven people. One of the victims of that attack has been named by local Ukrainian media as 9-year-old Ilya Doroshenko. Hungary has sounded a dissenting note from broad European support of the US decision to allow Ukraine to utilise longer range weapons to strike inside Russia. Foreign minister Peter Szijjarto has, Reuters reports, described it as \u201castonishingly dangerous\u201d to allow Nato-supplied weapons to be used for long-range strikes. Earlier this year Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n attracted criticism from EU and Nato allies after he travelled to Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin in person in July. The European Parliament described the visit as a \u201cblatant violation of the EU\u2019s Treaties and common foreign policy.\u201d We have been reporting today that Joe Biden\u2019s decision to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russia with US-supplied long-range missiles has been met with ominous warnings from Moscow \u2013 but has been cautiously welcomed by some western allies. Margus Tsahkna, the foreign minister of Estonia which is another Baltic country that fears a military threat from Russia, said easing restrictions on Ukraine was \u201ca good thing.\u201d \u201cWe have been saying that from the beginning \u2014 that no restrictions must be put on the military support,\u201d he said at a meeting of senior EU diplomats in Brussels. \u201cAnd we need to understand that situation is more serious (than) it was even maybe like a couple of months ago.\u201d Estonia and the other Baltic States have increased their military spending to over 2% of the value of their economies after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and Nato allies have raised their presence in those countries. In an earlier post, we reported that officials had said 8 people had been killed and 18 injured in a Russian attack on Odesa, Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea port city. Ukraine\u2019s state emergency services now says that 10 people were killed in the attack and that 43 people were injured. \u201cAccording to preliminary information, 10 people were killed and 43 others were wounded, including four children,\u201d the agency said on Telegram. The fatalities included at least seven police officers and a medic, according to the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine\u2019s air force said that Russia launched an Iskander-M ballistic missile, which was downed by air defences. \u201cUnfortunately, the downed missile fell into the residential sector of the city\u2019s Prymorskyi district,\u201d the air force wrote in a post on Telegram. US officials say Joe Biden, the US president, has authorised the first use of American-supplied long-range missiles by Ukraine for strikes inside Russia. The first strikes using Army Tactical Missile Systems (Atacms) rockets could come within days. My colleague Oliver Holmes has written this explainer on the capabilities of Atacms missiles and why they are so important to Ukraine: Here is an extract from the piece: Ukraine will now be able to strike targets inside Kursk with the missiles, where Kyiv holds more than 1,000 sq km of territory. The Atacms could target Russian weapons and ammunition depots, supply lines, and military bases, which would give relief to Ukrainian troops on the frontlines. With Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, the move might be a way to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s hand militarily before it is forced into peace talks. It may also have a psychological impact, raising morale in Ukraine during a tough period. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is to present a peace plan for Ukraine at the G20 summit, according to reports by Bloomberg. The Turkish president\u2019s plan reportedly consists of: freezing the frontline as it is Ukraine agreeing not to join Nato for at least ten years supplying Ukraine with weapons to provide for its defence placing international peacekeepers in a demilitarised buffer zone in the Donbas Earlier, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed reports that Erdo\u011fan was suggesting a freeze of the current tactical situation as a condition that would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d to the Russian Federation. Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Monday that he visited the eastern frontline town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk region. A video posted by Zelenskyy showed him visiting troops defending the town from Russian forces, who are situated about 8km (5 miles) away. In a message accompanying the video, Zelenskyy described the front there as \u201cintense\u201d, adding \u201cOnly thanks to the strength of the soldiers, the east is not completely occupied by Russia. The enemy receives a daily response. Thanks to the soldiers for their courage.\u201d The Kremlin has issued a photograph showing a meeting in Moscow today between president Vladimr Putin and Yevgeny Balitsky, who is the Moscow-installed governor in the Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia region. Zaporizhzhia is one of the region of Ukraine which Russia has claimed to annex but which it does not fully occupy. President Zelenskyy has said that the leaders of the G20 group, currently meeting in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, should take note of a strike today by Russia on Odesa which has killed eight people. In a message on his social media channels Zelenskyy appeared to also criticise German chancellor Olaf Scholz for his recent call with Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy posted: A ballistic missile strike by Russian terrorists in Odessa in a residential area. An apartment building, a university, and an administration building were damaged. As of now, it is known about eight dead people. These are not random shots - they are indicative shots. After the calls and meetings with Putin, after all the false gossip in the media about the alleged [Russian] \u201crefrain\u201d from strikes, Russia shows what it is really interested in: only war. And this signal should be heard in all parts of the world, from the halls where the members of the G20 meet, to all the capitals of the world. The governor of Odesa region Oleh Kiper has also posted an update on the attack, saying the dead included \u201cmedics, policemen, and ordinary civilians.\u201d He said that 39 people were injured, including four children. 30 adults have been hospitalised, he said. Kate Connolly is the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent The German tabloid Bild is reporting on what it calls a \u201ctop secret\u201d delivery to Ukraine of 4,000 strike drones, developed by the German artificial intelligence firm Helsing. The company reportedly received the contract from the Ukraine defence ministry in September and the order has been paid for out of a German government fund. The defence minister Boris Pistorius has confirmed the deliveries, saying he is happy that they\u2019re taking place now, when they could not be more needed. He saw them being tested in May with his Ukrainian counterpart Rustem Umerov, during a trip to Kyiv. Referred to as \u201cmini Taureses\u201d - after the long-range missiles which Germany is being urged to deliver but which chancellor Olaf Scholz is refusing to release citing fears for an escalation - the drones are AI-controlled and can apparently out-wit Russian GPS jamming capabilities. Their hit quota is said to be higher than the manually-steered fighter drones and their range four times farther than the conventional kamikaze drones used by the Ukrainian army. Pjotr Sauer and Dan Sabbagh report on the Kremlin reaction earlier today The Kremlin has said Joe Biden\u2019s outgoing administration wants to escalate the conflict in Ukraine by allowing Kyiv to use long-range missiles for strikes inside Russia. Several US outlets reported on Sunday that the Biden administration has decided to allow Ukraine to conduct strikes with US-made weapons deep into sovereign Russian territory. \u201cIt is clear that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps to continue to add fuel to the fire and to further inflame tensions around this conflict,\u201d Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Monday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had long pushed for authorisation from Washington to use the powerful Army Tactical Missile System, known by its initials Atacms, to hit targets inside Russia. Peskov said Putin had expressed Russia\u2019s position clearly in September when the Russian leader warned that the move to let Kyiv use longer-range weapons against targets inside Russia would mean Nato would be directly \u201cat war\u201d with Moscow. Without going into specifics, Putin said at the time Moscow would \u201ctake the appropriate decisions based on the threats that we will face\u201d. On Monday, Russian officials similarly pledged that Moscow would react to President Biden\u2019s decision, though they did not elaborate on what that response might entail. Read more from Pjotr Sauer and Dan Sabbagh here: Kremlin says Biden is \u2018fuelling fire\u2019 of Ukraine conflict with missiles decision Germany is sticking with its decision not to provide long-range missiles to Ukraine, Reuters reports a German government spokesperson said on Monday. Posting to the Telegram app, the governer of Odesa region Oleh Kiper has reported eight people killed and 18 injured by a Russian attack. He said one child is among the victims, and four people are in serious condition. He stated there was \u201cdamaged civil infrastructure, in particular residential buildings.\u201d More details soon \u2026 Polish President Andrzej Duda has said the US decision to allow Ukraine to use US-made missiles to strike targets inside Russia is a \u201cpotentially decisive moment\u201d. Reuters quotes him saying \u201cThis decision was very necessary. Russia sees that Ukraine enjoys strong support and that the west\u2019s position is unyielding and determined. It\u2019s a very important, potentially decisive moment in this war.\u201d Russian forces have taken control of the village of Novooleksiivka in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, Reuters reports, citing Russian media. Russia\u2019s ministry of defence has claimed this morning that two Ukrainian drones were destroyed over the Belgorod region. Earlier the governor of the region reported there were no known casualties from the incident. Tass reports that a Russian court has sentenced two Ukrainian men in the Kherson region, which Russia partially occupies, to 12 years in prison for espionage. The pair were accused of contacting Ukrainian secret services and passing along details of Russian military positions. Local media reports explosions have been heard in Odesa. About ten minutes before the report there was a warning of missile fire from Crimea, which Russia has occupied since 2014. Jennifer Rankin is the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis has bluntly criticised Olaf Scholz\u2019s call with Vladimir Putin. Lithuania is one of Ukraine\u2019s staunchest supporters in the EU, so the comments are not a surprise, but underscore the differences over how to approach Russia\u2019s invasion, as Kremlin forces make deeper advances. Landsbergis, who is also one of the EU\u2019s most outspoken foreign ministers, said it was difficult for him to understand why the call had happened, telling reporters: I\u2019m not in principle against any calling or reach-out, but it has to come from a position of strength, not from the position of weakness, because if it does, then Russians will abuse it. And they clearly are doing exactly that, with massive new rocket barrages against Ukraine\u2019s civil infrastructure, against energy. So what does it help? Why are we doing this? The German chancellor spoke to Putin for one hour on Friday, urging him to withdraw his troops from Ukraine. At the weekend Russia then launched its largest attack on Ukraine in months, killing at least seven people and forcing the introduction of nationwide electricity rationing. The Kremlin said on Monday that if the US allowed Ukraine to use US-made weapons to strike far into Russia then it would lead to a rise in tension and deepen the involvement of the US in the conflict. Speaking at his regular daily press briefing, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that there was no change in position from what Vladimir Putin had said in September. The Russian president had said he would consider strikes by US-made weapons on Russian soil as the direct involvement of Nato in the conflict. In response to a question from Tass, Peskov said Russia was only aware of the apparent decision by the Joe Biden administration from reporting in western media. Asked about recent overtures towards peace by Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Peskov said that any so-called \u201cfreezing\u201d of the conflict along the existing frontline was unacceptable for the Russian Federation. Jennifer Rankin is the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent The EU\u2019s chief diplomat Josep Borrell has expressed hope that European nations will allow Ukraine to use long-range weapons to strike Russia, following the US decision to loosen restrictions on US-made rockets. Borrell, who is standing down as the EU\u2019s foreign policy high representative next month, said he had long-believed Ukraine should be able to use western weapons to hit military targets inside Russia, telling reporters. I\u2019ve been saying once and again that Ukraine should be able to use the arms provided to them in order to not only to stop the arrow but also to be able to hit the archers. He said he hoped member states would agree on that, suggesting if there was no common decision \u201canyone will do whatever they believe is according to the need to support Ukraine\u201d. France, the EU\u2019s most consequential military power, has not immediately endorsed the US position. However, France\u2019s foreign minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot referred to Emmanuel Macron\u2019s words from May, saying his government would consider this option if it was to allow hitting targets where Russia is \u201ccurrently aggressing Ukrainian territory\u201d. Dutch foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp described the US decision as very important, saying: What I see is that President Putin in general only listens to facts on the ground. And I think therefore that it is very important the US also does not [impose] limitations any more for weapons delivered to Ukraine. Germany\u2019s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said this was not a shift in western policy, telling the media: The decision from the American side, and I would like to emphasise that this is not a rethink but an intensification of what has already been delivered by other partners, is so important at this moment. The ministers are attending the monthly EU foreign affairs meeting in Brussels, the last one to be chaired by Borrell, who is ending his five-year term. Reflecting on his tenure Borrell chided member states for being disunited and slow on foreign policy: My last call to my colleagues will be, be more united. Take decisions quicker. Every time we took decisions in order to support Ukraine, it took too long. Our video team have this report on yesterday\u2019s Russian strike on Sumy which killed 11 people, including two children. France, which has already provided long-range missiles to Ukraine, on Monday signalled that allowing Kyiv to strike military targets inside Russia remained an option on the table. \u201cWe openly said this was an option that we would consider if it was to allow to strike a target from where Russia is currently aggressing Ukrainian territory. So nothing new on the other side,\u201d Reuters reports Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot told journalists ahead of a EU ministers\u2019 meeting in Brussels. Local media reports explosions have been heard in Kherson. An air alert has sounded in Zaporizhzhia. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Monday expressed his hope that EU members could agree to allow Ukraine to use arms to strike inside Russia, Reuters reports. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying once and again that Ukraine should be able to use the arms we provided to them, in order to not only stop the arrows but also to be able to hit the archers,\u201d Borrell said before a meeting with EU foreign ministers in Brussels. \u201cI continue believing this is what has to be done. I\u2019m sure we will discuss once again. I hope member states will agree on that.\u201d In the UK an opposition politician has called on Keir Starmer\u2019s government to allow Ukraine use of UK-made Storm Shadow missiles to strike inside Russia. Recently appointed shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge of the opposition Conservative party told the GB News channel that permission from the Biden administration to use US-made weapons inside Russia\u2019s Kursk region was \u201ca very important development\u201d and \u201cvery welcome given the military situation in Ukraine.\u201d He continued: I do hope it now paves the way for the UK granting full autonomy to Ukraine in relation to the use of Storm Shadow missiles. Russia invaded Ukraine, a wholly unprovoked, illegal invasion, a dictatorship invading a democracy. It\u2019s been the right thing to do, to not be directly involved in Ukraine, but to support them in whatever way we can, in terms of providing munitions that\u2019s helped Ukraine to check their advance. He cited the deployment of troops from North Korea as an \u201cescalation\u201d by Russia, saying \u201cimagine how the Russians would feel if 10,000 Nato troops were now in Ukraine, supporting them. The fact is 10,000 North Korean troops have been deployed into this battle. A totalitarian regime, hundreds of thousands of troops, testing nuclear weapons, is sending those troops out to fight in Europe, alongside Russia. We have to understand which country is in the right here. It\u2019s Ukraine. We are doing the right thing to support them.\u201d The foreign minister of the Netherlands, Caspar Veldkamp, has described the decision by the Joe Biden administration that US supplied weapons can be used to strike inside Russia as an \u201cadequate response\u201d to the deployment of North Korean troops by Russia. The US president will allow Ukraine to use US-made Atacms rockets, which have a range of 190 miles (300km) inside Russia\u2019s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops have staged an incursion. Reuters reports that Odesa, on Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea coast, remains without power. Rolling power outages are also expected today. Authorities said most regions would face blackouts on Monday of up to eight hours, including the capital Kyiv, with only the west of the country spared. A Ukrainian MP has said that the use of longer range missiles against Russia is not a \u201csilver bullet\u201d that will guarantee victory for Ukraine, and called for a change of strategy from western leaders. Mariia Ionova, who sits on the foreign affairs committee in the Ukrainian parliament, told listeners of the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: Missiles are not the silver bullet against our common enemies, and that is why we are asking all our friends that we need a change in strategy, because our enemies are united and we should stand together as well. When we are talking about this permission [for longer range missile fire], yes, we appreciate it, but that [alone] will not bring a victory. [We need] an air shield over Ukraine, more training, more western military instructors in Ukraine, more sanctions, and also more secondary sanctions. And I think also we should be, and our friends\u2019 leaders should be, more creative, more brave. Do not exclude anything. Do not postpone. We understand the procedures in democratic societies, but for us, time is human lives. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, has posted to his Telegram channel to report that air defence in the region shot down \u201cseveral enemy drones\u201d from Ukraine. \u201cThere are no casualties,\u201d he reported. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of Kherson region, has posted to Facebook to state that four people were killed and ten others wounded by Russian strikes on the region in the past 24 hours. Ukraine\u2019s authorities have revised up the death toll and number of people injured by a missiles strike on Sumy at the weekend. It is now believed that 11 people have died, and 89 people were wounded. Reuters reports that two children are among the dead, with 11 children among those hurt. Volodymyr Artyukh, the head of the Sumy military administration, said it was \u201ca tragedy that Russia brought to our land.\u201d Local media reports that Ukraine is not expecting any power outages in the Lviv region in the west of the country today. Russian media reports the country\u2019s security forces have arrested a man on suspicion of preparing explosives and working for the Ukrainian secret service. Tass reports the FSB in a statement said the man was planning attacks in the Belgorod, Bryansk and Tula regions. The 48-year-old was, the FSB claimed, arrested with bomb-making equipment in Russia\u2019s Kaluga region, which is to the south-west of Moscow. Overnight Ukraine\u2019s air force has claimed it shot down eight of 11 drones launched at the country by Russia, Reuters reports. Citing a message on the Telegram app, the news agency reports that Ukraine\u2019s air force said it lost three of the drones on its radar, and that Russia also launched three missiles into Ukraine. Two fo the missiles were aimed at Ukraine\u2019s Sumy region. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Russian lawmaker Maria Butina has said that the administration of President Joe Biden was risking a third world war if it allowed Ukraine to use US-made weapons to strike deep into Russia. \u201cThese guys, Biden\u2019s administration, is trying to escalate the situation to the maximum while they still have power and are still in office,\u201d said Butina, who was jailed in the US for 18 months in 2019 after she tried to infiltrate US conservative groups and the National Rifle Association to promote Russian political interests around the 2016 election. She is now a lawmaker for the ruling United Russia party. \u201cI have a great hope that [Donald] Trump will overcome this decision if this has been made because they are seriously risking the start of World War Three which is not in anybody\u2019s interest,\u201d she told Reuters. Biden on Sunday reversed a ban on the firing of long-range US missiles into Russian territory by permitting them to be used against Russian and North Korean forces in the Kursk region. The US president will allow Ukraine to use US-made Atacms rockets, which have a range of 190 miles (300km) . President Vladimir Putin said on 12 September that western approval for such a step would mean \u201cthe direct involvement of Nato countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine\u201d because Nato military infrastructure and personnel would have to be involved in the targeting and firing of the missiles. In late October, Putin said that Russia\u2019s defence ministry was working on different ways to respond if the United States and its Nato allies help Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with long-range Western missiles. \u201cI guess there are some people in the United States who have nothing to lose for whatever reason or who are completely off the grid so much that they simply do not care,\u201d said Butina. In other developments: Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appeared to confirm the news of the US policy reversal, though he said any proof about the change in policy would emerge on the battlefield, if and when the missiles are used. \u201cToday, there\u2019s a lot of talk in the media about us receiving permission for respective actions. But strikes are not carried out with words. Such things are not announced. Missiles will speak for themselves. They certainly will,\u201d Zelenskyy said. Ten people, including two children, were killed and 52 have been injured after when a Russian missile hit a residential nine-storey building in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern region of Sumy, Ukraine\u2019s emergency services and military have said. \u201cSunday evening for the city of Sumy became hell, a tragedy that Russia brought to our land,\u201d Volodymyr Artyukh, the head of the Sumy military administration said in a post on the administration\u2019s Telegram messaging channel. Russia pounded Ukraine\u2019s power grid into the early hours of Sunday in what Kyiv said was a \u201cmassive\u201d attack with 120 missiles and 90 drones that killed at least seven people. The attack was the largest missile and drone assault on Ukraine since August and the first big Russian assault since the US election, showing the Kremlin in little mood to compromise after Donald Trump\u2019s victory. Ukrenergo, Ukraine\u2019s principal energy supplier, said blackouts and consumption restrictions would be introduced \u201cin all regions\u201d from Monday as engineers tried to repair as much of the damage to power facilities as possible. With the harsh Ukrainian winter fast approaching, the country is already suffering from major energy shortfalls. Polish prime minister Donald Tusk said the attack showed that talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone would not stop the war in Ukraine, two days after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz rang him. \u201cNo one will stop Putin with phone calls. The attack last night, one of the biggest in this war, has proved that telephone diplomacy cannot replace real support from the whole west for Ukraine,\u201d Donald Tusk wrote on X. Scholz defended his decision to phone the Kremlin, telling reporters on Sunday it was important to tell him [Putin] that he cannot count on support from Germany, Europe and many others in the world waning\u201d. He added: \u201cThe conversation was very detailed but contributed to a recognition that little has changed in the Russian president\u2019s views of the war \u2013 and that\u2019s not good news.\u201d Ukraine will be \u201ctop of the agenda\u201d this week at a meeting of leaders from the world\u2019s most powerful economies, Keir Starmer pledged, though he said he had \u201cno plans\u201d to follow Scholz and speak directly to Putin. Starmer will meet world leaders on Monday at the G20 summit in Brazil, which the Russian president has declined to attend, sending his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in his place. Finland is hosting its first large-scale Nato artillery exercise since the Nordic nation joined the military alliance last year, with live fire drills starting on Sunday. The exercise conducted in the northern Lapland region in November is part of Dynamic Front 25, the largest Nato artillery exercise ever held in Europe, with fire drills in Finland as well as Estonia, Germany, Romania and Poland. The Nordic nation, which shares a border with Russia, joined Nato last year, dropping decades of military non-alignment after Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. About 1,500 supporters of Russia\u2019s exiled opposition marched through central Berlin on Sunday \u2013 led by Yulia Navalnaya and chanting \u201cNo to war!\u201d and \u201cNo to Putin\u201d \u2013 in a demonstration against Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The march saw a smaller turnout than expected and was seen as a credibility test for the movement \u2013 weakened by years of repression and thrown into disarray since the death of its main leader Alexei Navalny in prison earlier this year. Russia\u2019s air defence units destroyed a drone heading towards Moscow, mayor Sergei Sobyanin said early on Monday. \u201cAccording to preliminary information, there is no damage or casualties at the site of the fall of the debris,\u201d Sobyanin wrote on his Telegram messaging channel.",

      "bodyText": "Hopes have been raised for EU citizens who have faced being removed from the UK post-Brexit even while they wait on their applications to stay, after a statutory body wrote to the Home Office demanding clarity on their legal right to go on holiday or visit family abroad. The move comes after a number of cases came to light involving the removal of EU citizens when they returned to the UK after a visit abroad. They include a Greek Cypriot who was removed from Scotland last month despite being told by the Home Office it could take another two years for his application for post-Brexit pre-settled status to be considered because of a backlog. At the time he said it was unfair to leave people whose rights were supposedly protected under the UK-EU withdrawal agreement in effect unable to visit family for years. The Independent Monitoring Authority said on Monday it had written to the Home Office about a number of concerns including the status of a \u201ccertificate of application\u201d, which is issued by the Home Office to give EU citizens evidence to show employers, landlords and the NHS they are entitled to be in the country while their case is pending. \u201cThe IMA has written to the Home Office after receiving information that citizens who hold a valid certificate of application (CoA) are having issues at the UK border, including being denied entry to the UK or are subject to removal directions. This includes administrative review of applications pending,\u201d it said. The IMA said that while the CoA \u201cdoes not confirm that the person has immigration status in the UK under the EU settlement scheme\u201d, it could be used to evidence the temporary protection of their rights while their application or an administrative review of a negative decision is pending. Under the law, those still turned away by a Home Office administrative review are entitled to appeal further at a tribunal. Costa Koushiappis\u2019s original application for the pre-settled status given to those in the country for less than five years before Brexit was rejected but he immediately requested an administrative review. He was detained at Edinburgh airport and despite showing his CoA and telling Border Force officers that he had a job and a flat, they ordered his removal. His lawyer, Andrew Jordan, said at the time that all he was asking was that his client and other EU citizens be \u201cgiven a chance\u201d and that the due process of the law be allowed to take its full course. In January, a Spanish woman was removed from the country after she made a Christmas trip to Spain to see her family and newborn niece.",

      "body": "<p>After briefing Michael Buerk, and countless other journalists, before they set off to cover the 1984-85 famine in Ethiopia, in which a million people are thought to have died, Paddy Coulter fell to thinking. The stark images that western reporters sent back home triggered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/live-aid\">Live Aid</a>, the biggest charitable event the world had ever seen. But how accurate a picture did they portray? Coulter, who has died aged 78, was then the head of communications for Oxfam. But in 1989 he shook the aid world by writing <a href=\"https://newint.org/children-and-youth/2024/aid-agencies-are-still-relying-starving-child-image\">a piece in the New Internationalist</a> that launched a powerful attack on aid agency fundraisers for their reliance on \u201cstarving children\u201d imagery and ignoring the indispensable work that local partners did. </p> <p>In Ethiopia in 1984, Coulter revealed, Oxfam had 108 employees, of whom 100 were Ethiopian. Yet only white faces ever appeared on television. Almost 30 years before it became fashionable to complain of \u201cwhite saviour syndrome\u201d, Coulter drew attention to the distorted picture that was being created of what he called \u201cwhites to the rescue of blacks\u201d. </p> <p>His first thought for challenging this was to arrange media training for Oxfam\u2019s black workers in Ethiopia. Then \u2013 to keep the celebrity-hungry media happy \u2013 he arranged for the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/15/glenda-jackson-obituary\">Glenda Jackson</a> to go out to Ethiopia to interview them for ITN. Coulter issued a plea for aid agencies to stop seeing fundraising as more important than educating the public. But the appeal fell on deaf ears.</p> <p>Coulter was not po-faced about this. He was a man of japes and jollities who had been a founding trustee of Comic Relief. But in the 1990s he resigned from its board, after 10 years, over the same issue \u2013 two decades before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/24/africa-comic-relief\">David Lammy</a> made the same complaint about Comic Relief. A film about a street children project in Addis Ababa focused on the actor Julie Walters with her arm around a little boy doing his homework by the light of a hurricane lamp. The film editors had removed empowering footage that showed the achievements of adolescents in the project. Coulter objected but was overruled by the Comic Relief fundraisers. He resigned saying: \u201cI, for one, would rather accept a smaller return and have a more \u2018educated pound\u2019.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I, for one, would rather accept a smaller return and have a more \u2018educated pound\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Truth-telling, and the ethical dilemmas surrounding the portrayal of the truth, were key to Coulter\u2019s long career, in which he played an important role in repositioning NGOs as a major force for change on development. He was born John Coulter in Belfast, and grew up in the market town of Ballynahinch, where his Presbyterian father, Percival, was a cattle dealer and butcher, and his Quaker mother, Eileen (nee Hobson), a primary school teacher.

At his local, the Rose and Crown in Oxford, he would routinely upbraid the landlord for the shortcomings of England\u2019s Six Nations rugby team, indeed any team bar the Irish.

Then, back in Oxford, he became Oxfam\u2019s head of communications. </p> <p>Having been awoken to the way that the western media distorted the reality of life in the developing world, he moved to the International Broadcasting Trust (IBT) in London. There he spent a decade lobbying the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 to improve the quality of the programmes they made about the global south. At IBT he produced more than 100 programmes on global development and environment issues for mainstream TV, including the BBC series Under the Blue Flag, which in 1996 won the United Nations Correspondents Association Gold award. </p> <p>In 2000 he was appointed OBE \u201cfor services to development awareness\u201d.</p> <p>His next move to improve the quality of truth-telling saw him switch in 2001 to become director of studies at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University.

      "body": "<p>My father-in-law Dennis Robertson, who has died aged 92, was an engineer specialising in flow dynamics, who led the development of the modern traffic light system in the UK in the 1970s and 80s.</p> <p>Dennis joined the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (now the Transport Research Laboratory) in Crowthorne, Berkshire, in the early 1970s where he began research into traffic flow management. This was a relatively new and increasingly important area of study as car ownership and congestion in British cities was increasing.</p> <p>Dennis and his team found that the existing approach to traffic light phases, with fixed periods of green and red, was unsuitable and often problematic in British cities, causing avoidable congestion. Instead, using data captured from sensors embedded in roads ahead of traffic lights combined with developments in computing, the TRRL team developed an algorithm that would continually modify the traffic light phase length dependent on the traffic approaching and waiting at red lights.</p> <p>This led to the development of the algorithmically controlled traffic light system Transyt (Traffic Network Study Tool) for which Dennis, in 1982, was awarded the Esso Energy award by the Royal Society for \u201csignificant contribution to energy saving\u201d. Transyt was further refined so that it would consider input and feedback from other traffic lights in the same city, reacting to flow demand across the whole city system, and this led to an improved algorithm and system named Scoot (Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique).</p> <p>Dennis travelled the world to present the Scoot approach and benefits, and the software is still used in more than 350 towns and cities across the globe. In 1987 Dennis was recognised for his work in the field of transport research with an honorary doctorate from the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. In 2003, he was appointed OBE.</p> <p>Dennis was born in south London, the son of Kenneth, a commercial traveller and builders\u2019 merchant, and his wife, Lily (nee Birch). After leaving school and completing his national service in the RAF, he began work as an apprentice engineer at Napier engineers in Acton. During his apprenticeship, he studied for a University of London mechanical engineering degree at evening classes, graduating with a first. He moved to work for the British Aircraft Corporation, working on the TSR-2 reconnaissance and strike aircraft, primarily on the design of the cockpit instrumentation.

      "bodyText": "My father-in-law Dennis Robertson, who has died aged 92, was an engineer specialising in flow dynamics, who led the development of the modern traffic light system in the UK in the 1970s and 80s. Dennis joined the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (now the Transport Research Laboratory) in Crowthorne, Berkshire, in the early 1970s where he began research into traffic flow management. This was a relatively new and increasingly important area of study as car ownership and congestion in British cities was increasing. Dennis and his team found that the existing approach to traffic light phases, with fixed periods of green and red, was unsuitable and often problematic in British cities, causing avoidable congestion. Instead, using data captured from sensors embedded in roads ahead of traffic lights combined with developments in computing, the TRRL team developed an algorithm that would continually modify the traffic light phase length dependent on the traffic approaching and waiting at red lights. This led to the development of the algorithmically controlled traffic light system Transyt (Traffic Network Study Tool) for which Dennis, in 1982, was awarded the Esso Energy award by the Royal Society for \u201csignificant contribution to energy saving\u201d. Transyt was further refined so that it would consider input and feedback from other traffic lights in the same city, reacting to flow demand across the whole city system, and this led to an improved algorithm and system named Scoot (Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique). Dennis travelled the world to present the Scoot approach and benefits, and the software is still used in more than 350 towns and cities across the globe. In 1987 Dennis was recognised for his work in the field of transport research with an honorary doctorate from the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. In 2003, he was appointed OBE. Dennis was born in south London, the son of Kenneth, a commercial traveller and builders\u2019 merchant, and his wife, Lily (nee Birch). After leaving school and completing his national service in the RAF, he began work as an apprentice engineer at Napier engineers in Acton. During his apprenticeship, he studied for a University of London mechanical engineering degree at evening classes, graduating with a first. He moved to work for the British Aircraft Corporation, working on the TSR-2 reconnaissance and strike aircraft, primarily on the design of the cockpit instrumentation. Though the TSR-2 was eventually cancelled, Dennis remained proud of his work on the project. After 20 years with the TRRL, Dennis retired in 1992, having reached the position of deputy director. He continued to have an active interest in traffic research, particularly the use of pay-per-mile traffic management. He also began to play bridge and spent many hours computing. A keen photographer and videographer, he embraced digital photography, and also enjoyed life in the local community with the U3A, Rotary and Probus. Dennis is survived by his second wife and their daughter, by a son from his first marriage, and by a stepson.",

The study by the Social Metrics Commission (SMC), which uses measures recently adopted by the UK government, found the cost of living crisis had plunged 2 million more people into severe hardship since 2019. In total, more than 16 million people are defined as living in poverty, or 24% of the UK population \u2013 the highest since comparable records began in 2000. Children accounted for the biggest rise of any social group falling into poverty, the report found, with an extra 260,000 on the breadline since before the Covid pandemic, meaning a record 36%, or 5.2 million children, were in deprivation. It is likely to reignite calls for Labour to scrap the two-child benefit cap as, of those 5.2 million children, more than half (55%) lived in families with three or more children. About one in four of the children in poverty lived in a single-child household, with the same proportion in a two-child family. Keir Starmer has resisted calls to abandon the policy \u2013 introduced by George Osborne when he was chancellor \u2013 saying the government would not take on the \u201cunfunded pledge\u201d without identifying a source for the \u00a33bn annual cost.

Under the government\u2019s current definition, which measures only average income and housing costs, 18% of the UK population was defined as being in absolute poverty in the year to March 2023, including 3.6 million children. With the new model, which is set to be adopted by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), 1.6 million more children are in poverty than under the current definition. The findings cover a period when living standards suffered their biggest fall since modern records began in the mid-1950s, as the Covid pandemic followed by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine pushed the cost of goods to their highest level in four decades. The SMC is a non-partisan body set up in 2016 to develop a new measure of deprivation in the UK.

It\u2019s time for them to move faster.</p> <p>Politicians have the power to reach a fair and ambitious deal. They must deliver on this responsibility. They must engage immediately and constructively. The highest possible level of ambition is indeed difficult, and it requires courage.

These pairs are always one from a developing country and one from a developed country.</p> <p>G20 nations cause 80% of all emissions and it is rare for their annual meeting today to coincide with the climate Cop \u2013 that is an opportunity, said Bubayev:</p> <p>Their leadership is essential to making progress. We cannot succeed without them, and the world is waiting to hear from them. We want them to provide clear mandates [to their negotiators] to deliver at Cop29.</p> <p>The UN\u2019s climate chief Simon Steele also rallied ministers to action:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is still a ton of work to do to ensure Cop29 delivers and [countries] to be moving much faster towards landing zones, particularly on the [climate finance goal]. I\u2019ve been very blunt. Climate finance is not charity. It is 100% in every nation\u2019s interest to protect their economies and people from rampant climate impacts.</p> <p>Ministers who have just arrived need to roll up their sleeves and dive into the hardest issues. Bluffing, brinkmanship and premeditated playbooks are burning up precious time. So let\u2019s cut the theatrics and get down to the real business this week.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bubayev got two softball questions from journalists from Azerbaijan, where press freedom is essentially nonexistent. But Shauna Corr, from the Irish Daily Mirror, threw a tough one: \u201cHow many oil and gas deals have Azerbaijan done this year while leading these talks? And do you think that\u2019s good leadership when the aim of Cop is to reduce fossil fuel use?\u201d Azerbaijan is significantly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/23/cop29-host-azerbaijan-set-for-major-fossil-gas-expansion-report-says\">increasing its gas production</a>.</p> <p>Bubayev, who formerly worked for Azerbaijan\u2019s state oil company, gave a non-answer:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The main oil and gas producing countries [have] already adopted decarbonisation programs.

The presidency isn\u2019t giving any hope for how the world will strike the right compromises.\u201d</p> <p>This kind of weariness is understandable, especially from people stuck in windowless rooms for 18 hours a day. And the frustration of developing countries is real \u2013 climate finance, the subject of this Cop, is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/27/2023-costliest-climate-disasters-poor-lose-out-global-postcode-lottery\">matter of life and death</a> for them, and rich countries are certainly dragging their heels on coming up with the sums needed.</p>    <p>It has been a gruelling week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2024/nov/11/cop29-live-the-climate-summit-gets-under-way-in-azerbaijan\">beginning last weekend with a tedious row over the agenda</a> as countries led by Saudi Arabia \u2013 predictably and reprehensibly \u2013 tried to sideline discussions of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/15/fossil-fuels-how-a-huge-gamble-sealed-cop28-deal\">\u201ctransition away from fossil fuels\u201d that was agreed last year</a>, as a way of unpicking that resolution.

The Cop process itself has come under attack, with a group including a former UN secretary-general, a former UN climate chief, and a former UN climate envoy, calling for reform.</p> <p>But to be too gloomy about these talks at this stage would be wrong. There is a deal to be struck here \u2013 and as Germany\u2019s respected development minister Jochen Flasbarth warns today, putting it off to next year means trying to run these talks with Donald Trump in the White House.</p> <p>This is my 18<sup>th</sup> Cop \u2013 my first was Cop10 in Buenos Aires in 2004, in the distant days when Argentina was a developing world climate champion. From my perspective, the first week of Cop29 has not seen great movement, but nor has the Cop shown signs of falling apart \u2013 unlike the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fb70c48-ed9b-11de-ba12-00144feab49a\">infamous Copenhagen Cop15</a>, in 2009 which was already a shambles by the midway point.

But it has not allowed the agenda to spiral out of its control, as the Danish prime minister\u2019s office did at at Cop15, which ended in mayhem. (Though also with a useful deal, which many people forget.)</p> <p>We must all remember, too, that Cop29 is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/08/cop29-climate-talks-what-would-a-good-outcome-look-like\">breaking new ground</a>, so it\u2019s not surprising this is turning out to be tricky. This is the first time there have ever been substantive negotiations on finance at a Cop.</p> <p>When the totemic target of ensuring $100bn would flow to developing countries each year by 2020 was put on the table, in the last days of Copenhagen, it was done with only brief prior discussion. (The finance announcement took even the UN by surprise \u2013 Ban Ki-moon, when I interviewed him just after he had stepped off the plane at Copenhagen, confidently told me that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c00c420-e9b0-11de-9f1f-00144feab49a\">developing countries must resign themselves to leaving Cop15 without promises of cash</a>. When the story appeared, he was promptly shot down by the Cop presidency and told to recant \u2013 so he claimed to have been misquoted. He wasn\u2019t.)</p> <p>Finance ministers don\u2019t even come to Cops, under normal circumstances, or make only occasional brief appearances \u2013 these meetings are usually run by environment ministers or foreign ministries. To get an idea of how constrained other ministries are by the finance department, take the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/17/david-lammy-kew-speech-uk-global-climate-fight\">speech by UK foreign secretary David Lammy this September</a>. Lammy wanted to announce the UK\u2019s return to climate leadership on the global stage, in contrast to his Conservative predecessors. But he was not allowed to confirm the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/26/ed-miliband-labour-honour-pledge-11bn-overseas-climate-aid\">pledge of \u00a311.6bn of climate aid</a>, set out under the previous government \u2013 because the UK\u2019s finance minister, Rachel Reeves, would not set out the UK budget until the following month.</p>    <p>That constraint is fairly typical across governments \u2013 no other ministries may preempt Treasury decisions. So the involvement of finance in this year\u2019s talks is an added complication for many.</p> <p>Finding the money to put developing countries on to a green path <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/13/barbados-pm-mia-mottley-donald-trump-climate-meeting-invitation\">makes sense for rich countries</a>, and for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/15/china-faces-crucial-decisions-on-climate-policy-during-second-trump-term\">rapidly developing economies such as China</a>, as much as it does the poor. Not only would it prevent climate chaos, help stem climate migration, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/developing-world-needs-private-finance-for-green-transition-says-cop-president\">prevent the reversal of development in stricken countries</a> \u2013 it would also open new markets for countries with low-carbon expertise to sell into. A trillion dollars a year is only about 1% of the global economy, and is less than a third of the amount spent globally on energy every year. These talks are not a lost cause. A deal at Cop29 would lift everybody, and it is there to be grasped.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-18T07:52:31.009Z\">at 7.52am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-673a3b628f08916386e23efa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-18T06:17:41.474Z\">6.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning!

But before I go, here are the main lines from today\u2019s non-action at the summit. \u201cCut the theatrics,\u201d UN climate chief Simon Steele told country representatives in Baku, after talks over the key issue of climate finance stalled, with developing countries insisting they need over $1tn a year and richer nations balking at the cost. There was a lot of frustration at Cop29, with progress on a climate finance agreement very slow. Shirley Matheson, WWF global NDC enhancement lead, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of frustration in the room. There\u2019s a lot of anxiety. There\u2019s a need for parties to really get together and work through this. One of Europe\u2019s top human rights officials accused Cop29 host country Azerbaijan of jailing activists and journalists for their work and opposition to the authorities. Michael O\u2019Flaherty, the Council of Europe commissioner for human rights, called for Azerbaijan to immediately release them. Australian climate change and energy minister Chris Bowen said reaching an agreement before the week is out was proving difficult. Bowen said the finance goal needed to cover what he called \u201cthe big three\u201d issues: the quantum, the contributor base and the structure of a funding agreement. The internationally agreed goal to keep the world\u2019s temperature rise below 1.5C is now \u201cdeader than a doornail\u201d, climate scientists have said. Three of the five leading research groups monitoring global temperatures consider 2024 on track to be at least 1.5C (2.7F) hotter than pre-industrial times. But senior US officials insisted the world can still meet the 1.5C target, but not without ambitious climate action from China. In recent days, the US and China have reaffirmed joint commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions other than CO2, a rare example of collaboration between the rivals. Meanwhile, the UK and the US signed a new agreement for civil nuclear collaboration on the sidelines of Cop negotiations. The agreement aims to pool billions in research funds to speed up the development of new technologies such as advanced modular reactors. That\u2019s about it. I\u2019ll be back with you early doors tomorrow morning to kick the live blog off for another day of climate negotiations coverage. Relying on natural carbon sinks such as forests and oceans to offset continued fossil fuel emissions will not stop global heating, the scientists who developed net zero have warned, writes Patrick Greenfield, Guardian biodiversity reporter. Each year, the planet\u2019s oceans, forests, soils and other natural carbon sinks absorb about half of all human emissions, forming part of government plans to limit global heating to below 2C under the Paris agreement. But the international group of authors who developed the science behind net zero have warned that countries could \u201ccheat\u201d their way towards Paris targets using naturally occurring parts of Earth\u2019s carbon cycle to make it look as if they achieved net zero while continuing to drive global heating. The study, published on Monday in Nature and led by the University of Oxford, said that naturally occurring carbon sinks such as rainforests and peatlands must be protected so they can remove historic pollution, but never formed part of the original net zero definition developed by scientists in 2009. The scientists underscored the need for \u201cgeological net zero\u201d, which means any future carbon emissions must be counteracted by permanent removal of the pollution from fossil fuels \u2013 not from pre-existing natural ecosystems. They urged governments to urgently clarify what net zero means at Cop29 in Azerbaijan or continue to risk catastrophic climate breakdown. Click the link below to read more: It is not part of the official agenda, but the UK and the US signed a new agreement for civil nuclear collaboration at the Cop29 summit on Monday. The agreement, which was announced by the UK\u2019s department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), aims to pool billions in research funds to speed up the development of new technologies. According to the statement, the agreement was signed by Ed Miliband, the UK\u2019s energy secretary, and David Turk, the US deputy secretary for energy. It will please some in the climate world who believe that investment in nuclear energy is the fastest way to decarbonise energy grids. At last year\u2019s Cop the US and the UK were among 31 countries that committed to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050. DESNZ is hopeful that new nuclear technologies, such as advanced modular reactors, can play a big role in decarbonising heavy industries such as hydrogen and steel production. Miliband said: Nuclear will play a vital role in our clean energy future. That is why we are working closely with our allies to unleash the potential of cutting-edge nuclear technology. Advanced nuclear technology will help decarbonise industry by providing low-carbon heat and power, supporting new jobs and investment here in the UK. The world can still meet the more ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement to keep global temperature rise under 1.5C, but cannot meet that goal without ambitious climate action from China, senior US officials told reporters on Monday, writes Dharna Noor, Guardian US fossil fuels and climate reporter. In recent days, the US and China have reaffirmed joint commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions other than CO2, which account for half of all warming contributions today. It\u2019s been a rare instance of collaboration between the two countries \u2013 and one that is set to founder when Donald Trump takes office in the US in February, my colleague Fiona Harvey wrote last week. Countries are on track to deliver new climate action plans, known as a nationally determined contribution, before 10 February \u2013 just days after Trump takes office. The US plans to meet that deadline, the officials said. The main aim for negotiators at Cop29 is to create a new and expanded goal for how much money rich countries will provide developing nations for climate adaptation and to transition away from fossil fuels. Negotiations on this point are currently deadlocked, but such strife is normal for UN climate negotiations, the officials said in the background briefing. Cash for climate adaptation remains the sticking point in the Cop29 talks in Baku, the Associated Press reports, with countries still far apart on how much is needed for developing countries to transition away from fossil fuels, adapt to climate change and pay for damages caused by extreme weather. Developing nations have said they need $1.3tn, while experts last week put the figure at about $1tn. Rich nations are yet to name the figure they think is appropriate. Teresa Anderson, the global lead on climate justice at ActionAid International, was sceptical about rich countries\u2019 intentions. She said: The concern is that the pressure to add developing countries to the list of contributors is not, in fact, about raising more money for frontline countries. Rich countries are just trying to point the finger and have an excuse to provide less finance. That\u2019s not the way to address runaway climate breakdown, and is a distraction from the real issues at stake. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, WWF global climate and energy lead, who was president at Cop20, when the summit was held in Lima, Peru, said: Climate finance is the fuel for emissions reductions. We need to be discussing both in parallel. After a faltering first week, Parties now have a second chance to work together and build consensus around the climate solutions we need to reduce emissions quickly. It is essential that this Cop sends a strong signal that countries need to raise their game on emission reductions. We need to maintain the momentum from Cop28\u2019s landmark decision to transition away from fossil fuels, with an outcome here that accelerates the just energy transformation. The Australian climate change and energy minister Chris Bowen has spoken about the high degree of difficulty of reaching an agreement before the week is out, writes Adam Morton, Guardian Australia\u2019s climate and environment editor. Bowen has been asked by the Cop29 president to co-chair with Egyptian minister Yasmine Fouad the negotiations on what is known as the \u201cnew collective quantified goal on climate finance\u201d. A deal on finance for the poor and vulnerable is the core focus at Cop29, and campaigners have expressed frustration at the slow progress. Bowen said the finance goal needed to cover what he called \u201cthe big three\u201d issues: the quantum, the contributor base (which economists have recommended could include not just developed countries, but multilateral development banks, private capital and new forms of taxation) and the structure of a funding agreement. \u201cAll three are intrinsically linked, so you can\u2019t solve one without the other,\u201d he told the Guardian. He said there was also a fourth issue that must be addressed - accessibility for all, particularly for Pacific countries so they did not miss out, suggesting this had happened in the past. \u201cThose four things - the big three plus accessibility - is a jigsaw puzzle. A four- dimensional jigsaw puzzle being constructed on a tight timeline, with 198 parties,\u201d Bowen said. On the state of negotiations, he said: \u201cThe importance is high, the degree of difficulty is high, but the energy levels and determination to give it the best show is high. That\u2019s on behalf of all of us - myself, Yasmine... and the presidency.\u201d \u201cNow is the time to be brave,\u201d Cop29 president Mukhtar Babayev has told the summit at the start of the second week, writes Damian Carrington, Guardian environment editor. That is when ministers take over the negotiations from their officials and can take the political decisions needed to unblock progress. He said: People have told me that they are concerned about the state of the negotiations. Let me be clear, I\u2019m also concerned that the parties are not moving towards each other quickly enough. It\u2019s time for them to move faster. Politicians have the power to reach a fair and ambitious deal. They must deliver on this responsibility. They must engage immediately and constructively. The highest possible level of ambition is indeed difficult, and it requires courage. Colleagues, now is the time to be brave. Babayev announced that Brazil and UK ministers have been drafted in to help push forward the negotiations on the critical issue of the trillion dollars a year of climate cash needed. That is in addition to the ministerial pairs already working on the specific issues. These pairs are always one from a developing country and one from a developed country. G20 nations cause 80% of all emissions and it is rare for their annual meeting today to coincide with the climate Cop \u2013 that is an opportunity, said Bubayev: Their leadership is essential to making progress. We cannot succeed without them, and the world is waiting to hear from them. We want them to provide clear mandates [to their negotiators] to deliver at Cop29. The UN\u2019s climate chief Simon Steele also rallied ministers to action: There is still a ton of work to do to ensure Cop29 delivers and [countries] to be moving much faster towards landing zones, particularly on the [climate finance goal]. I\u2019ve been very blunt. Climate finance is not charity. It is 100% in every nation\u2019s interest to protect their economies and people from rampant climate impacts. Ministers who have just arrived need to roll up their sleeves and dive into the hardest issues. Bluffing, brinkmanship and premeditated playbooks are burning up precious time. So let\u2019s cut the theatrics and get down to the real business this week. Bubayev got two softball questions from journalists from Azerbaijan, where press freedom is essentially nonexistent. But Shauna Corr, from the Irish Daily Mirror, threw a tough one: \u201cHow many oil and gas deals have Azerbaijan done this year while leading these talks? And do you think that\u2019s good leadership when the aim of Cop is to reduce fossil fuel use?\u201d Azerbaijan is significantly increasing its gas production. Bubayev, who formerly worked for Azerbaijan\u2019s state oil company, gave a non-answer: The main oil and gas producing countries [have] already adopted decarbonisation programs. All of the world, and petrostates, I mean, the oil and gas countries \u2013 there is a good chance for these countries to demonstrate their leadership in this issue and to increase the investment to green energy transition projects. On the other side of the world to Cop29, at the G20 heads of state summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, there are reports emerging that negotiators for Argentina\u2019s new rightwing government are trying to reverse progress on an agreement to tax the super rich. In July, finance ministers from the 20 wealthiest nations agreed in principle to impose a 2% tax on \u201cultra-high-net-worth individuals\u201d. The initiative, spearheaded by Brazil during its G20 presidency this year, could potentially raise $250bn a year. But, fresh from withdrawing negotiators from Cop19, the government of Javier Milei, elected president of Argentina this summer on a hard-right, neoliberal capitalist platform, is now said to be trying to reverse the agreement. Kate Blagojevic, Associate Director of Europe Campaigns at 350.org said: There is huge popular support in the G20 countries for a tax on the super rich and it is important that the European countries in the G20 rally behind the Brazilian President to protect the unprecedented agreement on taxing extreme wealth achieved by the Finance Ministers in July. It makes common sense to tax mega polluters and the mega rich to ensure that we have the money needed for climate action at home and globally, which can prevent and repair damage from extreme weather like we have seen in Spain and in Central America over the last few weeks. Oil-rich Saudi Arabia is a perennial obstructor of proposals to cut fossil fuels at Cops. So it is disturbing, if not surprising, to see the chair of oil giant Saudi Aramco, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, getting close to US president-elect and climate denier Donald Trump. The two sat next to each other at a UFC fight in New York on Friday. Elon Musk was the other person next to Trump. One of Europe\u2019s top human rights officials has accused Cop29 host country Azerbaijan of jailing activists and journalists for their work and opposition to the authorities. In a letter published on Monday, Michael O\u2019Flaherty, the Council of Europe commissioner for human rights, called for Azerbaijan to immediately release all jailed human rights defenders, journalists and civil society activists. In the letter, dated 4 November but just released, O\u2019Flaherty cites the cases of Akif Gurbanov, Alasgar Mammadli, Imran Aliyev and Anar Mammadli, all of whom were held earlier this year on charges of foreign currency smuggling, tax evasion and forging documents. Since 2023, more than a dozen staff and journalists from three media outlets have been arrested on similar charges, he noted. Azerbaijan is one of the 46 members of the Council of Europe. O\u2019Flaherty said in his letter: I am concerned at reports that the criminal proceedings against these human rights defenders, journalists and activists were launched in regard to carrying out their legitimate activities \u2026 I ask the relevant authorities in Azerbaijan to immediately release all human rights defenders, journalists and civil society activists who are imprisoned for their legitimate work or for expressing dissenting or critical opinions and to drop the criminal charges against them, as well as related restrictions, including a ban on travelling abroad. Furthermore, I note that there have been reports of ill-treatment and torture of several human rights defenders, journalists and activists while in police custody, as well as restrictions on the right of access to a lawyer of their choice. In a response, also dated 4 November, the Azerbaijani authorities told O\u2019Flaherty that their country was committed to upholding its obligations under human rights law. Their letter added: The investigative authorities have undertaken proceedings in question based on credible suspicions of violation of certain articles of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan. It should be emphasized that no journalist or media representative is being targeted for carrying out their professional work in Azerbaijan. There is a lot of frustration at Cop29 today, with progress on a climate finance agreement seemingly very slow. Experts have said a total of $1tn US dollars (\u00a3790bn) needs to be flowing into developing countries each year by 2030, bar China, to meet the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global heating below 2C. But the first week of negotiations achieved limited progress and hit walls in talks on adaptation, cutting emissions and keeping previous commitments on track. My Guardian colleague Fiona Harvey earlier reported that developed countries are dragging their feet on climate finance, as developing nations, many particularly exposed to climate disasters, grow increasingly desperate. \u201cLast week was a very tough week,\u201d Mark Lutes, WWF senior adviser for global climate policy, told the PA news agency at Cop29 on Monday. Lutes said discussions stalled as negotiators likely stuck to their given mandates amid \u201cvery difficult political issues\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s the ministers who always resolve these difficult issues,\u201d he said. Shirley Matheson, WWF global NDC enhancement lead, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of frustration in the room. There\u2019s a lot of anxiety. \u201cThere\u2019s a need for parties to really get together and work through this.\u201d Some powerful new speakers have taken the stage at Cop29 today \u2013 children, writes Damian Carrington, Guardian environment editor. At a special session at the UN climate talks Unicef youth advocates brought an uncompromising message for world leaders: keep the promises you made in the Paris climate agreement and protect our future. Georgina is 10 years old and from Tanzania: I stand before you today, not just as one child, but as the voice of millions of children whose lives are deeply affected by climate change, especially our health and education. Climate change is making us sick in rural areas where there is no clean water. When boys and girls are sick, they miss school. During extreme heat waves, many children become sick and dehydrated, especially during those long walks to fetch water. The water crisis affects both our health and education. Boys and girls from the village walk up to 6km searching for water. Sometimes the water it completely dry, because there has been no rain. By the time they return home, they\u2019re exhausted, dehydrated and too tired to study. Every child deserves clean water, good health and quality education, but climate change is taking away these basic rights from us. I am already showing what children can do. I have planted over 1000 trees across Tanzania, started ocean conservation clubs in coastal schools, and created environmental education materials in Swahili for rural children. \u201cWhen you, world leaders, signed the Paris Agreement, you made a promise to protect our future. Today, I stand here as a child asking you to keep that promise. Help build climate resilient schools, clean water systems and better health care facilities. Invest in clean energy for our schools and health centres. Solar power can keep vaccines cold and help us study at night.\u201d Remember, when you protect the environment, you protect children\u2019s health, education and dreams, and a healthy, educated child can change the world. Zunaira is 14 years old and from Pakistan: Where I come from, climate disasters like floods and heat waves are a part of life. Floods disturb everything, our education, our safety, our security, and most particularly, our futures. When communities are hit by floods, resources become limited, and girls in particular, are impacted by the limited resources in the family. They are not their priority. They are forced to miss school. The family simply cannot afford this education in the times of crisis. Children around the globe face unique struggles because of climate change, but we also have unique solutions to tackle it. We bring fresh ideas, our energy and the perspective of living through these challenges every day. I truly believe that we make a difference. But we need more than just policies and promises \u2013 we need action today. We don\u2019t just need to be heard \u2013 it is our right to be heard. We will inherit this planet but the choices you made in the past are disturbing and impacting our future. Let\u2019s work for a future which empowers young people to reach their full potential. The internationally agreed goal to keep the world\u2019s temperature rise below 1.5C is now \u201cdeader than a doornail\u201d, climate scientists have gloomily concluded, writes Oliver Milman, environment reporter for Guardian US. Three of the five leading research groups monitoring global temperatures consider 2024 on track to be at least 1.5C (2.7F) hotter than pre-industrial times, underlining it as the warmest year on record, beating a mark set just last year. The past 10 consecutive years have already been the hottest 10 years ever recorded. Although a single year above 1.5C does not itself spell climate doom or break the 2015 Paris agreement, in which countries agreed to strive to keep the long-term temperature rise below this point, scientists have warned this aspiration has in effect been snuffed out despite the exhortations of leaders currently gathered at a United Nations climate summit in Azerbaijan. \u201cThe goal to avoid exceeding 1.5C is deader than a doornail. It\u2019s almost impossible to avoid at this point because we\u2019ve just waited too long to act,\u201d said Zeke Hausfather, climate research lead at Stripe and a research scientist at Berkeley Earth. \u201cWe are speeding past the 1.5C line an accelerating way and that will continue until global emissions stop climbing.\u201d Click below to read more Ministers from Azerbaijan, Cop29\u2019s host, at a Monday press conference touted their climate-related health, education, and job creation efforts, writes Dharna Noor, Guardian US fossil fuels and climate reporter, in Baku. Among the initiatives they boasted of were an intergovernmental initiative to boost climate literacy, a ranking of the most sustainable universities, and an intergovernmental effort to take on climate-related health issues. The press conference came amid rumours that the country was close to releasing its new decarbonisation plan, known as a \u201cnationally determined contribution,\u201d to the UN. No such plan was announced. Azerbaijan is set to see a massive expansion of planet-heating gas production in the next decade, my colleague Damian Carrington revealed last month. When asked how the role of fossil fuels in warming the planet will be handled in Azerbaijan\u2019s climate-related school curricula, the country\u2019s minister of science and education deflected. It would be \u201csimple\u201d to say oil and gas causes emissions. But instead, the curricula will focus on the \u201cdifferent types of carbon footprints caused by energy,\u201d he said. And it will pose the following question to children: \u201cWhat will be my contribution to the, let\u2019s say, greener world.\u201d Climate experts have long warned that oil and gas expansion is incompatible with plans to secure a liveable future. Hullo! This is Damien Gayle taking the helm on the liveblog now, keeping you up to date with the latest from Cop29 for the rest of the day \u2013 with thanks to Bibi for getting things going. I hope you will stay with us all day, in spite of the somewhat frustrating news so far on progress from the negotiations. Remember, if you have any comments, suggestions or tips for things we could be writing about you can get in touch with me at damien.gayle@theguardian.com. Carbon Brief, in their (absolutely essential) morning briefing email, have rounded up the latest on President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s environmental calls, including more detail on Chris Wright, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the US Department of Energy. In a piece on Reuters, he\u2019s described as a \u201cstaunch defender of fossil fuel use\u201d. It continues: \u201cWright is the founder and CEO of Liberty Energy, an oilfield services firm based in Denver. He is expected to support Trump\u2019s plan to maximise production of oil and gas and to seek ways to boost generation of electricity, demand for which is rising for the first time in decades.\u201d He also \u201cmade a media splash in 2019 when he drank fracking fluid on camera to demonstrate it was not dangerous\u201d. The Washington Post, BBC News and Al Jazeera all describe Wright as a climate change \u201csceptic\u201d. The Post notes that, in a LinkedIn video last year, Wright said: \u201cThere is no climate crisis\u2026the only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive, opportunity-squelching policies justified in the name of climate change.\u201d Axios notes that Wright has called net-zero emissions pledges \u201csilly\u201d and \u201chopelessly destructive\u201d because of the costs that come with cleaner energy sources. In an analysis article, Sky News climate reporter Victoria Seabrook says the choice \u201cspells disaster for the fight against climate change\u201d. Relatedly, Reuters reports that Trump also announced the creation of a National Energy Council to coordinate policies to boost US energy production \u2013 and that will be led by his pick for interior secretary, North Dakota governor Doug Burgum. The Independent delves into the comments on climate by many of Trump\u2019s picks. And the Associated Press reports on how Alaska\u2019s political leaders \u201chope to see Trump undo restrictions on oil drilling\u201d. Meanwhile, a Reuters \u201cexclusive\u201d reports that Trump\u2019s transition team \u201cis planning to kill the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation\u201d. The newswire adds: \u201cEnding the tax credit could have grave implications for an already stalling US EV transition. And yet representatives of Tesla \u2013 by far the nation\u2019s biggest EV maker \u2013 have told a Trump-transition committee they support ending the subsidy, said the two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.\u201d In response, Reuters also reports, current energy secretary Jennifer Granholm told reporters at COP29 that cancelling the tax credit would mean \u201cceding the territory to other countries, particularly China\u201d. The climate crisis is right here, right now, taking lives and livelihoods across the world, as my story earlier today on supercharged extreme weather lays bare. That makes protecting people even more vital than ever, from flood defences to heatwave plans to resilient water supplies. The UN climate chief Simon Stiell spelled out in forceful terms today - \u201cthe difference between life and death\u201d - why it is critical that Cop29 delivers the funding for this adaptation, as part of the overall finance goal. \u201cThis year, we saw how every bit of preparation \u2013 every policy, every plan \u2013 is the difference between life and death for millions of people around the world. People, communities, nations want to act, to protect themselves and their loved ones, to strengthen their businesses and economies \u2013 but they do not have the means. And when nations can\u2019t climate-proof their links in global supply chains, every nation in our interconnected global economy pays the price. I mean literally pays the price, in the form of higher inflation, especially in food prices, as savage droughts, wildfires and floods rip through food production. We must flip this script. [But] there is a stark financial gap we must bridge. Adaptation costs are skyrocketing for everyone, especially developing countries. Their costs could rise to $340 billion per year by 2030. It\u2019s easy to become slightly anaesthetized by all these numbers, especially at this finance-focused COP. But let\u2019s never allow ourselves to forget: these figures are the difference between safety and life-wrecking disasters for billions of people. Almost half the human population live in climate vulnerability hotspots, where people are 15 times more likely to die from climate impacts. Personally, I find that fact deeply disturbing, practically offensive in some ways. It certainly keeps me up at night, and I\u2019m guessing it also does so for many of you. We can no longer rely on small streams of finance. We need torrents of funding. The funding exists. We need to unlock and unblock it. This great piece ran late last week on the excellent online environmental reporting site Grist, delving into one of the big issues for the summit: The question bringing COP29 to a halt: Who\u2019s rich enough to pay for climate change? Everyone at the COP29 climate summit agrees that the world\u2019s poorest and most climate-vulnerable countries need trillions of dollars to transition to clean energy and cope with climate-fueled disasters. And everyone agrees that rich countries, which are responsible for a disproportionate share of historic carbon pollution, have some responsibility to pay up for this. But the question nobody can seem to agree on is this: Which countries are rich? \u2026 The battle lines were drawn more than three decades ago, in the 1992 agreement that first established COP as the forum for annual U.N. climate talks. That agreement divided the world\u2019s countries into \u201cdeveloped country parties\u201d and \u201cdeveloping country parties.\u201d The world has changed a great deal since then. China and India have become two of the world\u2019s five largest economies and together make up almost a third of the world\u2019s population. East Asian countries like Singapore and South Korea have become pillars of the global technology and manufacturing sectors \u2014 and grown phenomenally richer in the process. Persian Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have used money from their massive oil fields to build some of the world\u2019s most eye-popping infrastructure and buy global influence. As a result of all this change, only 13 of the world\u2019s 20 largest economies were considered \u201cdeveloped\u201d at the time the U.N. convention first took effect. For incumbent developed countries like the United States and Canada, which are facing calls to commit to sending a trillion dollars per year to poor nations, the key question in Baku is how to bring newly flush economies over to the donor side of the table. It will be fascinating to see what progress can be made on this critical issue this week. A small tax on just seven of the world\u2019s biggest oil and gas companies would raise $15 billion in the first year alone to help the world\u2019s most climate-vulnerable countries pay for the escalating cost of damage caused by the climate crisis. New analysis from Greenpeace and Stamp out Poverty shows a minimal tax on companies which have seen their profits spiral in recent years would see the UN\u2019s Loss and Damage fund rise by more than 2000%. Abdoulaye Diallo, from Greenpeace International\u2019s Stop Drilling Start Paying campaign said: \u201cWho should pay? This is fundamentally an issue of climate justice and it is time to shift the financial burden for the climate crisis from its victims to the polluters behind it.\u201d She said the analysis revealed the scale of the urgent need for innovative solutions to raise the funds to meet it. \u201cWe reject Big Oil\u2019s assault on people and democracy and call on governments worldwide to adopt the Climate Damages Tax and other mechanisms to extract revenue from the oil and gas industry.\u201d The \u2018Climate Damages Tax\u2019 would see a global tax put on every tonne of carbon emitted by the coal, oil and gas extracted - starting at $5 per tonne and rising each year thereafter. If it was imposed on ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, TotalEnergies, BP, Equinor and ENI it could raise $15 billion in the first year alone, the study shows. Currently, just $702 million has been pledged to the loss and damage fund, while the combined profits of those fossil fuel companies exceeds $148 billion. The briefing also highlights the financial costs of some of this year\u2019s worst climate driven weather events, which caused at least $64 bn in damage and represent just a fraction of the global cost of loss and damage over the last year. David Hillman, Director of Stamp Out Poverty, said: \u201cWhile oil and gas giants keep raking in grotesque levels of profit from exploiting resources, the damages resulting from the industry\u2019s operations are disproportionately borne by people who did not cause the crisis. A climate damages tax \u2013 along with other levies on fossil fuels and high-emitting sectors \u2013 will make polluters pay for the cost of climate impacts, as well as supporting workers and affected communities in the transition to clean energy, jobs, and transport.\u201d My colleague Fiona Harvey spoke to Jochen Flasbarth, the German development secretary, at Cop over the weekend. He warned that countries must find a deal this week and not delay. \u201cPostponing the decision here to Bel\u00e9m [the city in northern Brazil where next year\u2019s UN climate summit will be held] is not something advisable,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWe have an increasing crisis in the world, war in the world, and countries disappearing from global solidarity like the US, and the departure of the Argentinian delegation. These are clear signals that we will get in difficult times.\u201d Flasbarth was upbeat on the talks, but others have spoken of \u201cfrustration\u201d and a \u201cvacuum\u201d. He said: \u201cI\u2019m quite positive that we can reach an agreement here. We are building up something credible.\u201d He told Fiona that a Cop focused on finance was always going to be difficult. \u201cSome people are worried because this is economically an issue of distribution, and this is always not easy. But I see some positive signals.\u201d Meanwhile in the world beyond Cop (yes, there is such a place), there is plenty of lively weather going on. The Caribbean is dealing with Tropical storm Sara, the 18th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season and the third this month. The Philippines have been hit by the sixth typhoon this month. And in the US in the past week, Louisiana has experienced significant rainfall, causing widespread flash flooding across central and south-east regions of the state. Further heavy rainfall is expected across regions bordering the Gulf of Mexico over the coming days. Rainfall totals for the 24-hour period leading into Tuesday could exceed 100mm in Alabama and southern Mississippi. How usual is it to have G20 happening at the same time as Cop? According to Jen Iris Allan, a senior lecturer at Cardiff University who also writes the Regular Earth Negotiations Bulletin, commenting on Bluesky, it\u2019s not normal at all. Cop29 happening at the same time as the G20 is a rare opportunity. It gets the leaders of the big economies together in a small setting. They could strike a side deal that would really help here. It will be interesting to see how the two meetings interplay. Some are going back and forth. Marina Silva, Brazil\u2019s environment minister, for example, posted that she had \u201ctaken a break from her Cop responsibilities for a few days\u201d so that she could attend G20. The UN secretary general Antonion Guterres is at G20 too, and will also be heading back to Cop later this week. Josh Gabbatiss has just posted a Monday-morning primer on the state of affairs with the climate finance text as the second week of COP29 begins. You can find it on Bluesky here. He points out: The new climate finance target is the big issue that will define COP29. Government ministers are arriving to thrash out everything from the amount of money raised to who contributes towards it. He notes that: We\u2019ve seen a few versions of the text as parties make sure their views are represented while trying to produce something their governments can work with. The number of \u201coptions\u201d is lower than it was on Wednesday. But the number of brackets - meaning undecided bits - is higher. It\u2019s still long: 25 pages. Negotiators started with a 9-page text, which they rejected as \u201cunbalanced\u201d - then lots of stuff got added back in. It will need to be shorter. The EU chief negotiator told journalists last week that a 2-page text could capture \u201ceverything we need\u201d. Looks as if Trump WILL keep his promise to Drill baby, drill. On Saturday he appointed Chris Wright, an oil and gas industry executive and a staunch defender of fossil fuel use, to lead the US Department of Energy. Wright is the founder and CEO of Liberty Energy, an oilfield services firm based in Denver, Colorado. He is expected to support Trump\u2019s plan to maximize production of oil and gas and to seek ways to boost generation of electricity, demand for which is rising for the first time in decades. The Loss and Damage collaboration have published an open letter to the Cop presidency, about the negotiations for a new collective quantified goal on climate finance (NCQG). They explaining their reasoning here. The letter is, essentially, a plea. They point out that \u201cemissions in developed countries continued to grow, leaving a diminishing slice of the global carbon budget for developing countries to meet their social and development needs, which corresponds to an enormous financial debt owed to developing countries by developed countries.\u201d \u201cWe are counting on you to get us back on track towards creating a world in which all humans, all other species and all ecosystems are thriving on a healthy planet at this COP.\u201d The letter goes on to say: We call on you to agree to: An NCQG that ensures that we can keep below the 1.5\u00b0C survival limit of the Paris Agreement. An NCQG based on the needs and priorities of developing countries and with public funds provided by developed countries exclusively for all developing countries, one that does not deviate from Article 9 of the Paris Agreement. An NCQG that delivers at least USD 1.3 trillion a year for mitigation, adaptation and Loss and Damage provided as grants and highly concessional finance. Representatives from two Pacific island countries have sharply criticised Australia over its plans for a massive gas industry expansion in Western Australia, saying it could ultimately result in 125 times more greenhouse gas emissions than their island nations release in a year. Representatives from Vanuatu and Tuvalu called on Australia to stop approving new fossil fuel developments, including a proposal to extend the life of Woodside\u2019s North West Shelf gas facility until 2070. Vanuatu\u2019s special envoy for climate change, Ralph Regenvanu, said Australia was \u201cnot acting in good faith\u201d when it stood alongside Pacific leaders on the global stage and promoted its climate credentials while continuing to approve coal and gas projects. \u201cAs the world\u2019s third largest fossil fuel exporter, the Australian government is exporting climate destruction overseas, including to Pacific nations like Vanuatu, who experience the most devastating impacts of the climate crisis, despite contributing the least,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is climate injustice.\u201d Tuvalu\u2019s climate change minister, Maina Talia, said new fossil fuel developments were incompatible with the global commitment to pursue efforts to limit global heating to 1.5C, agreed as part of the Paris climate deal. The criticism comes as Australia is lobbying to host Cop31 in 2026 in partnership with Pacific countries. They are vying with Turkey for the hosting rights. Pacific leaders have largely supported the bid for what has been described as a proposed \u201cPacific Cop\u201d, and have argued it should focus on lifting commitments to cut emissions and support the most vulnerable in the region. You can read the full story here: One of the most striking things about attending any Cop summit is the sense of walking through corridors filled with a truly global population, Representatives of different nations take great pride in wearing the traditional clothes of their community, and it makes an immensely powerful and inspiring statement. Photographer Rafiq Maqbool, from AP, has spent a bit of time taking some striking photographs of a few of the different representatives. We\u2019ll post a few more later. There are reports from AFP that the UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres yesterday called on the G20 leaders who are gathering in Rio de Janeiro to rescue the stalled concurrent UN climate talks in Azerbaijan by showing \u201cleadership\u201d on cutting emissions. \u201cA successful outcome at Cop29 is still within reach, but it will require leadership and compromise, namely from the G20 countries,\u201d Guterres, who will attend the summit of the world\u2019s biggest economies starting Monday, told a press conference in Rio. AFP reports: \u201cThe annual UN talks in Baku are deadlocked at the midway point, with nations no closer to agreeing a $1 trillion deal for climate investments in developing nations after a week of negotiations. The talks are stuck over the final figure, the type of financing, and who should pay, with Western countries wanting China and wealthy Gulf states to join the list of donors. All eyes have turned to Rio in the hope of a breakthrough. \u201cThe spotlight is naturally on the G20. They account for 80 percent of global emissions,\u201d Guterres said, calling on the group to \u201clead by example.\u201d Climate was an issue advanced by several of the leaders as they converged on Rio. US President Joe Biden, making a stopover in the Amazon, talked up $11 billion in bilateral climate financing his administration has allocated this year. He also - in a reference to President-elect Donald Trump taking over from him in two months - declared that \u201cnobody\u201d could reverse the \u201cclean energy revolution\u201d directed by his government. European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in Rio jointly launched a campaign to boost renewable energies in Africa. \u201cTripling renewables globally until 2030 would mean a cut of 10 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions,\u201d von der Leyen said at an event put on by the advocacy group Global Citizen. She said the EU was increasing investment around the world for the building of infrastructure of renewables, \u201cspecifically in Africa\u201d through the bloc\u2019s Global Gateway program - designed to rival China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. The European Union is the world\u2019s biggest contributor for climate financing, most of which goes through multilateral funds. Chinese President Xi Jinping - whose country is the planet\u2019s biggest polluter - made his own plea for the G20 to step up international cooperation against climate change. The leaders of the world\u2019s biggest economies should coordinate efforts in areas such as \u201cgreen and low-carbon development, environmental protection, energy transition and climate change response,\u201d he said in a tribune published in Brazil\u2019s Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. The G20 should \u201cprovide more funding, technology and capacity-building support to Global South countries,\u201d he said. Brazil is hoping to channel the focus on climate in the two-day G20 summit for it to feature prominently in the meeting\u2019s final declaration. Marina Silva, Brazil\u2019s environment minister, said it was \u201cfundamental\u201d that the G20 participants \u201cdo their homework\u201d and see to it that the COP29 negotiations move forward. My colleague Damian Carrington has written about a new assessment of the role of climate change in extreme weather events, which found that it is supercharging heatwaves, floods, storms, droughts and wildfires. The new database of hundreds of studies that analyse the role of global heating in extreme weather was compiled by the website Carbon Brief and shared with the Guardian. At least 24 previously impossible heatwaves have struck communities across the planet, a new assessment has shown, providing stark evidence of how severely human-caused global heating is supercharging extreme weather. The impossible heatwaves have taken lives across North America, Europe and Asia, with scientific analyses showing that they would have had virtually zero chance of happening without the extra heat trapped by fossil fuel emissions. Further studies have assessed how much worse global heating has made the consequences of extreme weather, with shocking results. Millions of people, and many thousands of newborn babies, would not have died prematurely without the extra human-caused heat, according to the estimates. The analysis comes as residents were evacuated from their homes in New York state due to wildfires, made worse by a prolonged drought over nearly half of the US. We are now embarking on the second week of talks in Azerbaijan, and critics have been calling Cop29 \u201cstuck\u201d, \u201clogjammed\u201d, \u201con a knife edge\u201d, and \u201cfoundering\u201d. One respected commentator, Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: \u201cThis has been the worst first week of a Cop in my 15 years attending these summits. There\u2019s been limited progress \u2026 I sense frustration, especially among the developing country groups here at Cop. The presidency isn\u2019t giving any hope for how the world will strike the right compromises.\u201d This kind of weariness is understandable, especially from people stuck in windowless rooms for 18 hours a day. And the frustration of developing countries is real \u2013 climate finance, the subject of this Cop, is a matter of life and death for them, and rich countries are certainly dragging their heels on coming up with the sums needed. It has been a gruelling week, beginning last weekend with a tedious row over the agenda as countries led by Saudi Arabia \u2013 predictably and reprehensibly \u2013 tried to sideline discussions of the \u201ctransition away from fossil fuels\u201d that was agreed last year, as a way of unpicking that resolution. That led to long nights, even at an early stage. Added to that, world leaders failed to turn up in the numbers expected, with many of them \u2013 Biden, Scholz, Macron, von der Leyen and Trudeau among them \u2013 facing troubles at home. The Cop process itself has come under attack, with a group including a former UN secretary-general, a former UN climate chief, and a former UN climate envoy, calling for reform. But to be too gloomy about these talks at this stage would be wrong. There is a deal to be struck here \u2013 and as Germany\u2019s respected development minister Jochen Flasbarth warns today, putting it off to next year means trying to run these talks with Donald Trump in the White House. This is my 18th Cop \u2013 my first was Cop10 in Buenos Aires in 2004, in the distant days when Argentina was a developing world climate champion. From my perspective, the first week of Cop29 has not seen great movement, but nor has the Cop shown signs of falling apart \u2013 unlike the infamous Copenhagen Cop15, in 2009 which was already a shambles by the midway point. With negotiations lasting two weeks, progress on breaking down the key obstacles will inevitably be limited, at the halfway mark. The Cop presidency has made some missteps \u2013 rolling out the red carpet to oil companies; the Cop chief executive appearing to offer facilitation of fossil fuel deals to an undercover journalist. But it has not allowed the agenda to spiral out of its control, as the Danish prime minister\u2019s office did at at Cop15, which ended in mayhem. (Though also with a useful deal, which many people forget.) We must all remember, too, that Cop29 is breaking new ground, so it\u2019s not surprising this is turning out to be tricky. This is the first time there have ever been substantive negotiations on finance at a Cop. When the totemic target of ensuring $100bn would flow to developing countries each year by 2020 was put on the table, in the last days of Copenhagen, it was done with only brief prior discussion. (The finance announcement took even the UN by surprise \u2013 Ban Ki-moon, when I interviewed him just after he had stepped off the plane at Copenhagen, confidently told me that developing countries must resign themselves to leaving Cop15 without promises of cash. When the story appeared, he was promptly shot down by the Cop presidency and told to recant \u2013 so he claimed to have been misquoted. He wasn\u2019t.) Finance ministers don\u2019t even come to Cops, under normal circumstances, or make only occasional brief appearances \u2013 these meetings are usually run by environment ministers or foreign ministries. To get an idea of how constrained other ministries are by the finance department, take the speech by UK foreign secretary David Lammy this September. Lammy wanted to announce the UK\u2019s return to climate leadership on the global stage, in contrast to his Conservative predecessors. But he was not allowed to confirm the UK\u2019s pledge of \u00a311.6bn of climate aid, set out under the previous government \u2013 because the UK\u2019s finance minister, Rachel Reeves, would not set out the UK budget until the following month. That constraint is fairly typical across governments \u2013 no other ministries may preempt Treasury decisions. So the involvement of finance in this year\u2019s talks is an added complication for many. Finding the money to put developing countries on to a green path makes sense for rich countries, and for rapidly developing economies such as China, as much as it does the poor. Not only would it prevent climate chaos, help stem climate migration, and prevent the reversal of development in stricken countries \u2013 it would also open new markets for countries with low-carbon expertise to sell into. A trillion dollars a year is only about 1% of the global economy, and is less than a third of the amount spent globally on energy every year. These talks are not a lost cause. A deal at Cop29 would lift everybody, and it is there to be grasped. Good morning! It\u2019s Monday morning, and the negotiations at Cop29 will resume today after a day of rest for everyone concerned. I\u2019m Bibi van der Zee, and I\u2019ll be anchoring the liveblog this morning, so please send your thoughts and suggestions along to me at Bibi.vanderzee@theguardian.com.

The Met Office said up to 20cm (8in) of snow could accumulate in the worst-affected areas in the \u201cfirst taste of winter\u201d. It issued several yellow warnings for the coming days, including rain, sleet and snow from 7pm on Monday to 10am on Tuesday, from Northumberland and Cumbria down to north Wales and the Midlands. The most likely scenario, forecasters said, was for up to 20cm of snow to accumulate on hills above 300 metres and up to 10cm on hills above 200 metres. \u201cThere is a chance of snow settling at lower levels, where 5-10cm would prove much more disruptive \u2013 this remains uncertain, but seems most likely across parts of Yorkshire and Derbyshire,\u201d they added. In the affected areas, there was a chance of power cuts, disruption to road and public transport and the risk of injury from slipping on ice. In Northern Ireland, a warning for snow and ice is in place from 3pm on Monday until 10am on Tuesday. It is likely to lead to difficult travel conditions and public transport delays. In northern Scotland, a yellow warning for snow and ice stretches from 4pm on Monday until 10am on Wednesday. The Met Office spokesperson Nicola Maxey said that by Monday afternoon snow had mostly fallen on hilltops with 2cm falling in Lerwick, Shetland. But she said more snow and ice is expected over the coming days, with temperatures plunging to below average levels for the time of year. \u201cIt is going to be quite a widely cold week \u2013 a few degrees below average both day and night for most of the country,\u201d Maxey said. It is predicted temperatures could drop to -2C in London on Friday, -4C in Birmingham and -7C further north. \u201cThere\u2019s likely to be a widespread frost overnight as we get this colder air coming in from the Arctic maritime air mass \u2013 cold air from the north pushing down across the country \u2013 which will be across the whole country by the middle of the week.\u201d Drivers have been advised to allow more time for journeys and to pack essential winter items such as warm clothing, food, water, a blanket, a torch, an ice scraper or de-icer, a warning triangle, a hi-vis vest and an in-car phone charger. The Met Office has said travel disruption on Tuesday is likely. Merseyrail said it would be activating its cold weather plan which means the first service on all lines running without passengers to check conditions.",

      "body": "<p>As one quarter of the Swedish underground-ish rap collective Drain Gang, Bladee (pronounced Blade) spent his 20s on the frontlines of a hyper-online youth culture. But as his 30th birthday loomed, the musician born Benjamin Reichwald started to sweat. His anxiety about ageing, a serious depressive spell, and the mixed reception to his latest <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/bladee1000/sets/spiderr-1\">album</a>, spiralled into a crisis: were he and his Drain Gang peers \u201cpermanently frozen as 20-year-olds because we came up at a certain time of our lives\u201d, he wondered. Was he already past it at 29?</p> <p>\u201cI got so old, I got embarrassed to be even here,\u201d Reichwald <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJw7YwDTklM&amp;ab_channel=draingang\">sings</a> on his newest album, Cold Visions. Older readers may roll their eyes, but given Reichwald has built up one of the most ardent young fanbases in music, this was a valid worry. \u201cI had a lot to get off my chest,\u201d he says now. \u201cI was thinking a lot about my position and I felt stuck \u2013 do I have to be perceived as an artist to feel fulfilled? I\u2019m chasing that and it doesn\u2019t give me anything. So why am I doing this?\u201d</p> <p>Reichwald has a reputation for being elusive (this is one of the very few solo interviews he has ever done) and frequently obscures his face. Lately he has favoured corpse paint, blood-red grills for his teeth and a chaotic assemblage of bandanas, sunglasses and Oakley hats. But during a two-hour conversation in a Brooklyn hotel room, in Gucci sneakers and a T-shirt with the logo of Norwegian black metal band Satyricon, he is thoughtful and forthcoming.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were reckless \u2013 but we were so young, we just didn\u2019t know. Someone\u00a0was probably always gonna die</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite his worries, being 30 has treated Reichwald well. In March<strong> </strong>he released Psykos, a rock-leaning collaboration with his fellow Swedish rapper and long-term friend and collaborator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/12/im-genuine-and-a-bit-strange-emo-rapper-yung-lean-bares-his-soul-jonatan-leandoer-hastad\">Yung Lean</a>, who also featured on Cold Visions, which was released the following month. In October, they both appeared on Charli xcx\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/11/charli-xcx-brat-remix-album-billie-eilish-ariana-grande-lorde\">Brat remix album</a>, with Bladee <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN7he0b0sK8\">reworking the song Rewind</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s a Bladee verse, I did my thing,\u201d is how he modestly describes his contribution, but he speaks more effusively of Charli: \u201cI have eternal respect for her. She put me in this context with all these other people\u201d \u2013 Ariana Grande, Lorde and Billie Eilish all appear on the remix record \u2013 \u201cand I\u2019m very grateful to be involved.\u201d</p> <p>It caps a big year for Reichwald. Released a decade after his debut mixtape, Cold Visions is his most fully realised project yet. Made in two weeks in his house in Stockholm, the album is, he says, \u201creally honest, more like a diary\u201d. In the course of 30 songs, he purges his demons over raging, blown-out trap beats. Brain cells fried into oblivion, he navigates panic attacks and self-loathing, calls himself \u201cthe king of nothing matters\u201d and raps about \u201cviolently drug abusing weed\u201d<em>.</em> In one line he\u2019s working out and getting tanned in LA, the next \u201cI\u2019m crashing down some like a wave over castles made of sand.\u201d</p> <p>Cold Visions was self-released after Reichwald split from Year0001, Drain Gang\u2019s longtime label and management company.<strong> </strong>\u201cI don\u2019t really care any more about being a bigger artist,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s important is that I\u2019m doing something that\u2019s true to me.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyUoddHWuOU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UyUoddHWuOU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The Drain Gang collective \u2013 Bladee, Ecco2K, Thaiboy Digital, and Whitearmor \u2013 have been best friends since their teens, playing around with Auto-Tune, and freestyling in the vein of idiosyncratic US rappers such as Lil B and Chief Keef. Early Bladee tracks \u2013 overcast<strong> </strong>cloud rap about crushed hearts, pills and dreams \u2013 were so digitally processed that they passed through the uncanny valley and ended up somewhere strangely melodic and emotive.<strong> </strong>\u201cI hated to hear my voice without the Auto-Tune,\u201d Reichwald says. \u201cIt\u2019s how we found our sound. Without it we wouldn\u2019t have committed to doing it \u2013 it sounded too bad.\u201d</p> <p>The group cycled through a number of names before landing on Drain Gang, inspired by a nihilistically gothic sentiment later articulated in Bladee\u2019s song Be Nice 2 Me: \u201cTake a knife and drain your life.\u201d They quickly found kindred spirits in Sad Boys, a local crew featuring Yung Lean. In 2014, Lean\u2019s melancholic and memeable hip-hop was taking the internet by storm, and Reichwald quit his job at a kindergarten to join him on tour.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I didn\u2019t understand why people liked my music. I thought there must be some kind of mistake\u00a0</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By April 2015, barely out of his teens, Reichwald was living with Lean in Miami, where working on music came second to partying and drug use. One evening, Lean suffered drug-induced <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2016/06/16/yung-lean-warlord-interview\">psychosis</a>; Reichwald called the ambulance which probably saved his life. Hours later, Barron Machat, Lean\u2019s 27-year-old manager, died in a car accident on his way to the hospital; Xanax was found in his system. \u201cThings were building to a point where something was going to happen because of how we were living,\u201d Reichwald says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think that anything could go wrong, we were so in this drugs and rock star lifestyle. Someone was probably always gonna die with how we were moving. It was very reckless, but we were so young, we just didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Reichwald returned to Sweden and worked at a shampoo factory while suffering from PTSD and struggling to process Machat\u2019s death and Lean\u2019s deteriorating mental health. \u201cI was not really OK,\u201d he says. Reichwald says it took him a long time to understand that he and his friends had autonomy over their surreal new lives as successful rappers. \u201cI sometimes felt like, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be here, so I have to do what everyone says<em>.\u2019 </em>I didn\u2019t understand that I had any value in the situation. I didn\u2019t understand why people would like my music. I thought there must be some kind of misunderstanding. But now, I\u2019ve done it for so long and I actually know what I\u2019m doing. I believe more in my ability.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5SkU7ALjwQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-5SkU7ALjwQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>His music remained dark and dissociative for a good while, but the clouds began to part around 2020. While Reichwald\u2019s persona had long swung between mall rat and mystic, his spiritual side became more pronounced as his music grew brighter. Fans started to wonder if he had experienced some sort of transformative near-death experience because, in 2019, he had <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2019/09/17/bladee-interview-drain-gang-trash-island\">mentioned</a> that he\u2019d been struck by lightning in Thailand. Or at least he thinks that\u2019s what happened. \u201cEither I had a random seizure from <em>seeing</em> the lightning or I got struck by it.\u201d Whatever it was, \u201csomething definitely changed around that time\u201d.</p> <p>Drain Gang\u2019s angst once enticed a considerable number of nihilistic, male online edgelords, but their fanbase has evolved as their music has become more euphoric, frequently going viral on TikTok during the pandemic. Most of the crowd at a recent show were dressed in distressed black clothes like Reichwald; they were mainly so young that fans older than 26 were given their own fast-track <a href=\"https://x.com/colinjjoyce/status/1847098699136008385\">queue</a> as if they needed elderly care. </p> <p>Reichwald says that he is uncomfortable with being idolised, but understands the way that belonging to a subculture can be life-affirming.

      "bodyText": "As one quarter of the Swedish underground-ish rap collective Drain Gang, Bladee (pronounced Blade) spent his 20s on the frontlines of a hyper-online youth culture. But as his 30th birthday loomed, the musician born Benjamin Reichwald started to sweat. His anxiety about ageing, a serious depressive spell, and the mixed reception to his latest album, spiralled into a crisis: were he and his Drain Gang peers \u201cpermanently frozen as 20-year-olds because we came up at a certain time of our lives\u201d, he wondered. Was he already past it at 29? \u201cI got so old, I got embarrassed to be even here,\u201d Reichwald sings on his newest album, Cold Visions. Older readers may roll their eyes, but given Reichwald has built up one of the most ardent young fanbases in music, this was a valid worry. \u201cI had a lot to get off my chest,\u201d he says now. \u201cI was thinking a lot about my position and I felt stuck \u2013 do I have to be perceived as an artist to feel fulfilled? I\u2019m chasing that and it doesn\u2019t give me anything. So why am I doing this?\u201d Reichwald has a reputation for being elusive (this is one of the very few solo interviews he has ever done) and frequently obscures his face. Lately he has favoured corpse paint, blood-red grills for his teeth and a chaotic assemblage of bandanas, sunglasses and Oakley hats. But during a two-hour conversation in a Brooklyn hotel room, in Gucci sneakers and a T-shirt with the logo of Norwegian black metal band Satyricon, he is thoughtful and forthcoming. Despite his worries, being 30 has treated Reichwald well. In March he released Psykos, a rock-leaning collaboration with his fellow Swedish rapper and long-term friend and collaborator Yung Lean, who also featured on Cold Visions, which was released the following month. In October, they both appeared on Charli xcx\u2019s Brat remix album, with Bladee reworking the song Rewind. \u201cIt\u2019s a Bladee verse, I did my thing,\u201d is how he modestly describes his contribution, but he speaks more effusively of Charli: \u201cI have eternal respect for her. She put me in this context with all these other people\u201d \u2013 Ariana Grande, Lorde and Billie Eilish all appear on the remix record \u2013 \u201cand I\u2019m very grateful to be involved.\u201d It caps a big year for Reichwald. Released a decade after his debut mixtape, Cold Visions is his most fully realised project yet. Made in two weeks in his house in Stockholm, the album is, he says, \u201creally honest, more like a diary\u201d. In the course of 30 songs, he purges his demons over raging, blown-out trap beats. Brain cells fried into oblivion, he navigates panic attacks and self-loathing, calls himself \u201cthe king of nothing matters\u201d and raps about \u201cviolently drug abusing weed\u201d. In one line he\u2019s working out and getting tanned in LA, the next \u201cI\u2019m crashing down some like a wave over castles made of sand.\u201d Cold Visions was self-released after Reichwald split from Year0001, Drain Gang\u2019s longtime label and management company. \u201cI don\u2019t really care any more about being a bigger artist,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s important is that I\u2019m doing something that\u2019s true to me.\u201d The Drain Gang collective \u2013 Bladee, Ecco2K, Thaiboy Digital, and Whitearmor \u2013 have been best friends since their teens, playing around with Auto-Tune, and freestyling in the vein of idiosyncratic US rappers such as Lil B and Chief Keef. Early Bladee tracks \u2013 overcast cloud rap about crushed hearts, pills and dreams \u2013 were so digitally processed that they passed through the uncanny valley and ended up somewhere strangely melodic and emotive. \u201cI hated to hear my voice without the Auto-Tune,\u201d Reichwald says. \u201cIt\u2019s how we found our sound. Without it we wouldn\u2019t have committed to doing it \u2013 it sounded too bad.\u201d The group cycled through a number of names before landing on Drain Gang, inspired by a nihilistically gothic sentiment later articulated in Bladee\u2019s song Be Nice 2 Me: \u201cTake a knife and drain your life.\u201d They quickly found kindred spirits in Sad Boys, a local crew featuring Yung Lean. In 2014, Lean\u2019s melancholic and memeable hip-hop was taking the internet by storm, and Reichwald quit his job at a kindergarten to join him on tour. By April 2015, barely out of his teens, Reichwald was living with Lean in Miami, where working on music came second to partying and drug use. One evening, Lean suffered drug-induced psychosis; Reichwald called the ambulance which probably saved his life. Hours later, Barron Machat, Lean\u2019s 27-year-old manager, died in a car accident on his way to the hospital; Xanax was found in his system. \u201cThings were building to a point where something was going to happen because of how we were living,\u201d Reichwald says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think that anything could go wrong, we were so in this drugs and rock star lifestyle. Someone was probably always gonna die with how we were moving. It was very reckless, but we were so young, we just didn\u2019t know.\u201d Reichwald returned to Sweden and worked at a shampoo factory while suffering from PTSD and struggling to process Machat\u2019s death and Lean\u2019s deteriorating mental health. \u201cI was not really OK,\u201d he says. Reichwald says it took him a long time to understand that he and his friends had autonomy over their surreal new lives as successful rappers. \u201cI sometimes felt like, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be here, so I have to do what everyone says.\u2019 I didn\u2019t understand that I had any value in the situation. I didn\u2019t understand why people would like my music. I thought there must be some kind of misunderstanding. But now, I\u2019ve done it for so long and I actually know what I\u2019m doing. I believe more in my ability.\u201d His music remained dark and dissociative for a good while, but the clouds began to part around 2020. While Reichwald\u2019s persona had long swung between mall rat and mystic, his spiritual side became more pronounced as his music grew brighter. Fans started to wonder if he had experienced some sort of transformative near-death experience because, in 2019, he had mentioned that he\u2019d been struck by lightning in Thailand. Or at least he thinks that\u2019s what happened. \u201cEither I had a random seizure from seeing the lightning or I got struck by it.\u201d Whatever it was, \u201csomething definitely changed around that time\u201d. Drain Gang\u2019s angst once enticed a considerable number of nihilistic, male online edgelords, but their fanbase has evolved as their music has become more euphoric, frequently going viral on TikTok during the pandemic. Most of the crowd at a recent show were dressed in distressed black clothes like Reichwald; they were mainly so young that fans older than 26 were given their own fast-track queue as if they needed elderly care. Reichwald says that he is uncomfortable with being idolised, but understands the way that belonging to a subculture can be life-affirming. Even before his teens, he formed a punk band with Ecco2K after seeing someone with a studded leather jacket and thinking: \u201cI want to be like that. But,\u201d he adds, \u201cyou need to find yourself within all that.\u201d He allows himself a little pride in the way Drain Gang have built and maintained their singular corner of music. \u201cWe still don\u2019t feel like someone is doing what we\u2019re doing, better,\u201d he says. \u201cI would love to hear someone take it to the next level with a new perspective, someone young. I feel like that\u2019s the point of it \u2013 you can keep the idea going.\u201d He\u2019s now looking beyond Cold Visions to his own future. \u201cI want to become a better person,\u201d he says with a sweetly earnest laugh. \u201cI want to have a brighter outlook and work on liking myself more.

      "bodyText": "Swimming is among the most popular sporting hobbies in the country, with 4.7 million people enjoying a dip at least twice a month, according to Sport England. And, unless you\u2019ve had a bad case of swimmer\u2019s ear, you\u2019ll have heard about the wild swimming trend. The Outdoor Swimming Society says that several million people in the UK now take to rivers, lakes, lidos and seas each year. Their main motivation? Joy, with 94% saying they felt happier and less stressed after a swim. Team GB\u2019s five-medal haul \u2013 one gold and four silvers \u2013 at the Paris Olympic Games 2024 likely encouraged more people to take up or return to the sport, too. So, the chances of you having a swimmer in your life are pretty high. If you\u2019re looking for inspiration to find the perfect gift for them this Christmas, we\u2019re swimming in ideas. *** The best gifts for swimmers *** Streamlined cossie Zoggs swimsuit, \u00a331 zoggs.com \u00a345 next.co.uk Former Paralympic swimmer Susie Rodgers, who won 30 international medals including gold at the Rio 2016 Games, rates Zoggs\u2019 colourful swimwear because some pieces are made from recycled plastic bottles.

Of course you do! Unlike most pool shoes, these slides have an adjustable Velcro strap fastening, which, as Rodgers has a prosthetic, means \u201cthey\u2019re the only thing that stay on my foot\u201d. *** Take care of your hair TreSemm\u00e9 Keratin Smooth mask, \u00a38.50 boots.com \u00a36.50 amazon.co.uk Alicja Jasnikowska hits the pool year-round, and this year is swimming 15km throughout November to raise money for Cancer Research UK. She says: \u201cSwimming three times a week dries out your hair, so I use this conditioning mask in place of a regular conditioner.\u201d *** Watertight goggles Zoggs polarised goggles, \u00a323 shop.rnli.org \u00a321.92 allensswimwear.co.uk According to Jasnikowska, this pair from Zoggs \u201chave a good seal, so no leakage, and the tinted lenses are great for summer outdoor swimming\u201d. *** For the softest skin Nivea Soft moisturiser, \u00a34.34 superdrug.com \u00a35.70 amazon.co.uk This Nivea moisturiser is always in Jasnikowska\u2019s swim bag because it\u2019s \u201clight, easily absorbed and a bargain\u201d. She uses it regularly on her hands and feet, too, so \u201cit\u2019s a great all-rounder\u201d. Pop it in a swimmer\u2019s stocking. *** Spotty wet bag Radsocken wet bag, \u00a36.98 for two amazon.co.uk \u201cI was given one of these years ago as a gift and it\u2019s brilliant,\u201d says Jasnikowska. \u201cIt\u2019s for your wet cossie, hat and goggles after your swim.\u201d *** Funky flip-flops Havaianas, from \u00a316 havaianas-store.com From \u00a37.99 amazon.co.uk Jasnikowska loves classic Havaianas to go between the changing rooms and the pool, as they\u2019re \u201cdurable, stylish and double up as a holiday flip-flop\u201d. *** Cuddly hot-water bottle Boots hot water bottle, \u00a36.99 boots.com \u00a34.95 amazon.co.uk Jasnikowska thinks outdoor swimmers (like her mum) would love nothing more than a decent hot-water bottle for Christmas. *** Swim caps for thick hair Swimscarf swim cap, \u00a326.95 swimscarf.co.uk Katrice Rodrigues is the founder of Unity Swimming CIC, which provides a safe space to improve swimming confidence for Black and Asian people. She recommends the Swimscarf swim hat, saying it \u201cfits all heads, hair lengths and types, keeps it dry, and comes in several fabulous colours\u201d. *** Cold feet begone! Zone3 neoprene swim socks, \u00a339 zone3.com \u00a39.99 amazon.co.uk Diane Mangan, a swim guide at Wild Swims Lake District, says icy feet and hands can diminish the enjoyment of wild swimming. \u201cSo, I can never have enough swim socks,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are a must for protecting the feet from rocky shores and provide an essential layer of warmth for long swims.\u201d *** Long-sleeved swimwear Finisterre women\u2019s Yulex long sleeve swimsuit, \u00a3150 finisterre.com Finisterre men\u2019s Yulex long sleeve shorty wetsuit, \u00a3165 finisterre.com Mangan says: \u201cThey call it a swimsuit, but it\u2019s made from 2mm Yulex natural rubber, a clean alternative to neoprene. Like a wetsuit, it gives warmth to your core but, because it\u2019s designed as a swimsuit, it\u2019s good for breaststroke (legs can drop rather than float, as in a full wetsuit). The Yulex material is soft and easy to get in and out of \u2013 essential for winter dips when you want to get warm quickly. Also, the design and cut are beautiful and it\u2019s well made.\u201d You can also rent suits from \u00a320. *** Swimming aids for little learners Speedo spinning dive toys, \u00a317.39 for four sportsgb.com \u00a319.20 johnlewis.com Delphin discs swimming aid, from \u00a34 newitts.com \u00a329.95 for six amazon.co.uk Chris Lee, head coach at Plymouth Leander who has worked with five-time Paralympic medallist Reece Dunn among others, says sinkers or saucers are ideal for child beginners because they\u2019re \u201cfun items that engage the swimmer and allow them to enjoy the water\u201d.

      "bodyText": "If you want to warn young people about the dangers of sextortion, Scottish teenagers say, use language that we understand, keep your messages fast-paced and don\u2019t scare us. Previous awareness-raising campaigns \u201call looked like they\u2019d been designed by old people trying to be young\u201d, according to the young Scots who have developed a series of online clips in partnership with Fearless, the youth service of the charity Crimestoppers, launching across social media this week. Cases of sextortion, where teenagers are tricked online into sending intimate pictures of themselves to fraudsters who then demand money and threaten to share the material with others, are rising around the globe, with a large proportion of cases involving young men aged between 14 and 18. \u201cIf you want young people to listen it needs to be in the words we actually use \u2013 no young person goes around talking about intimate images \u2026 we call them nudes, scuds and many more\u201d, said 16-year-old Rocco, launching the information videos that can be shared across TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram reels in Glasgow on Monday. Funded and supported by the Scottish government and Police Scotland, the initiative consulted teenagers across Scotland to create online content that would appeal to 13- to 21-year-olds across genders. \u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be a big dramatic production \u2013 we\u2019d be more likely to watch a video on TikTok or Snapchat if it looked like any other video, something a pal had made. It needed to be short, realistic and has to have young people in it,\u201d Rocco added. At the same event, 15-year-old Ruby explained that many of the young people were concerned their parents wouldn\u2019t know how to help them and wanted practical advice on what to do if a friend confided they had been targeted. \u201cMany stressed that the biggest barrier to reporting sextortion was that they thought they\u2019d get into trouble. They\u2019d been told in school lessons that it was against the law to send and receive nude images so they thought they\u2019d get into trouble for sending the image in the first place.\u201d Lyndsay McDade, the manager of Fearless Scotland, who has spearheaded the campaign, as a mother of teenagers herself, said she understood how overwhelming the subject could feel to discuss with young people. As well as the clear message to young people \u2013 \u201cdon\u2019t panic, don\u2019t pay or comply and get help\u201d \u2013 a second strand of the campaign is a longer film offering advice to adults who work with and look after young people. McDade paid tribute to Ros and Mark Dowey, whose 16-year-old son Murray killed himself after he was targeted by online criminals, who also helped to develop the campaign.",

Producer Trevor Horn has mashed up three sets of performances into a new \u201cUltimate Mix\u201d, which will be released on 25 November, and also features George Michael, Robbie Williams, Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor and many more.</p> <p>Writing on Instagram, Sheeran said: \u201cMy approval wasn\u2019t sought on this new Band Aid 40 release and had I had the choice I would have respectfully declined the use of my vocals. A decade on and my understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed.\u201d</p> <p>Sheeran shared a post by British-Ghanaian vocalist Fuse ODG, saying it \u201celoquently explained\u201d his feelings about the song.</p> <p>Fuse ODG wrote of charity initiatives such as Band Aid: \u201cWhile they may generate sympathy and donations, they perpetuate damaging stereotypes that stifle Africa\u2019s economic growth, tourism and investment, ultimately costing the continent trillions and destroying its dignity, pride and identity. By showcasing dehumanising imagery, these initiatives fuel pity rather than partnership, discouraging meaningful engagement.\u201d</p> <p>Fuse ODG said he wanted to \u201creclaim the narrative \u2026 today, the diaspora drives the largest flow of funds back into the continent, not Band Aid or foreign aid, proving that Africa\u2019s solutions and progress lie in its own hands\u201d.</p> <p>Band Aid has raised over \u00a3150m since being founded in 1984, including via the song \u2013 which topped the charts on each of its three releases \u2013 and the US-UK benefit concerts Live Aid. It originally targeted famine relief in Ethiopia and has since expanded to charitable efforts across Africa.</p> <p>But the song has been criticised for a paternalistic and generalising attitude towards Africans, and had its lyrics changed in 2014, including Bono\u2019s climatic line \u201cWell tonight thank God it\u2019s them, instead of you\u201d which was changed to \u201cWell tonight we\u2019re reaching out and touching you\u201d.</p> <p>Fuse ODG was invited to appear on that version, but declined, writing in the Guardian at the time: \u201cI, like many others, am sick of the whole concept of Africa \u2013 a resource-rich continent with unbridled potential \u2013 always being seen as diseased, infested and poverty-stricken.\u201d</p> <p>Sheeran is gearing up to release his own Christmas song, Under the Tree, taken from the soundtrack to new Netflix film That Christmas, co-written by Richard Curtis and adapted from his children\u2019s books. It stars Brian Cox as Santa Claus, with Jodie Whittaker, Fiona Shaw and Bill Nighy among the supporting cast.</p>",

Producer Trevor Horn has mashed up three sets of performances into a new \u201cUltimate Mix\u201d, which will be released on 25 November, and also features George Michael, Robbie Williams, Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor and many more. Writing on Instagram, Sheeran said: \u201cMy approval wasn\u2019t sought on this new Band Aid 40 release and had I had the choice I would have respectfully declined the use of my vocals. A decade on and my understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed.\u201d Sheeran shared a post by British-Ghanaian vocalist Fuse ODG, saying it \u201celoquently explained\u201d his feelings about the song. Fuse ODG wrote of charity initiatives such as Band Aid: \u201cWhile they may generate sympathy and donations, they perpetuate damaging stereotypes that stifle Africa\u2019s economic growth, tourism and investment, ultimately costing the continent trillions and destroying its dignity, pride and identity. By showcasing dehumanising imagery, these initiatives fuel pity rather than partnership, discouraging meaningful engagement.\u201d Fuse ODG said he wanted to \u201creclaim the narrative \u2026 today, the diaspora drives the largest flow of funds back into the continent, not Band Aid or foreign aid, proving that Africa\u2019s solutions and progress lie in its own hands\u201d. Band Aid has raised over \u00a3150m since being founded in 1984, including via the song \u2013 which topped the charts on each of its three releases \u2013 and the US-UK benefit concerts Live Aid. It originally targeted famine relief in Ethiopia and has since expanded to charitable efforts across Africa. But the song has been criticised for a paternalistic and generalising attitude towards Africans, and had its lyrics changed in 2014, including Bono\u2019s climatic line \u201cWell tonight thank God it\u2019s them, instead of you\u201d which was changed to \u201cWell tonight we\u2019re reaching out and touching you\u201d. Fuse ODG was invited to appear on that version, but declined, writing in the Guardian at the time: \u201cI, like many others, am sick of the whole concept of Africa \u2013 a resource-rich continent with unbridled potential \u2013 always being seen as diseased, infested and poverty-stricken.\u201d Sheeran is gearing up to release his own Christmas song, Under the Tree, taken from the soundtrack to new Netflix film That Christmas, co-written by Richard Curtis and adapted from his children\u2019s books. It stars Brian Cox as Santa Claus, with Jodie Whittaker, Fiona Shaw and Bill Nighy among the supporting cast.",

Amid grinding Russian ground advances, EU feuding and Donald Trump\u2019s unpropitious re-election, the war has reached a critical juncture, militarily and diplomatically. The outcome is in the balance as the scales momentarily tip towards more death and destruction, then back towards some form of Trump-imposed land-for-peace sell-out.</p> <p>Russia has the advantage at present. But Kyiv will not and must not give up.</p> <p>Biden was slow to give the missile go-ahead, despite months of pressure from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has argued, with good reason, that Ukraine is fighting with one hand tied behind its back. Russian airfields, military bases and command centres that are used to mount almost daily, lethal missile and drone attacks on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/17/russia-targets-ukraines-power-grid-in-biggest-missile-strike-in-months-officials-say\">Ukraine\u2019s cities and energy infrastructure</a> are out of range.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s tardiness was the product of an excessive caution that has seen the US drag its feet on supplying new weapons from the start. If Ukraine had been armed in 2022 with all the tanks, air-defence systems, missiles and fighter aircraft it has subsequently, belatedly been given, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/26/ukraine-russia-war-nato-biden-putin\">it might not be struggling as it is now</a>.</p> <p>But his hesitation was reportedly reinforced by a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/politics/us-ukraine-strikes.html\">recent classified US intelligence assessment</a>. It warned that Putin could respond to the use of the US long-range army tactical missile system (Atacms), and the similarly capable Anglo-French Storm Shadow missiles, AKA Scalp-EG, on Russian soil, with attacks on the US and its allies.</p> <p>Direct, overt Russian armed retaliation against European military bases or territory seems unlikely, although tensions with Poland and other \u201cfrontline\u201d Nato countries are running high. <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ukraine-west-nuclear/33119997.html\">Dark threats by Putin cronies</a> such as former president Dmitry Medvedev about using nuclear weapons are dismissed as rhetorical fearmongering.</p> <p>Instead, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/us/politics/russia-sabotage-campaign-ukraine.html\">the intelligence finding suggested</a>, Russia may step up covert, deniable sabotage: cyber, infowar and arson attacks of the type it has undertaken in recent years. This would allow the Kremlin to impose a cost, especially on wavering Nato members such as Olaf Scholz\u2019s Germany, while avoiding all-out east-west war.</p> <p>The GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, and other state organs are said to have been tasked by Putin with preparing asymmetrical responses for exactly the circumstances that are now unfolding. The overall aim: to alarm and disrupt western societies and publics.</p> <p>The GRU is notorious in Britain for carrying out the non-Ukraine-related Salisbury poisonings in 2018. In March this year, it was linked to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgexrw3x2xo#:~:text=A%20man%20has%20admitted%20carrying,London%20on%20behalf%20of%20Russia.\">arson at a warehouse</a> in east London supposedly used to supply Ukraine. Attacks on a factory in Poland and non-military targets in Latvia and Lithuania are also attributed to the GRU. In May, Donald Tusk, Poland\u2019s prime minister, said <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/poland-baltic-states-russia-threats-sabotage-2273d15b717d7b499e669038d21d9acb\">12 people had been arrested</a> for beatings, arson and \u201cacts of sabotage on commission from Russian intelligence services\u201d.</p> <p>These may have been mere practice runs. Kaja Kallas, former prime minister of Estonia and newly nominated EU foreign policy chief, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-estonia-baltics-sabotage-spying-kallas-62835b00fdb31f648ebe2259908ca2a1\">says Moscow </a>is waging a \u201cshadow war\u201d on Europe. Norway\u2019s prime minister, Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, warns that Russia may target energy producers and arms factories. Europe needed a coordinated approach, Kallas said. \u201cHow far do we let them go on our soil?\u201d</p> <p>Nor is the threat confined to land. Last week, in the latest in a series of incidents, a Russian spy ship \u2013 officially classed as an \u201coceanographic research vessel\u201d \u2013 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/16/russian-spy-ship-escorted-away-from-internet-cables-in-irish-sea\">militarily escorted out of the Irish Sea</a>. Its unexplained presence there and around UK coasts has renewed concerns about the security of critical undersea infrastructure, including pipelines and internet cables linking the UK, Ireland, Europe and the US.</p> <p>Described as the latest attempt to probe western defences and vulnerabilities, the incident followed an investigation in Nordic countries last year into suspected Russian state-led espionage ops. Spy ships disguised as fishing vessels were being used to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/19/russian-spy-network-operating-in-north-sea-investigation-claims\">plan future attacks</a> on windfarms and communications cables in the North Sea, it said.</p> <p>However Russia responds \u2013 and the initial Kremlin reaction on Monday was wait-and-see \u2013 Biden\u2019s decision challenges Ukraine and the European Nato allies, too. Having pressed so hard for so long, Zelenskyy must prove that the missiles make a difference. US officials are sceptical they can change the course of the war.

      "bodyText": "US president Joe Biden\u2019s last-gasp decision to permit Ukraine to fire western-made, long-range missiles at military targets deep inside Russian territory runs the risk of triggering a sharp increase in retaliatory sabotage, such as cyber and arson attacks on Britain and its European Nato partners. Vladimir Putin, who ordered the full-scale, illegal invasion of Ukraine 1,000 days ago tomorrow, has long warned that Kyiv\u2019s expanded use of US-, British- and French-made missiles would be viewed by Moscow as an act of war by Nato, and could trigger catastrophic consequences. Now Putin\u2019s bluff, if it is a bluff, is being called. Much the same may be said of Keir Starmer and the EU. A joint statement by G7 leaders, coinciding with the 1,000-day landmark, pledged \u201cunwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes\u201d. Starmer reiterated that commitment en route to this week\u2019s G20 summit in Brazil. Exactly what it means in practice may soon be harshly tested. Biden\u2019s decision is welcome, if overdue. Amid grinding Russian ground advances, EU feuding and Donald Trump\u2019s unpropitious re-election, the war has reached a critical juncture, militarily and diplomatically. The outcome is in the balance as the scales momentarily tip towards more death and destruction, then back towards some form of Trump-imposed land-for-peace sell-out. Russia has the advantage at present. But Kyiv will not and must not give up. Biden was slow to give the missile go-ahead, despite months of pressure from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has argued, with good reason, that Ukraine is fighting with one hand tied behind its back. Russian airfields, military bases and command centres that are used to mount almost daily, lethal missile and drone attacks on Ukraine\u2019s cities and energy infrastructure are out of range. Biden\u2019s tardiness was the product of an excessive caution that has seen the US drag its feet on supplying new weapons from the start. If Ukraine had been armed in 2022 with all the tanks, air-defence systems, missiles and fighter aircraft it has subsequently, belatedly been given, it might not be struggling as it is now. But his hesitation was reportedly reinforced by a recent classified US intelligence assessment. It warned that Putin could respond to the use of the US long-range army tactical missile system (Atacms), and the similarly capable Anglo-French Storm Shadow missiles, AKA Scalp-EG, on Russian soil, with attacks on the US and its allies. Direct, overt Russian armed retaliation against European military bases or territory seems unlikely, although tensions with Poland and other \u201cfrontline\u201d Nato countries are running high. Dark threats by Putin cronies such as former president Dmitry Medvedev about using nuclear weapons are dismissed as rhetorical fearmongering. Instead, the intelligence finding suggested, Russia may step up covert, deniable sabotage: cyber, infowar and arson attacks of the type it has undertaken in recent years. This would allow the Kremlin to impose a cost, especially on wavering Nato members such as Olaf Scholz\u2019s Germany, while avoiding all-out east-west war. The GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, and other state organs are said to have been tasked by Putin with preparing asymmetrical responses for exactly the circumstances that are now unfolding. The overall aim: to alarm and disrupt western societies and publics. The GRU is notorious in Britain for carrying out the non-Ukraine-related Salisbury poisonings in 2018. In March this year, it was linked to arson at a warehouse in east London supposedly used to supply Ukraine. Attacks on a factory in Poland and non-military targets in Latvia and Lithuania are also attributed to the GRU. In May, Donald Tusk, Poland\u2019s prime minister, said 12 people had been arrested for beatings, arson and \u201cacts of sabotage on commission from Russian intelligence services\u201d. These may have been mere practice runs. Kaja Kallas, former prime minister of Estonia and newly nominated EU foreign policy chief, says Moscow is waging a \u201cshadow war\u201d on Europe. Norway\u2019s prime minister, Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, warns that Russia may target energy producers and arms factories. Europe needed a coordinated approach, Kallas said. \u201cHow far do we let them go on our soil?\u201d Nor is the threat confined to land. Last week, in the latest in a series of incidents, a Russian spy ship \u2013 officially classed as an \u201coceanographic research vessel\u201d \u2013 was militarily escorted out of the Irish Sea. Its unexplained presence there and around UK coasts has renewed concerns about the security of critical undersea infrastructure, including pipelines and internet cables linking the UK, Ireland, Europe and the US. Described as the latest attempt to probe western defences and vulnerabilities, the incident followed an investigation in Nordic countries last year into suspected Russian state-led espionage ops. Spy ships disguised as fishing vessels were being used to plan future attacks on windfarms and communications cables in the North Sea, it said. However Russia responds \u2013 and the initial Kremlin reaction on Monday was wait-and-see \u2013 Biden\u2019s decision challenges Ukraine and the European Nato allies, too. Having pressed so hard for so long, Zelenskyy must prove that the missiles make a difference. US officials are sceptical they can change the course of the war. EU officials in Brussels hope they will. What Biden appears to hope is that long-range strikes on North Korean troops newly deployed in Russia\u2019s contested Kursk region will deter Pyongyang from further involvement. That seems improbable, too. Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s ostracised dictator, is Putin\u2019s new best bro. He\u2019s not noted for a caring attitude to human life. With Trump\u2019s advisers threatening a de facto betrayal of Ukraine, Europe\u2019s leaders, including Starmer, must put their money, lots of it, and their weapons where their mouths are \u2013 and help Zelenskyy maintain the fight, even without US hardware and financial backing, if need be. The problem is that unity of purpose, and resources, are lacking. Scholz broke with most of the EU last week when he phoned Putin for a chat. The chancellor (who continues to refuse to supply Germany\u2019s Taurus long-range missiles to Kyiv) said he was pursuing peace. But it looked like weakness with snap elections brewing, and it angered other leaders. \u201cNo one will stop Putin with phone calls,\u201d Tusk snarled. \u201cTelephone diplomacy cannot replace real support from the whole west for Ukraine.\u201d The \u201cwhole west\u201d means France, too. But President Emmanuel Macron, having spoken frequently and passionately about the vital importance for Europe of defeating Russia, now appears to be temporising about actually letting Kyiv fire French missiles. Will Starmer give a green light, or will he also get cold feet? With Ukraine burning, Europe divided, and Biden two months away from oblivion, it\u2019s little wonder that Putin, with a host of dirty tricks up his sleeve, thinks he\u2019s winning the Ukraine missile crisis.

Since 7 October 2023, his education department\u2019s office for civil rights has launched <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/07/biden-harris-administration-ramps-up-actions-to-counter-antisemitism-on-college-campuses-and-protect-jewish-communities/\">more than 100 investigations</a>, the vast majority over allegations of antisemitism, and several after claims filed by conservative groups. At least 60 universities remain under investigation.</p> <p>\u201cTargeting \u2018woke\u2019 education is catnip for the right right now, and the fact that they used antisemitism, or alleged antisemitism, as the tool to do so enabled them to mitigate to a great degree Democratic opposition and actually get Democrats to support them in this agenda,\u201d said Lara Friedman, the president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, who tracks efforts to use antisemitism as a pretext to punish critics of Israel.</p> <p>Kamola, the Trinity professor, told the Guardian that the exploitation of antisemitism to threaten universities\u2019 independence is an extension of earlier, organized campaigns which already saw so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/05/georgia-passes-bill-restricting-discussion-race-schools\">divisive concepts</a>\u201d legislation targeting discussion of race and initiatives promoting inclusivity on campuses.</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t issues of antisemitism on college campuses and that those shouldn\u2019t be taken very seriously,\u201d he added. \u201cBut there are a number of groups that have long been fighting the culture war in the name of anti-critical race theory and anti-diversity and inclusion, that after October 7 just pivoted to antisemitism.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018A sledgehammer\u2019</h2> <p>Free speech advocates expect the IHRA definition to be \u201cused as a sledgehammer\u201d in the incoming administration\u2019s attacks on pro-Palestine activism, said Sainath, of Palestine Legal.</p> <p>Already, some universities have heeded the definition\u2019s spirit in drafting their own codes. New York University, for instance, earlier this year issued new <a href=\"https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-community-standards/nyu-guidance-expectations-student-conduct.html\">university policies</a> citing federal guidance and in effect extending equal rights protections to Zionism, a political ideology.</p> <p>In May, the House of Representatives passed the Antisemitism Awareness Act, which codifies Trump\u2019s executive order into federal law. The Democratic Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has pledged to bring it to a vote before the Senate comes under Republican control in January.</p> <p>On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union issued an <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/documents/aclu-urges-senate-to-oppose-s-4127-the-antisemitism-awareness-act\">open letter</a> denouncing the IHRA definition as \u201coverbroad\u201d and encouraging senators to reject it. \u201cEnshrining this definition into regulation would chill the exercise of First Amendment rights and risk undermining the Department of Education\u2019s legitimate and important efforts to combat discrimination,\u201d they wrote.</p> <p>Vera Eidelman, a staff attorney with the ACLU\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told the Guardian that the examples included in the IHRA definition which conflate antisemitism with criticism of Israel are protected by the first amendment.</p> <p>\u201cClaiming that the existence of the state of Israel is a racist endeavor, or drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis, whatever you think of the merits of that speech, it\u2019s clearly political speech,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The only federal judge asked to weigh in on the question so far agreed. Last month, US district court Judge Robert Pitman ruled that a March 2024 directive by the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, instructing all public universities in the state to incorporate the IHRA definition in their policies amounted to \u201c<a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1172787806/gov.uscourts.txwd.1172787806.62.0.pdf\">viewpoint discrimination</a>\u201d.</p> <h2>A chilling effect</h2> <p>Free speech advocates hope that additional efforts to impose the IHRA definition would also fail in court, but they warn that it is already having an effect. While the federal government has never cut funding to universities over antisemitism claims, Trump\u2019s threats on funding and accreditation have administrators on high alert.</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m a general counsel at a university being told by the federal government, \u2018Hey, if you don\u2019t get this right, your federal funding is on the line\u2019 \u2026 What are you going to choose?\u201d Tyler Coward, lead counsel at the campus free speech group Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire) told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to choose censorship to save your federal dollars, and that is a really awful position to put our institutions in.\u201d</p> <p>For faculty and students, the prospect of the incoming administration doubling down on its attacks on what it calls antisemitism are cause of growing anxiety.</p> <p>\u201cYou could be a scholar of the Middle East, Palestinian history and literature, or Israeli history and literature, and what you know to be true from your extensive, decades-long scholarship, you now have to think, \u2018Well, these claims we\u2019re making that are fact-based and based on evidence will, by this politically ideological definition, be deemed antisemitism,\u201d said Kamola, the political science professor. \u201cIt creates an incredible chilling effect.\u201d</p> <p>Sainath, of Palestine Legal, said that disciplinary charges, investigations, and a general climate of repression have taken a toll on student organizing, manifesting in quieter campuses compared with last year.</p> <p>But she and others expressed hopes that as Americans prepare to fight the incoming administration\u2019s crackdown on civil liberties across the board, they will also support efforts to protect pro-Palestine speech in higher education.</p> <p>\u201cThe movement is not going to stop speaking out just because Trump is in office.\u201d</p>",

On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union issued an open letter denouncing the IHRA definition as \u201coverbroad\u201d and encouraging senators to reject it. \u201cEnshrining this definition into regulation would chill the exercise of First Amendment rights and risk undermining the Department of Education\u2019s legitimate and important efforts to combat discrimination,\u201d they wrote. Vera Eidelman, a staff attorney with the ACLU\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told the Guardian that the examples included in the IHRA definition which conflate antisemitism with criticism of Israel are protected by the first amendment. \u201cClaiming that the existence of the state of Israel is a racist endeavor, or drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis, whatever you think of the merits of that speech, it\u2019s clearly political speech,\u201d she said. The only federal judge asked to weigh in on the question so far agreed. Last month, US district court Judge Robert Pitman ruled that a March 2024 directive by the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, instructing all public universities in the state to incorporate the IHRA definition in their policies amounted to \u201cviewpoint discrimination\u201d. A chilling effect Free speech advocates hope that additional efforts to impose the IHRA definition would also fail in court, but they warn that it is already having an effect. While the federal government has never cut funding to universities over antisemitism claims, Trump\u2019s threats on funding and accreditation have administrators on high alert. \u201cIf I\u2019m a general counsel at a university being told by the federal government, \u2018Hey, if you don\u2019t get this right, your federal funding is on the line\u2019 \u2026 What are you going to choose?\u201d Tyler Coward, lead counsel at the campus free speech group Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire) told the Guardian. \u201cYou\u2019re going to choose censorship to save your federal dollars, and that is a really awful position to put our institutions in.\u201d For faculty and students, the prospect of the incoming administration doubling down on its attacks on what it calls antisemitism are cause of growing anxiety. \u201cYou could be a scholar of the Middle East, Palestinian history and literature, or Israeli history and literature, and what you know to be true from your extensive, decades-long scholarship, you now have to think, \u2018Well, these claims we\u2019re making that are fact-based and based on evidence will, by this politically ideological definition, be deemed antisemitism,\u201d said Kamola, the political science professor. \u201cIt creates an incredible chilling effect.\u201d Sainath, of Palestine Legal, said that disciplinary charges, investigations, and a general climate of repression have taken a toll on student organizing, manifesting in quieter campuses compared with last year. But she and others expressed hopes that as Americans prepare to fight the incoming administration\u2019s crackdown on civil liberties across the board, they will also support efforts to protect pro-Palestine speech in higher education. \u201cThe movement is not going to stop speaking out just because Trump is in office.\u201d",

After presiding over the response<strong> </strong>to destructive blazes that left a devastating toll, including the Camp fire that claimed the lives of 85 people in and around the town of Paradise, in 2020 he told a crowd in Pennsylvania that high-risk fire states such as California,<strong> </strong>and their residents, were to blame.</p> <p>\u201cI said you gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests \u2013 there are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and they\u2019re like, like, so flammable, you touch them and it goes up,\u201d he said. That year, a <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/fire/202013\">record 10.2m acres were charred</a> across the US.</p> <p>In a signal of how politicized disaster management in the Trump era became, he added: \u201cMaybe we\u2019re just going to have to make them pay for it because they don\u2019t listen to us.\u201d</p> <p>Such comments raised fears among experts and officials working to protect these landscapes and the neighborhoods near them that Trump didn\u2019t understand the magnitude of the risks US forests faced.</p> <p>He\u2019s been unwilling to embrace the strategies that the scientists and landscape managers recommend to help keep catastrophic fire in check, including a delicate and tailored approach to removing vegetation in overgrown forests, protecting old-growth stands, and following those treatments with prescribed burning.</p> <p>The risks and challenges have only intensified since his first term.</p> <p>Some in the wildfire response communities are hopeful that Trump will cut red tape that\u2019s slowed progress on important forest treatments, but others have highlighted a blunt approach could do more harm than good.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/30/firefighters-federal-cancer-coverage\">Firefighters were elated after a federal bill provided them support for cancer. Then came \u2018a slap in the face\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many have voiced concerns over ambitions set out in Project 2025 to curb prescribed burning in favor of increasing timber sales.</p> <p>Meanwhile, federal firefighters are waiting to see whether Trump and a Republican-led Congress will secure long-overdue pay raises.</p> <p>The US Forest Service (USFS), the largest employer of federal firefighters, has seen an exodus of emergency responders over abysmally low pay and gaps in support for the unsustainable and dangerous work they do.</p> <p>Federal firefighters who spend weeks at a time on the fireline and rack up thousands of hours in overtime each summer, make far less than their state- and city-employed counterparts with paychecks that rival those of fast-food employees. That exodus has hampered its ability to keep pace with the year-round firefighting needs.</p> <p>\u201cDoing less with your resources makes a task like fire suppression and fuels management extremely more challenging,\u201d said Jonathan Golden,<strong> </strong>legislative director of the advocacy group Grassroots Wildland Firefighters.</p> <p>Joe Biden facilitated a temporary pay raise for federal wildland firefighters, but those expire at the end of the year. With Trump promising large cuts to federal budgets and the bureaucrats who operate them, many fear the Republican leadership in Congress won\u2019t push the legislation needed to ensure these essential emergency responders keep their raise<strong>.</strong></p> <p>If the pay raises are allowed to expire, many more federal firefighters will walk out the door \u2013 right when they are needed most.</p> <p>\u201cThe job isn\u2019t going to get any easier,\u201d Golden said. \u201cMy hope is that we continue to have a well-staffed and well-funded professional workforce that can answer the call year-round \u2013 because that\u2019s what is required.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Emergencies on the rise</strong></h2> <p>Billion-dollar weather and climate disasters are on the rise. There was a historic number in the US in 2023 with a total of 28 \u2013 surpassing the previous record of 22 in 2022. With more than a month left, there have already been <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/\">24 this year</a>.</p> <p>Trump has a history of stalling in the aftermath of natural disasters, opting instead to put a political spin on who receives aid. For wildfires during his first term, that meant threatening California and other Democratic-majority states with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/13/trump-disaster-funding-warning\">delayed or withheld funding</a> to punish them for their political leanings.</p> <p>This time, some fear he may also reduce the amount of aid provided by Fema. Project 2025 has called for a <a href=\"https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\">shift in emergency spending</a>, putting the \u201cmajority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government\u201d and either eliminating or armoring grants that fund preparedness to push Trump\u2019s political agenda.</p> <p>The framework advises the next president to remove all unions from the department and only give Fema grants to states, localities and private organizations who \u201ccan show that their mission and actions support the broader homeland security mission\u201d, including the deportation of undocumented people.</p> <p>These tactics could hamper both preparedness and recovery from wildfires and other disasters, especially in high-risk blue states such as California and others across the west.</p> <p>The administration has also been advised by Project 2025 authors to dismantle or severely hamper the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, whose forecasting has been essential to warn when dangerous weather arises, and remove all mention of the climate crisis in federal rhetoric and research.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s picks of a former congressman Lee Zeldin to head the Environmental Protection Agency and North Dakota governor Doug Burgum as the Department of Interior secretary \u2013 two agencies deeply connected to US climate policy \u2013 indicate his strong skepticism of the climate crisis. Zeldin and Burgum have clear directives to oversee rampant deregulation and expedite extraction on public lands.</p> <p>\u201cFolks at federal agencies are already being gently advised to think about the language they use to describe things,\u201d Swain said. He thinks the effects will be far-reaching, especially when it comes to wildfire preparedness and response. Disabling science and weather-focused agencies could reduce important intel that responders rely on, reduce nimbleness and hamper efforts to plan into the future.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people are thinking this is going to be the second coming of the first Trump administration and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right way to be thinking about it,\u201d Swain said.</p> <p>\u201cThis time, it\u2019s highly plausible that the disruption and the harms will be a lot deeper and more lasting \u2013 it will be much harder to reverse.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Big picture problems</strong></h2> <p>Even before Trump retook the White House, the US was missing the mark on its ambitious climate goals. But scientists and experts have offered clear warnings about how Trump\u2019s policies could accelerate dire outcomes.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change is a huge crisis and we don\u2019t have time to spare,\u201d said Julia Stein<strong>, </strong>deputy director of the Emmett Institute on climate change and the environment at the UCLA School of Law.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/09/global-boiling-mass-flooding-and-trump-10-big-talking-points-for-cop29\">Global boiling, mass flooding and Trump: 10 big talking points for Cop29</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stein pointed to the potential for many of these policies to be challenged in court, much like they were the first time around. States such as California, which is also home to one of the world\u2019s largest economies to back it, are already preparing to challenge Trump\u2019s policies. The directives of the first Trump administration were often legally vulnerable, Stein said, and she thinks they might be again this time around, especially if he attempts to rid the agencies of career bureaucrats and their deep knowledge of how things work.</p> <p>In a state where wildfires are always a risk, California is also bolstering its own approach, doubling down on landscape treatments and investing in preparation, mitigation, and response according to Stein, who noted the $10bn climate bond just passed by voters there that will go toward wildfire prevention and mitigation.</p> <p>Still, fires don\u2019t recognize borders. The threats continue to push into areas that aren\u2019t accustomed to them, and larger swaths of the country will be forced to grapple with smoke. Without partners in federal agencies that manage lands across the US, states will struggle to address the mounting challenges on their own.</p> <p>\u201cContinuing to enforce those laws in California will blunt some of the impact for Californians,\u201d she said. \u201cThe unfortunate thing \u2013 especially when it comes to climate change \u2013 there are going to be national and global consequences for inaction at the federal level.\u201d</p>",

Some in the wildfire response communities are hopeful that Trump will cut red tape that\u2019s slowed progress on important forest treatments, but others have highlighted a blunt approach could do more harm than good. Many have voiced concerns over ambitions set out in Project 2025 to curb prescribed burning in favor of increasing timber sales. Meanwhile, federal firefighters are waiting to see whether Trump and a Republican-led Congress will secure long-overdue pay raises. The US Forest Service (USFS), the largest employer of federal firefighters, has seen an exodus of emergency responders over abysmally low pay and gaps in support for the unsustainable and dangerous work they do. Federal firefighters who spend weeks at a time on the fireline and rack up thousands of hours in overtime each summer, make far less than their state- and city-employed counterparts with paychecks that rival those of fast-food employees. That exodus has hampered its ability to keep pace with the year-round firefighting needs. \u201cDoing less with your resources makes a task like fire suppression and fuels management extremely more challenging,\u201d said Jonathan Golden, legislative director of the advocacy group Grassroots Wildland Firefighters. Joe Biden facilitated a temporary pay raise for federal wildland firefighters, but those expire at the end of the year. With Trump promising large cuts to federal budgets and the bureaucrats who operate them, many fear the Republican leadership in Congress won\u2019t push the legislation needed to ensure these essential emergency responders keep their raise. If the pay raises are allowed to expire, many more federal firefighters will walk out the door \u2013 right when they are needed most. \u201cThe job isn\u2019t going to get any easier,\u201d Golden said. \u201cMy hope is that we continue to have a well-staffed and well-funded professional workforce that can answer the call year-round \u2013 because that\u2019s what is required.\u201d Emergencies on the rise Billion-dollar weather and climate disasters are on the rise. There was a historic number in the US in 2023 with a total of 28 \u2013 surpassing the previous record of 22 in 2022. With more than a month left, there have already been 24 this year. Trump has a history of stalling in the aftermath of natural disasters, opting instead to put a political spin on who receives aid. For wildfires during his first term, that meant threatening California and other Democratic-majority states with delayed or withheld funding to punish them for their political leanings. This time, some fear he may also reduce the amount of aid provided by Fema. Project 2025 has called for a shift in emergency spending, putting the \u201cmajority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government\u201d and either eliminating or armoring grants that fund preparedness to push Trump\u2019s political agenda. The framework advises the next president to remove all unions from the department and only give Fema grants to states, localities and private organizations who \u201ccan show that their mission and actions support the broader homeland security mission\u201d, including the deportation of undocumented people. These tactics could hamper both preparedness and recovery from wildfires and other disasters, especially in high-risk blue states such as California and others across the west. The administration has also been advised by Project 2025 authors to dismantle or severely hamper the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, whose forecasting has been essential to warn when dangerous weather arises, and remove all mention of the climate crisis in federal rhetoric and research. Trump\u2019s picks of a former congressman Lee Zeldin to head the Environmental Protection Agency and North Dakota governor Doug Burgum as the Department of Interior secretary \u2013 two agencies deeply connected to US climate policy \u2013 indicate his strong skepticism of the climate crisis. Zeldin and Burgum have clear directives to oversee rampant deregulation and expedite extraction on public lands. \u201cFolks at federal agencies are already being gently advised to think about the language they use to describe things,\u201d Swain said. He thinks the effects will be far-reaching, especially when it comes to wildfire preparedness and response. Disabling science and weather-focused agencies could reduce important intel that responders rely on, reduce nimbleness and hamper efforts to plan into the future. \u201cA lot of people are thinking this is going to be the second coming of the first Trump administration and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right way to be thinking about it,\u201d Swain said. \u201cThis time, it\u2019s highly plausible that the disruption and the harms will be a lot deeper and more lasting \u2013 it will be much harder to reverse.\u201d Big picture problems Even before Trump retook the White House, the US was missing the mark on its ambitious climate goals. But scientists and experts have offered clear warnings about how Trump\u2019s policies could accelerate dire outcomes. \u201cClimate change is a huge crisis and we don\u2019t have time to spare,\u201d said Julia Stein, deputy director of the Emmett Institute on climate change and the environment at the UCLA School of Law. Stein pointed to the potential for many of these policies to be challenged in court, much like they were the first time around. States such as California, which is also home to one of the world\u2019s largest economies to back it, are already preparing to challenge Trump\u2019s policies. The directives of the first Trump administration were often legally vulnerable, Stein said, and she thinks they might be again this time around, especially if he attempts to rid the agencies of career bureaucrats and their deep knowledge of how things work. In a state where wildfires are always a risk, California is also bolstering its own approach, doubling down on landscape treatments and investing in preparation, mitigation, and response according to Stein, who noted the $10bn climate bond just passed by voters there that will go toward wildfire prevention and mitigation. Still, fires don\u2019t recognize borders. The threats continue to push into areas that aren\u2019t accustomed to them, and larger swaths of the country will be forced to grapple with smoke. Without partners in federal agencies that manage lands across the US, states will struggle to address the mounting challenges on their own. \u201cContinuing to enforce those laws in California will blunt some of the impact for Californians,\u201d she said. \u201cThe unfortunate thing \u2013 especially when it comes to climate change \u2013 there are going to be national and global consequences for inaction at the federal level.\u201d",

The company also announced it had agreed to sell 23 airplanes to GA Telesis, an aviation services company, for $519m. The October announcement briefly boosted the stock, before it came down as bankruptcy appeared likely.</p> <p>The airlines also said in October that it planned to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/spirit-airlines-furlough-hundreds-pilots-2024-10-30/\">furlough</a> about 330 pilots starting 31 January 2025, in addition to the 186 pilots it furloughed in September. The company downgraded 120 captains to first officers at the time.</p> <p>The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. That is a huge change from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy of luring customers with rock-bottom fares and forcing them to pay extra for things such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.</p> <p>In a highly unusual move, Spirit plans to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts say should help prop up fares. But that will help rivals more than it will boost Spirit. Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.</p> <p>Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.</p> <p>The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.</p> <p>Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the justice department sued to block the $3.8bn deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.</p> <p>US airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.</p> <p>The last bankruptcy by a major US carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013.</p>",

Last month, Spirit announced it would conduct layoffs as part of $80m in cost-saving measures, though it did not specify how many employees would be affected. The company also announced it had agreed to sell 23 airplanes to GA Telesis, an aviation services company, for $519m. The October announcement briefly boosted the stock, before it came down as bankruptcy appeared likely. The airlines also said in October that it planned to furlough about 330 pilots starting 31 January 2025, in addition to the 186 pilots it furloughed in September. The company downgraded 120 captains to first officers at the time. The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. That is a huge change from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy of luring customers with rock-bottom fares and forcing them to pay extra for things such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda. In a highly unusual move, Spirit plans to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts say should help prop up fares. But that will help rivals more than it will boost Spirit. Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes. Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots. The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target. Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the justice department sued to block the $3.8bn deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later. US airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying. The last bankruptcy by a major US carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013.",

The non-expert poetry readers who participated were more likely to judge AI-generated poems as being written by humans than those actually written by humans. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, showed participants poems written by 10 famous English-language poets along with poems generated in the style of those poets by ChatGPT 3.5. Real and imitation poems by Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, Samuel Butler, Lord Byron, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, TS Eliot, Allen Ginsberg, Sylvia Plath and Dorothea Lasky were presented to participants. Results showed that the odds of a poem written by a human being judged as human-authored were roughly 75% that of an AI-generated poem being judged as human-authored.

He wants to dramatically alter the accreditation process that ensures colleges meet set standards, opening the door for programs that currently<strong> </strong>do not.</p> <p>These are just a few of Trump\u2019s ideas for overhauling colleges and universities \u2013 frequent targets of rightwing campaigns that view them as incubators for leftist ideology. Many of Trump\u2019s higher ed proposals involve driving out these perceived ideas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/18/trump-universities-antisemitism\">Trump likely to use antisemitism claims to launch crackdown on US universities</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What is Trump proposing? </h2>  <p>Trump\u2019s higher education platform isn\u2019t terribly detailed; it is composed<strong> </strong>mostly of one-liners that propose, for instance, to \u201cMake Colleges and Universities Sane and Affordable\u201d. He has, however, suggested what would be a seismic change to higher education: the dismantling of the US Department of Education, which helps distribute federal financial aid to college students. It would take congressional approval to shutter the agency, something Republicans haven\u2019t been able to achieve despite saying for decades they want to close it. </p> <p>His allies have proposed policies with more meat on the bones. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/project-2025\">Project 2025</a>,<strong> </strong>the conservative blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation, includes ways to peel back protections for LGBTQ+ students, \u201crestore due process\u201d for people accused of assault and harassment on campus, and curtail student loan forgiveness.</p> <p>If implemented fully, the conservative changes for higher education under Trump would be monumental.</p> <h2>What is \u2018American Academy\u2019?</h2>  <p><a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-the-american-academy\">One video</a>in Trump\u2019s platform, dubbed Agenda47, focuses on the American Academy, which is<strong> </strong>designed to work against higher ed institutions that are \u201cturning our students into communists and terrorists and sympathizers of many, many different dimensions\u201d.</p> <p>He says he<strong> </strong>would tax, fine and sue private university endowments, which fund those universities, and use the money to create this academy. It would offer a \u201cfree world-class education\u201d without adding to the federal debt, he claims, by offering online courses that then give credentials that the federal government and contractors would be required to recognize, and grant people the \u201cequivalent\u201d of a bachelor\u2019s degree.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be strictly non-political and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed,\u201d Trump said in the video.</p> <h2>Overhauling accreditation</h2>  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-protecting-students-from-the-radical-left-and-marxist-maniacs-infecting-educational-institutions\">another video</a>, Trump<strong> </strong>refers to the accreditation system as the \u201csecret weapon\u201d for overhauling higher ed. Accreditors basically oversee colleges and programs to ensure they meet educational standards, a form of industry self-regulation.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump hates the state of higher education in the US so much that he wants to start a new online university that will dole out bachelor\u2019s degrees free of charge to challenge existing colleges. Trump has also vowed to \u201cdeport pro-Hamas radicals and make our college campuses safe and patriotic again\u201d. He wants to dramatically alter the accreditation process that ensures colleges meet set standards, opening the door for programs that currently do not. These are just a few of Trump\u2019s ideas for overhauling colleges and universities \u2013 frequent targets of rightwing campaigns that view them as incubators for leftist ideology. Many of Trump\u2019s higher ed proposals involve driving out these perceived ideas. What is Trump proposing? Trump\u2019s higher education platform isn\u2019t terribly detailed; it is composed mostly of one-liners that propose, for instance, to \u201cMake Colleges and Universities Sane and Affordable\u201d. He has, however, suggested what would be a seismic change to higher education: the dismantling of the US Department of Education, which helps distribute federal financial aid to college students. It would take congressional approval to shutter the agency, something Republicans haven\u2019t been able to achieve despite saying for decades they want to close it. His allies have proposed policies with more meat on the bones. Project 2025, the conservative blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation, includes ways to peel back protections for LGBTQ+ students, \u201crestore due process\u201d for people accused of assault and harassment on campus, and curtail student loan forgiveness. If implemented fully, the conservative changes for higher education under Trump would be monumental. What is \u2018American Academy\u2019? One videoin Trump\u2019s platform, dubbed Agenda47, focuses on the American Academy, which is designed to work against higher ed institutions that are \u201cturning our students into communists and terrorists and sympathizers of many, many different dimensions\u201d. He says he would tax, fine and sue private university endowments, which fund those universities, and use the money to create this academy. It would offer a \u201cfree world-class education\u201d without adding to the federal debt, he claims, by offering online courses that then give credentials that the federal government and contractors would be required to recognize, and grant people the \u201cequivalent\u201d of a bachelor\u2019s degree. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed,\u201d Trump said in the video. Overhauling accreditation In another video, Trump refers to the accreditation system as the \u201csecret weapon\u201d for overhauling higher ed. Accreditors basically oversee colleges and programs to ensure they meet educational standards, a form of industry self-regulation. But some conservatives claim the process is weaponized and overly burdensome. Trump calls accreditors a failure and says he will \u201cfire the radical left accreditors that have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist maniacs and lunatics\u201d. He will then seek new accreditors that will create standards that include \u201cdefending the American tradition and western civilization, protecting free speech, eliminating wasteful administrative positions that drive up costs incredibly, removing all Marxist diversity, equity, and inclusion bureaucrats\u201d and more. Last month, the Guardian published video of a meeting between the House majority leader, Steve Scalise, and the pro-Israel lobby group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), in which Scalise detailed plans to pull billions of dollars of federal funding from some of the most prestigious universities in the country, and to strip them of accreditation to punish them for allowing pro-Palestinian protests on their campuses. Weaponizing civil rights law Trump said he will use the Department of Justice to file civil rights cases against colleges that \u201cengage in racial discrimination\u201d. The justice department pursues discrimination cases regularly now, but the Republican president-elect says he would go after schools with diversity, equity and inclusion practices \u2013 what he calls \u201cexplicit unlawful discrimination under the guise of equity\u201d \u2013 and schools allowing pro-Palestinian protests on their campuses. He also mentions ending programs that research mis- and disinformation. \u201cWe need to break up the entire toxic censorship industry that has arisen under the false guise of tackling so-called mis- and disinformation,\u201d he said.

Why are Ajax still be banging on about playing the game the right way?</p> <p>Often it makes little sense. A mood transmitted from the fans, perhaps? A culture passed on from player to player, director to director? Something in the very air around the stadium? But occasionally there are times when it\u2019s perfectly obvious why a club is the way it is, why it is apparently locked in a cycle of otherwise inexplicable behaviour. <em><strong>Real Madrid</strong></em> act like Real Madrid because the club\u2019s president is, as he has been for all but three years since 2000, Florentino P\u00e9rez. And there is nothing P\u00e9rez likes more than a famous, expensive footballer.</p> <p>Post-Covid, as the whole of European football felt a financial pinch, Madrid seemed to have changed. The club made a series of wise transfers, buying players on the way up.

They still had development to come and, by doing so together, seemed to be developing, with Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Rodrygo and Fede Valverde, a mutually compatible style. P\u00e9rez dropped <em><strong>Kylian Mbapp\u00e9</strong></em> into this blend, which is starting to resemble events from the summer of 2003, when he bought David Beckham but sold Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 and destroyed the balance of the side.</p> <p>Madrid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/29/real-madrid-ballon-dor-vinicius-rodri\">boycotted this year\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or ceremony</a> after it became apparent Vin\u00edcius wasn\u2019t going win. Which does rather demand the question of why, if they regard it as such an outrage that Rodri was preferred to Vin\u00edcius, they brought in a player who plays in the same position as him and has very similar characteristics, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/68346321\">for a huge signing-on fee</a>. Vin\u00edcius likes to play on the left. He can go long spells without being involved in the game. But he has ferocious pace, great skill and imagination and is a brilliant and unusual finisher. Just like Mbapp\u00e9.</p> <p>Last season the balance of the forward line seemed perfect. Bellingham played centrally but dropped deep, creating space for Vin\u00edcius from the left or Rodrygo from the right to swoop into. Add Mbapp\u00e9 into that and the result is a mess. Bellingham scored 19 times in 28 league matches last season; his goal against Osasuna on 9 November was his first for Real this season, as he has been forced to operate deeper. Rodrygo has ended up being nudged out, essentially for not being famous enough, while Mbapp\u00e9, although he has scored six league goals, has cut a frustrated figure for a team who have lost ground to Barcelona in La Liga and are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague/table\">off to a mediocre start</a> to their Champions League title defence.</p> <p>Mbapp\u00e9 is, of course, a player of astonishing gifts, not just technically exceptional, but impossibly fast with it. Watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/30/france-argentina-world-cup-last-16-match-report\">him tear Argentina apart</a> at the 2018 World Cup was viscerally thrilling. He was only 19 at the time but seemed astoundingly mature. There appeared no limit to what he might achieve. Since then, he\u2019s remained frozen in potential. Paris Saint-Germain, a club where he was rarely challenged and had enormous political clout, was a move almost destined to stunt his development.</p> <p>In that squad, in that league, with his talent, he could essentially do what he wanted. It was all very easy for him and the result was that, in big games, he was often involved only fleetingly, if at all. It has been a similar story for France. In the 2022 World Cup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/14/france-morocco-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\">semi-final</a> and final, he had to be moved off his preferred left flank into the centre because of his refusal to track the opposing right-back. He did, eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/18/world-cup-final-argentina-france-match-report\">turn it on in the final</a> \u2013 although his hat-trick comprised two penalties and a stunning volley \u2013 but had he not been so disengaged, Argentina might not already have been 2-0 up.</p> <p>Mbapp\u00e9 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/07/kylian-mbappe-left-out-france-nations-league-squad-deschamps-talks\">is now out of the France squad</a> as he goes through what his national coach Didier Deschamps termed \u201ca difficult period\u201d that has \u201ca physical element and a psychological one\u201d. The break, perhaps, will do him good; certainly it\u2019s easy enough to understand why players should need time off given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/04/the-overstuffed-football-calendar-is-reducing-quality-but-increasing-drama\">the relentless nature of the calendar</a>. He\u2019s scored only once in his last eight games but, worse than that, he seemed entirely unable to work out how to deal with Barcelona\u2019s high line in the Cl\u00e1sico, being caught offside eight times.</p> <p>The fear must be that his time in Paris, when he was challenged so rarely, has blunted his edge so he has forgotten how to solve problems on the pitch. Hopefully for him \u2013 and for football \u2013 it will return. But his case does show the potential problems \u2013 even for the most talented players \u2013 if they choose the wrong club.

UK consumer confidence has fallen this month, as households report that their current finances continued to deteriorate in November, while pessimism about the financial outlooks for the year ahead has risen. Britain and the United States have signed a new agreement for civil nuclear collaboration at the COP29 summit, that could speed up the development of new technologies. Thames Water has \u00a323bn of assets that are in urgent need of repair and the supply of water to its 16 million customers is \u201con a knife-edge\u201d, a Guardian investigation has found Sources have also warned that Thames Water\u2019s IT \u2018falling apart\u2019 and is being hit by cyber-attacks. Economists at the CEBR have calculated that Donald Trump could wipe 1% off the UK economy by imposing new import tariffs. The rise in UK employment costs is going to hit growth and wages next year, Goldman Sachs have forecast. UK households will also face a 1% rise in energy bills in January, when the price cap is next changed, analysts at Cornwall Insight have calculated. The average asking price on a UK home has dropped by more than \u00a35,000 this month as the autumn budget caused housing market jitters. US budget airline Spirit has filed for bankruptcy protection. Britain and the United States have signed a new agreement to collaborate on civil nuclear technology at the COP29 summit. The agreement, signed by UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband and US Deputy Secretary of Energy David Turk today, aims to pool billions in research funds and share information on advanced nuclear technologies. The goal is to speed up the development of new technologies, such as advanced modular reactors, to help decarbonise industry and boost energy security. The new agreement will come into force from 1 March 2025. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband says: \u201cNuclear will play a vital role in our clean energy future. \u201cThat is why we are working closely with our allies to unleash the potential of cutting-edge nuclear technology. \u201cAdvanced nuclear technology will help decarbonise industry by providing low-carbon heat and power, supporting new jobs and investment here in the UK.\u201d The UK government says the agreement builds on a pledge made last year at COP28 to triple nuclear energy capacity globally by 2050. It expects this new agreement will also be signed by Canada, France, Japan, Republic of Korea, Republic of South Africa, China, Euratom, Switzerland and Australia. You can track the latest action at COP 29 here: The owners of Scotland\u2019s only oil refinery, which is scheduled to close next summer, have reportedly rejected a US-led approach about a possible bid. A consortium said to be led by Robert McKee, an American energy industry veteran, wrote to Petroineos, the owner of the Grangemouth site, to express an interest in buying it, according to Sky News. But the approach has been rejected by Petroineos, which is 50%-owned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s petrochemicals empire. The consortium is understood to comprise The Canal Group, which is reportedly developing a green energy refinery in Texas, and Trading Stack, a Middle East-based commodities trader, Sky say. Petroineos is planning to shut Grangemouth by the end of June next year, a move that could cost 500 employees their jobs. Thames Water\u2019s IT systems are in the spotlight again today, with sources telling the Guardian they are so antiquated they have been easy for cybercriminals to attack. My colleague Anna Isaac reports: \u201cThe software we use is older than me, and some of the hardware is older than my dad,\u201d says Siddharth*. He is one of a team fighting a daily battle to sustain ancient IT infrastructure at Thames Water. Sometimes the defences are breached. Thames, the UK\u2019s largest water and waste treatment company, is on a \u201cknife-edge\u201d according to sources, with its resilience in doubt because it depends on an array of creaking \u2013 often Victorian \u2013 infrastructure. While plenty of attention has been paid to its pipes, trunk mains and sewage overflows, less well understood is another big problem: its computer systems. Some IT systems date back to the 1980s, and have long been declared obsolete. More here: *Names have been changed Trading has begun cautiously on Wall Street. The S&amp;P 500 stock index has inched up by 4 points to 5,874, a gain of less than 0.1%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq is 0.2% higher. Tesla are among the top risers, up over 7% following reports that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team are planning to make a federal framework to regulate self-driving vehicles a top priority for the U.S. Transport Department (see earlier post). Nvidia is a leading faller, down 2.5%, after reports of overheating snags with its Blackwell chip (see earlier post). Top European Central Bank policymakers are concerned that new US tariffs could hurt growth. ECB vice-president Luis de Guindos told an event in Frankfurt that trade tensions could damage Europe\u2019s economy, saying: \u201cThe balance of macro-risks has shifted from concerns about high inflation to fears over economic growth. The growth outlook is clouded by uncertainty about economic policies and the geopolitical landscape, both in the euro area and globally. Trade tensions could rise further, increasing the risk of tail events materialising.\u201d Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel is also concerned, telling an event in Tokyo that tariffs promised by Trump would upend international trade. However, Nagel was not too concerned that they could push up inflation, saying: \u201cGlobal integration would have to decrease substantially to cause a noticeable rise in inflationary pressures. \u201cAnd, so far, we have not seen this.\u201d Shares in Nvidia are down almost 2% in premarket trading, on reports of an overheating problem with its new Blackwell chips. Website The Information reported yesterday that the Blackwell graphics processing units \u2013 designed to be used in artificial intelligence systems \u2013 has an overheating problem when connected together in Nvidia\u2019s customised server racks. Nvidia has reportedly asked its suppliers to change the design of the racks \u201cseveral times\u201d as it tries to overcome the problem. More here. Blackwell, launched earlier this year, is targetted at datacentres that train AI models such as the latest generations of GPT, Claude and Gemini, and which run AI chatbots. Revolut, Britain\u2019s most valuable fintech firm, has been granted a UK trading licence by the FCA. The decision will allow Revolut to offer new trading products and features for UK customers next year, thought to include trading of UK and EU stocks and ETFs. Until now, Revolut has operated its Trading feature in the UK as \u201can Appointed Representative with a Principal\u201d, meaning it could allow retail customers to buy and sell shares listed in the US. Yana Shkrebenkova, Head of Wealth and Trading UK at Revolut, explains: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a significant milestone for Revolut Trading. Having launched our successful investment product five years ago, we strive to bring best in class investment products to our customers in the UK. We know that there is so much more our Revolut Trading customers want from our platform and we are working hard to deliver on this, rolling out new features safely and considerately. Revolut was granted a UK banking licence \u2013 with \u201crestrictions\u201d \u2013 in July, after a three-year wrangle with regulators. Bitcoin is slipping back from its recent record highs today. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency is down 2% today, at $89,000, away from the record high of almost $93,500 set last week. The dip comes after a dormant bitcoin wallet that had been inactive for 14 years sprung into life last week. Some 2,000 bitcoin, worth almost $180m, were moved from the wallet. The sudden activity caused a lot of excitement in crypto circles, as its last transaction took place in 2010 \u2013 when one bitcoin was worth less than a dollar. Bitcoin has been on quite the rally in the last fortnight; it was trading below $70,000 on 5 November, the day of the US election, but started rallying once Donald Trump\u2019s victory was clear. Bill Blain, market strategist at Wind Shift Capital, suggests Bitcoin may have been experiencing \u201ca classic greater fool moment\u201d, saying: As Bitcoin soars 30%, there are signs long-term holders\u2019 wallets are being opened to sell as new buyers are persuaded to pile-in on stories about deregulation, crypto as an asset, and the usual get rich scams. Classic pump and dump. Shares in Tesla have jumped almost 7% in pre-market trading, following a report that Donald Trump\u2019s administration could ease US rules for self-driving cars. According to Bloomberg, the Trump team plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department\u2019s priorities, As Bloomberg point out, that\u2019s good news for leading Trump supporter Elon Musk: If new rules enable cars without human controls, it will directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who\u2019s become a powerful fixture in the president-elect\u2019s inner circle. He\u2019s bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.

The Czech Republic\u2019s top central banker is concerned that consumer prices around the worlw will be more volatile than in the past. This will mean tighter monetary and fiscal policies than before to keep inflation near target, Czech central bank Governor Ales Michl believes. In remarks posted on the Czech National Bank\u2019s website on Monday, Michl says: After a period of high inflation, we are now entering a phase of higher inflation volatility around central bank targets, with an upside risk. Michl argued that there had been excessive money creation in the run-up to the Covid-19 pandemic, because interest rates were kept near zero for over a decade after the financial crisis. He told a central banking conference in Mexico City: This has led to persistent inflationary pressures. To address this, the policy mix should consist of two elements: firstly, maintaining interest rates higher than pre-COVID levels for a prolonged period; and secondly, governments must balance their budgets. Failure to do so could risk a second wave of inflation, with another cost shock potentially acting as a trigger. Donald Trump\u2019s immigration pledges may be the real macro threat to economic growth, rather than tariffs, suggests Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics. Shearing told clients: As the dust settles on Donald Trump\u2019s stunning election victory, attention has quickly turned to his policy pledges and their implications for the US economic outlook. Global policymakers and investors are understandably focused on his pledges to raise tariff barriers across the board \u2013 and by significant amounts in some US trading relationships. But the economic hit from efforts to raise trade barriers isn\u2019t likely to be as large as many fear. The major threat from Donald Trump\u2019s pledges will instead come from his stated intention to remove millions of migrant workers from the US. One of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders, Vistry Group, still reeling from two profit warnings, is also under pressure from shareholders over its boss\u2019s multiple roles and corporate governance concerns. Greg Fitzgerald, Vistry\u2019s chief executive, also chairs the company, which breaches corporate governance code guidance. It means he is running both the business and the board of directors. At the company\u2019s last general meeting in May, Fitzgerald\u2019s re-election was only backed by 79.3% of shareholders - with more than a fifth voting against or abstaining. Vistry, formerly known as Bovis Homes, said in a statement today: \u201cThe board has actively engaged with shareholders both before and after the AGM in respect of a range of corporate governance matters and has a detailed understanding of shareholder views. The board understands that the primary concerns from some shareholders was in relation to the combination of the role of the CEO and chair, which was a departure from the UK Corporate Governance Code.\u201d The housebuilder said it had appointed a senior independent director, Rob Woodward, to \u201cprovide additional oversight on governance matters and serve as an alternative point of communication for investors and the other non-executive directors\u201d. He has held a series of calls with shareholders to discuss corporate governance. Vistry said the results of an external assessment of the combined role of CEO and chair will be published in is 2024 annual report. It said that through the process, shareholders \u201chave expressed different perspectives\u201d. \u201cThe company remains committed to ongoing dialogue with shareholders and will continue to engage to ensure that the company understands shareholders\u2019 views and is able to consider feedback, as well as to provide clarity on the company\u2019s approach to succession planning going forward.\u201d It is not only Fitzgerald\u2019s combined role that has raised eyebrows. He owns a 40% stake in the Devon-based developer Baker Estates and has banked \u00a35.2m in the past three years, while also owning shares in Ardent Hire, which supplies forklift trucks to Vistry, according to the Sunday Times. Corporate governance experts have raised concerns about Fitzgerald\u2019s multiple roles and stakes in related companies, raising potential conflicts of interest, and \u201cinadequate disclosures\u201d by Vistry, according to the paper. A Perth-headquartered goldminer has agreed to give the equivalent of \u00a3130m \u2013 more than its entire cash reserves \u2013 to the government of Mali after its chief executive and two other employees were detained by authorities in the West African country. Resolute Mining CEO Terence Holohan and the other two employees \u2013 all British citizens \u2013 were unexpectedly detained on 8 November in Mali\u2019s capital of Bamako, at the conclusion of a meeting with government mining and tax officials. The meeting was to progress what Resolute described as unsubstantiated open claims against the company regarding taxes, custom levies, maintenance and management of offshore accounts. To resolve the matter, Resolute said on Monday it had paid Mali $80m out of its $157m in cash reserves, and promised to pay another $80m more in coming months. Britain\u2019s financial watchdog has banned a company director after he failed to tell them he had been imprisoned for grievous bodily harm. The Financial Conduct Authority has banned Ari Harris from working in financial services, following his failure to disclose he had been jailed for three years in 2022. Harris, the FCA says, stabbed a man twice in the neck with a kitchen knife in 2018, during a confrontation in a public carpark, and pleaded guilty to GBH. He, and his firm Reeds Motors, should have notified the FCA of his offending, conviction and custodial sentence. Instead, the regulator, says they provided false and misleading information to cover up the fact that he was in prison. In a ruling today, the FCA says: Following an application in October 2022, the FCA asked the firm why it needed an additional approved person. Both Mr Harris and the firm stated that this was required as Mr Harris was currently overseas and looking into a business abroad. Mr Harris continued to mislead the FCA during a telephone call, failing to mention that he was actually in prison at the time. The FCA has concluded that there is \u201ca severe risk of an erosion of public confidence\u201d if those who are convicted of violent offences and who \u201clack honesty, integrity and reputation\u201d are permitted to continue working in the financial services industry. Over in the US, Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection today after being dragged down by mounting debts and losses. Spirit, which has been struggling to recover from the drop in travel demand caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, has announced it is entering Chapter 11 proceedings as part of a debt restructuring deal. Spirit, the biggest budget airline. in the US, has lost more than $2.5bn since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1bn, Associated Press reports. The company has reassured customers it will continue operating while the restructuring is conducted, telling them: We are writing to let you know about a proactive step Spirit has taken to position the company for success. Spirit has entered into an agreement with our bondholders that is expected to reduce our total debt, provide increased financial flexibility, position Spirit for long-term success and accelerate investments providing Guests with enhanced travel experiences and greater value. Part of this financial restructuring includes filing a \u201cprearranged\u201d chapter 11. The eurozone\u2019s trade surplus with the rest of the world has widened, partly thanks to a drop in imports from the UK. Data firm eurostat has reported that the eurozone recorded a \u20ac12.5bn trade surplus with the rest of the world in September, up from \u20ac9.8bn in September 2023. Eurozone exports rose by 0.6%, to \u20ac237.8bn, while imports from the rest of the world fell by 0.6% to \u20ac225.3bn. While European companies shipped \u20ac28.5bn of goods to the UK, up 2%, there was a 10.7% drop in imports from the UK, to \u20ac13.1bn. Imports from the US, Switzerland, Norway, Japan, India and Brazil also fell year-on-year: The UK government is being urged to \u201cact fast\u201d over the Thames Water crisis, after the Guardian reported that water supplies are \u201con a knife-edge\u201d due to serious underinvestment. Our investigation has found that Thames has failed to tackle serious safety concerns or upgrade vital IT systems, meaning that \u00a323bn of its assets that are in urgent need of repair. It appears Thames is in a worse financial state than previously admitted, and neither its managers nor regulators appear to have grasped the perilous state of some of its reservoirs and pipes. As my colleague Anna Isaac reported: Sources described how concerns about the company\u2019s governance and operations had been raised at the highest levels of management. Yet they claimed that the problems had not been tackled, suggesting that the scale of the turnaround required at Thames may have been underestimated. \u201cOperations have been hollowed out and cut to the bone,\u201d a senior source at Thames said. \u201cWe\u2019re putting the public at risk by failing to invest in the most basic needs.\u201d They added that, in their view, management had not moved quickly enough to address problems such as weakening explosive infrastructure \u2013 such as containers holding the gas produced by sewage \u2013 and cracks in reservoirs. They said Thames\u2019s management and the regulator, Ofwat, had been slow to address these problems, allowing them to escalate. Gary Carter, GMB National Officer, says Thames\u2019s previous owners have left it \u201cin a perilous state\u201d (it has \u00a315bn of debt), adding that ministers should be ready to put it into a special administration regime if new investment isn\u2019t agreed: \u201cThames needs committed long term investment just to keep operating, never mind stop the leaks and cut the sewage spills. \u201cThen it must be held to account and deliver for customers, with its skilled workforce central to the turnaround. If that investment isn\u2019t forthcoming then the Government must act fast and put Thames into special administration. Ministers can\u2019t sit back and watch the car crash.\u201d UK consumer confidence has fallen this month, as households grow gloomier about their financial prospects. The latest poll of consumer sentiment, just released by data firm S&amp;P Global, shows that households reported that their current finances continued to deteriorate in November, while pessimism about the financial outlooks for the year ahead has risen. Households across the UK reported further pressure on their everyday spending, which ate into the amount of cash they had available to spend. It has fallen again this month, at a faster rate than in October. Debt levels rose in November for the first time in three months, the survey found. A gauge of job security also declined, which could be driven by the increase in employer National Insurance contributions announced in the Budget. The poll shows that the budget, at the end of October, has not lifted confidence among households. Worryingly, confidence dropped this month despite the Bank of England cutting interest rates two weeks ago, just as S&amp;P Global began polling households. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: \u201cNovember is seeing households grow somewhat gloomier again, failing to build on the underlying improvement seen in the months leading up to the General Election. Consumer confidence has fallen back since spiking higher in July amid the election buzz, as ongoing pressure on household finances has resulted in squeezed spending, higher debt and lower savings. A key concern going forward will be the labour market. Rising incomes and busier workplaces have underpinned much of the improvement in consumer sentiment over the past two years, but job security is showing signs of waning. Any intensification of job worries, spurred perhaps the recent measures announced in the Budget, including higher employer National Insurance contributions, could result in a further loss of consumer confidence. This would likely in turn hit consumer spending and economic growth. Analysts at Goldman Sachs have predicted that the increase in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions will weigh on the economy in 2025. In their outlook for the UK economy next year, just released, Goldman say they think growth is likely to cool later in 2025. They believe that wage growth will slow, as firms pass on the impact of higher NICS bills onto their workforce. Goldman say: We expect consumer spending growth to moderate in H2 next year as real disposable income growth falls back. This partly reflects slowing real wage growth; we expect private sector pay increases to cool, partly because of the employer National Insurance Contributions increase being passed on to consumers. Net interest is likely to become a headwind as effective mortgage rates continue to drift up while deposit rates gradually decline. And there is likely to be a continued drag on disposable income from the ongoing freeze on personal income tax thresholds. Trade tensions under the Trump administration will also hurt the UK economy next year, Goldman predict, even if Britain avoids tough new tariffs. They say: Although our base case is that the US only imposes very limited tariffs on the UK, the threat of more significant tariffs is likely to generate uncertainty in the near term, which should weigh on demand. And we expect that uncertainty around tariffs will notably reduce Euro area growth, which is likely to generate spillovers to the UK. Begbies Traynor also reveals that their employment costs are expected to rise by \u00a31.25m due to the increase in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions. The company is \u201creviewing options to mitigate the impact where possible\u201d. The higher employment costs announced in last month\u2019s budget are likely to push more companies into financial trouble, insolvency advisers Begbies Traynor warned this morning. Begbies Traynor also cautioned that firms will be hurt by the prospect that UK borowing costs remain high for longer than hoped. In a trading update, Ric Traynor, executive chairman of Begbies Traynor Group, told the City: \u201cAdditional headwinds for UK business from increased employment costs and the prospect of higher for longer interest rates are likely to extend the period of elevated insolvency levels, increasing the need for advice and support from our insolvency and business recovery professionals.\u201d Begbies has already been busy; it has reported a 16% increase in revenues and adjusted pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of October. Ric Traynor says: \u201cWe have made a very good start to the year with double digit growth in revenue and profits driven by positive momentum across the group. This gives us confidence that we will deliver market expectations for the year as a whole. Reeves\u2019s decision to raise employers\u2019 national insurance contributions (NICs) has been criticised by retailers, especially in the services sector, and disability charities. The UK minimum wage is also increasing from April. Marks &amp; Spencer have warned that budget measures could cost it more than \u00a360m next year, while Sainsbury\u2019s expects to pay another \u00a3140m in NICs, which could push up prices on the shelves. The Bank of England expects interest rates to fall more slowly, as inflation is likely to be higher due to the measures in the Budget. Donald Trump could knock almost 1% off the size of the UK economy if he imposes new tariffs on imports into the US, analysts have warned. The CEBR thinktank have calculated that if the US imposes a 20% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tafiff on China, it could reduce the UK economy by 0.9% by the end of the Trump administration, even if other countries don\u2019t retaliate. The CEBR cautions that Trump\u2019s re-election could reshape global dynamics, \u201cparticularly in trade, energy, and environmental policy\u201d. There is also a risk that energy prices are pushed higher (leading to higher bills) if retaliatory action is taken agaisnt US tariff. The CEBR say: During Trump\u2019s first term, the Brent-WTI price differential peaked at $7.34 per barrel in 2019, roughly a 118% increase from the start of his administration, despite a drive to boost domestic oil and gas production. This was largely driven by buyers\u2019 reluctance to purchase US energy exports. However, shifts in global energy dynamics mean significant oil price rises are less likely this time around. China, once a major importer of US energy commodities, now sources discounted supplies from Russia, while its domestic economic slowdown has dampened its energy demand. OPEC also has spare production capacity, given it is currently implementing an output cut of 2.2 million barrels a day to support prices. The easiest way for the UK to avoid Trump tariffs would be to agree to a Free Trade Agreement, the CEBR adds. This could reduce existing trade barriers, as well as dodging new tariffs. CEBR adds: Unfortunately, the major sticking point to a deal remains food standards, and tariffs may be used to pressure the UK to accept US demands in this regard. Last weekend, one of Trump\u2019s senior advisers said the UK \u201chas to choose\u201d between the European Union and US economic models, and that the next president would be more willing to clinch a free trade agreement with the UK if it turns away from the EU\u2019s \u201csocialism\u201d. Today\u2019s prediction that energy prices for those on default tariffs will rise again in January are another kick in the teeth for households, says Richard Neudegg, director of regulation at Uswitch.com. \u201cThis price hike would mean the average household on a standard variable tariff would pay 1% more on their rates from January, just at the time when households typically use the most energy. \u201cThe price cap is supposed to protect consumers, but millions face paying more during the coldest months of the year. Neudegg adds that customers can fix their bills below January\u2019s predicted price cap level*, saying: \u201cThere are now a range of fixed deals available that are significantly cheaper than the predicted price cap for January, so it is well worth running a comparison to see how much you could save. Right now, the average household could save up to \u00a3120 per year against the current price cap by switching to a fixed deal. \u201cConsumers who are worried about paying their energy bill should check what energy help they are eligible for, and contact their supplier who may be able to offer support.\u201d * \u2013 reminder: Cornwall Insight expect prices to drop in April and October, when the quarterly cap changes again. The oil price is rising this morning, after the conflict between Russia and Ukraine intensified last weekend. Brent crude, the international benchmark, is up 0.3% at $71.26 per barrel, having hit its lowest level since the start of October on Friday. The rise follows the fierce missile and drone attack launched by Russia last weekend at Ukraine\u2019s energy grid, which killed seven people and forced nationwide electricity rationing to be introduced today. Ukrenergo, Ukraine\u2019s principal energy supplier, said blackouts and consumption restrictions would be introduced \u201cin all regions\u201d as engineers tried to repair as much of the damage to power facilities as possible. Russia has also accused Joe Biden\u2019s administration of \u201ctrying to escalate the situation to the maximum\u201d, after the White House lifted the ban on Ukraine using long-range missiles to fire into Russian territory yesterday. Here\u2019s the details of Cornwall Insight\u2019s forecasts for Britain\u2019s energy price cap from January. This morning\u2019s prediction of a small rise in energy bills in January will be \u201cdisappointing\u201d, says Dr Craig Lowrey, Principal Consultant at Cornwall Insight, especially as the weather gets chillier. \u201cOur final price cap forecast for January indicates, as expected, bills will remain largely unchanged from October. Supply concerns have kept the market as volatile as earlier in the year, and additional charges have remained relatively stable, so prices have stayed flat. While we may have seen this coming, the news that prices will not drop from the rises in the Autumn will still be disappointing to many as we move into the colder months. \u201cFuel poverty has occupied political agendas for years, with little long-term progress. This winter, millions of households say they will not heat their homes to recommended temperatures, risking serious health consequences. With it being widely accepted that high prices are here to stay, we need to see action. Options like social tariffs, adjustments to price caps, benefit restructuring, or other targeted support for vulnerable households must be seriously considered. \u201cLong-term, our transition away from the volatile global wholesale market toward sustainable, home-produced renewables can help to secure our energy future. Although the transition does require upfront investment, it promises lower bills down the line. The government needs to keep momentum on the transition while acknowledging that immediate support is essential for those struggling now. Inaction is a choice to leave people in the cold.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Household energy bills across Great Britain are set to rise at the start of next year, analysts predict, putting more pressure on household finances. Officially, the price cap for January-March 2025 will be set on Friday morning by regulator Ofgem, limiting what energy providers can charge in England, Scotland and Wales. But analysts at Cornwall Insight have crunched the numbers, and predict that the cap for a typical dual fuel household will rise to \u00a31,736 per annum in January, up from the current level of \u00a31,717 per year set in October. This is a rise of 1% from the current price cap \u2013 a blow to hopes that bills might drop at the start of 2025. Importantly, though, the cap limits the amount that a consumer can be charged for each unit of energy \u2013 not a ceiling on potential bills, which are usually higher in the winter as households spend more to keep warm. Cornwall Insight, whose calculations are based on the wholesale price of energy, say: The cap level is a reflection of a relatively volatile wholesale market, influenced by supply concerns tied to geopolitical tensions, maintenance on Norwegian gas infrastructure, weather disruptions, amongst other smaller factors. Despite prices stabilising in comparison to the past two years, the market remains very sensitive to global events. This is leaving prices substantially above historic averages. At the end of September, Cornwall had expected the price cap would dip in January, but wholesale energy prices have been higher than hoped. Last Friday, the month-ahead price of UK gas rose to a one-year high of almost 120p per therm. Gas prices rose last week, after Austrian group OMV warned of a potential disruption to supplies from Russia. On Saturday, Gazprom did indeed stop supplies to Austria, after OMV won a \u20ac230m arbitration award against Russia\u2019s state-owned natural gas company. Looking further ahead, Cornwall currently forecast the cap will drop slightly in April 2025 and again in October 2025.

      "body": "<p>Throughout the UN climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan, in recent days, US officials have maintained a studiously sunny disposition, saying that the Republican president-elect, Donald Trump, will not derail climate progress.</p> <p>The US climate envoy, John Podesta, said the fight \u201cfor a cleaner, safer\u201d planet will not stop under a re-elected Trump even if some progress is reversed. The energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, said: \u201cThe absence of leadership in the White House does not mean that this energy transition is stopped.\u201d And Joe Biden\u2019s climate and energy assistant, Jacob Levine, told reporters that the president\u2019s climate policies had sparked an unstoppable clean energy \u201crevolution\u201d.</p> <p>In the absence of federal climate policy, they have argued, states will continue the push to zero out emissions. And the historic climate-related subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act, they have said, will continue to spur decarbonization efforts from the private sector. On Monday, US officials reinforced this view with a <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/mesc/reports\">plan</a> for continued private sector-led emissions reduction in manufacturing.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change won\u2019t be solved by one president, but climate action will not be stopped by one president,\u201d the Massachusetts senator Ed Markey told reporters on Saturday.</p> <p>Decarbonization, Markey said, was even taking place in Republican states, thanks to Biden\u2019s green subsidies. \u201cThe green revolution is blue and red,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Republicans have come to Cop29 with a different message. In a sometimes surreal Saturday press conference where they cracked jokes about US sports teams before an international audience, four Republican members of Congress aggressively argued for increasing oil and gas production; even coal, they argued, should maintain its place in the energy system.</p> <p>\u201cWith technology, we can solve a lot of these problems without just banning fossil fuels,\u201d said Representative Morgan Griffith, who represents a coal country district in Virginia. \u201cAn area that has natural resources should not be penalized for not looking at the opportunity to have a cleaner world.\u201d</p> <p>Representative August Pfluger, whose Texas district covers the oil-rich Permian Basin, said Trump\u2019s re-election indicates an \u201coverwhelming support\u201d for the former president\u2019s call to \u201crestore America\u2019s energy dominance and lead the world in energy expansion\u201d.</p> <p>And when asked by the Guardian in the halls of Cop29 if he would support Trump\u2019s pledge to pull the US out of the Paris agreement, Pfluger responded by talking about energy: \u201cWe definitely want to see affordable, reliable energy provided throughout the world.</p> <p>\u201cInflation has been very difficult on people, and we have to take a realistic look about the types of energy and the innovation for energy freedom throughout the world,\u201d said Pfluger, who is leading the House of Representatives\u2019 delegation to the UN climate summit. \u201cMany countries would say that some of the tenets [in the accord] have actually been a massive competitive disadvantage and have pushed up prices everywhere around the world.\u201d</p> <p>In the weeks leading up to his second inauguration, Trump appears to have doubled down on his crusade against climate action. This week, he tapped a former fracking executive to head up his energy department, a Republican who arranged an infamous meeting between Trump and oil bosses to lead his interior department, and a former congressman who has a score of just 14% from the League of Conservation Voters to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.</p> <p>Still, Democratic officials at Cop29 say that the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy incentives and tax breaks are durable.</p> <p>At Saturday\u2019s press conference, Pfluger did indicate that Congress would probably preserve some of its provisions. \u201cIf there are pieces of the IRA that help support lowering American energy costs, helping Americans, helping our partners and allies have access to affordable, reliable energy, then I bet that those will stay in place,\u201d Pfluger said.</p> <p>But the US should include fossil fuels in a \u201cbest of the above\u201d energy strategy, said Republican Michigan representative John James at the press conference. And the overall strategy, he said, should be \u201cinnovation, not regulation\u201d.</p> <p>Harjeet Singh, a director at the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, a proposed agreement for a concrete phaseout of coal, oil, and gas, attributed the Republicans\u2019 message to a \u201ctoxic alliance between polluting corporations and complicit political leaders.\u201d</p> <p>A key aim for Cop29 negotiators is to establish a new and expanded global goal for climate finance to help poor countries cope with disasters and draw down their emissions. Over the weekend, the White House <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/11/17/fact-sheet-president-biden-marks-historic-climate-legacy-with-trip-to-brazils-amazon-rainforest/\">announced</a> that the US surpassed its goal of providing $11bn a year in climate financing.</p> <p>Trump during his first term proposed eliminating the US\u2019s climate finance commitments, but was shot down by the Senate.</p> <p>When asked on Saturday if he would support zeroing out US climate aid, Pfluger deflected, but did not rule out the possibility. \u201cWhat we want to do \u2026 is to unleash American energy, to unleash innovation throughout the world that benefits in a connected world from affordable clean reliable energy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Climate finance, he said, should only go to projects that focus on slashing energy costs. \u201cIf something is not congruent or not in support of lowering energy costs while reducing emissions, you can bet that this Congress is going to look at that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>International leaders at Cop29 have railed against Trump\u2019s stance against climate action and his pledge to exit the Paris agreement.

The two babies were treated at Khartoum\u2019s Bashair teaching hospital. \u201cCases like this are common,\u201d said Dr Moeen*, who works with MSF at the hospital. \u201cThankfully, that little girl survived. Others are not so lucky.\u201d Bashair teaching hospital treated 314 children under the age of 15 for wounds from gunshots or blasts this year \u2013 about one in six of all war-wounded patients received at the hospital. The baby girl was one of 12 children rushed to the hospital after an explosion at a nearby market. But the hospital\u2019s capacity is limited \u2013 severe burns cannot be treated, and surgeries are stalled because the lack of access provided by the warring sides means supplies have not been received for more than a year. The city has been carved up by the Sudanese Armed Forces and the rival Rapid Support Forces paramilitary since April 2023, with civilians unable to cross frontlines to seek out food, medicine or healthcare \u2013 or simply escape the gunfire and explosions. This meant that when an 18-month-old boy named Riyad arrived with a 50% chance of survival after being hit by a bullet while sleeping, the medical team had to fight for hours to stabilise him but could not remove the bullet from his chest. Mohammed al-Hammadi, MSF\u2019s field coordinator at the hospital, said that in most cases, patients like Riyad cannot be evacuated because of the divisions in the city. \u201cThe fighting has disrupted daily life, making movement between states, crossing frontline areas, extremely dangerous.

Furthermore, this is a duty under the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/614/contents\">regulations</a>. Where there are any circumstances which give rise to a concern to drinking water, the company are required to notify the inspectorate.</p>    <p>\u201cSimilarly, water company staff are able report matters directly to the inspectorate. In both cases the inspectorate will carry out an investigation and will take action as necessary to maintain the high standard of drinking water in England. The inspectorate carry out a programme of risk-based audits to identify, monitor and verify areas of concern, and take enforcement action based on our <a href=\"https://dwi.gov.uk/what-we-do/enforcement-policy/\">enforcement policies</a>.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Thames Water said: \u201cThe wellbeing and safety of our colleagues and customers is our highest priority.

That\u2019s why we have set out an ambitious plan for 2025-30 which asks for \u00a320.7bn of expenditure and investment with an additional \u00a33bn through gated mechanisms, so that we can meet our customers\u2019 expectations and environmental responsibilities.</p> <p>\u201cFurther, we take our requirements to protect customers\u2019 personal data and maintain essential services extremely seriously. We regularly review our systems to ensure their continued reliability.</p> <p>\u201cWe take a rigorous approach to financial discipline throughout the company in order to operate within budget, as any business in turnaround would be expected to do.\u201d</p> <p>An Ofwat spokesperson said: \u201cThe Guardian has raised a number of serious allegations about Thames Water. We will take action if there is evidence of breach of the company\u2019s obligations.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been pushing Thames Water to make significant improvements in its operational performance and financial resilience for some time. It is, of course, essential that all water companies provide a safe and reliable water supply. The company has made a request for a substantial increase in expenditure, including to address issues of asset health, as part of the current price review process. We are reviewing that request and the supporting information provided, and will announce our final decisions in December.</p> <p>\u201cIn assessing the business case put forward by companies and in our enforcement work, we work closely with other regulators where needed and seek their views. This includes the Drinking Water Inspectorate in regard to security and cyber measures related to water services, and the Health and Safety Executive and National Cyber Security Centre on matters relating to safety and cybersecurity.\u201d<br><br>*<em>Names have been changed</em></p>",

A company source said \u201call sites have stringent security measures in place\u201d and that claims otherwise were \u201cincorrect\u201d. A spokesperson for the Drinking Water Inspectorate said: \u201cThe Drinking Water Inspectorate considers the provision of a continuous, safe supply of clean drinking water to be the highest priority of a water company. Furthermore, this is a duty under the regulations. Where there are any circumstances which give rise to a concern to drinking water, the company are required to notify the inspectorate. \u201cSimilarly, water company staff are able report matters directly to the inspectorate. In both cases the inspectorate will carry out an investigation and will take action as necessary to maintain the high standard of drinking water in England. The inspectorate carry out a programme of risk-based audits to identify, monitor and verify areas of concern, and take enforcement action based on our enforcement policies.\u201d A spokesperson for Thames Water said: \u201cThe wellbeing and safety of our colleagues and customers is our highest priority. We supply 2.6bn litres of water every day, rated among the highest quality of drinking water anywhere in the world. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very open about the \u2018asset deficit\u2019 we face, and the challenges we will have meeting future demand if it\u2019s not addressed. That\u2019s why we have set out an ambitious plan for 2025-30 which asks for \u00a320.7bn of expenditure and investment with an additional \u00a33bn through gated mechanisms, so that we can meet our customers\u2019 expectations and environmental responsibilities. \u201cFurther, we take our requirements to protect customers\u2019 personal data and maintain essential services extremely seriously. We regularly review our systems to ensure their continued reliability. \u201cWe take a rigorous approach to financial discipline throughout the company in order to operate within budget, as any business in turnaround would be expected to do.\u201d An Ofwat spokesperson said: \u201cThe Guardian has raised a number of serious allegations about Thames Water. We will take action if there is evidence of breach of the company\u2019s obligations. \u201cWe have been pushing Thames Water to make significant improvements in its operational performance and financial resilience for some time. It is, of course, essential that all water companies provide a safe and reliable water supply. The company has made a request for a substantial increase in expenditure, including to address issues of asset health, as part of the current price review process. We are reviewing that request and the supporting information provided, and will announce our final decisions in December. \u201cIn assessing the business case put forward by companies and in our enforcement work, we work closely with other regulators where needed and seek their views. This includes the Drinking Water Inspectorate in regard to security and cyber measures related to water services, and the Health and Safety Executive and National Cyber Security Centre on matters relating to safety and cybersecurity.\u201d *Names have been changed",

The Athens-based artist and author James Bridle, who uses they/them pronouns, was announced in June as the recipient of the Schelling Architecture Foundation\u2019s theory prize, awarded every two years, for their \u201coutstanding contributions to architectural theory\u201d. But on Sunday, days before this Wednesday\u2019s awards ceremony in the south-western city of Karlsruhe, Bridle was informed in an email that the foundation\u2019s committee had decided unanimously not to award them the prize because Bridle was among the several thousand authors who signed an open letter calling for a boycott of Israeli cultural institutions. Signatories of the pledge, published on LitHub at the end of October, stated that \u201cwe will not work with Israeli cultural institutions that are complicit or have remained silent observers of the overwhelming oppression of Palestinians\u201d. In a press release, the foundation said Bridle\u2019s signature on the letter was \u201cin direct contradiction\u201d to responsibilities from the \u201cawareness of Germany\u2019s national history\u201d.

I started at three but at that age, I started to work more and more with passion, with love, and with the determination to be as good as possible.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/17/boulter-and-raducanu-stun-canada-for-last-four-spot-in-billie-jean-king-cup\">Boulter and Raducanu stun Canada for last-four spot in Billie Jean King Cup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI am not the kind of guy that I will say: \u2018No, I would not change things,\u2019 because for me it looks arrogant. Of course I would change things, but one thing has been so important for me [is that] I\u2019m going to leave this professional tour with the calm and personal satisfaction that I give my best in almost every single moment.\u201d</p> \n<p>This has been a sobering final season for the 22-time grand slam champion. Having returned from hip surgery in January, Nadal\u2019s hopes of a successful comeback did not materialise, and last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/10/a-difficult-decision-rafael-nadal-announces-retirement-from-tennis-at-38\">he announced his decision to retire</a>. Nadal said he is not mentally burned out but his physical limitations have forced him to finish his career.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf I have to explain the struggle I have had with my body throughout my career, it is not an explanation that will last five minutes,\u201d Nadal said, laughing. \u201cI have had several episodes in my career that have complicated my activity, but I have overcome them. The last injury in Australia forced me to have hip surgery and they had to remove part of my iliopsoas [muscle]. This has not allowed me to compete how I have done for most of my career.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll these problems that I have had during my career have found a solution [or] they have given me windows of being able to play without limitations. Then they came back to me, and that is why I have had so many breaks in my career. I simply feel that I cannot carry out my activity normally and without limitations on a continuous basis.</p> \n<p>\u201cI no longer have windows that allow me to train or compete at 100%. And that is one [injury], but apart from that I have all the others that have not gone away and that are also limiting me. In other words, it is a cocktail that makes me, as many other athletes, have to stop. I see it as something logical for someone who has been working the way I have worked since I was seven or eight years old.\u201d</p> \n<p>M\u00e1laga city council has not taken the task of seeing off Spain\u2019s greatest athlete lightly. Across the road from the Palacio de Deportes, the tournament venue, the city\u2019s athletics stadium is adorned with a huge 2,600m<sup>2</sup> banner reading \u201cGRACIAS, RAFA\u201d alongside an image of the 38-year-old.</p> \n<p>Such is the fanfare and attention around his retirement, the press conference room at the Palacio de Deportes could not accommodate the large audience, leading the ITF to schedule Spain\u2019s pre-tournament press event at a convention room in the player\u2019s hotel, 12 miles away in Fuengirola. The rest of the Spanish team \u2013 Carlos Alcaraz, Marcel Granollers, Pedro Mart\u00ednez and Roberto Bautista Agut \u2013 mostly watched in silence as the vast majority of questions were directed at Nadal.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am not here to retire. I\u2019m here to try to help the team,\u201d said Nadal. \u201cThen it\u2019s of course going to be my last week on the professional tour, but at the end, we are here in a team competition. The most important thing is to try to help the team and to stay all focused on what we have to do, that is play tennis and do it very well, no?\u201d</p> \n<p>The question remains what form Nadal\u2019s participation in his final tournament will take.

      "bodyText": "Rafael Nadal says he is at peace as the Spaniard prepares to end his legendary career at the Davis Cup finals in M\u00e1laga this week. \u201cAt the end, I achieved the most important thing for me, because this day arrived and I am in peace that I gave all that I had,\u201d said Nadal. \u201cI played and I practised since I was seven. I started at three but at that age, I started to work more and more with passion, with love, and with the determination to be as good as possible. \u201cI am not the kind of guy that I will say: \u2018No, I would not change things,\u2019 because for me it looks arrogant. Of course I would change things, but one thing has been so important for me [is that] I\u2019m going to leave this professional tour with the calm and personal satisfaction that I give my best in almost every single moment.\u201d This has been a sobering final season for the 22-time grand slam champion. Having returned from hip surgery in January, Nadal\u2019s hopes of a successful comeback did not materialise, and last month he announced his decision to retire. Nadal said he is not mentally burned out but his physical limitations have forced him to finish his career. \u201cIf I have to explain the struggle I have had with my body throughout my career, it is not an explanation that will last five minutes,\u201d Nadal said, laughing. \u201cI have had several episodes in my career that have complicated my activity, but I have overcome them. The last injury in Australia forced me to have hip surgery and they had to remove part of my iliopsoas [muscle]. This has not allowed me to compete how I have done for most of my career. \u201cAll these problems that I have had during my career have found a solution [or] they have given me windows of being able to play without limitations. Then they came back to me, and that is why I have had so many breaks in my career. I simply feel that I cannot carry out my activity normally and without limitations on a continuous basis. \u201cI no longer have windows that allow me to train or compete at 100%. And that is one [injury], but apart from that I have all the others that have not gone away and that are also limiting me. In other words, it is a cocktail that makes me, as many other athletes, have to stop. I see it as something logical for someone who has been working the way I have worked since I was seven or eight years old.\u201d M\u00e1laga city council has not taken the task of seeing off Spain\u2019s greatest athlete lightly. Across the road from the Palacio de Deportes, the tournament venue, the city\u2019s athletics stadium is adorned with a huge 2,600m2 banner reading \u201cGRACIAS, RAFA\u201d alongside an image of the 38-year-old. Such is the fanfare and attention around his retirement, the press conference room at the Palacio de Deportes could not accommodate the large audience, leading the ITF to schedule Spain\u2019s pre-tournament press event at a convention room in the player\u2019s hotel, 12 miles away in Fuengirola. The rest of the Spanish team \u2013 Carlos Alcaraz, Marcel Granollers, Pedro Mart\u00ednez and Roberto Bautista Agut \u2013 mostly watched in silence as the vast majority of questions were directed at Nadal. \u201cI am not here to retire. I\u2019m here to try to help the team,\u201d said Nadal. \u201cThen it\u2019s of course going to be my last week on the professional tour, but at the end, we are here in a team competition. The most important thing is to try to help the team and to stay all focused on what we have to do, that is play tennis and do it very well, no?\u201d The question remains what form Nadal\u2019s participation in his final tournament will take. The Spanish captain, David Ferrer, will select the team for Tuesday\u2019s quarter-final against the Netherlands. Based on recent results, it seems likely that Alcaraz and Bautista Agut will play singles while Nadal, who has not played competitively since the Olympics, could team up with Granollers in doubles. As he discussed his playing prospects, Nadal also noted that he is unsure whether Roger Federer, his old rival, will make an appearance in M\u00e1laga to support him in the final moments of his glittering career. \u201cMy big farewell would be the joy of winning with everyone,\u201d said Nadal. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I will respond or not. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll play a match or not. I\u2019ve played very little recently. As for Roger\u2019s presence, I don\u2019t know if Federer will come here. He\u2019ll try, but he has a very busy schedule.\u201d",

Commander Dominic Murphy told an inquiry that he believed no warning was issued by public health leaders until after the poisoning of Dawn Sturgess three months later when she sprayed herself with a dose of nerve agent from a fake perfume bottle apparently found in a bin in the city. Murphy\u2019s testimony appears to contradict that of the former chief medical officer for England and Wales, Dame Sally Davies, who said last week she had a \u201cstrong recollection\u201d of a warning being made soon after the attack on Skripal in March 2018, though no record of one can be found.

      "bodyText": "Some of Australia\u2019s most prominent authors are among a group of more than 90 writers and literary supporters who have paid for every federal parliamentarian to receive a carefully curated package of books on the Middle East to expand their knowledge of the history of the conflict. Each of the 227 MPs and senators is being given the same five books \u2013 nonfiction, fiction and reference works \u2013 as part of the campaign to encourage wider reading on the origins of the Middle East conflict among Australia\u2019s political leaders. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Writers including Tim Winton, Charlotte Wood, Michelle de Kretser and JM Coetzee have backed the Summer Reading for MPs campaign which is appealing directly to parliamentarians to deepen their understanding of the complexity of relations in the region. The selection has been endorsed by the Jewish Council of Australia and the Australian Palestine Advocacy Network. They are: Balcony over Jerusalem by journalist John Lyons; A Very Short History of the Israel-Palestine Conflict by Jewish historian and political scientist Ilan Papp\u00e9; The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine by Palestinian American writer and historian Rashid Khalidi; Palestine A-Z, an alphabetised list of definitions and common terms by Irish writer Kate Thompson; and The Sunbird, a novella by Lebanese Australian author Sara Haddad. In a letter to MPs and senators, the group recommended the five \u201cauthoritative, highly readable books\u201d to help address what they believed was a lack of nuance in public debate. \u201cThe political debate in Australia and internationally rarely touches on the issues, events and historical analyses that these books reveal \u2013 despite their direct relevance to what is happening today,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking anyone to change their personal opinions or public positions. We just ask that politicians consider reading one or more of these books in the hope that they might inform and illuminate discussion on the ghastly situation we have been watching unfold across the Middle East.\u201d One of the campaign\u2019s initiators, Melbourne architect Marcus O\u2019Reilly, said he and others devised the project after becoming frustrated at the level of political debate being reflected in media reporting and the seemingly muted response from political leaders to events in Israel and Gaza and the wider region. O\u2019Reilly said much of what he was seeing reported of Australia\u2019s debate didn\u2019t match what he was reading in books. \u201cIt just occurred to me that if people were reading some of these books, people\u2019s responses might be amped up a bit more,\u201d he said. He said the campaign was not urging people to take any particular view \u2013 just to read more widely and think more deeply. \u201cYou can reach your own conclusion,\u201d he said, of the books\u2019 collective content. \u201cThey\u2019re not pushing a particular direction and that was the whole idea.\u201d Another of the originators, publisher Aviva Tuffield, emphasised the importance of reading for driving empathy and understanding and \u201cshifting hearts and minds\u201d. She said devising a reading list and providing the books seemed like the best way to encourage that. \u201cThe summer is for reading,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s well-known summer reading lists like Obama\u2019s, and the Grattan Institute\u2019s. It might be good for politicians who aren\u2019t engaged [on this issue] and only get the talking points to do some reading [of their own].\u201d Over the past fortnight, the campaign sought meetings with a cross-section of MPs and senators from all parties and the crossbench, hand-delivering the books with the letter to those who responded \u2013 in Melbourne last week and now in Canberra \u2013 and mailing them to the rest. Tuffield said after meeting MPs from across the parliament that many had reported being cautious about raising the Middle East conflict in parliament. One regional MP said it was the issue that generated most correspondence from constituents.

I never had a day off in the time I worked in Australia, either as a holiday or a sick day.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shergill was only allowed outside the house to let the dog out. Otherwise, she spent her entire time inside the house in Red Hill, barely a kilometre from where Danaratna would later work.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe did not pay me much for my long hours of work. His wife was very demanding. Whenever I asked for a break, she would say \u2026 that I should \u2018stop complaining and continue your work\u2019.</p> \n<p>\u201cSometimes she would get angry with me and say things such as \u2018I will send you back, where you won\u2019t earn much money\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shergill told the court she felt trapped.</p> \n<p>\u201cI did not feel that I could escape my situation. I believed that I would be in danger if I tried to leave. I believed that Mr Suri was the most powerful person from India in Australia.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shergill knew no one else in Canberra.</p> \n<p>\u201cMr Suri had my passport, and I had no way to get myself back to India. I believed that I had no choice but to stay working for Mr Suri. I felt like I was his prisoner.\u201d</p> \n<p>The court heard that after a year, a high commission official presented Shergill with documents purporting to show she was being paid a salary, and instructed her to sign them.</p> \n<p>\u201cI refused each time because it did not record how much I was being paid. Mr Suri\u2019s wife kept pushing me to sign the form, and got angrier with me. She told me that I would be sent back to India if I did not sign.\u201d</p> \n<p>After refusing four days in a row, she fled, Shergill told the court.</p> \n<p>\u201cI did not take any belongings with me, and I left behind all of my clothes. I slept on the streets. I was too scared to go back to the residence. I was sure that Mr Suri would punish me for leaving.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shergill managed to make contact with the Salvation Army, who arranged for her to travel to Sydney. She is now an Australian citizen.</p> \n<p>The federal court heard Shergill was paid less than $2,500 for all of her work in Australia \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.judgments.fedcourt.gov.au/judgments/Judgments/fca/single/2024/2024fca0261\">about $9 a day</a>.</p> \n<p>Raper ordered Suri to pay $189,000 in unpaid wages and interest to Shergill, as well as a $97,200 fine.</p> \n<p>In her <a href=\"https://www.judgments.fedcourt.gov.au/judgments/Judgments/fca/single/2024/2024fca0261\">judgment</a>, Justice Raper said Shergill had been invisible in Australia, her \u201centire existence\u201d spent \u201c<a href=\"https://www.judgments.fedcourt.gov.au/judgments/Judgments/fca/single/2024/2024fca0261\">entrapped within domestic servitude</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese workers, by fear, the precarious nature of their employment arising from their visa status, their lack of language skills, complete isolation and their slave-like working conditions, are precluded from participating in our society and huddling under the cloak of our societal protections,\u201d Raper said.</p> \n<p>\u201cTheir invisibility breeds exploitation.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/18/trump-military-mass-deportation\">Trump confirms he will utilize US military to conduct mass deportations</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But Suri and the Indian government refused to take part in the court case or pay the ordered amount.</p> \n<p>Arindam Bagchi, a spokesperson for India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs, said the allegations against Suri were \u201cfalse\u201d and alleged Shergill had \u201cwilfully deserted her post\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cHer conduct and false representations give rise to suspicions that all this has been motivated by her desire to permanently stay in Australia, and in which she seems to have succeeded.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said Australian courts had no jurisdiction to hear cases for India-based staff of the high commission, and that Shergill\u2019s case could only be settled in India. He said the Australian court\u2019s \u201cex-parte judgment\u201d ignored diplomatic immunity.</p> \n<p>In response to questions from Guardian Australia, Suri said Shergill had held diplomatic status in Australia \u2013 marked by a white passport \u2013 and was employed, not privately, but by the government of India. He said she was \u201cextremely well-treated \u2026 as a member of our extended family\u201d and alleged that the court\u2019s judgment that her working conditions were slave-like was \u201ca patent lie\u201d.</p> \n<p>Suri said Shergill was an India-based employee \u201cgoverned by Indian wage norms, just like all other staff at the mission\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cBringing India-based staff within the purview of local laws creates a bad precedent for diplomatic missions around the world.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd as a thinking person who comes from a value system of equity and justice, I believe that to accept the kind of grossly unjust and false judgment given by the court would be a violation of everything that I stand for.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018Insufficient scrutiny\u2019</h2> \n<p>Private domestic staff generally enter Australia on a <a href=\"https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/temporary-work-403/domestic-worker#Eligibility\">403 diplomatic visa for domestic workers</a>.</p> \n<p>But government sources have told the Guardian a number of countries are routinely presenting domestic staff hired to work in the private homes of senior officials as diplomats, obscuring them from government oversight and protections. </p> \n<p>Statistics from the Department of Home Affairs show the number of 403 domestic worker visas granted fell dramatically during the pandemic restrictions and has not yet returned to previous levels.

      "bodyText": "Priyanka Danaratna was invisible in Australia. Behind the closed doors of a house in Canberra\u2019s leafy diplomatic quarter, she toiled as a domestic servant. She spoke no English, had her passport seized and could not leave the house without permission. Danaratna worked in Australia for three years \u2013 seven days a week, on average 14 hours a day. Sometimes, she would start work at 5am and not finish until 1am the next day. In those three years she had only two days off: she spent them in hospital after being badly burned with oil while working in the kitchen. For her labour, the mother of two was paid the equivalent of 65 cents an hour. \u201cWhen I realised the wages that were usually paid in Australia, I felt foolish for coming for so little money,\u201d she later told the federal court. Danaratna painted a picture before the court of a quiet, relentless oppression. She told the court her employer was not impolite \u201cand never made threats to me\u201d, but \u201cdid not provide me with satisfactory clothing and food\u201d. \u201cI did not feel like I was being treated properly.\u201d In August, Justice Elizabeth Raper ordered the diplomat who employed her \u2013 the former Sri Lanka deputy high commissioner to Australia, Himalee Arunatilaka \u2013 to pay Danaratna more than half a million dollars in unpaid wages and interest. The judge found Danaratna was employed in a private capacity and her case attracted no diplomatic immunity. But the diplomat, and the Sri Lankan government that still employs her, have refused to pay the money owed, or to accept the court\u2019s verdict. In a statement, Sri Lanka\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was \u201csatisfied that the said salary was paid to the domestic assistant by the employer as mutually agreed\u201d. \u201cThe domestic assistant in question served a full three-year term and, on the eve of the employer\u2019s originally intended departure from Australia, absconded from the residence of the employer,\u201d the statement said. Danaratna, still in Australia, has received none of the money the court found she is owed. Arunatilaka\u2019s career in Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign service has been unaffected by the court ruling: she is now serving as her country\u2019s permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva. She did not respond to a request for comment. \u2018I felt like I was a prisoner\u2019 Danaratna\u2019s case is not unique. Lawyers and campaigners say oppressive working conditions for domestic workers in diplomatic households have been known for many years. In 2015, the Salvation Army\u2019s freedom partnership to end modern slavery told a Senate inquiry many suffered \u201chorrendous abuse\u201d and \u201cabsolutely humiliating, degrading treatment\u201d. Now government sources say private domestic staff are increasingly being brought into Australia on diplomatic visas, which makes monitoring their work conditions more difficult. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads An earlier case, also before Raper, highlighted the visa question. In 2015, domestic worker Seema Shergill came to Australia in the employ of the then Indian high commissioner, Navdeep Suri Singh. \u201cI worked seven days per week, from around 5am until 11.30pm each day,\u201d Shergill said in an affidavit before the federal court. \u201cI had one hour off each day from around 4pm until 5pm. I never had a day off in the time I worked in Australia, either as a holiday or a sick day.\u201d Shergill was only allowed outside the house to let the dog out. Otherwise, she spent her entire time inside the house in Red Hill, barely a kilometre from where Danaratna would later work. \u201cHe did not pay me much for my long hours of work. His wife was very demanding. Whenever I asked for a break, she would say \u2026 that I should \u2018stop complaining and continue your work\u2019. \u201cSometimes she would get angry with me and say things such as \u2018I will send you back, where you won\u2019t earn much money\u2019.\u201d Shergill told the court she felt trapped. \u201cI did not feel that I could escape my situation. I believed that I would be in danger if I tried to leave. I believed that Mr Suri was the most powerful person from India in Australia.\u201d Shergill knew no one else in Canberra. \u201cMr Suri had my passport, and I had no way to get myself back to India. I believed that I had no choice but to stay working for Mr Suri. I felt like I was his prisoner.\u201d The court heard that after a year, a high commission official presented Shergill with documents purporting to show she was being paid a salary, and instructed her to sign them. \u201cI refused each time because it did not record how much I was being paid. Mr Suri\u2019s wife kept pushing me to sign the form, and got angrier with me. She told me that I would be sent back to India if I did not sign.\u201d After refusing four days in a row, she fled, Shergill told the court. \u201cI did not take any belongings with me, and I left behind all of my clothes. I slept on the streets. I was too scared to go back to the residence. I was sure that Mr Suri would punish me for leaving.\u201d Shergill managed to make contact with the Salvation Army, who arranged for her to travel to Sydney. She is now an Australian citizen. The federal court heard Shergill was paid less than $2,500 for all of her work in Australia \u2013 about $9 a day. Raper ordered Suri to pay $189,000 in unpaid wages and interest to Shergill, as well as a $97,200 fine. In her judgment, Justice Raper said Shergill had been invisible in Australia, her \u201centire existence\u201d spent \u201centrapped within domestic servitude\u201d. \u201cThese workers, by fear, the precarious nature of their employment arising from their visa status, their lack of language skills, complete isolation and their slave-like working conditions, are precluded from participating in our society and huddling under the cloak of our societal protections,\u201d Raper said. \u201cTheir invisibility breeds exploitation.\u201d But Suri and the Indian government refused to take part in the court case or pay the ordered amount. Arindam Bagchi, a spokesperson for India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs, said the allegations against Suri were \u201cfalse\u201d and alleged Shergill had \u201cwilfully deserted her post\u201d. \u201cHer conduct and false representations give rise to suspicions that all this has been motivated by her desire to permanently stay in Australia, and in which she seems to have succeeded.\u201d He said Australian courts had no jurisdiction to hear cases for India-based staff of the high commission, and that Shergill\u2019s case could only be settled in India. He said the Australian court\u2019s \u201cex-parte judgment\u201d ignored diplomatic immunity. In response to questions from Guardian Australia, Suri said Shergill had held diplomatic status in Australia \u2013 marked by a white passport \u2013 and was employed, not privately, but by the government of India. He said she was \u201cextremely well-treated \u2026 as a member of our extended family\u201d and alleged that the court\u2019s judgment that her working conditions were slave-like was \u201ca patent lie\u201d. Suri said Shergill was an India-based employee \u201cgoverned by Indian wage norms, just like all other staff at the mission\u201d. \u201cBringing India-based staff within the purview of local laws creates a bad precedent for diplomatic missions around the world. \u201cAnd as a thinking person who comes from a value system of equity and justice, I believe that to accept the kind of grossly unjust and false judgment given by the court would be a violation of everything that I stand for.\u201d \u2018Insufficient scrutiny\u2019 Private domestic staff generally enter Australia on a 403 diplomatic visa for domestic workers. But government sources have told the Guardian a number of countries are routinely presenting domestic staff hired to work in the private homes of senior officials as diplomats, obscuring them from government oversight and protections. Statistics from the Department of Home Affairs show the number of 403 domestic worker visas granted fell dramatically during the pandemic restrictions and has not yet returned to previous levels. Almost 600 visas were granted over the past decade: the most in 2015-16. Shergill held a 995 visa, a category reserved for diplomatic staff, and for which domestic workers are not eligible. Anti-slavery advocates argue the visa regime is being consistently breached, even for those on domestic worker visas. One of the conditions for domestic staff working in the homes of diplomats is that they must \u201chave an employment contract that meets Australia\u2019s workplace laws\u201d. They must also be allowed to leave their place of work, have possession of their passport and be paid in money (not food or clothing) that is accounted for through payslips. The Guardian has sighted, among the official court files, the employment documents signed by Danaratna \u2013 and her high commission employer \u2013 stating she would be paid in accordance with Australian laws. In her judgment, Raper wrote \u201cit would have been clear\u201d to Australian authorities granting Danaratna\u2019s visa that she was not going to be lawfully employed, but that there was \u201cinsufficient scrutiny\u201d of her proposed working arrangement. \u201cIt is perplexing that the department, in the circumstances, did nothing and granted the visa.\u201d Dfat did not respond to a series of questions from the Guardian. Vulnerable and isolated workers David Hillard is pro bono partner at Clayton Utz, which represented both Danaratna and Shergill before the federal court. He told the Guardian a confluence of factors mean such cases can go undetected: workers with little English or understanding of their rights in Australia; a dramatic power imbalance between employer and employee; and the arcane nature of embassies and diplomatic properties. \u201cIt is difficult to imagine more vulnerable and isolated workers, and it is probably inevitable that they end up trapped in slave-like working conditions. \u201cIt is hard to conceive of someone in 21st century Australia literally being trapped in a job and earning 65 cents an hour. How do we describe this as anything other than slavery?\u201d Hillard said the two cases came to public knowledge only because of the courage of the women involved to escape the homes in which they worked. \u201cOtherwise, we would be none the wiser as to the slavery that took place behind the locked gates of some of Canberra\u2019s diplomatic residences. \u201cPersonally, I do not think that we should put foreign workers [at] the risk of exploitation that exists under these visas \u2026 Why should anyone need to keep a person trapped in their home as a servant, in order to survive life in Canberra?\u201d Claudia Cummins, the Salvation Army\u2019s modern slavery lead, said the organisation had helped at least a dozen domestic workers who had escaped forced labour within diplomatic residences. She said the systems designed to protect those workers often failed because they were not understood by workers or simply can\u2019t be accessed: people can\u2019t leave their employers\u2019 homes or they don\u2019t know who they can call. \u201cMigrant domestic workers experiencing modern slavery may fear or distrust authorities due to their experiences in their country of origin \u2026 and the fear that coming forward \u2026 may lead to deportation or retaliation against them or their family at home.\u201d Danaratna remembers that feeling of being trapped. \u201cI did not believe that I had any options to leave,\u201d she wrote in an affidavit to the court. When she finally found someone she could tell \u2013 the Salvation Army \u2013 it was, she said, \u201cthe first time I realised that I could get help\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Australians like our space; it\u2019s a good thing we have a lot of it. But do we always use it smartly? Australians now build and live in the biggest homes in the world, outstripping even the US and Canada. In the last 60 years, our houses have more than doubled in size \u2013 from 100 sq metres to 236 sq metres \u2013 while the number of people living in them has declined.</p> <p>And this month a 236 sq metre house has sprouted up in the back garden of the National Gallery of Victoria. There are no bedrooms or bathrooms inside \u2013 in fact, there are no rooms at all, just a labyrinth of windowless walls that feel dark and oppressive. But then the maze ends, opening out on another house \u2013 this one 50 sq metres \u2013<strong> </strong>that feels like a sudden respite. Despite being smaller, it feels roomier with its high ceilings and a beautiful play of shadow and light coming through slotted pine walls. It\u2019s not the size, it\u2019s the way you use it.</p> <p>Home Truth is both an architectural artwork and a provocation, posed by the Melbourne studio Breathe for the NGV\u2019s ninth annual architectural commission. Breathe is <a href=\"https://www.breathe.com.au/projects\">known for elegant Nightingale houses</a>, smartly designed to maximise space and minimise environmental impact, during both construction and years of heating and cooling after.

But small houses are cheaper to buy and cheaper to run, Jeremy McLeod, the founding director of Breathe Architecture, points out.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I told you that you could buy that for $100,000?\u201d he says, pointing at the small house. \u201cAnd this is $580,000?\u201d he adds, pointing at the big house.</p> <p>\u201cWould you rather have more space?

No. Sometimes you have got to make the choice that actually works for all parts of your life.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Australia has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/19/australia-housing-crisis-affordability-policies-coalition\">housing crisis</a> overlapping with a cost-of-living crisis and a climate crisis \u2013 and the lack of house-size options between tiny and enormous must be urgently addressed to help with all three, McLeod says.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest houses in the world don\u2019t help with cost of living, given where interest rates are,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t help a housing crisis, it means we build fewer houses.

It\u2019s about telling the truth and saying, this is what that much space actually looks like.\u201d</p> <p>Australia\u2019s houses ballooned in the 1980s, a decade that saw shifts in financial deregulation and housing policy as well as a new era of individualisation. Within the home, people began wanting more space: home offices, spare bedrooms, rooms for each kid.

      "bodyText": "Australians like our space; it\u2019s a good thing we have a lot of it. But do we always use it smartly? Australians now build and live in the biggest homes in the world, outstripping even the US and Canada. In the last 60 years, our houses have more than doubled in size \u2013 from 100 sq metres to 236 sq metres \u2013 while the number of people living in them has declined. And this month a 236 sq metre house has sprouted up in the back garden of the National Gallery of Victoria. There are no bedrooms or bathrooms inside \u2013 in fact, there are no rooms at all, just a labyrinth of windowless walls that feel dark and oppressive. But then the maze ends, opening out on another house \u2013 this one 50 sq metres \u2013 that feels like a sudden respite. Despite being smaller, it feels roomier with its high ceilings and a beautiful play of shadow and light coming through slotted pine walls. It\u2019s not the size, it\u2019s the way you use it. Home Truth is both an architectural artwork and a provocation, posed by the Melbourne studio Breathe for the NGV\u2019s ninth annual architectural commission. Breathe is known for elegant Nightingale houses, smartly designed to maximise space and minimise environmental impact, during both construction and years of heating and cooling after. (\u201cRight size housing for a climate crisis. Right size housing for a housing crisis,\u201d the website reads.) Some people may walk inside the smaller house at the NGV and scoff, trying to imagine all their furniture in there. But small houses are cheaper to buy and cheaper to run, Jeremy McLeod, the founding director of Breathe Architecture, points out. \u201cWhat if I told you that you could buy that for $100,000?\u201d he says, pointing at the small house. \u201cAnd this is $580,000?\u201d he adds, pointing at the big house. \u201cWould you rather have more space? Absolutely. Can you afford it? No. Sometimes you have got to make the choice that actually works for all parts of your life.\u201d Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Australia has a housing crisis overlapping with a cost-of-living crisis and a climate crisis \u2013 and the lack of house-size options between tiny and enormous must be urgently addressed to help with all three, McLeod says. \u201cThe biggest houses in the world don\u2019t help with cost of living, given where interest rates are,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t help a housing crisis, it means we build fewer houses. And it definitely doesn\u2019t solve a climate crisis \u2013 we\u2019ve got the biggest carbon footprint per capita outside of the Middle East and oil-producing nations.\u201d Home Truth is not only beautiful but environmentally friendly: when it is deconstructed in April, Breathe will use all of the wood to build actual houses. The walls are made from a low carbon material called Saveboard, which is created using recycled cartons and plastics that can be heated and reshaped to be used again and again. Nothing will end up in landfill. McLeod is keen to stress that he is not ordering people to downsize; Home Truth is an opportunity to stand in two very differently sized houses and really feel how space can be used smartly, and appreciate how design makes our lives more environmental, more convenient and more beautiful. \u201cIf people want a second bathroom rather than a back yard, that\u2019s fine,\u201d McLeod says. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that someone living in a 236 sq metre house should move into a 50 sq metre house \u2013 this is not about judgment. It\u2019s about telling the truth and saying, this is what that much space actually looks like.\u201d Australia\u2019s houses ballooned in the 1980s, a decade that saw shifts in financial deregulation and housing policy as well as a new era of individualisation. Within the home, people began wanting more space: home offices, spare bedrooms, rooms for each kid. Housing became a source of wealth rather than a human right, which meant houses got bigger while our gardens got smaller and less biodiverse. But when an extra bathroom could add $50,000 to the value of your house, why wouldn\u2019t you chuck that on? \u201cIt was Menzies\u2019 great vision that we would be a nation of homeowners, and governments have tried to incentivise that through taxation,\u201d McLeod says. \u201cBut take capital gains \u2013 people in other parts of the world can\u2019t believe that you can buy a house for $1m here, sell it for $2m and you don\u2019t pay tax on it.

It included decent curry pastes, bak kuh teh spices and Chinese dried mushrooms and it took a month to arrive. I found it abandoned and open on the edge of our paddock opposite the school bus stop. It was nowhere near the letter box. I can now get most of those ingredients at a duopoly branch. For all their faults, big supermarkets have brought range and reach to the country shopper. But I will keep shopping at my smaller local supermarket \u2013 just don\u2019t be surprised if you see me occasionally browsing in the curry paste aisle of the duopoly we love to hate. We all need to get our fix. Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter",

The Scanlon Foundation Research Institute\u2019s annual survey, Mapping Social Cohesion, measures participants\u2019 sense of belonging, worth, inclusion and justice, political participation, and acceptance and rejection, to form a cohesion index and produce a numerical benchmark that can be compared year on year. It involved almost 8,000 randomly selected participants, further surveying another 229 targeted participants \u2013 the latter mostly overseas-born Australians. As a companion to the wider survey, the foundation also produces an extra qualitative study, this year based on interviews with 45 people and focused on polarisation. The 2024 overall social cohesion index score was 78 \u2013 the same as in 2023 but still at its lowest since the survey began in 2007. The score has been steadily declining since 2008. The smaller qualitative study produced a picture of Australians divided on current political, economic and environmental issues and with older Australians, in particular, feeling \u201cthat Australia has changed\u201d. The survey found financial pressures remained \u201cstubbornly common\u201d, with 41% of respondents describing themselves as \u201cjust getting by\u201d \u2013 a figure that has risen 10 percentage points since 2021. Produced in conjunction with the Australian Multicultural Foundation and the Australian National University, the survey found support for multiculturalism remains mostly positive, with 85% agreeing it has been good for Australia generally and 82% saying it is good for the economy. But while this is still stronger than before the Covid-19 pandemic, it is down from 89% in 2023.

The survey showed that levels of trust in government had shot up during the pandemic restrictions and stayed high for longer than in other parts of the world, but had now fallen back. \u201cWe might be just returning to a historical norm of people just generally distrusting government,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cBut perhaps there are lessons there for governments if they want.\u201d People under financial pressure were less likely than others to trust in government. Asked to rate their trust in a range of institutions and entities, respondents rated community and public service agencies above government and media. Social media companies were rated lowest. Political participation was steady in 2024, with more than half (53%) saying they had signed a petition in the past year.",

By asking the public to confront imperialism, the movement opened the door to a confrontation between the people and the Democratic party, awakening its voters to an issue once seen as someone else\u2019s concern.</p> <p>When the uncommitted movement offered to endorse Harris in exchange for having a speaker at the Democratic national convention and were denied, it allowed the movement to more extensively highlight the contradictions that mark the party.

      "bodyText": "In the days following the 2024 election, a cadre of pundits have been eager to call the uncommitted voters\u2019 impact on the presidential race both a failure and a significant factor in Vice-President Kamala Harris\u2019s loss. Despite those contradicting analyses, the movement\u2019s success lies not in its voter count, but rather in the clarity it offered voters, even those who changed their minds and chose to vote for Harris in the end. As with the anti-war campaigns of the 1960s, the Uncommitted National Movement, the more than 500,000-person effort which called on Americans against the genocide in Gaza to withhold their votes, was a representation of the nation\u2019s shifting consciousness around US responsibility in Israel\u2019s war. By asking the public to confront imperialism, the movement opened the door to a confrontation between the people and the Democratic party, awakening its voters to an issue once seen as someone else\u2019s concern. When the uncommitted movement offered to endorse Harris in exchange for having a speaker at the Democratic national convention and were denied, it allowed the movement to more extensively highlight the contradictions that mark the party. If the Democrats weren\u2019t giving marginalized people an opportunity to speak, what does that say to Muslims, Arabs and voters of color who know intimately this kind of erasure and disregard at the hands of the party that purports to represent them? While some in the Democratic party billed Israel\u2019s carnage as an issue that concerned only the left, many liberals across the spectrum, from the far left to centrists, actually consider it a mainstream issue, one that dominates their political perspectives and positions. More and more people, through the activism of uncommitted voters, learned that American democracy is a feature of western imperialism \u2013 Republicans and Democrats alike would supply arms to Israel and allow its government impunity on the world stage. Even though more than 60% of US voters supported an arms embargo, including 77% of Democratic voters and 40% of Republican voters, and even though stopping arms transfers polled highly in swing states, the Democratic party ignored demands for an embargo and ceasefire. (The Biden administration has repeatedly said it is pushing for a ceasefire.) That ceasefire has yet to come, and more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, with many more unaccounted for. The anti-war college campus protests also furthered the cause of uncommitted: students across the country were unduly labeled as antisemitic antagonists because they pressed their universities to divest from weapons manufacturers. Democratic voters across the country became more and more sympathetic to the students\u2019 actions, marking an even more pronounced break from the party position. That consciousness only grew once the expansion of the war into Lebanon and Syria underscored the extent of US involvement in the creation and exacerbation of regional warfare. Uncommitted voters in Michigan, which has the largest population of Palestinians, Arabs and Muslim people in the country, helped deliver a loss to the Harris campaign on election night. To be clear: there is no basis to the accusation that Harris losing Michigan was the lone cause of Trump\u2019s win. But it matters that Arab and Muslim voters in cities such as Dearborn rejected the Democrats\u2019 agenda, while Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian representative from Michigan and Ilhan Omar, a representative from Minnesota, held on to their seats.

However, once again Liverpool were unable to break down Everton and, when asked why he thought his side were so effective against the Reds, S\u00f8rensen said: \u201cI think it\u2019s the way Liverpool play \u2013 very simple and direct that you read and you can set up for, to nullify the threats. They\u2019re one of the easier teams to prepare [for] because it is simple but \u2013 don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I totally respect it.

Brighton had raced into a 2-0 lead but two quickfire goals from Katrina Gorry brought the Hammers level. Kirby, however, came good when she received the ball just inside the area, took two touches to balance herself and scored with the third. The 31-year-old had assisted Rachel McLauchlan\u2019s opener, and so her late strike took her to 101 goal involvements in the English top flight. Brighton\u2019s manager, Dario Vidosic, said of the winner: \u201cI thought the play and everything \u2013 how we penetrate, how we got behind, to find the free player in Fran. But then her composure, that\u2019s the class that she possesses and I think that\u2019s a goal she deserves as well, especially with her performance today.\u201d <strong>SR</strong></p> <h2>Spurs defensive problems continue</h2> <p>Tottenham\u2019s defending looked very questionable at times during their 3-0 loss to Arsenal and, for the second game in a row, Robert Vilahamn\u2019s side conceded very early. Having seen Manchester City score after 24 seconds of a match they went on to lose 4-0, it took just 64 for Alessia Russo to find the net on Saturday, as Tottenham conceded first for the sixth time in their eight league games. Asked why he felt his team were unable to hold out for longer, Vilahamn said: \u201cWe had a plan [to stop it] for this game and they scored anyway in a different way. You work on something that should be aggressive in the beginning and then they score anyway. Self-confidence is a big thing in playing and taking decisions and being really sharp, and when you have big games in a row where you lose [by] big numbers, it affects your self-confidence. We have to try to find a way through this tough period.\u201d <strong>TG</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/16/tottenham-arsenal-wsl-match-report\">Tottenham 0-3 Arsenal</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Super-sub Salmon gives Villa victory at last</h2> <p>There would have been a deep sigh of relief from Robert de Pauw as the final whistle blew at Villa Park, marking their first win of the season.

A dizzying end-to-end rollercoaster of a match was settled by the substitute Ebony Salmon\u2019s stunning strike in stoppage time. De Pauw\u2019s decision to bring on the England international paid off when it mattered most and this win will have breathed life into his future at the club \u2013 as well as the team\u2019s confidence. <strong>RO</strong></p>    <h2>Mistakes let Leicester down</h2> <p>\u201cThe best things come in twos,\u201d as the saying goes, but not for Leicester as Manchester United cruised to a 2-0 victory on Sunday \u2013 and there were two crucial moments they were left to rue afterwards.

And it was deliberate, a tactical decision that paid off. \u201cWe have dominated a lot of games possession-wise but tonight we were happy to sit behind the ball, be compact,\u201d the midfielder Erin Cuthbert said. \u201cIt was more of a traditional performance but Sonia is a winner and will do whatever it takes to win. We got the tactics spot on.\u201d The London team conceded possession but they dominated in every other area, with 15 shots to eight, six on target to two and 30 touches in the penalty area to 16.

      "bodyText": "Almost a third of Victorians who could be eligible for the state\u2019s shared equity scheme for homebuyers would miss out if it is replaced by federal Labor\u2019s proposed Help to Buy initiative, according to independent analysis. A report by the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO), to be released on Tuesday, has found 668,800 Victorians \u2013 or about 29% of those who could currently be eligible for the state\u2019s Homebuyer Fund \u2013 would no longer qualify under the federal scheme. The report, requested by Legalise Cannabis MP Rachel Payne, said this was due to Help to Buy having lower income and property price caps than the state program, which is considered among the most generous shared equity schemes in the country. Under the federal scheme, which was a key election promise of Anthony Albanese, the commonwealth would contribute 40% of the purchase price of a new home, or 30% for an existing home, with the buyer required to have a minimum deposit of just 2%. But singles with no dependents will only qualify if their yearly income is $90,000 or less. This is about $45,000 below the Victorian scheme\u2019s limit of $135,155. Meanwhile, the limit for couples with a combined income is set at $120,000, almost $100,000 less than the state cap of $216,245. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The maximum purchase price for homes in Melbourne and Geelong is also capped at $100,000 lower under the federal scheme, at $850,000. According to the PBO, about 10,000 Victorians properties, or 7.8% of those eligible under the Homebuyer Fund, would not be eligible under Help to Buy as a result. Payne said in the south-eastern metropolitan region she represents in the upper house one in 10 homes won\u2019t be eligible. \u201cThe federal scheme doesn\u2019t even come close to the state\u2019s \u2013 particularly for many couples who live in my area, who are wanting to buy a home and start a family,\u201d she said. The report also does not take into account that Help to Buy is yet to pass the federal parliament, having languished in the Senate for months after the Greens and the Coalition teamed up to delay debate on the bill until this week. Victoria, and other states, are expected to wind down their shared equity schemes if and when the federal proposal passes parliament. Under the Victorian scheme, the government contributes up to 25% of the purchase price of a home, provided the buyer has a deposit of at least 5%, which reduces their mortgage and removes the need for lender\u2019s mortgage insurance. According to the state government, it has helped about 11,500 households buy their own home. The PBO analysis said 2% of all property sales in the state in the 2022-23 year were made under the fund. But in the May budget, the government revealed it would stop taking applications for the program from June 2025, when it would \u201ctransition to the national scheme\u201d. It allocated a final investment of $700m in the Homebuyer Fund for 4,600 places. Payne said the move \u201ccompletely contradicted\u201d the Victorian government\u2019s recent string of housing announcements, which the premier, Jacinta Allan, has said were focused on helping millennials achieve home ownership. \u201cIt\u2019s quite odd that there is a major disparity around the government saying that they want to see young people get into the market, announcing all these incentives around planning to help with that,\u201d she said. \u201cYet at the same time, the financial support that the government can offer seems to be falling to the wayside and is being replaced by a federal system that isn\u2019t really fit for purpose for people buying in Victoria.\u201d The PBO noted its analysis had limitations, including that it does not account for differences in how the state and federal schemes define eligible locations, and it was sensitive to uncertainties in the property market, including price fluctuations. It also cannot predict whether individuals might change their behaviour to meet the eligibility criteria for the federal scheme. Help to Buy is expected to have just 40,000 places available nationwide across four years. A Victorian government spokesperson said as the Homebuyer Fund was wrapping up, its focused would turn to \u201cseiz[ing] every opportunity to build more homes\u201d in the state. \u201cMillennials deserve the same opportunities as their parents and grandparents \u2013 which is why we\u2019re building more homes and creating more opportunities for them to live near transport, jobs and family,\u201d they said.",

The town is home to the firefighting foam manufacturer Angus Fire.</p> <p>PFAS, short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and commonly known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d owing to their persistence in the environment, are a family of about 10,000 chemicals that have been linked to a wide range of serious illnesses, including certain cancers. They are used in many consumer products, from frying pans to waterproof coats, but one of their most common uses is in firefighting foams.</p> <p>The law firm Leigh Day has informed Angus Fire that, acting on behalf of residents, it has been instructed to investigate a case against the firm as a result of \u201calleged PFAS pollution in Bentham\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Angus Fire said: \u201cWe have been advised by Leigh Day that it is under instruction to investigate a potential claim on behalf of one residency. We have not received notice of any legal action.\u201d</p> <p>In the past 25 years, nearly 10,000 court cases <a href=\"https://chemsec.org/just-the-start-the-growing-legal-battle-over-pfas-in-europe/\">have been filed</a> in the US alleging harm from PFAS exposure. Some of these cases have already resulted in multi-billion dollar settlements. The case against Angus Fire would be be the first ever PFAS-related legal case in the UK.</p> <p>Charlotte Armstrong, a senior associate solicitor at Leigh Day, said: \u201cAngus Fire state that they no longer manufacture or test any PFAS-containing foam products in Bentham, but that doesn\u2019t help the people of Bentham. PFAS are \u2018forever chemicals\u2019, and unfortunately that means that the chemical pollution in the area is anything but a historic issue. Our clients and the wider community in Bentham are entitled to fully understand the extent of PFAS pollution in their community, so that those allegedly responsible can be held to account in terms of financial compensation and remediation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/05/bentham_locator/giv-13425cTb0sTi8qkHI/\" data-alt=\"Map of Bentham\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/05/bentham_locator/giv-13425cTb0sTi8qkHI/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>After the initial investigation, <a href=\"https://www.endsreport.com/article/1875440/firefighting-foams-firm-enlists-consultants-test-groundwater-pfas-site\">Bentham town council asked</a> Angus Fire to test the environment on Duke Street \u2013 a narrow residential road next to the factory \u2013 for PFAS.</p> <p>The test results, which were made available in October, <a href=\"https://www.endsreport.com/article/1890899/gardens-used-grow-food-pfas-polluted-town-contaminated-forever-chemicals\">revealed</a> that soil adjacent to gardens on Duke Street was contaminated with elevated levels of PFAS.

      "bodyText": "Residents in the UK town with the country\u2019s highest identified concentration of \u201cforever chemicals\u201d have instructed lawyers to investigate the possibility of a first-of-its-kind legal claim against the firefighting foam manufacturer located in the centre of Bentham. In May this year, an investigation by the Ends Report and the Guardian revealed that the rural North Yorkshire town is the most PFAS-polluted place known to exist in the UK. The town is home to the firefighting foam manufacturer Angus Fire. PFAS, short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and commonly known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d owing to their persistence in the environment, are a family of about 10,000 chemicals that have been linked to a wide range of serious illnesses, including certain cancers. They are used in many consumer products, from frying pans to waterproof coats, but one of their most common uses is in firefighting foams. The law firm Leigh Day has informed Angus Fire that, acting on behalf of residents, it has been instructed to investigate a case against the firm as a result of \u201calleged PFAS pollution in Bentham\u201d. A spokesperson for Angus Fire said: \u201cWe have been advised by Leigh Day that it is under instruction to investigate a potential claim on behalf of one residency. We have not received notice of any legal action.\u201d In the past 25 years, nearly 10,000 court cases have been filed in the US alleging harm from PFAS exposure. Some of these cases have already resulted in multi-billion dollar settlements. The case against Angus Fire would be be the first ever PFAS-related legal case in the UK. Charlotte Armstrong, a senior associate solicitor at Leigh Day, said: \u201cAngus Fire state that they no longer manufacture or test any PFAS-containing foam products in Bentham, but that doesn\u2019t help the people of Bentham. PFAS are \u2018forever chemicals\u2019, and unfortunately that means that the chemical pollution in the area is anything but a historic issue. Our clients and the wider community in Bentham are entitled to fully understand the extent of PFAS pollution in their community, so that those allegedly responsible can be held to account in terms of financial compensation and remediation.\u201d After the initial investigation, Bentham town council asked Angus Fire to test the environment on Duke Street \u2013 a narrow residential road next to the factory \u2013 for PFAS. The test results, which were made available in October, revealed that soil adjacent to gardens on Duke Street was contaminated with elevated levels of PFAS. The land is owned by Angus Fire and is made available for use by residents, who use it to grow food. Local people were advised by Angus Fire to wash and peel vegetables grown on the land, to clean their homes of dust regularly, and to remove shoes before entering their homes. Residents of Duke Street have said that since finding out about the contamination they felt \u201ctrapped\u201d. \u201cAt any point of buying a house, you would want the option to sell it, depending on what you want to do in your life,\u201d said one person, who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cAt the moment, that would be a significant challenge. And with the uncertainty over how long it will take to remediate the land, we are essentially trapped in this situation.\u201d Angus Fire has offered residents on Duke Street a series of financial \u201cgoodwill gestures\u201d. A spokesperson for Angus Fire said it had \u201cpresented a number of options to residents whose properties border the legacy foam manufacturing and testing areas, which we believe could offer a constructive way forward and which also underscores our commitment to addressing the situation responsibly. \u201cWe recognise the concerns about potential environmental impacts from historic operations at our facility and regret the inconvenience and worry that this has caused.\u201d Duke Street residents have expressed concern about the risk of the contamination to their health. Dr Anna Watson, the director of policy and advocacy at the Chem Trust charity, said that while it was welcome that Angus Fire was \u201cadmitting responsibility for the irreversible PFAS pollution near their site in Bentham\u201d, it was \u201cheartbreaking to think of people being uprooted from their community, as well as having to deal with the anxiety of potential long-term health impacts from these toxic chemicals\u201d. \u201cThe UK government needs to take urgent action to ban the use and manufacture of these chemicals as a group and be at the forefront of a global PFAS-free economy,\u201d she said. Residents said they had had no correspondence with local or government officials over the contamination. An Environment Agency spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working with North Yorkshire council and looking into historic PFAS contamination from the Angus Fire site. Our primary focus is to assess the risk to the environment and provide support to our partners on risk to residents.\u201d North Yorkshire council\u2019s assistant director for regulatory services, Callum McKeon, said: \u201cWe continue to work with partner agencies to assess historic PFAS contamination from the Angus Fire site at Bentham.

      "body": "<p>Great actors have always attracted artists. I think of <a href=\"https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O84971/edmund-kean-as-sir-giles-painting-clint-george/\">Edmund Kean</a> looking wild-eyed and demonic as Sir Giles Overreach painted by George Clint; <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/sargent-ellen-terry-as-lady-macbeth-n02053\">Ellen Terry</a> as a green-gowned Lady Macbeth preserved by John Singer Sargent; and Ruskin Spear\u2019s study in oils of <a href=\"https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1111599/laurence-olivier-as-macbeth-painting-spear-ruskin/\">Laurence Olivier</a> as a tormented, guilt-haunted Macbeth. For well over a century, it has also been possible to record the voices of our leading actors. But what would happen if image and sound were combined?</p> <p>One answer is to be found in a radical new exhibition called <a href=\"https://www.stageblock.art/\">The Shakespeare Portraits</a> on view at the <a href=\"https://redeightgallery.com/whats-on/\">Red Eight Gallery</a>, which can be found in the City of London\u2019s Cornhill alongside the Royal Exchange. The show consists of 10 digital portraits of living actors accompanied by speeches from Shakespeare plays. I can best explain by example. I sat beneath a large, framed image of Ian McKellen and as I spoke to the exhibition\u2019s creative director, <a href=\"https://www.arsalansattari.com/\">Arsalan Sattari-Hicks</a>, I realised that Sir Ian\u2019s head was occasionally moving, that his gaze was subtly shifting and his features expressing a variety of emotions. At one point I even heard him speaking a fragment of \u201cAll the world\u2019s a stage\u201d from As You Like It with characteristic virtuosity. Richard Brierley, the gallery\u2019s director, put it succinctly when he told me: \u201cNormally the portrait is passive and you are the active one. In this case the portrait is active and you are passive.\u201d</p>    <p>I would qualify this by saying the modulations in the sitter\u2019s movements are so nuanced as to be often barely perceptible and that the speeches can be activated by the viewer through the press of a button. But the total effect is uncanny and I was intrigued as to how it was done. I was told that Sattari-Hicks and a small crew would record the sitter in a studio using a state-of-the-art camera and then refine the images through hours of post-production. The spoken texts were chosen by the actors in collaboration with the Shakespeare director Ron Daniels, who curated the finished version. Given the actors\u2019 vast experience, that process was usually done in an hour and 20 minutes.</p> <p>I was struck by the intimacy of the experience. The actors\u2019 faces are seen in close-up as if they had suddenly materialised on the gallery walls. And the texts are spoken in a way that adds to the pervading quietude. Patrick Stewart takes the St Crispin\u2019s Day speech from Henry V and strips it of rhetoric to show us a man, on the eve of battle, talking to other men: when he suggests that Crispin\u2019s feast will be remembered \u201cfrom this day to the ending of the world\u201d he does so with modest certainty whereas Olivier on film famously sent the line soaring upwards to the heavens.</p> <p>In the midst of \u201cTo be or not to be\u201d Derek Jacobi inserts a prolonged pause after the lines \u201cTo die, to sleep\u201d, pondering the implication of each word. Harriet Walter as Prospero in The Tempest leaves us in no doubt as to the character\u2019s awesome power stressing the key verb in \u201cI have bedimmed the noontide sun\u201d: this, you realise, is a magician who has not only raised the dead from their graves but also created darkness at noon.</p>    <p>The big question is what happens next? The 10 portraits on show are unique collectables which will be on sale to individuals or institutions. But they are the work of a company, StageBlock, co-founded by Sattari-Hicks and Francesco Pierangeli, which has ambitious plans for the future. They are already planning a second volume of Shakespeare Portraits to be recorded in the new year. They also dream of extending the idea of living portraits to other writers and other cultures and of ploughing 10% of the money from placements and exhibitions back into the performing arts.</p> <p>Given the impressive roster of names in the first exhibition \u2013 which also includes David Suchet, Juliet Stevenson, Adrian Lester, Simon Callow, Charles Dance and Frances Barber \u2013 there is a good chance that profits will ensue. It\u2019s a bold, visionary new idea for the digital age but I hope it won\u2019t stifle the talent of the individual portraitist. I cherish the notion of, say, Salvador Dal\u00ed\u2019s painting of <a href=\"https://www.salvador-dali.org/en/museums/dali-theatre-museum-in-figueres/the-collection/129/portrait-of-laurence-olivier-in-the-role-of-richard-iii\">Olivier as Richard III</a> hanging on a gallery wall alongside the mesmerising image of McKellen looking on at one in watchful fascination.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.stageblock.art/\">The Shakespeare Portraits</a> is at the Red Eight Gallery, London, until 6 December</p></li> </ul>",

In this case the portrait is active and you are passive.\u201d I would qualify this by saying the modulations in the sitter\u2019s movements are so nuanced as to be often barely perceptible and that the speeches can be activated by the viewer through the press of a button. But the total effect is uncanny and I was intrigued as to how it was done. I was told that Sattari-Hicks and a small crew would record the sitter in a studio using a state-of-the-art camera and then refine the images through hours of post-production. The spoken texts were chosen by the actors in collaboration with the Shakespeare director Ron Daniels, who curated the finished version. Given the actors\u2019 vast experience, that process was usually done in an hour and 20 minutes. I was struck by the intimacy of the experience. The actors\u2019 faces are seen in close-up as if they had suddenly materialised on the gallery walls. And the texts are spoken in a way that adds to the pervading quietude. Patrick Stewart takes the St Crispin\u2019s Day speech from Henry V and strips it of rhetoric to show us a man, on the eve of battle, talking to other men: when he suggests that Crispin\u2019s feast will be remembered \u201cfrom this day to the ending of the world\u201d he does so with modest certainty whereas Olivier on film famously sent the line soaring upwards to the heavens. In the midst of \u201cTo be or not to be\u201d Derek Jacobi inserts a prolonged pause after the lines \u201cTo die, to sleep\u201d, pondering the implication of each word. Harriet Walter as Prospero in The Tempest leaves us in no doubt as to the character\u2019s awesome power stressing the key verb in \u201cI have bedimmed the noontide sun\u201d: this, you realise, is a magician who has not only raised the dead from their graves but also created darkness at noon. The big question is what happens next? The 10 portraits on show are unique collectables which will be on sale to individuals or institutions. But they are the work of a company, StageBlock, co-founded by Sattari-Hicks and Francesco Pierangeli, which has ambitious plans for the future. They are already planning a second volume of Shakespeare Portraits to be recorded in the new year. They also dream of extending the idea of living portraits to other writers and other cultures and of ploughing 10% of the money from placements and exhibitions back into the performing arts. Given the impressive roster of names in the first exhibition \u2013 which also includes David Suchet, Juliet Stevenson, Adrian Lester, Simon Callow, Charles Dance and Frances Barber \u2013 there is a good chance that profits will ensue. It\u2019s a bold, visionary new idea for the digital age but I hope it won\u2019t stifle the talent of the individual portraitist. I cherish the notion of, say, Salvador Dal\u00ed\u2019s painting of Olivier as Richard III hanging on a gallery wall alongside the mesmerising image of McKellen looking on at one in watchful fascination. The Shakespeare Portraits is at the Red Eight Gallery, London, until 6 December",

Begbies Traynor said increased employment costs, as well as higher interest rates, would extend a period of \u201celevated insolvency levels\u201d, in a statement to the stock market on Monday. The Labour government last month raised taxes on business steeply to cover the cost of increased spending on the NHS, schools and the armed forces in its first budget for 14 years. Rachel Reeves\u2019s decision to raise employers\u2019 national insurance contributions provoked a chorus of protests from businesses. Unlike corporation tax, a rise in national insurance contributions affects every business with employees, whether profitable or not.

      "body": "<p>Paying a premium for a flight during the school holidays or a cab at peak hours might be expected but fluctuating charges \u2013 otherwise known as surge pricing \u2013 could become the norm in other industries, say experts. </p> <p>According to Omar Merlo, the academic director of strategic marketing programmes at the Imperial College Business School, surge pricing \u2013 widely known as dynamic pricing \u2013 is when retailers adjust their prices in response to supply and demand, meaning customers are charged higher prices when demand spikes.</p> <p>The Wardour Street branch of O\u2019Neill\u2019s pub in Soho, central London, has implemented an additional \u00a32 charge to pints ordered after 10pm. This means a pint of Brewdog IPA that costs \u00a37.40 during the day will cost \u00a39.40 after 10pm. The policy has been in place since 2022 to comply with the licensing requirement for more security staff.</p> <p>Some customers expressed their disappointment on social media at the price bump. One wrote on X: \u201cThis new idea of dynamic pricing is ridiculous, greedy and needs calling out. Very shortsighted.\u201d</p> <p>However, another noted that charging more during busier periods was similar to discounts and offers at quieter times. \u201cI was going to say I thought it was awful, but is it not simply \u2018happy hour\u2019 in reverse? \u201d</p> <p>Though it has angered many, O\u2019Neill\u2019s is not the first to introduce surge pricing. Dr Florian Stahl, a professor of marketing from Mannheim Business School, said this pricing model was likely to permeate into other areas, such as festivals and the energy sector.</p> <p>\u201cWe can expect surge pricing to expand into several industries in the UK, particularly in sectors with fluctuating demand patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cThis might include public transportation, where prices may increase during peak travel times or major events like concerts and festivals.\u201d</p> <p>Here are other industries that have implemented a form of surge pricing.</p> <h2><strong>Ride</strong><strong>-hailing apps</strong></h2>    <p>The cost of a cab using ride-hailing apps changes frequently but Uber and Bolt also practise surge pricing.</p> <p>Isabella Coolican, an associate in the competition team at Freeths law firm, said prices tended to become more expensive on Friday or Saturday evenings, during bad weather or after a concert or sports match because the demand exceeded supply.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why the same routes on an average Tuesday morning may be half the price,\u201d she added.</p> <p>According to Merlo, these cab-hire services \u201cuse surge pricing fundamentally to make sure that people who order a car are those that really need it\u201d and to \u201cget the drivers out when they are most needed\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m desperate for that Uber car when it\u2019s crowded, I\u2019m quite happy to pay more \u2026 and when I get it, I\u2019m happy that I get it. If it gets too expensive, maybe you\u2019re happy to jump on a tube instead.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Airlines and hotels</strong></h2> <p>Airlines have long used dynamic pricing models to determine the cost of flights. This is why trips during peak season tend to cost more.</p> <p>Hotels also use seasonal pricing, which involves adjusting prices based on the time of year. This was typically linked to demand, said Stahl, and was an area that surge-style pricing might creep further into.</p> <p>\u201cHotel prices in major cities or tourist destinations can fluctuate due to high demand during peak tourist seasons, events, or local holidays. In the hotel and accommodation industry, surge pricing might be implemented in real time based on demand, weather or last-minute bookings, affecting both hotels and short-term rental platforms like Airbnb.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Hospitality</strong></h2> <p>Restaurants, bars and pubs may increase prices during busier times such as celebrations or match days. However, this is something we might see on a more regular basis, Stahl said.</p> <p>Stonegate Group, Britain\u2019s largest pub group and owner of chains including the Slug &amp; Lettuce and Yates\u2019s, said it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/12/busy-pubs-charge-drinkers-more-slug-lettuce-yatess\">raising prices at 800 of its venues</a> during peak times, such as weekends, to help cover costs, including staffing.</p> <p>A pint of beer during the busiest periods would cost drinkers 20p more. It has previously done so during special events, such as World Cups.</p> <p>However, many venues offer happy hours or discounted lunch menus during less busy hours. These types of deals enticed customers and boosted sales during quieter periods, Stahl said.</p> <p>\u201cThese offers often include reduced prices, \u2018buy one, get one free\u2019 deals, or specials on select beverages. In contrast, lunch menus are available during midday hours and focus on offering discounted or fixed-price meals, often with smaller portions or limited choices to provide quick, affordable options.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Concert tickets</strong></h2>    <p>Music venues have a limited capacity, so when it comes to tickets for some of the biggest performers, demand outstrips supply.</p> <p>Many Oasis fans were furious after some of the tickets for their upcoming reunion tour jumped by more than double the price due to being in demand.</p> <p>Shows were initially advertised at \u00a3148.50, but when fans finally reached the front of the queue, often after hours of waiting, many found that basic standing tickets had gone up to \u00a3355.20.</p> <p>Merlo said consumers often became frustrated if they felt they were not getting value for money. \u201cUsually, if [people] perceive that they are getting more value, they are willing to pay more. With the Oasis ticket debacle, they just got a higher price, and so that leads to this kind of disappointment.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Theme parks</strong></h2> <p>To deal with a post-Covid shortfall, there may be more surge pricing applied to prices at theme parks.</p> <p>This year, Merlin Entertainments, the owner of Legoland, Madame Tussauds, and Alton Towers, said it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/25/legoland-alton-towers-charge-more-peak-times-merlin-entertainments-surge-pricing\">planned to introduce surge pricing</a> so families would pay more on peak summer weekends than weekdays.</p> <p>\u200b\u200bThe system will use machine learning to flex prices in response to supply and demand \u2013 in a similar way to that deployed by cut-price airlines, cab-hailing services and some hotels.</p> <h2><strong>Utilities and bills</strong></h2> <p>Another area Merlo said we could see dynamic pricing was in energy and utilities, particularly because of the adoption of smart meters and internet of things devices.</p> <p>The watchdog <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/mar/25/energy-price-cap-ofgem-great-britain\">Ofgem launched a consultation this year</a> to decide whether to introduce a \u201cdynamic\u201d price cap, under which British households would be charged based on the time of day they use their energy. During busier periods, energy suppliers could charge more for electricity, but customers could also save money at quieter times.</p> <p>This kind of surge pricing model would probably apply only to customers with smart meters on variable tariffs, Ofgem said.</p> <p>According to Merlo, \u201cwith the availability of data, the availability of technology, we\u2019re going to probably see [dynamic pricing] more and more. AI technologies are allowing for a lot of these contexts in which dynamic pricing is being used to be expanded.\u201d</p>",

In the hotel and accommodation industry, surge pricing might be implemented in real time based on demand, weather or last-minute bookings, affecting both hotels and short-term rental platforms like Airbnb.\u201d Hospitality Restaurants, bars and pubs may increase prices during busier times such as celebrations or match days. However, this is something we might see on a more regular basis, Stahl said. Stonegate Group, Britain\u2019s largest pub group and owner of chains including the Slug &amp; Lettuce and Yates\u2019s, said it was raising prices at 800 of its venues during peak times, such as weekends, to help cover costs, including staffing. A pint of beer during the busiest periods would cost drinkers 20p more. It has previously done so during special events, such as World Cups. However, many venues offer happy hours or discounted lunch menus during less busy hours. These types of deals enticed customers and boosted sales during quieter periods, Stahl said. \u201cThese offers often include reduced prices, \u2018buy one, get one free\u2019 deals, or specials on select beverages. In contrast, lunch menus are available during midday hours and focus on offering discounted or fixed-price meals, often with smaller portions or limited choices to provide quick, affordable options.\u201d Concert tickets Music venues have a limited capacity, so when it comes to tickets for some of the biggest performers, demand outstrips supply. Many Oasis fans were furious after some of the tickets for their upcoming reunion tour jumped by more than double the price due to being in demand. Shows were initially advertised at \u00a3148.50, but when fans finally reached the front of the queue, often after hours of waiting, many found that basic standing tickets had gone up to \u00a3355.20. Merlo said consumers often became frustrated if they felt they were not getting value for money. \u201cUsually, if [people] perceive that they are getting more value, they are willing to pay more. With the Oasis ticket debacle, they just got a higher price, and so that leads to this kind of disappointment.\u201d Theme parks To deal with a post-Covid shortfall, there may be more surge pricing applied to prices at theme parks. This year, Merlin Entertainments, the owner of Legoland, Madame Tussauds, and Alton Towers, said it planned to introduce surge pricing so families would pay more on peak summer weekends than weekdays. The system will use machine learning to flex prices in response to supply and demand \u2013 in a similar way to that deployed by cut-price airlines, cab-hailing services and some hotels. Utilities and bills Another area Merlo said we could see dynamic pricing was in energy and utilities, particularly because of the adoption of smart meters and internet of things devices. The watchdog Ofgem launched a consultation this year to decide whether to introduce a \u201cdynamic\u201d price cap, under which British households would be charged based on the time of day they use their energy. During busier periods, energy suppliers could charge more for electricity, but customers could also save money at quieter times. This kind of surge pricing model would probably apply only to customers with smart meters on variable tariffs, Ofgem said. According to Merlo, \u201cwith the availability of data, the availability of technology, we\u2019re going to probably see [dynamic pricing] more and more. AI technologies are allowing for a lot of these contexts in which dynamic pricing is being used to be expanded.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I haven\u2019t kept many things from my teenage&nbsp;years. I have a box of photos \u2013 hazy snapshots from holidays and parties, captured on disposable cameras and developed at Boots. I&nbsp;have a stack of A-level psychology notes, kept in homage to my subsequent career. And I &nbsp;have&nbsp;a letter, from a boy called Ben (not his real name),&nbsp;written when we were both 17. We were friends&nbsp;first, and then he was my boyfriend, and then&nbsp;he broke my heart.</p> <p>I took the train to school, and for years Ben and I&nbsp;would walk to and from the station, sometimes bouncing a tennis ball back and forth between us as we spoke. We discovered films together, and music and books, and at the weekends we got drunk with our friends. When half of our year group descended on Newquay for a week after our GCSEs, we lay on the beach together one night, singing at the top of our lungs. More than anything, though, we talked: about life, about who we thought we might be, and what we wanted from the blurry future ahead.</p> <p>In the early years, Ben and I were \u201cjust friends\u201d: I&nbsp;had&nbsp;a boyfriend, then he had a girlfriend. But eventually, inevitably, something happened. We were 17, and in the stretched time warp of the teenage years, it truly felt like we had waited for that moment for ever. I had driven to his house after a party, his parents were out, and on the sofa in his living room, we kissed. I remember we said \u201cOh my God\u201d to each other afterwards, again and again, all the words blending into one. It wasn\u2019t even days before I told him I loved him; it was barely an hour.</p> <p>The weeks that followed were weightless. I was delighted to be seen with him, for people to know I was his girlfriend. Around that time, he wrote me the letter. It began with the list of things he loved about me. Then&nbsp;he told me he couldn\u2019t believe this was happening, that whatever difficulty we had now or in the future, we would work through it, that he couldn\u2019t believe how lucky he was. He ended with the words: \u201cSorry for the incoherence of this letter, I want you in my bed.\u201d If I had been on cloud nine before, that letter sent me into space.</p> <p>About two weeks later, Ben broke up with me. There was no clear justification \u2013 maybe something about wanting his freedom, but nothing that remotely explained how abruptly and totally he had changed his mind. But that was it. I had to go to school with him the next day, and every other day after that. Due to a stroke of adminsitrative bad luck, we sat our A-levels at adjacent desks. Then, and every day since we had broken up, he blanked me.</p> <p>The immediate aftermath was awful. I remember standing in the shower, wondering how long it would take me to stop loving him. Of course, I did stop eventually: I went to university, moved on with my life, and fell in love again. But for years, I would dream about him regularly. The dreams were always the same: we were reunited in some way, and he apologised. Often, my now-partner appeared in the dreams, maybe an attempt from my sleep-addled brain to remind me that things had long moved on, that I was happy now. Until recently, I was truly ashamed of these night-time visits: a woman in her 30s still dreaming about a brief teenage love affair.</p> <p>Then I started writing a book about adolescence. In doing so, I realised I wasn\u2019t the only one to experience a hugely impactful relationship in my teenage years. I read about a 2003 study, in which adults aged 20 to 94 were <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03196077\">asked</a> to recall when in their life they had felt various emotions most strongly. Participants in their 20s tended to report being most in love right now, but for all other age groups, the peak was at age 15. When I read about this it floored me: these are often the most emotionally intense relationships of our lives.</p> <p>Yet in society, teenage love is dismissed. The phrase \u201cpuppy love\u201d is used, denoting something juvenile: a transient, infantile affection. There seems to be a real appetite and respect for teenage lovers in fiction \u2013 from Romeo and Juliet to Normal People\u2019s Connell and Marianne \u2013 that is utterly at odds with the attitudes held about teenage love in the real world. It is as though we give ourselves permission to acknowledge the power of adolescent love in stories, but cannot acknowledge it publicly about ourselves.</p> <p>This dismissal has huge consequences for actual teenagers, from the simple fact of their pain being ignored to something far worse. In 2023, 15-year-old Holly Newton was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0l90lvl0qo\">murdered</a> by her 16-year-old ex-boyfriend, who had obsessively stalked and controlled her. Despite it being obviously relevant that they were once in a romantic relationship, the courts have not officially recorded that Holly was a victim of domestic violence, because she was under 16. But there is ample research <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X10000682\">evidence</a> that teenagers, particularly boys, can be violent and abusive to their romantic partners, and that the psychological consequences for victims are just as real as they are in adulthood.</p> <p>Once you understand the context of adolescent development, the gravity of these relationships becomes easier to understand. Adolescence is a critical period of identity formation, when for the first time we grapple with that fundamental question: \u201c<em>Who am I?\u201d</em> We look to others for the answer. The psychologist Erik Erikson, writing in 1968, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Identity_Youth_and_Crisis.html?id=v3XWH2PDLewC\">summed up</a> adolescent love as an \u201cattempt to arrive at the definition of one\u2019s identity by projecting one\u2019s diffused self-image on another and seeing it thus reflected and gradually clarified\u201d.</p> <p>On top of this, in teenage relationships, developing identities become intertwined. When my own relationship ended at 17, I realised that everything I\u2019d discovered about myself over the preceding years was knotted up with memories of Ben. The only way to extract him from my brain was to destroy pieces of myself, obliterating the nascent identity I thought I liked. Seeing it through this lens, I finally started to understand why the aftermath was so hard.</p> <p>For the first time, I also began to understand things from Ben\u2019s point of view. The <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167696817700261\">research</a> shows that teenagers often initiate break ups when they feel the relationship is hindering or blocking certain fundamental needs, such as for intimacy, autonomy or social status. To a teenager, a romantic relationship can represent a liberating opportunity \u2013 for sexual experience, personal affirmation, social status, fun \u2013 but if it then traps them into a commitment, it can quickly end up becoming precisely the opposite. I understood that the boy I had given my heart to was an adolescent too, just trying to understand who he was.</p> <p>While I was writing about all this, something else&nbsp;happened: I saw Ben again. One of my friends from school had stayed in touch with him, and we were both invited to her wedding. On the day itself, as I got ready in my bedroom in the hotel, my nervousness made me numb. Somehow my legs carried me downstairs, and then there he was: right in front of me, talking to me with his wife by his side.</p> <p>By seeing Ben as a married man in his 30s, I realised&nbsp;the 17-year-old who broke my heart didn\u2019t exist&nbsp;any&nbsp;more. That boy had been replaced by a stranger&nbsp;who merely looked like him. Finally, the ghost that&nbsp;roamed my nocturnal mind began to fade. But I&nbsp;will&nbsp;always keep his letter. That letter represents a&nbsp;fundamental experience that made me who I am: truly&nbsp;loving someone for their mind, and being loved&nbsp;like that, however briefly, in return. It also represents the fact that I coped with being unloved, at a young&nbsp;and fragile age, and that\u2019s part of who I am as well. The letter was a wound, and then a scar, and now&nbsp;I&nbsp;am finally healed.</p> <p>\u2022 Lucy Foulkes is the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/coming-of-age-9781847927293/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article\">Coming of Age</a> (Vintage).</p> <h2><strong>Further reading</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/conversations-on-love-9780241448731?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Conversations on Love </a>by Natasha Lunn (Viking, \u00a310.99)</p> <p><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/inventing-ourselves-9781784161347/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Inventing Ourselves</a> by Sarah-Jayne Blakemore (Black Swan, \u00a310.99)</p> <p><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-incredible-teenage-brain-9781785925573/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">The Incredible Teenage Brain</a> by Bettina Hohnen, Jane Gilmour and Tara Murphy (Jessica Kingsley, \u00a316.99)</p>",

Officials at the heart of Trump\u2019s first administration have spoken of purging thousands of federal workers by using controversial powers to reshape the bureaucracy. Now, inside dozens of government agencies, staff are bracing for Trump\u2019s second administration. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty bleak,\u201d said Steve Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents 110,000 employees at various agencies around the US. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty grim.\u201d The former president attacked federal employees on the campaign trail, claiming they were \u201cdestroying this country\u201d in an August podcast interview. \u201cThey\u2019re crooked people, they\u2019re dishonest people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be held accountable.\u201d Trump has signaled his support for reviving the Schedule F executive order he issued in the final days of his last administration, under which swaths of the federal workforce could be stripped of their civil servant protections and redefined as political appointees.

The success of Project 2025, the rightwing plan for Trump\u2019s presidency, \u201crevolves around\u201d the implementation of Schedule F, he added: reclassifying roles typically filled by career government employees as political, \u201cand having the ability to, you know, threaten, harass, intimidate or fire them\u201d. Emboldened by a supreme court decision earlier this year that former presidents are entitled to some degree of immunity from criminal prosecution, Trump is \u201cgoing to do some pretty amazing things that we\u2019ve never seen before, and I think it\u2019s going to be pretty horrible\u201d, said Lenkart.

I tell my children to study hard for their future, because we don\u2019t know what the government or anyone will do to help us. We don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll survive or start again. We don\u2019t know where to begin. For me, this situation shows who your real friends are and who\u2019s willing to help from the heart. I\u2019m thankful to my neighbours and many others in our barangay [district] who didn\u2019t abandon us. No matter the situation, we survived, and I\u2019ll never forget this experience. Now, we are doing our best to keep our family together.

      "bodyText": "Righto, that\u2019s us done for today. Congratulations Australia on scooping the T20 series and to Pakistan for bagging the ODI series before it. We\u2019ll be back in a week or so to bring you the small matter of The Border-Gavaskar Trophy - five Test matches between Australia and India. Ding Dong. Thanks for joining us, goodbye. Australia Captain Josh Inglis*: It\u2019s been a great week. We\u2019ve had a lot of fun as a group. It\u2019s been really nice. When Stoinis is going like that, he is really hard to stop. I think the six he hit out of the stadium was one of the biggest i\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d *Still with a hint of his native Leeds accent. (By\u2019eck &gt; strewth) Spencer Johnson is named Player of the Series for his eight wickets: I wasn\u2019t really expecting that! It\u2019s nice to be back in the green and gold and happy to get the series win. Every opportunity to play for Australia is a good one and hopefully I\u2019ll continue to do well.\u201d \u2018The Big Stoin\u2019 (see i\u2019m doing it now\u2026 ) powers another SIX over long on and then Abbas Afridi slings down a chest high full toss that is called a NO BALL. That\u2019ll be the win for Australia, they take the T20 portion of the series 3-0 and finish in some style. 10th over: Australia 111-3 (Stoinis 55 , David 7) Yikes. 25 runs smeared off Shaheen\u2019s over. Absolute carnage in Hobart as Marcus Stoinis opens his vast shoulders and peppers the stands. A flick for SIX, a drive for four down the ground and a monster over midwicket see Stoinis to FIFTY off just 23 balls. David then weighs in with a SIX of his own off the final ball of the over, crunched over deep point. Phew. 10th over: Australia 86-3 (Stoinis 38 , David 1) Tim David joins Stoinis in the middle. Two beefy hitters, this could be over in a hurry. Meanwhile\u2026 (!) Australia putting the foot down but Inglis tries a cheeky scoop that goes straight to Rauf at fine leg. 9th over: Australia 79-2 (Inglis 22, Stoinis 37) Stoinis goes down the ground for four and then follows up next ball with a towering SIX off Haris Rauf. That was a humongous hit \u2013 shades of Liam Livingstone dispatching Rauf at Headingley a few years ago. Stoinis is ticking here, he hangs back and drives forcefully for four more through the off side and then smashes another SIX \u2013 a mighty blow wide of mid-on that has the Aussie commentators on my TV doing vocal cartwheels. They keep referring to him as \u2018The Big Stoin\u2019 which I am actually quite enjoying despite myself. 22 runs blitzed off the over. Australia need 39 more off plenty 66 balls. 8th over: Australia 57-2 (Inglis 21, Stoinis 16) Stoinis slams a four off Sufiyan Muqeem but then nearly perishes playing a pre-meditated reverse-dab that drops short of the man on the \u201845 by this much. 7th over: Australia 48-2 (Inglis 19, Stoinis 9) Haris Rauf has put the skids on a little, just five runs off the over. 6th over: Australia 43-2 (Inglis 16, Stoinis 7) Jahandad Khan is unlucky, snaring the edge of Josh Inglis\u2019 bat but the ball runs away fine for four. 5th over: Australia 38-2 (Inglis 12, Stoinis 6) Kablammo! Stoinis rocks back and nails a cut shot to the fence off Haris Rauf. The ball skimming across the outfield like a pebble across a glacier, faster than a cat on a hot tin roof, insert other simile here. 4th over: Australia 31-2 (Inglis 10, Stoinis 1) Marcus Stoinis joins his captain out in the middle, getting off the mark to his third delivery with a measured pull into the leg side. Jake Fraser-McGurk throws his head back in frustration as he lashes a full delivery straight down the throat of short cover. Not the first time he\u2019s done that after looking very good early in the piece. Australia lose their second\u2026 3rd over: Australia 25-1 (Fraser-McGurk 18, Inglis 5) Captain Josh Inglis comes to the crease and immediately picks up four runs with a glide through backward point. Swiss clock timing on that one. A single brings Fraser-McGurk on strike and he finishes the over in some style, pinging cover drive to the fence, stand and admire young man! Shaheen Shah Afridi foxes Short with a slower ball that the batter is suckered into playing way to early, gifting a catch to Irfan Khan at mid on. Pakistan have their first and they need a lot more, pronto. 2nd over: Australia 16-0 (Fraser-McGurk 14, Short 2) Jahandad Khan the debutant left-arm seamer shares the new ball and settles into his international career well. Five tidy balls on and around a length and a couple of slower balls thrown in for good measure. JFM decides enough is enough and hacks the final ball of the over down the ground for four. Didn\u2019t middle it but got enough. 1st over: Australia 10-0 (Fraser-McGurk 9, Short 1) Shaheen Shah Afridi is driven through cover for four by Fraser-McGurk and then is unlucky to be edged meatily wide of the keeper and away for four. Ten runs off the first in total for Australia. Here come Australia, Jake Fraser-McGurk and Matthew Short out will get the chase underway. Ah, I knew I\u2019d spotted Adam Zampa\u2019s new hairdo somewhere before\u2026 Spencer Johnson cleans up Sufiyan Muqeem with a bullseye yorker that splatters middle stump. That\u2019s the end of a bit of a shocker for Pakistan, they were going well at 61-2 after six and a bit overs but the wheels came off after, losing 9-56 off the next 69 deliveries. Australia will chase 118 to win the series 3-0 in about ten minutes or so. 18th over: Pakistan 117-9 (Rauf 0, Sufiyan Muqeem 0) Not long now\u2026 The debutant Jahandad Khan tries to flick Ellis for six but is well caught by a diving Stoinis on the boundary. 17th over: Pakistan 116-8 (J Khan 5, Rauf 0) Haris Rauf replaces his fellow fast bowler. Pakistan spluttering at the Bellerive Oval. Shaheen slams Bartlett over midwicket for a huge SIX onto the grass bank but then tamely gloves the next ball to keeper Inglis. It was a slower ball bouncer but it looks to have hurt Shaheen\u2019s hand/fingers. He gives them a rueful shake as he walks from the middle. 16th over: Pakistan 107-7 (J Khan 3, S Shah Afridi 9) Aaron Hardie back into the attack. Shaheen tries a huge smear over leg but fails to connect. Hardie gifts a free hit and is whipped away into the leg side for four by Shaheen. A thick outside edge off the last ball trickles away for four more to bring the hundred up for Pakistan. They need a strong finish here to try and post a vaguely competitive total. A sorry looking Glenn Maxwell is now changed into his tracksuit and sat forlornly in the dugout. Doesn\u2019t look like good news on the knee/hamstring injury. 15th over: Pakistan 95-7 (J Khan 2, S Shah Afridi 1) Here come old flat-top, he come groovin\u2019 up slowly. Jahandad Khan and Shaheen Shah Afridi come together in the middle. Adam Zampa nearly cleans both men up in his final over but somehow they survive. The leg-spinner finishes with 2-11 from his four overs. Well bowled that man. 14th over: Pakistan 92-7 (J Khan 0, S Shah Afridi 0) Two wickets in the over and no runs. Pakistan in a lot of trouble in Hobart. Afridi doesn\u2019t last much longer \u2013 pulls Hardie into the leg side where Tim David\u2019s bucket hands do the honours. Gone! Bad cricket from Abbas Afridi who barbecues his partner! Afridi clips into the leg side and calls Irfan Khan for a single that does not exist, Afridi realises this and sends Khan back but it is waaay too late, Johnson has collected the ball and thrown down the stumps with a direct hit. 13th over: Pakistan 92-5 (Irfan Khan 10, Abbas Afridi 1) Zampa licks his lips as a skittish looking Abbas Afridi arrives in the middle. Glenn Maxwell nearly runs him out after his first ball with the batter taking a dosy wander out of his crease. Uh uo. Maxwell has tweaked a hamstring in the process by the looks of it, he gingerly walks off. More on that as we get it. Zampa bowls Babar! The spinner gets his man and the big fish is snared by Australia. Looking to get on with it, Babar came dancing down but ended up yorking himself. Trouble now for the visitors. 12th over: Pakistan 89-4 (Babar 40, Irfan Khan 9) Inglis shuffles his pack as Ellis replaces Hardie. Babar nudges into the leg side and they come back for a well scampered two runs. Babar had to fire up the afterburners a little bit there. Seven runs collected off the over. Zampa is coming back for the next. 11th over: Pakistan 82-4 (Babar 36, Irfan Khan 6) Spencer Johnson replaces Zampa. I\u2019d have been tempted to keep Zampa on and go for the kill. But, then again, I am not the Australian cricket captain. Important to remember that. Shot! Khan pulls a short ball for four, the first boundary since the Powerplay. 10th over: Pakistan 72-4 (Babar 32, Irfan Khan 1) Irfan Khan to the middle and, like a lanky lemur or a drunk in the pub, Pakistan have a long tail after this pair. Another one gone! Pakistan have lost 3-9 in the last three overs. Agha is pinned on the back leg and it looks stone DEAD. A painful Agha innings comes to an end \u2013 just one run in nine balls. Babar still there but can\u2019t get a sniff of strike at the minute as things jam up and fall to pieces down the other end. 9th over: Pakistan 67-3 (Babar 28, Agha 1) Just a single off an excellent Zampa over. Australia slamming the brakes on since the Powerplay. Babar cannot get any strike, takes a single off the first ball of the over and then Agha is tied down and can\u2019t return the favour. 8th over: Pakistan 66-3 (Babar 27, Agha 1) Salman Agha joins a strike deprived Babar in the middle. Pakistan just starting to totter. Aaron Hardie into the attack, Usman Khan dances down and gives himself space to hack into the off side but his flat bat shot finds Ellis on the sponge. A gift of a wicket that, not a pretty shot. 7th over: Pakistan 62-2 (Babar 26, Usman Khan 1) Khan arrives at the crease at nudges his first ball for a single to farm the strike off Babar. Adam Zampa is the man to prise the wicket for Australia! A googly is misread by Haseebullah Khan and spliced into the off side. Australia needed that and a newly bleached and shorn Zampa celebrates, minimally. 6th over: Pakistan 58-1 (Babar 23, Haseebullah 24) Nathan Ellis replaces Spencer Johnson and is immediately greeted with a scythe for four over point from Haseebullah. The makeshift opener squeezed for three behind square and plays a delightful late cut for three more. Lovely batting. Powerplay done and Australia in need of a breakthrough. 5th over: Pakistan 46-1 (Babar 22, Haseebullah 13) Marcus Stoinis chugs in, Alpine vast shoulders bursting out his shirt. Babar Azam purrs into action! Sixteen runs off the over and three Babar boundaries \u2013 a half volley driven handsomely down the ground, a flick fine off his pads and a glide wide of point. Pure class. 4th over: Pakistan 30-1 (Babar 10, Haseebullah 11) A tidy over from Johnson is blotted slightly by a top edge from Haseebullah that flies away over the keeper for four. Neither side pulling away from the other at the moment. 3rd over: Pakistan 24-1 (Babar 9, Haseebullah 6) Bartlett still spraying it around, a short and wide delivery is lashed wide of point for four by Haseebullah. The bowler tightens things up with a couple of well executed yorkers and Pakistan can only muster two more singles off the over. There\u2019s no swing out there to speak of and the pitch looks flatter than a drunken karaoke session. 2nd over: Pakistan 18-1 (Babar 8, Haseebullah 1) Haseebullah Khan is the new batter. He eases his second ball to long on to pick up a single and keep strike. Johnson tests out the middle of the pitch with a bouncer, Farhan tries to swat it away but gets in a mess, sending a soft catch up in the air to midwicket where he is easily caught. Spencer Johnson, fresh off his five-fer in the last match at Sydney, is starting from the other end. Back to earth with a bump! Farhan drives down the ground compactly for three and Babar launches the bowler back over his head for another superlative boundary\u2026 wait a minute though\u2026 1st over: Pakistan 10-0 (Farhan 5, Babar 5) Xavier Bartlett has the ball in hand for Australia. We\u2019ll have some seam to start. Play! Farhan clips through midwicket where a fumble allows a third run and brings Babar on strike. Four! No messing about from the Prince of Pakistani batting, a full ball is timed away off the pads for a boundary first ball. It\u2019s a loosey goosey start from Bartlett who can\u2019t find his radar. Pakistan take ten from the first over. Here come the players, bright skies in Hobart, I don\u2019t think the weather is going to get involved in this one. The word is that Sahibzada Farhan is set to open alongside Babar Azam for the visitors, can the two men get Pakistan off to a flier and put some pressure on this nascent Aussie side? Time to find out. It looks like a beautiful evening in Hobart. We\u2019ll have the first ball in a quarter of an hour. Excuse me for one second whilst I \u2018compartmentalise\u2019 a rowdy toddler and grind up some much needed Lavazza. Salman Agha wins the toss as Mohammad Rizwan is presumably putting his feet up for this one. The stand-in captain decides to have first use of the Hobart wicket. Australia are unchanged whereas the visitors have handed a debut to southpaw pace bowler Jahandad Khan. Teams: Australia: Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matt Short, Josh Inglis (c &amp; wk), Glenn Maxwell, Tim David, Marcus Stoinis, Aaron Hardie, Xavier Bartlett, Nathan Ellis, Adam Zampa, Spencer Johnson Pakistan: Babar Azam, Sahibzada Farhan, Haseebullah Khan (wk), Usman Khan, Salman Agha (c), Irfan Khan, Abbas Afridi, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Jahandad Khan, Haris Rauf, Sufiyan Muqeem Meanwhile, it looks like Jason Gillespie isn\u2019t going to be axed. Not yet at least: Whilst we wait for the coin toss, get your peepers around this: Inside Hockley\u2019s modest Jolimont office, within sight of the MCG, a sequinned pink and purple costume of a cartoon woman shaped like a cricket bat grabs your attention. It was worn by the backing dancers supporting Katy Perry at the landmark 2020 World Cup final and now occupies the corner. Sitting opposite, Hockley adds one final thought. \u201cIt feels a bit premature, but I\u2019ve been very fortunate, you\u2019ve helped me reflect a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cOne thing I\u2019m not good at is celebrating our successes, I\u2019m just very like \u2018on to the next thing\u2019. But I\u2019m getting better at trying to celebrate everyone\u2019s hard work. And then the other bit is I\u2019m not very good at enjoying the cricket and the event days, because you feel very responsible, and you just want to make sure everything\u2019s right. So I\u2019m determined to enjoy this summer. Hello and welcome to the final T20 between Australia and Pakistan from the Bellerive Oval in Hobart* Australia have wrapped up the three match series already, Spencer Johnson pocketing 5-26 in Sydney to see Josh Inglis\u2019 transitional side go 2-0 up with one to play. There\u2019s no such thing as a dead rubber in the modern game though, Pakistan will be looking to end their white ball tour on a high after a rousing victory in the ODI series and plenty of Australia\u2019s young players will be looking to put in strong performances that stick in the minds of the selectors with the big guns due to come back to the fold imminently. Play begins in a little over half an hour, 7pm AEDT and 8am GMT. I\u2019ll be back with the news of the teams and toss very soon. *By way of a seen-better-days sofa in a murky dawned London town.

Trump has nominated Kennedy to oversee US health agencies despite his propagation of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. \u201cI think Bobby Kennedy\u2019s views on vaccines are dangerous \u2026 but I don\u2019t think that most Americans share them. So we\u2019ll just have to wait and see what happens,\u201d she told reporters in Canberra. The daughter of the late president John F Kennedy also criticized Trump\u2019s pick of Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence. The choice of Gabbard, a supporter of Russia, would \u201cobviously \u2026 be of great concern\u201d, she said. What could be the impact of RFK Jr\u2019s nomination? Dr Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said even if public policies remained unchanged, authorities from the federal government speaking out against vaccines \u201cdiscourages people who might otherwise be vaccinated, and at that point that\u2019s as bad as not having a vaccine at all\u201d. Israel intensifies bombing as Beirut airstrike kills Hezbollah media chief Hezbollah\u2019s chief spokesperson has been killed by an Israeli airstrike on Beirut, as Israel intensifies its air offensive in Lebanon despite ongoing indirect negotiations for a ceasefire. Mohammed Afif, who has been the public face of Hezbollah for months, was killed in a strike on the offices of the Ba\u2019ath party in Ras al-Nabaa, central Beirut. The attack in the busy residential area came without warning, and appeared to damage neighbouring buildings. Witnesses said they saw four bodies at the scene of the strike, which took place a day before Lebanon was expected to deliver its response to a US-delivered ceasefire proposal. What is the humanitarian fallout from the conflict? In Lebanon, 3,481 people have been killed since Israel invaded on 1 October, including 29 in the past 24 hours, health officials said Sunday. What about Gaza? After the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed 1,200 people and during which 250 were taken hostage, Israel has bombarded the territory with airstrikes and a ground invasion. Infrastructure has been decimated, the population displaced multiple times and brought close to starvation, and 43,799 people have been killed, according to Gaza health officials, with a UN Human Rights Office verifying nearly 70% were women and children. The death toll is understood to be an underestimate, with the UN estimating in May 2024 that more than 10,000 people\u2019s bodies are under the rubble.

Instead of pandering to \u2013 and promoting \u2013 the worst instincts of his base, Trump, long preoccupied by his image, may begin to contemplate his legacy. Will history mock or admire him? The greater his concern with his lasting reputation, the better our chances of averting disaster.</p> <p>Ukraine illustrates the choices ahead.

A democratic Ukraine on Russia\u2019s border is a constant reminder to the Russian people of the freedoms that Putin\u2019s dictatorship denies them. He wants another Belarus.</p> <p>No amount of strongman-admiration on Trump\u2019s part will overcome the Ukrainian people\u2019s refusal to become another Kremlin vassal state. Nor will it avoid Ukraine\u2019s understandable <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/article/ukraine-russia-and-the-minsk-agreements-a-post-mortem/\">distrust</a> of Putin and insistence on western security guarantees if there is to be any formal accord. Trump as Chamberlain would be indifferent to Kyiv\u2019s pleas. A Trump sensitive to his place in history might be more accommodating.</p> <p>Moreover, a humiliating surrender for Ukraine would hardly go unnoticed in Beijing. Trump might try to spin it as enabling greater focus on China, which he rightly sees as a <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/online/2020/01/14/how-china-threatens-human-rights-worldwide/\">threat</a>, but Xi Jinping is likely to read it as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china-implies-trump-could-discard-taiwan-2024-10-30/\">a lack of resolve</a>. If Trump will not defend an aspiring democracy on the threshold of the European Union, why would he prevent Beijing from incorporating Taiwan by threatened or actual force?

He laughably claims that China would pay for the tariffs, ignoring the near-universal view of economists that the cost would be passed on to American <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/opinion/trump-tariffs-economy.html\">consumers</a>.</p> <p>Trump contends that tariffs would force more manufacturing to US soil, but a battle of tit-for-tat tariffs would more immediately fuel <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/30/companies-tariffs-trump-prices/\">inflation</a>. During the campaign, Trump played on many Americans\u2019 mistaken <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/business/economy/inflation-prices-economy.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare\">tendency</a> to equate higher prices from past inflation with ongoing inflation, but they would soon appreciate the difference as prices again soared.</p> <p>Biden showed the way toward a smarter trade policy \u2013 one built on common values rather than mere competition \u2013 that Trump would be wise to continue and expand.

During his first term, he gave Benjamin Netanyahu whatever he wanted, from recognizing <a href=\"https://il.usembassy.gov/statement-by-president-trump-on-jerusalem/\">Jerusalem</a> as Israel\u2019s capital to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/world/middleeast/trump-israel-west-bank-settlements.html\">greenlighting</a> rapid expansion of Israel\u2019s illegal (war-crime) settlements and refusing to call Palestinian land \u201c<a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/trumps-state-department-no-longer-calls-west-bank-occupied-in-annual-report/\">occupied</a>\u201d. Now, Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/30/trump-harris-election-democracy-autocracy/\">says</a> that Biden has imposed too many restraints on the Israeli prime minister \u2013 by pushing him to stop bombing and starving Palestinian civilians \u2013 even though Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/11/us-un-human-rights-israel\">refused</a> to use the leverage of conditioning US arms sales and military aid to enforce those demands.

That would outrage the world and almost surely yield additional war-crime charges from the international criminal court (ICC).</p> <p>During Trump\u2019s last term, he disgracefully imposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/11/trump-icc-us-war-crimes-investigation-sanctions\">sanctions</a> on the prior ICC prosecutor for opening investigations that could implicate Israeli officials in Palestinian territory as well as US torturers under George W Bush in Afghanistan.

Netanyahu is itching for Trump to join him in a military attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, but that would risk involving American forces in a regional war that Trump wants to avoid. It would also endanger the Gulf states\u2019 oil supplies, fueling inflation. And it would only encourage Iran to obtain a ready-made nuclear weapon from, say, North Korea. Is that what Trump wants?</p> <p>More broadly, Trump needs to decide whether to continue his professed admiration for the world\u2019s autocrats.

Trump can hardly trumpet his artful dealmaking when word is out that a round of calculated fawning is all it takes to manipulate his fragile ego.

      "bodyText": "The nightmare has arrived. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d norm-flouting was bad enough the last time around, when a collection of traditional Republicans in senior positions moderated his worst impulses. No such grown-ups are expected to return. Our only hope may be that Trump no longer must worry about re-election. Instead of pandering to \u2013 and promoting \u2013 the worst instincts of his base, Trump, long preoccupied by his image, may begin to contemplate his legacy. Will history mock or admire him? The greater his concern with his lasting reputation, the better our chances of averting disaster. Ukraine illustrates the choices ahead. Does Trump really want to be known as the Neville Chamberlain of the 21st century, appeasing a brutal tyrant in the naive hope that he will be sated with a single gulp of ill-gotten territory? For reasons that are not wholly understood, Trump has long harbored an unseemly admiration for Vladimir Putin. Trump is likely to stop sending arms to Ukraine and to insist that Kyiv settle for at best a frozen conflict, in effect ceding its occupied eastern territory to Russia. But with Trump in the White House, Putin is likely to want more. Behind Putin\u2019s self-serving rhetoric about denazifying Ukraine is a desire to de-democratize it. A democratic Ukraine on Russia\u2019s border is a constant reminder to the Russian people of the freedoms that Putin\u2019s dictatorship denies them. He wants another Belarus. No amount of strongman-admiration on Trump\u2019s part will overcome the Ukrainian people\u2019s refusal to become another Kremlin vassal state. Nor will it avoid Ukraine\u2019s understandable distrust of Putin and insistence on western security guarantees if there is to be any formal accord. Trump as Chamberlain would be indifferent to Kyiv\u2019s pleas. A Trump sensitive to his place in history might be more accommodating. Moreover, a humiliating surrender for Ukraine would hardly go unnoticed in Beijing. Trump might try to spin it as enabling greater focus on China, which he rightly sees as a threat, but Xi Jinping is likely to read it as a lack of resolve. If Trump will not defend an aspiring democracy on the threshold of the European Union, why would he prevent Beijing from incorporating Taiwan by threatened or actual force? Even close American allies such as Japan and South Korea would quickly recalibrate their need to accommodate Beijing. Is that what Trump wants to be remembered for? Trump mainly sees China as a commercial threat. Having hiked tariffs during his last presidency (Joe Biden maintained them), Trump now threatens to substantially increase them. He laughably claims that China would pay for the tariffs, ignoring the near-universal view of economists that the cost would be passed on to American consumers. Trump contends that tariffs would force more manufacturing to US soil, but a battle of tit-for-tat tariffs would more immediately fuel inflation. During the campaign, Trump played on many Americans\u2019 mistaken tendency to equate higher prices from past inflation with ongoing inflation, but they would soon appreciate the difference as prices again soared. Biden showed the way toward a smarter trade policy \u2013 one built on common values rather than mere competition \u2013 that Trump would be wise to continue and expand. Beyond subsidies, many Chinese producers exploit Beijing\u2019s use of Uyghur forced labor, especially in China\u2019s north-west province of Xinjiang. That forced labor infects exports of cotton, tomatoes, aluminum and, significantly, polysilicon, the building block of China\u2019s corner-the-market solar panels. Both the US government and the European Union claim to oppose importing the product of forced labor, but only the United States has created a legislative presumption against any imports from Xinjiang without proof that forced labor was not involved \u2013 proof that is impossible to obtain given China\u2019s opaque supply chains. The EU never adopted that presumption, so imports from Xinjiang have surged, while US imports have diminished. A smart policy on trade with China would push the EU to adopt a similar presumption. Trump should also have US customs officials pay more attention to Beijing\u2019s subterfuges, such as shipping from Xinjiang via other parts of China or even third countries to avoid the presumption. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza will demand a rethink from Trump. During his first term, he gave Benjamin Netanyahu whatever he wanted, from recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital to greenlighting rapid expansion of Israel\u2019s illegal (war-crime) settlements and refusing to call Palestinian land \u201coccupied\u201d. Now, Trump says that Biden has imposed too many restraints on the Israeli prime minister \u2013 by pushing him to stop bombing and starving Palestinian civilians \u2013 even though Biden refused to use the leverage of conditioning US arms sales and military aid to enforce those demands. Trump wants to let Israel \u201cfinish the job\u201d, ideally quickly, and told Netanyahu to \u201cdo what you have to do\u201d. But an unrestrained Netanyahu might heed the calls of his rightwing ministers to force the mass deportation of the Palestinians of Gaza to Egypt \u2013 a trip that, like the Nakba of 1948, is likely to be one-way.

      "body": "<p>Here is a 40-minute autobiographical jeu d\u2019esprit from Leos Carax, the renowned director of Les Amants du Pont-Neuf, Bad Blood, Holy Motors and Annette; a body of work featuring such stars as Juliette Binoche, Michel Piccoli, Kylie Minogue, Denis Lavant and Adam Driver. First unveiled at Cannes this year, the puckish elusiveness of the piece is announced in the title itself.</p> <p>C\u2019est Pas Moi, or It\u2019s Not Me, is a cine-collage essay in the manner of Godard, although the audio soundtrack does not quite have that papier-mache roughness that Godard often created. Godard\u2019s voice appears briefly in an answering-machine message to Carax, a fragment that Carax might not have dared include while the great man was still alive. It\u2019s a mosaic of Carax\u2019s movies, private videos, archival footage and classic clips, punctuated with big san-serif intertitles: gnomic maxims and prose-poem micro-fragments.</p> <p>The film is another moment to consider the great difference between the French film industry and that of the UK, the US, or really anywhere. What other non-French director, however prestigious, would be granted this kind of indulgence? Or would have wanted it, however seasoned it would be with irony and self-questioning?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJPQtYyzEIY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pJPQtYyzEIY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Perhaps you need to be a Carax fan to watch this, and for me \u2013 as precisely this kind of viewer \u2013 this short film has all of Carax\u2019s wit and whimsy, his distinctive streak of the grand and even the grandiose, his glam-rock self-dramatisation (there\u2019s a big role for the work of David Bowie), his gloomy despairing rage at the state of the world in the 20th and 21st centuries and his concurrent streak of personal melancholy. (The very existence of this short piece might announce Carax\u2019s conviction that his career is nearing its end \u2013 I hope not.)</p> <p>The clips themselves are entertaining, although there is something very surreal in seeing what looks like a French van in a black-and-white archive clip, broadcasting a tinny dubbed French voice, which on close inspection turns out to be from the Stockport Water Board. C\u2019est Pas Moi amuses \u2013 and discomfits.</p> <p>\u2022 C\u2019est Pas Moi is at the ICA, London, from 22 November.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Here is a 40-minute autobiographical jeu d\u2019esprit from Leos Carax, the renowned director of Les Amants du Pont-Neuf, Bad Blood, Holy Motors and Annette; a body of work featuring such stars as Juliette Binoche, Michel Piccoli, Kylie Minogue, Denis Lavant and Adam Driver. First unveiled at Cannes this year, the puckish elusiveness of the piece is announced in the title itself. C\u2019est Pas Moi, or It\u2019s Not Me, is a cine-collage essay in the manner of Godard, although the audio soundtrack does not quite have that papier-mache roughness that Godard often created. Godard\u2019s voice appears briefly in an answering-machine message to Carax, a fragment that Carax might not have dared include while the great man was still alive. It\u2019s a mosaic of Carax\u2019s movies, private videos, archival footage and classic clips, punctuated with big san-serif intertitles: gnomic maxims and prose-poem micro-fragments. The film is another moment to consider the great difference between the French film industry and that of the UK, the US, or really anywhere. What other non-French director, however prestigious, would be granted this kind of indulgence? Or would have wanted it, however seasoned it would be with irony and self-questioning? Perhaps you need to be a Carax fan to watch this, and for me \u2013 as precisely this kind of viewer \u2013 this short film has all of Carax\u2019s wit and whimsy, his distinctive streak of the grand and even the grandiose, his glam-rock self-dramatisation (there\u2019s a big role for the work of David Bowie), his gloomy despairing rage at the state of the world in the 20th and 21st centuries and his concurrent streak of personal melancholy. (The very existence of this short piece might announce Carax\u2019s conviction that his career is nearing its end \u2013 I hope not.) The clips themselves are entertaining, although there is something very surreal in seeing what looks like a French van in a black-and-white archive clip, broadcasting a tinny dubbed French voice, which on close inspection turns out to be from the Stockport Water Board. C\u2019est Pas Moi amuses \u2013 and discomfits. \u2022 C\u2019est Pas Moi is at the ICA, London, from 22 November.",

      "body": "<p>Are you feeling tired?* I\u2019m going to take an educated guess that the answer is yes. I think I know maybe one person who isn\u2019t tired. One of the most devastating moments of motherhood for me has been recovering from the trauma of a year of sleep deprivation only to discover that I am still tired, and I probably will be for the next 25 years, by which point I\u2019ll be tired because I\u2019ll be old.</p> <p>So, I have been wondering: what does it really mean to be tired? Why are we tired \u2013 and what kind of tired are we?</p> <p>I think we\u2019re all working very hard, all the time. We are working hard to survive, to look after our homes, our families and our friends; we face financial worries; we live with medical conditions. Some of this hard work contributes towards building a better life \u2013 but there is another kind of work that many of us are doing which does the opposite.</p> <p>Sometimes, feeling tired feels good. It is satisfying to feel the ache in my muscles after a pilates class, a swim in the sea, a good cry and a few other things that are best read between the lines. I sometimes even used to like a tired hangover if I had nothing to do but drink coffee and watch a film during the day (the ultimate tired pastime for someone who doesn\u2019t like naps).</p> <p>But I sometimes feel a different quality of fatigue sweeping through me. I notice it most acutely \u2013 as with most things \u2013 when I am with my psychoanalyst. It\u2019s a bone-tired, ready-to-give-up kind of slump. It is the draining of energy that comes from working very, very hard, unconsciously, to avoid certain emotions that I would rather not allow into my conscious mind. It is the exhaustion that comes from tension \u2013 grinding teeth to bite back anger, or clenching every facial muscle to hold in tears. In my experience, these are the most exhausting emotions to suppress, but all of it is draining work, and often we don\u2019t even know we\u2019re doing it.</p> <p>This kind of tiredness doesn\u2019t get better with sleep or rest; in fact, it seems to get worse. Unlike the kind of tiredness that follows exercise or some other enlivening activity, this fatigue comes from a deadening of our own insides. It\u2019s the kind of tired that a plant gets when it doesn\u2019t have enough water or light. A wilting. Wilted is how I feel when I leave my analytic session having worked so hard not to cry, and succeeded \u2013 when what I really needed was to let go and let myself feel.</p> <p>So if sleeping won\u2019t help, what will? Well, recuperating from this kind of tiredness is possible, but it is also painful. It involves developing the capacity to feel better \u2013 that is, to get better at feeling, allowing our emotional and psychological selves to truly come alive.</p> <p>Human beings have spent millennia searching for some way to feel more alive.

      "bodyText": "Are you feeling tired?* I\u2019m going to take an educated guess that the answer is yes. I think I know maybe one person who isn\u2019t tired. One of the most devastating moments of motherhood for me has been recovering from the trauma of a year of sleep deprivation only to discover that I am still tired, and I probably will be for the next 25 years, by which point I\u2019ll be tired because I\u2019ll be old. So, I have been wondering: what does it really mean to be tired? Why are we tired \u2013 and what kind of tired are we? I think we\u2019re all working very hard, all the time. We are working hard to survive, to look after our homes, our families and our friends; we face financial worries; we live with medical conditions. Some of this hard work contributes towards building a better life \u2013 but there is another kind of work that many of us are doing which does the opposite. Sometimes, feeling tired feels good. It is satisfying to feel the ache in my muscles after a pilates class, a swim in the sea, a good cry and a few other things that are best read between the lines. I sometimes even used to like a tired hangover if I had nothing to do but drink coffee and watch a film during the day (the ultimate tired pastime for someone who doesn\u2019t like naps). But I sometimes feel a different quality of fatigue sweeping through me. I notice it most acutely \u2013 as with most things \u2013 when I am with my psychoanalyst. It\u2019s a bone-tired, ready-to-give-up kind of slump. It is the draining of energy that comes from working very, very hard, unconsciously, to avoid certain emotions that I would rather not allow into my conscious mind. It is the exhaustion that comes from tension \u2013 grinding teeth to bite back anger, or clenching every facial muscle to hold in tears. In my experience, these are the most exhausting emotions to suppress, but all of it is draining work, and often we don\u2019t even know we\u2019re doing it. This kind of tiredness doesn\u2019t get better with sleep or rest; in fact, it seems to get worse. Unlike the kind of tiredness that follows exercise or some other enlivening activity, this fatigue comes from a deadening of our own insides. It\u2019s the kind of tired that a plant gets when it doesn\u2019t have enough water or light. A wilting. Wilted is how I feel when I leave my analytic session having worked so hard not to cry, and succeeded \u2013 when what I really needed was to let go and let myself feel. So if sleeping won\u2019t help, what will? Well, recuperating from this kind of tiredness is possible, but it is also painful. It involves developing the capacity to feel better \u2013 that is, to get better at feeling, allowing our emotional and psychological selves to truly come alive. Human beings have spent millennia searching for some way to feel more alive. Magic mushrooms, sex, music, moving very fast, going very high, going very far down, going very far away. When you put it like that, my choice of having psychoanalysis sounds rather tame. But that is not my experience of it. I have had moments lying on my analyst\u2019s couch when I have felt more alive even than when I saw a killer whale burst out of the ocean. It is no doubt revealing that this is the memory that came to mind. My psychoanalyst helps me to understand what it is in myself that I am killing off, and she is helping me to recognise and give voice to these different parts of me, little by little, little feeling by little feeling, so that all of my mind can truly come alive. And it\u2019s working. I used to feel empty inside. It was terrifying. I carried around this disturbing sense of feeling like an adult-looking carapace with nothing underneath: I had this vision of myself as a wizened old tortoise with a thick, weighty dark shell, with nothing but wisps of smoke inside.

Not that it was clear they were cauliflowers to begin with, so tight were the pale green leaves protecting most of the heads, although a few were visible, staring out like ghostly white faces. In her <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/jane-grigsons-vegetable-book-9780140273236/\">Vegetable Book</a>, Jane Grigson describes seeing a man near the city of Nicosia in Cyprus carrying a cauliflower so big that he couldn\u2019t get his arm around it. It\u2019s a shame she never met Peter Glazebrook of Halam in Nottinghamshire, who in 2014 entered the Guinness World Records with <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/heaviest-cauliflower\">his 27.48kg cauliflower</a>.</p> <p>The cauliflower is a variety of the common cabbage with arrested inflorescence. That is to say, a cabbage whose flowers were starting to form, but got interrupted at the bud stage, resulting in dense \u201ccurds\u201d, which are most commonly white, but can also be luminous green, purple, orange, yellow and brown. Broccoli is arrested in much the same way, and I can\u2019t help but feel a little sorry for both inhibited vegetables.</p> <p>Pity aside, the interruption means that all the nutrient energy and goodness intended for flowering remains in a cauliflower\u2019s thick, creamy stems, making them particularly rich in nutrients: vitamins C and B6, and useful quantities of folate, protein and fibre. The stems also hold organic compounds called glucosinolates, which contain the sulphur volatiles responsible for both the mild, mustard-like heat when you chew raw cauliflower and the sulphurous aromas released when you cook the florets in boiling water, which all too quickly turns to the steam that fills the kitchen with a sulphuric pong or sulphuric goodness, depending on your point of view.</p> <p>I tend to think of it is as sulphuric goodness, but even so, I am glad to have lived for a period with a Swedish weather presenter who was also an expert at dealing with cooking smells, and who showed me several ways to (try to) deal with the scent of cooking cauliflower.

This doesn\u2019t <em>really</em> mask the smell, but it does make a lovely, soft sauce \u2013 somewhere between a <em>fonduta</em> and cheese bechamel \u2013 which can be poured over boiled cauliflower, especially if it\u2019s been mashed, mixed with breadcrumbs and cheese and shaped into polpette, which is one of the most delicious ways to serve cauliflower. </p> <p>The polpette are versatile, too, and can be cooked in three ways: shallow-fried, deep-fried or baked. Shallow-frying involves slightly flattening the balls, so they\u2019ll cook more evenly. Deep-frying requires immersing the balls in a few inches of hot sunflower or other suitable oil until lightly golden, then lifting on to kitchen or blotting paper. Or bake them at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 20 minutes, or until lightly golden.</p> <p>Thanks to the addition of cream cheese, the sauce should stay quite liquid even when it has cooled slightly, but it really is best served piping hot and poured over the polpette like a heavy blanket.</p> <h2>Cauliflower polpette with cheese sauce</h2> <p>Serves <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>1 small cauliflower</strong> (trimmed weight about 600g)<strong>,</strong> broken into florets<strong><br>Salt</strong><strong> and pepper</strong><strong><br></strong><strong>1 </strong><strong>garlic clove</strong>, peeled and minced<br><strong>2 tsp </strong><strong>very finely chopped parsley</strong><br><strong>1 whole egg, plus </strong><strong>1 </strong><strong>egg yolk</strong><br><strong>50g grated cheese</strong> (parmesan or similar)<strong><br></strong><strong>Nutmeg</strong>, to taste<br><strong>Salt and black pepper<br>50g dr</strong><strong>ied breadcrumbs</strong>, plus extra if needed</p> <p>For the cheese sauce<br><strong>1 bay leaf<br>50ml milk<br>50g </strong><strong>melting cheese</strong> (fontina or cheddar, say), cubed <br><strong>20g parmesan</strong>, grated<br><strong>50g cream cheese</strong><br><br>Boil the cauliflower florets in salted water until just tender, then drain, tip into a bowl and mash roughly.

I\u2019m reminding myself that the real self-sabotage would be to refuse pastries overstuffed with pistachio cream, Campari luminous as a stained-glass window, fat green olives and crunchy, oily, salty snacks. That being alive and open to pleasure is the greatest privilege and I should gobble all this happiness up and lick my fingers, because this is as good as it gets, and because winter is coming.</p> <p>I\u2019m taking two weeks off to work on my winter buddy, to become \u201cplump and moist like a frog\u201d, as a friend counselled. I plan to return rested, rounder and maybe even a fraction wiser.</p> <p>\u2022 Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Support for seasonal self-love comes from an unexpected quarter: the French daily Lib\u00e9ration has issued a plea for us to embrace our \u201cwinter buddy\u201d. That\u2019s a soft, friendly winter body, forged of chestnut-based desserts, cheese and chouquettes, those sugar-topped mini choux buns they sell by the dozen in French bakeries (I\u2019ve never seen a basket of them that didn\u2019t make me yearn to unhinge my jaw and consume it in one gulp, like a python with a nest of bird\u2019s eggs). This winter buddy stuff is pure French fancy. The article conjures a wild, wish-fulfilled universe, in which having a bit of solstice padding makes you sexually irresistible rather than drawing barbed comments from your mother-in-law. I bet French intellectuals will remain whippety slim and elegant, though it\u2019s reassuring to realise they\u2019re probably dreaming of raclette, that nutritionist\u2019s nightmare of molten cheese, potato and charcuterie. Still, it was a perfectly timed rallying cry for me. I\u2019m turning 50 next week and the inevitable taking stock and finding myself wanting has left me flirting with dismal old deprivation. I talk a good game of self-compassion, but this looming half-century has sent me back to the lonely business of trying to be the \u201cbest\u201d at staying alive which I thought I had shed in my 20s \u2013 eating leaves and gravelly seeds and being just marginally, optimally hungry. I might live hungrily for ever, but where\u2019s the joy? So on my birthday holiday in Venice, I\u2019m trying to embrace softness and prepare for winter like a fat bear. I\u2019m reminding myself that the real self-sabotage would be to refuse pastries overstuffed with pistachio cream, Campari luminous as a stained-glass window, fat green olives and crunchy, oily, salty snacks. That being alive and open to pleasure is the greatest privilege and I should gobble all this happiness up and lick my fingers, because this is as good as it gets, and because winter is coming. I\u2019m taking two weeks off to work on my winter buddy, to become \u201cplump and moist like a frog\u201d, as a friend counselled. I plan to return rested, rounder and maybe even a fraction wiser. \u2022 Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>C\u00e9cile Chaminade is no longer a household name, or even a recognisable name, even in a time when female composers are being rediscovered and celebrated. I\u2019ve loved her since I was a little boy visiting Hoylake for piano lessons with Heather Slade-Lipkin \u2013 her mother used to play Chaminade for me. It seems extraordinary now, but every time Joan would sit down at the piano for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/01/i-was-swallowing-the-piano-whole-stephen-hough-on-life-as-a-prodigy-and-playing-for-jimmy-savile\">this opened-eyed little boy</a>, devouring music like I was in a sweet shop, it was Chaminade\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fwNjXw8oSA&amp;t=1s\">Automne</a>, or her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT5ov3_yfQM\">Scarf Dance</a>, or the tricky <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4hfYZySUyg\">Toccata</a>. One treat after another.</p> <p>I\u2019m playing a lot of Chaminade this season; or, more accurately, I\u2019m playing a few pieces of hers many times \u2013 alongside three of the great, 30-minute masterpieces of 19th-century piano music: the Schumann Fantasie, and the B minor Sonatas of Liszt and Chopin. To those surprised by the juxtaposition, I think Chaminade sits very comfortably and proudly there, not because her elegant miniatures are comparable in scope and ambition to those three greatest keyboard works of the 19th century by three geniuses, but because she shared an important place with them in the most popular performance venue of the Romantic era: the salon.</p>    <p>Salons have pretty much disappeared today (apart from those who try to resurrect the idea \u2013 a musical equivalent of jousting on the village green or taking a ride on a steam train) so we tend to forget that for most of the 19th century solo piano recitals in large public spaces were rare. It was the salon \u2013 a large room in a large private home to which music lovers would be invited \u2013 which was ubiquitous. Chopin\u2019s whole creative life was fuelled by these opportunities for his music to be heard. His pieces were almost all dedicated to various countesses and rich patrons who would invite him to play for them; the intimate setting of a dozen people listening quietly in an elegant private room was his chosen space.</p> <p>All the great 19th-century composers wrote some music specifically for amateurs to play at home. Apart from anything else, it was their main source of income. If you had the money and space for a china cabinet it\u2019s likely you\u2019d have a piano in the same room too. Pretty much everyone who had the time and leisure to read a book would have learned the piano as well. Especially women.</p> <p>Enter C\u00e9cile Chaminade. She was born in 1857 into a musical family, receiving her first piano lessons from her mother.

      "bodyText": "C\u00e9cile Chaminade is no longer a household name, or even a recognisable name, even in a time when female composers are being rediscovered and celebrated. I\u2019ve loved her since I was a little boy visiting Hoylake for piano lessons with Heather Slade-Lipkin \u2013 her mother used to play Chaminade for me. It seems extraordinary now, but every time Joan would sit down at the piano for this opened-eyed little boy, devouring music like I was in a sweet shop, it was Chaminade\u2019s Automne, or her Scarf Dance, or the tricky Toccata. One treat after another. I\u2019m playing a lot of Chaminade this season; or, more accurately, I\u2019m playing a few pieces of hers many times \u2013 alongside three of the great, 30-minute masterpieces of 19th-century piano music: the Schumann Fantasie, and the B minor Sonatas of Liszt and Chopin. To those surprised by the juxtaposition, I think Chaminade sits very comfortably and proudly there, not because her elegant miniatures are comparable in scope and ambition to those three greatest keyboard works of the 19th century by three geniuses, but because she shared an important place with them in the most popular performance venue of the Romantic era: the salon. Salons have pretty much disappeared today (apart from those who try to resurrect the idea \u2013 a musical equivalent of jousting on the village green or taking a ride on a steam train) so we tend to forget that for most of the 19th century solo piano recitals in large public spaces were rare. It was the salon \u2013 a large room in a large private home to which music lovers would be invited \u2013 which was ubiquitous. Chopin\u2019s whole creative life was fuelled by these opportunities for his music to be heard. His pieces were almost all dedicated to various countesses and rich patrons who would invite him to play for them; the intimate setting of a dozen people listening quietly in an elegant private room was his chosen space. All the great 19th-century composers wrote some music specifically for amateurs to play at home. Apart from anything else, it was their main source of income. If you had the money and space for a china cabinet it\u2019s likely you\u2019d have a piano in the same room too. Pretty much everyone who had the time and leisure to read a book would have learned the piano as well. Especially women. Enter C\u00e9cile Chaminade. She was born in 1857 into a musical family, receiving her first piano lessons from her mother. When she was 10 she was accepted for study at the Paris Conservatoire but her father forbade it, so she studied with various of its professors privately. Although all women of a certain class at the time were encouraged to play the piano at home, it was unusual for them to be allowed to pursue a career doing so. In fact, women were generally discouraged from travelling or dining alone, two activities which fill the lives of touring concert performers. One of the keys to understanding the paucity of female composers until the 20th century is that composers generally wrote music for themselves to play, whether in public venues or the more private world of the salon. So if a performing career was not a possibility for a woman then neither was writing music. Chaminade is one of the few who were able to ride over this restriction, a witness to her determination and her popularity. And Chaminade was exceptionally successful for a while. She played her music all over Europe, including for Queen Victoria who gave her the Jubilee medal in 1897; her Pr\u00e9lude for organ Op 78 was played at the monarch\u2019s funeral. Most of her large output was written between the 1880s and 90s and she had an enormous international renown. Her Scarf Dance alone is said to have sold more than five million copies. In the US hundreds of women across the continent around the turn of the 20th century founded and joined Chaminade Clubs, from Yonkers, New York to Jackson, Mississippi \u2013 two of the many which exist to this day, and still present concerts. Chaminade married a music publisher but they lived in a platonic relationship and separately, he in Marseille and she in Paris. He died in 1907 and she never remarried. It\u2019s hard not to draw certain conclusions from this \u2013 a further indication of the restrictions of the age.

I pictured plummy English or haughty southern Irish accents with a few mangled Belfast \u201cnowwws\u201d thrown in for colour.</p> <p>On reflection this wasn\u2019t really to do with the book, a sober and well-researched account of a brutal murder. But more because there can tend to be a slightly goofy way of depicting, and interacting with, the complexity of the history in the place where I am from. Perhaps especially of late.</p> <p>Say Nothing couldn\u2019t really be arriving at a more advantageous time. Since Brexit (when many in England and indeed down south seemed to discover the existence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dup\">the DUP</a> for the first time) there has been a wave of interest in the Troubles and the north that feels like it is building to a crescendo. The huge success of Anna Burns\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/17/milkman-is-an-essential-novel-for-our-times-every-politician-should-read-it\">Booker-prize winning Milkman</a> \u2013 as well as, to be fair, Say Nothing the book and now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/18/kneecap-how-northern-irish-rap-trio-rose-to-fame-by-subverting-the-troubles\">Kneecap-mania</a> \u2013 speaks to this. The interest is particularly pronounced among people around my millennial<strong> </strong>generation, both in England and the south of Ireland, who see the Troubles as a blind spot in their education.</p> <p>Declarations of an affinity with Irish culture are everywhere. Many an Essex lad can these days be heard in pub gardens chanting \u201cSplit the G\u201d (take the exact swig of Guinness to make the liquid level fall to the middle of the G on the glass). I can barely open my mouth in London, where I live, without someone clocking my accent and starting to explain about their Cork granny (despite the very different recent histories of the south and the north).</p> <p>For once it is not my pronunciation of certain words that stands out for being a bit clapped. I was recently chatting to a nice young man who rushed to tell me that his dad is Irish. Then he passed me my Guinness from the bar and declared: \u201cSlant-eee!\u201d I replied: \u201cOh no, babe \u2013 you say it like <em>sl\u00e1inte</em> (slawn-sha, kind of).\u201d Posh English girls are suddenly saying \u201cthe north of Ireland\u201d instead of Northern Ireland, signalling their political righteousness. I sometimes imagine them saying that to my grandma (a tough-as-nails Derry woman with her fair share of Troubles tales) and just laugh. I actually texted a family member the other day: \u201cYou know all these posh English girlies are calling it the north of Ireland now.\u201d They replied: \u201cIt will be <em><a href=\"https://dbpedia.org/page/Tiocfaidh_%C3%A1r_l%C3%A1\">Tiocfaidh \u00e1r l\u00e1</a></em> next.\u201d</p> <p>I was pleased to find, after watching half the episodes of Say Nothing, that the show treats its subject matter much more seriously. Say Nothing tells the story of the IRA\u2019s abduction and murder of Jean McConville, a mother of 10. She was accused of passing information to British forces, but no evidence of this has ever surfaced. Her orphaned children (their father died of cancer before her murder) campaigned for justice for many years. In parallel, the show follows the very different lives of IRA militants Dolours and Marian Price, along with figures they associated with, like Gerry Adams and Brendan Hughes.</p> <p>The Price sisters grew up in a republican family and joined the IRA, one in her late teens and the other in her early 20s. They were involved in peaceful protests before this, including the Burntollet Bridge incident in 1969, when protesters on a civil rights march from Belfast to Derry were attacked by Ulster loyalists. This is depicted in a few terrifying scenes in the show and framed as a moment of radicalisation. Spirited, intelligent and angry, the Price sisters planned and participated in high-profile IRA actions, including the 1973 Old Bailey bombing that injured about 200 people. They were sent to prison and conducted a notorious hunger strike. The two threads converge when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/24/old-bailey-bomber-dolours-price\">Dolours Price</a> participates in McConville\u2019s abduction.</p> <p>My fears about the show were proved unfounded: there is plenty of great acting by Belfast stars or soon-to-be stars. If there is any justice in the world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/nov/12/disney-northern-ireland-troubles-drama-say-nothing\">Lola Petticrew</a> will launch a major career off their performance of the young Dolours. And Say Nothing mostly does an admirable job of not shying away from the messiness of the material it depicts.</p> <p>But it is not by any means a flawless account of the Troubles. (And I would hope nobody watches it for a history lesson.) There is nothing, for example, about loyalist paramilitaries. And it is too obvious that the film-makers consider the Price sisters\u2019 combination of glamour and toughness to be hugely unlikely, and expect the viewer to react similarly: there are too many scenes of the sisters got up like nuns bearing guns and so on. I doubt this brand of tough, glamorous woman will scan as at all unusual to anyone who grew up in the north. (Their very hardline IRA activity is another story, of course.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/nov/12/disney-northern-ireland-troubles-drama-say-nothing\">\u2018No Americans putting on bad Belfast accents!\u2019 How Disney drama Say Nothing brings the Troubles to life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Say Nothing does avoid the worst pitfalls, though. There is a sanitised depiction of the Troubles, which tends to go down well with Americans or southern Irish people, that frames the conflict primarily as a struggle for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/16/irish-unification-referendum-remains-remote-sinn-fein-gains\">united Ireland</a> and so principally a dispute over national identity. The reality is that the latest phase of Ireland\u2019s long colonial history was triggered because the predominantly working-class Catholic population in the north was denied fair access to jobs and housing, and experienced gerrymandering. Say Nothing, to its credit, opens with a monologue outlining this. Perhaps not the slickest delivery, but it did warrant highlighting upfront.</p> <p>I suspect this story of the Troubles is less palatable to some because it frames things more explicitly in terms of a good old-fashioned class struggle. You can always tell which elements of any topic remain controversial by whether they are being talked about and celebrated or not. Likewise I suspect that saying \u201cthe north of Ireland\u201d is all the rage these days precisely because many people in England don\u2019t really care what it\u2019s called any more. To my mind, one major failure of identity politics over the past decade has been the overemphasis on having the right language. But just like Say Nothing should not be treated as a history lesson, we should never treat talismanic phrases as a substitute for proper, sustained engagement with any topic.</p> <p>But anyway, I will leave you all to your \u201cslantees\u201d and \u201cnorth of Irelands\u201d.

Since Brexit (when many in England and indeed down south seemed to discover the existence of the DUP for the first time) there has been a wave of interest in the Troubles and the north that feels like it is building to a crescendo. The huge success of Anna Burns\u2019s Booker-prize winning Milkman \u2013 as well as, to be fair, Say Nothing the book and now Kneecap-mania \u2013 speaks to this. The interest is particularly pronounced among people around my millennial generation, both in England and the south of Ireland, who see the Troubles as a blind spot in their education. Declarations of an affinity with Irish culture are everywhere. Many an Essex lad can these days be heard in pub gardens chanting \u201cSplit the G\u201d (take the exact swig of Guinness to make the liquid level fall to the middle of the G on the glass). I can barely open my mouth in London, where I live, without someone clocking my accent and starting to explain about their Cork granny (despite the very different recent histories of the south and the north). For once it is not my pronunciation of certain words that stands out for being a bit clapped. I was recently chatting to a nice young man who rushed to tell me that his dad is Irish. Then he passed me my Guinness from the bar and declared: \u201cSlant-eee!\u201d I replied: \u201cOh no, babe \u2013 you say it like sl\u00e1inte (slawn-sha, kind of).\u201d Posh English girls are suddenly saying \u201cthe north of Ireland\u201d instead of Northern Ireland, signalling their political righteousness. I sometimes imagine them saying that to my grandma (a tough-as-nails Derry woman with her fair share of Troubles tales) and just laugh. I actually texted a family member the other day: \u201cYou know all these posh English girlies are calling it the north of Ireland now.\u201d They replied: \u201cIt will be Tiocfaidh \u00e1r l\u00e1 next.\u201d I was pleased to find, after watching half the episodes of Say Nothing, that the show treats its subject matter much more seriously. Say Nothing tells the story of the IRA\u2019s abduction and murder of Jean McConville, a mother of 10. She was accused of passing information to British forces, but no evidence of this has ever surfaced. Her orphaned children (their father died of cancer before her murder) campaigned for justice for many years. In parallel, the show follows the very different lives of IRA militants Dolours and Marian Price, along with figures they associated with, like Gerry Adams and Brendan Hughes. The Price sisters grew up in a republican family and joined the IRA, one in her late teens and the other in her early 20s. They were involved in peaceful protests before this, including the Burntollet Bridge incident in 1969, when protesters on a civil rights march from Belfast to Derry were attacked by Ulster loyalists. This is depicted in a few terrifying scenes in the show and framed as a moment of radicalisation. Spirited, intelligent and angry, the Price sisters planned and participated in high-profile IRA actions, including the 1973 Old Bailey bombing that injured about 200 people. They were sent to prison and conducted a notorious hunger strike. The two threads converge when Dolours Price participates in McConville\u2019s abduction. My fears about the show were proved unfounded: there is plenty of great acting by Belfast stars or soon-to-be stars. If there is any justice in the world, Lola Petticrew will launch a major career off their performance of the young Dolours. And Say Nothing mostly does an admirable job of not shying away from the messiness of the material it depicts. But it is not by any means a flawless account of the Troubles. (And I would hope nobody watches it for a history lesson.) There is nothing, for example, about loyalist paramilitaries. And it is too obvious that the film-makers consider the Price sisters\u2019 combination of glamour and toughness to be hugely unlikely, and expect the viewer to react similarly: there are too many scenes of the sisters got up like nuns bearing guns and so on. I doubt this brand of tough, glamorous woman will scan as at all unusual to anyone who grew up in the north. (Their very hardline IRA activity is another story, of course.) Say Nothing does avoid the worst pitfalls, though. There is a sanitised depiction of the Troubles, which tends to go down well with Americans or southern Irish people, that frames the conflict primarily as a struggle for a united Ireland and so principally a dispute over national identity. The reality is that the latest phase of Ireland\u2019s long colonial history was triggered because the predominantly working-class Catholic population in the north was denied fair access to jobs and housing, and experienced gerrymandering. Say Nothing, to its credit, opens with a monologue outlining this. Perhaps not the slickest delivery, but it did warrant highlighting upfront. I suspect this story of the Troubles is less palatable to some because it frames things more explicitly in terms of a good old-fashioned class struggle. You can always tell which elements of any topic remain controversial by whether they are being talked about and celebrated or not. Likewise I suspect that saying \u201cthe north of Ireland\u201d is all the rage these days precisely because many people in England don\u2019t really care what it\u2019s called any more. To my mind, one major failure of identity politics over the past decade has been the overemphasis on having the right language. But just like Say Nothing should not be treated as a history lesson, we should never treat talismanic phrases as a substitute for proper, sustained engagement with any topic. But anyway, I will leave you all to your \u201cslantees\u201d and \u201cnorth of Irelands\u201d. I\u2019m saying nothing.

Mewis confirmed they were engaged last November after several weeks of speculation fuelled in part by social posts featuring her wearing a diamond ring on her engagement finger. At the time, Mewis said that along with her parents and sister, Kerr had \u201cjust been everything\u201d to her. \u201cMy biggest supporter, always listening to me nag and complain, all of my crazy antics,\u201d she said. The pair have spoken about the importance of sharing their relationship on social media to normalise \u201cbeing two girls in love\u201d. Kerr and Mewis\u2019s post was filled with congratulatory comments within minutes of its appearing, with one saying \u201cbubba is so loved already\u201d. Both Mewis and Kerr represented their countries at the recent World Cup. In June, Kerr signed a contract extension at Chelsea with the new deal keeping her at the club until 2026. Mewis plays for West Ham United. Kerr missed out on her chance to make the squad for the 2024 Paris Olympics this year due to her rehabilitation from knee surgery after rupturing her ACL in January.",

If we\u2019re not weighing knickers to test how quickly heated airers dry clothes, we\u2019re hiking hundreds of miles in pursuit of the very best walking boots, sampling Advent calendars or driving electric cars. Passing on these hard-earned recommendations to you, our readers, has been such a thrill. And we\u2019ve delighted in discovering which products you love the most. As winter starts to take its frosty hold, you\u2019ve been wrapping up in our fashion team\u2019s favourite coats and boots, and embracing the cosy indoors with stove-style electric heaters, stylish pyjamas and, er, not-so-stylish (but oh-so-comfy) knee pillows. There\u2019s been a few surprises, too: when our writers told you about the one thing that elevated an everyday task, among your favourites was a simple garlic plate that avoids the tedium of chopping the much-loved ingredient. Here are the 11 items you\u2019ve been loving \u2013 and buying \u2013 the most this month. *** The sanity-preserving reading light Gritin clip-on light, \u00a39.99 amazon.co.uk This super-cheap reading light featured in that list of everyday items that could improve your life as a potential saviour for new parents. \u201cThroughout the mayhem, my clip-on reading light has helped create as much restorative escapism as a bath infused with brandy,\u201d says writer Matt Collins. \u201cMy partner and I have one each, and we can read using the disturbance-free glow at whatever time of night, in whatever room of the house we end up.\u201d *** The earbuds to get you through Couch to 5K JLab sport headphones, now reduced to \u00a319.99 johnlewis.com Guardian travel writer Rachel Dixon credits these budget earbuds with finally getting her into a regular running routine. \u201cI am a slow but very sweaty jogger, and my old earbuds used to switch off or slip out of my ears when I ran,\u201d she says. \u201cWearing these, I\u2019ve finally completed Couch to 5K.\u201d Hundreds of readers must be halfway to 5K by now. *** Traditional, stylish pyjamas Seersucker pyjamas, \u00a348 johnlewis.com Our self-proclaimed pyjama obsessive Melanie Wilkinson loves these traditional seersucker PJs from John Lewis. \u201cSeersucker says classy yet wholesome to me,\u201d she says in her guide to the best women\u2019s pyjamas. \u201cThe quality is wonderful and the covered buttons are a lovely detail. This set would be ideal for when guests are visiting.\u201d *** The best budget heated clothes airer Heated airer with wings, \u00a340 dunelm.com Although this wasn\u2019t the outright winner in our thorough test of heated airers \u2013 that honour went to the Lakeland Dry:Soon Deluxe \u2013 this lightweight airer from Dunelm was our readers\u2019 favourite. It probably helped that it\u2019s considerably cheaper, at \u00a340, and takes up very little space. *** The best boots for the commute Wide-fit leather Chelsea boots, \u00a369 marksandspencer.com Our fashion team picked out autumn boots for every occasion, from parties to muddy walks in bad weather. But it was these sturdy Chelsea boots from M&amp;S that our readers loved the most. \u201cThe affordable, wide-fit style in a subtle bordeaux colour will be invaluable this autumn,\u201d says styling editor Melanie Wilkinson. *** The knee pillow that could save your sleep Sports Medica ergonomic knee pillow, \u00a315.95 amazon.co.uk If, like Guardian reporter Simon Usborne, you\u2019ve \u201creached the age when back niggles and snoring confine you to sleeping on your side, and you have slightly spindly legs and knobbly knees\u201d, this memory foam pillow could be transformative. \u201cIt has a loose strap that means the pillow comes with me as I turn from side to side, all the while keeping my knees cosseted and comfortably separated,\u201d he says. This struck a chord with sleepless readers, who have been buying hundreds of these knee-savers. *** The perfect peacoat Double-breasted peacoat, \u00a3159 johnlewis.com \u201cI cannot do justice to how excellent this coat is, and the photo doesn\u2019t either,\u201d says fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley, in her November style edit. \u201cPlease take my word for it when I say it looks and feels delicious. Well-thought-out pockets and expensive-looking detailing (for instance, a concealed button to hold the collar in place).\u201d *** The garlic crusher that will elevate your cooking Handmade ceramic garlic grater, \u00a314 etsy.com This beautiful garlic plate has transformed Guardian contributor Kate Lloyd\u2019s cooking. \u201cIt\u2019s such a simple thing \u2013 a ceramic plate with little bumps on that you scrub cloves against to create a paste \u2013 but it\u2019s genuinely been a gamechanger,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so much quicker and more pleasant than the tedium of chopping garlic into tiny cubes.\u201d *** Jess Cartner-Morley\u2019s go-to sunglasses Le Specs cat\u2019s eye sunglasses, \u00a365 johnlewis.com You\u2019ve been buying these in droves to protect your eyes from the glare of the winter sun. \u201cI have never met anyone [these sunglasses] don\u2019t suit,\u201d says Jess Cartner-Morley. \u201cThey are cat\u2019s eye but not retro, oversized but not overwhelming. And \u00a365 is reasonable compared with the extortionate prices of most designer sunnies.\u201d *** A picture Advent calendar for book lovers Oxfam bookshelf Advent calendar, \u00a33.99 oxfam.org.uk Never mind fancy Advent calendars full of beer, biscuits and tools \u2013 our readers\u2019 favourite has been this adorable picture calendar, with a brainteaser behind each door. All profits go to Oxfam. *** Thermals \u2013 but make them fashion Heattech T-shirt, \u00a319.90 uniqlo.com Uniqlo has sold more than a billion of its new-gen thermals \u2013 they look and feel like fashion. \u201cMy favourite item is its extra warm cashmere blend high-neck T-shirt in six colours,\u201d says Jess Cartner-Morley in her guide to autumn style. \u201cI\u2019ll be wearing it underneath lightweight shirt dresses or sleeveless shifts.\u201d Monica Horridge Deputy editor, the Filter *** This week\u2019s picks The best Le Creuset alternatives, from cast-iron casserole dishes to skillets The 20 best self-care gifts for Christmas, from slippers to essential oils to massagers First-time cat owner? The essentials you need, from quality food to pet insurance The 8 best video doorbells, tried and tested Editor\u2019s pick Lego, football, art sets, vinyl, roller skates and Harry Potter: there\u2019s something timeless and reassuringly wholesome about the gifts that our large cross-section of kids told us they want for Christmas. Our aim? To take the guesswork out of present-buying for parents, and provide some genuine intel. Our younger kids want toys, toys and more toys (and quite a few story-telling boxes); our older small children are after onesies and squishies. Our tweens have more expensive taste, requesting projectors and laptops (as well as the latest, must-read books); and our teens want everything from trainers to Xbox games, jewellery to skincare. It\u2019s a fascinating snapshot of kids today. And happily, most seem aware that we\u2019re still keeping the purse strings tight: Fleur, aged six, concedes that, in lieu of an actual horse, she\u2019ll settle for a Squishmallows one. So that\u2019s nice.

      "bodyText": "I am a teacher and I requested a cash equivalent transfer value (CETV) from Teachers\u2019 Pensions in June. I needed to submit the value of my pot to the court as part of the divorce proceedings. I received a wordy letter from Teachers\u2019 Pensions saying that there may be a delay due to changes to the ways pension valuations are calculated. I rang for clarification and, after an hour on hold, was told that there was no timeframe for my valuation to be completed, and that I could not finalise my divorce without it, unless my husband waived his right to half my pension. With current high divorce rates, and the fact that there are more women in the teaching profession than men, there must be a lot of women who are trying to get out of marriages but who are having to carry on living with the person they want to leave while they deal with bureaucratic bullshit. This is stoking distrust between my husband and me as he thinks I\u2019m deliberately prevaricating. I have a very difficult choice to make now. I can push ahead with the transfer of equity so my husband can move out before the conditional court order is in place, but I\u2019ve been advised against this. Or I can insist we wait. But wait until when? LS, London You, and many others, have fallen victim to something called Transitional Protection. In a nutshell, this was a 2015 policy which allowed public sector employees who were near retirement to remain in a final salary pension scheme while younger colleagues were transferred to less lucrative career average schemes. This was ruled discriminatory by a court in 2018, and the government set about amending the rules. As of October 2023, all pensionable service between 2015 and 2022 has had to be rolled back to the final salary scheme \u2013 a long and complex task which has delayed the calculation of pension values required by courts before an application for divorce can proceed.

Yours arrived the day after I queried your case, but there are sure to be many more who have been kept waiting longer than the three months the government deems acceptable.

      "body": "<p>Is there any human endeavour as heroic or under-appreciated as plant collecting? When in 1921, at the age of 33, Nikolai Vavilov arrived in Petrograd (now St Petersburg) to take charge of the bureau of applied botany and plant breeding, he found a city racked by hunger. War followed by civil conflict had crippled Russia\u2019s food production and distribution systems \u2013 a situation compounded by the seizure of peasants\u2019 grain stores by the Bolsheviks \u2013 and Petrograd, once the cradle of the Russian empire, had been transformed into a graveyard. Walking along Nevsky Prospekt, Vavilov was appalled to see starving citizens queueing for mouldy bread. \u201cWestward the sun is dropping,\u201d observed the poet Anna Akhmatova, \u201cand already death is chalking the doors with crosses.\u201d</p> <p>On entering the bureau, Vavilov was even more dismayed to find the heating pipes had burst and the storage units containing nearly 14,000 varieties of wheat, barley, oat and rye collected by his predecessor had been eaten by famished staff. It was, recorded a member of Vavilov\u2019s team, \u201ca picture of almost complete destruction\u201d.</p> <p>Yet by 1940, Vavilov had secured new premises in a former tsarist palace in the centre of the city and had amassed the largest collection of seeds in the world. It was a collection brimming with \u201clatent life\u201d, writes Simon Parkin in his riveting account of Vavilov\u2019s plant institute, \u201ca Noah\u2019s Ark of plant matter\u201d. Once cultivated and harvested, the seeds contained sufficient genetic material to feed not only the citizens of Leningrad, as the city had been renamed following Lenin\u2019s death in 1924, but the entire population of the Soviet Union. In the process, Vavilov, a tireless polyglot, would become the most celebrated botanist in the world, feted by scientists from Edinburgh to New York. All the more extraordinary, then, that today he is all but forgotten, a victim of the Soviet state\u2019s desire to erase memories of the siege and the millions who perished in the Nazi onslaught.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The authorities destroyed Vavilov\u2019s file and discouraged journalists from writing about him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Karl Marx wrote that \u201chistory repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce\u201d. The tragedy is that having amassed a collection with the potential to banish famine, Vavilov was arrested on the eve of war and branded \u201can enemy of the people\u201d. In this, he appears to have been a victim of a bitter struggle with the peasant-agronomist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/29/stalin-and-the-scientists-simon-ings-review\">Trofim Lysenko</a>, who had rejected Mendelian genetics for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism\">Lamarckism</a> \u2013 the idea that plants and other organisms acquire superior traits from their environments rather than from inherited genetic material. Lysenko believed that through a combination of agronomical knowhow and political will, these traits could be passed down to future generations \u2013 a theory that Stalin found appealing.</p> <p>The result was that when in July 1941, the Soviet authorities began fortifying Leningrad in preparation for the German siege and evacuated precious artworks from the Hermitage, Vavilov\u2019s collection was ignored, though whether this was deliberate or a bureaucratic oversight, Parkin cannot say. What he shows, brilliantly, is how the farce of the seeds\u2019 non-evacuation nearly ended in a second tragedy as Vavilov\u2019s colleagues fought to preserve the collection from raids by starving citizens and their own gnawing hunger. Incredibly, of the 250,000 seeds that Vavilov had amassed at the outbreak of war, the majority survived and by 1967, 100m acres of Russian agricultural land had been planted with material from the institute\u2019s collection. Not only that, but wheat collected by Vavilov in Spain, Japan, Italy and Argentina was crossbred to create high-yielding winter varieties, while potatoes from Bolivia were used to breed hybrids resistant to disease. Today, 90% of the seeds and planted crops in the institute\u2019s collection are found in no other in the world.</p>    <p>Writing in 1737, Carl Linnaeus, the father of modern taxonomy, observed: \u201cWhen I consider the melancholy fate of so many of botany\u2019s votaries, I am tempted to ask whether men are in their right mind who so desperately risk life and everything else through the love of collecting\u2019 plants.\u201d Imprisoned for the duration of the war, Vavilov would never return to his beloved institute and died of hunger in 1943 at a prison in western Russia. Afterwards, ashamed of their persecution of the world-renowned botanist, the authorities destroyed Vavilov\u2019s case file and did their best to discourage journalists from writing about his achievements. The result was that it was not until the late 1970s that Vavilov\u2019s story and the fate of his employees became more widely known. Even so, Parkin\u2019s is the first book to have been published on the subject outside Russia.</p> <p>To recreate the story, the author has drawn on the institute\u2019s archives and the diaries and letters of the two-dozen staff to whom it fell to guard the collection during the near-900-day siege, one of the longest of any city in history. In the process, he restores Vavilov and his scientific colleagues to their rightful places in the pantheon of Soviet heroes. But perhaps Parkin\u2019s biggest achievement is to explain how the botanists who sat out the siege resisted the temptation to consume the collection. Instead, he details how they defended the seed bank from looters and braved German bombs to plant potatoes at a field station on the perimeter of the city, thereby ensuring they would produce new tubers that could be stored and preserved for the following year.</p> <p>In the process, 19 staff died, most of them of starvation while surrounded by containers that could have saved their lives. In this they were guided by the conviction that many of the samples were irreplaceable because of the loss of natural habitats from which they had been collected and that they could contain unrecognised genetic qualities. Their resolve was also a product of their loyalty to Vavilov and their belief in the importance of the scientific endeavour. As one survivor told Parkin: \u201cIt was impossible to eat [the collection], for what was involved was the cause of your life, the cause of your comrades\u2019 lives.\u201d Astonishingly, this resolve held despite an explicit order from Moscow to \u201cspare nothing\u201d to save the lives of their fellow citizens.</p> <p>Although Parkin has done a remarkable job of resurrecting the story of this \u201cforbidden garden\u201d, he admits to frustration that his efforts \u201ccould not transport me to the white-hot centre of the story\u201d. It is a frustration this reader shares. Despite a wealth of information about the siege, the thoughts, feelings and cravings of Vavilov\u2019s staff remain tantalisingly out of reach. Instead, Parkin ends on a deflationary note, admitting he has no answer to the question of whether in opting to sacrifice the lives of people in the present for the benefit of future generations, the botanists made the correct moral choice.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Forbidden Garden of Leningrad: A True Story of Science and Sacrifice in a City Under Siege</em> by Simon Parkin is published by Sceptre (\u00a325).

The tragedy is that having amassed a collection with the potential to banish famine, Vavilov was arrested on the eve of war and branded \u201can enemy of the people\u201d. In this, he appears to have been a victim of a bitter struggle with the peasant-agronomist Trofim Lysenko, who had rejected Mendelian genetics for Lamarckism \u2013 the idea that plants and other organisms acquire superior traits from their environments rather than from inherited genetic material. Lysenko believed that through a combination of agronomical knowhow and political will, these traits could be passed down to future generations \u2013 a theory that Stalin found appealing. The result was that when in July 1941, the Soviet authorities began fortifying Leningrad in preparation for the German siege and evacuated precious artworks from the Hermitage, Vavilov\u2019s collection was ignored, though whether this was deliberate or a bureaucratic oversight, Parkin cannot say. What he shows, brilliantly, is how the farce of the seeds\u2019 non-evacuation nearly ended in a second tragedy as Vavilov\u2019s colleagues fought to preserve the collection from raids by starving citizens and their own gnawing hunger. Incredibly, of the 250,000 seeds that Vavilov had amassed at the outbreak of war, the majority survived and by 1967, 100m acres of Russian agricultural land had been planted with material from the institute\u2019s collection. Not only that, but wheat collected by Vavilov in Spain, Japan, Italy and Argentina was crossbred to create high-yielding winter varieties, while potatoes from Bolivia were used to breed hybrids resistant to disease. Today, 90% of the seeds and planted crops in the institute\u2019s collection are found in no other in the world. Writing in 1737, Carl Linnaeus, the father of modern taxonomy, observed: \u201cWhen I consider the melancholy fate of so many of botany\u2019s votaries, I am tempted to ask whether men are in their right mind who so desperately risk life and everything else through the love of collecting\u2019 plants.\u201d Imprisoned for the duration of the war, Vavilov would never return to his beloved institute and died of hunger in 1943 at a prison in western Russia. Afterwards, ashamed of their persecution of the world-renowned botanist, the authorities destroyed Vavilov\u2019s case file and did their best to discourage journalists from writing about his achievements. The result was that it was not until the late 1970s that Vavilov\u2019s story and the fate of his employees became more widely known. Even so, Parkin\u2019s is the first book to have been published on the subject outside Russia. To recreate the story, the author has drawn on the institute\u2019s archives and the diaries and letters of the two-dozen staff to whom it fell to guard the collection during the near-900-day siege, one of the longest of any city in history. In the process, he restores Vavilov and his scientific colleagues to their rightful places in the pantheon of Soviet heroes. But perhaps Parkin\u2019s biggest achievement is to explain how the botanists who sat out the siege resisted the temptation to consume the collection. Instead, he details how they defended the seed bank from looters and braved German bombs to plant potatoes at a field station on the perimeter of the city, thereby ensuring they would produce new tubers that could be stored and preserved for the following year. In the process, 19 staff died, most of them of starvation while surrounded by containers that could have saved their lives. In this they were guided by the conviction that many of the samples were irreplaceable because of the loss of natural habitats from which they had been collected and that they could contain unrecognised genetic qualities. Their resolve was also a product of their loyalty to Vavilov and their belief in the importance of the scientific endeavour. As one survivor told Parkin: \u201cIt was impossible to eat [the collection], for what was involved was the cause of your life, the cause of your comrades\u2019 lives.\u201d Astonishingly, this resolve held despite an explicit order from Moscow to \u201cspare nothing\u201d to save the lives of their fellow citizens. Although Parkin has done a remarkable job of resurrecting the story of this \u201cforbidden garden\u201d, he admits to frustration that his efforts \u201ccould not transport me to the white-hot centre of the story\u201d. It is a frustration this reader shares. Despite a wealth of information about the siege, the thoughts, feelings and cravings of Vavilov\u2019s staff remain tantalisingly out of reach. Instead, Parkin ends on a deflationary note, admitting he has no answer to the question of whether in opting to sacrifice the lives of people in the present for the benefit of future generations, the botanists made the correct moral choice. \u2022 The Forbidden Garden of Leningrad: A True Story of Science and Sacrifice in a City Under Siege by Simon Parkin is published by Sceptre (\u00a325).

Woolworths\u2019 submission to the inquiry, included highly specialised retailers like The Cheesecake Shop and Steve Costi\u2019s Seafood.</p> \n<p>Under questioning, Woolworths chief executive, Amanda Bardwell, conceded that only Coles offered an equivalent range of groceries for those conducting a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you want to define it that way, then yes, you

share of supermarket sector sales, while Coles generates 29%, representing a far more concentrated sector than in comparable economies.</p> \n<p>Bardwell said many consumers shopped around for individual items that could be bought from multiple retailers.</p> \n<p>\u201cSometimes they might be looking for a full weekly shop, but more often than not we\u2019re seeing customers actually shop multiple times a week and so they\u2019re looking for convenience when it comes to that,\u201d Bardwell said.</p> \n<p>One of Woolworths\u2019 priorities is to \u201cneutralise Coles and contain Aldi on pricing\u201d, according to a 2015 investor presentation by the supermarket chain and referred to by the ACCC.</p> \n<p>Bardwell was asked whether the supermarket\u2019s strategy was to \u201cbeat Coles on price or match Coles on price\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would say we compete on price every single day,\u201d Bardwell said.</p> \n<p>In its <a

compete vigorously.</p> \n<h2>Woolworths holds undeveloped \u2018strategic\u2019 sites</h2> \n<p>Woolworths executives denied suggestions the company engages in \u201cland banking\u201d; a practice where companies used their market power to buy or lease land to block rivals from expanding.</p> \n<p>The ACCC referred to a Woolworths document that described some of its properties as \u201csites

Woolworths doesn\u2019t hold on to undeveloped land to block competitors.</p> \n<p>\u201cOnce again, there\u2019s a number of individual sites in there and it\u2019s a mix of different sites and different reasons,\u201d Kemmler said.</p> \n<p>Under questioning, Kemmler said that Woolworths did buy shopping centres \u201cwith the view of putting a Woolworths supermarket\u201d into the acquired site, which could include a decision not to renew a rival retailer\u2019s lease.</p> \n<h2>Woolworths asked to clarify supplier rebates</h2> \n<p>Woolworths executives were asked about profit margins generated by the supermarket chain, which have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/01/coles-and-woolworths-have-leapfrogged-their-peers-in-profitability-these-charts-prove-it\">risen well above pre-pandemic levels</a>.</p> \n<p>Sharp asked how the business reconciles price complaints from suppliers with Woolworths\u2019 rising margins and record net profit results.</p> \n<p>Former chief executive Brad Banducci told the inquiry this was the \u201cretailer\u2019s challenge\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe retailer is always trying to balance delivering for the customer, which is where you\u2019ve got to start, treating your suppliers fairly because they\u2019ve also got to have a business that succeeds, doing the right thing for your employees \u2026 and then balancing that with a fair return to the shareholder,\u201d Banducci said.</p> \n<p>Bardwell said it was a \u201cconstant challenge\u201d to get the balance right.</p> \n<p>The National Farmers\u2019 Federation has complained to the ACCC the major supermarkets use \u201cexploitative\u201d buying practices that take advantage of growers <a

product</a>.</p> \n<p>The Woolworths executives were also asked to provide detail about any rebates they charge food suppliers, referring to payments they allegedly demand from producers on their final invoice.</p> \n<p>The ACCC\u2019s deputy chair, Mick Keogh, asked the executives to clarify their responses after a series of unclear answers.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll our discussions with suppliers \u2026 highlight their understanding and expectation that they will be asked to fund rebates in the region of 3 to 5% routinely,\u201d Keogh said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt seems your responses seem to indicate a lack of awareness of that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Woolworths representatives said they would clarify the issue on Tuesday.</p> \n<h2>Execs asked to explain yellow, red and pink tickets</h2> \n<p>Woolworths executives were questioned about the ticket colours placed throughout their stores, which often confuse shoppers according to <a href=\"https://www.choice.com.au/shopping/everyday-shopping/supermarkets/articles/supermarket-specials-survey\">surveys conducted by consumer group Choice</a>.</p> \n<p>Sharp asked why the supermarkets used the same colour tickets \u2013 yellow \u2013 on fresh produce items that weren\u2019t on sale and for some of its grocery specials and whether that was confusing for shoppers.</p> \n<p>Banducci said that yellow tickets indicated that the item was only available short term.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are looking for it, and it is a price that if you don\u2019t buy it this week, it won\u2019t be here next week, or if you don\u2019t buy it today, it might not be here tomorrow,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Red tickets indicate the product will be at a \u201cgreat price\u201d over the long term, while pink is used for new products.</p> \n<p>Woolworths representatives were asked why they didn\u2019t just reduce the usual price of goods, rather than run promotions.</p> \n<p>Bardwell said there was a long tradition of promotional pricing in Australia and that Woolworths offered low shelf prices for non-discounted items.</p> \n<p>Woolworths executives will answer further questions

      "body": "<p>In September 1981, 10 months after Ronald Reagan\u2019s sweeping 44-state victory over Jimmy Carter, 100 leading elected Democratic officials privately convened to formulate a response to Reaganism. Alan Cranston of California, the Senate minority whip, began the meeting with a fundamental question: \u201cIf our party is a coalition, unlike the Republicans, who tend to represent a single group, what are the common denominators, transcending regional differences and local interests, which make us a national party?\u201d</p> <p>In the four decades since the fracturing of the New Deal order, an answer to this question has largely eluded the Democratic party. Of the United States\u2019 20 highest-median-income states, Kamala Harris won 18; of the 20 lowest, Harris won just three. Democrats reliably win the counties that produce the majority of American economic output; Harris\u2019s losing base consisted of counties <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-again-won-counties-representing-a-minority-share-of-national-gdp-but-with-notable-gains/\">collectively representing</a> 60% of the GDP.

As the economist Daniela Gabor explains, the main way that Biden\u2019s industrial policy achieves this is by \u201c<a href=\"https://www.phenomenalworld.org/interviews/bidenomics/\">de-risking</a>\u201d investment for the private sector; aside from a handful of strategic tariffs, Biden largely refrained from using punitive measures to discipline investors. As such, there are few reasons for any corporate interests \u2013 including the dirty energy sector \u2013 to oppose this kind of agenda; indeed, the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute have already <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/24/big-business-biden-democrats-climate-law-00156378\">vowed</a> to defend the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) from a Republican majority.</p> <p>It was an agenda, in short, whose viability depended upon a careful aversion to offending moneyed donors and the upper strata of the bifurcated Democratic coalition. For a brief moment, it worked as intended: even Wall Street seemed to back the Biden administration\u2019s fiscal stimulus. This shared interest in revitalizing dilapidated American infrastructure, de-risking the domestic climate transition, and mildly expanding social programs appeared to be a serviceable Democratic common denominator. But when Bidenomics needed to speak to voters\u2019 immediate economic concerns \u2013 rising food, healthcare, childcare and energy costs driven by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/07/greedflation-corporate-profiteering-boosted-global-prices-study\">corporate greed</a> chiefly among them \u2013 Democratic consultants, policymakers and commentators had little beyond denial and outright scorn for those who dared even question the economy\u2019s strength.</p> <p>Jason Furman, a Harvard professor and Barack Obama\u2019s chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/01/14/biden-economy-message-election\">denied</a> that voters could truly be dissatisfied with the state of the economy at all: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the spending data that looks like anyone\u2019s upset about anything.\u201d Ben Harris, a Brookings Institution economist and a former treasury official under Biden, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/01/14/biden-economy-message-election\">concurred</a>: \u201cIf you really want to understand how people feel about the economy, look what they\u2019re doing \u2013 not what they\u2019re saying.\u201d The administration itself took the view that, given enough time, Americans would simply come to their senses: it was, in one Biden adviser\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/01/14/biden-economy-message-election\">words</a>, taking \u201cconsumers a while to kind of see data consistently\u201d.</p> <p>Insofar as the highest echelons of Democratic advisers had a strategy to manage immediate economic concerns, it was to simply wait things out. The trouble was that Americans never came to see the data the way the Biden administration insisted they would.

No serious answer to existential questions of economic anxiety, Harris found, would have <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/mark-cuban-kamala-harris\">satisfied</a> each bloc in the party.</p> <p>Bidenomics depended, in effect, upon these episodes of acute, zero-sum class conflict being perpetually delayable. This vision for the Democratic party proved completely incapable of challenging the forces driving inflation in 2022 and onward. Bidenomics might deliver a decarbonized \u201c<a href=\"https://www.noemamag.com/the-designer-economy/\">designer economy</a>\u201d in a decade\u2019s time, but its viability today depends upon raising and de-risking corporate profit margins. To openly confront capital, as a populist message against \u201cgreedflation\u201d might have, would have contradicted the project\u2019s entire nature.</p> <p>Even so, it should have been clear that even the elite constituency for de-risking has grown vanishingly small. BlackRock \u2013 which, in 2021, <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/literature/whitepaper/bii-davos-brief-2021.pdf\">told investors</a> that the American state\u2019s increased indebtedness would \u201clikely have more benign market implications than in the past\u201d \u2013 became more <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-ceo-fink-does-not-see-inflation-transitory-2021-07-14/\">hawkish</a> on inflation than the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, himself, insisting that the Biden administration\u2019s spending had overheated the American economy and that inflation was not simply transitory. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who worked with the Biden administration to craft the 2021 stimulus bill, has now reverted to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/15/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-urges-us-to-deal-with-its-fiscal-deficit.html\">demanding</a> that the Biden administration slash the American budget deficit. And no matter how \u201cde-risked\u201d its investments, JPMorgan itself has largely lost interest in climate transition, warning its clients of the need for a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/352b38a7-f298-4b54-adc2-f4cc1b17444b\">reality check</a>\u201d on phasing out fossil fuels earlier this year.</p> <p>Even the Biden administration\u2019s most tangible investments hardly resemble the \u201cgood jobs\u201d of the post-war era. Whatever their long-term effects, many of the new investments made under Bidenomics have flowed to the anti-union south. The Bidenites\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/15/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-increased-worker-organizing/\">hope</a> was that this might generate a renewed landscape for labor organizing and class conflict in America, out of which labor might eventually come out <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/biden-uaw-union-election-chattanooga-julie-su/\">on top</a> \u2013 though evidence for this effect has been, at best, <a href=\"https://inthesetimes.com/article/uaw-mercedes-benz-alabama-volkswagen-uaw-union\">mixed</a>. Workers at the IRA\u2019s banner investments suffer from the same precarity and abuse that characterize the entirety of the American political economy; in one acutely ironic case, a battery plant funded by a $9.2bn low-cost IRA loan took three months to address a mold outbreak, leaving workers severely ill. As one worker hospitalized for mold exposure at the IRA-funded plant <a href=\"https://labornotes.org/2024/02/fords-battery-flagship-socked-mold-sickness-workers-say\">put it</a>: \u201cThis is corporate America walking all over us.\u201d</p> <p>This, as political economist Max Kiefel <a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/latest/are-you-feeling-it-kiefel\">notes</a>, is the fundamental impasse of American industrial policy. Workers are to be <em>helped</em> by a highly professionalized party, whose <a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/latest/are-you-feeling-it-kiefel\">knowledge production</a> flows from consulting firms and thinktanks; they are never directly empowered themselves. In 1999, the political scientist Theda Skocpol described this mode of political association as a kind of \u201cadvocacy without members\u201d: the supposed benefactors of party advocacy ceased to be agents in the advocacy supposedly on their behalf.

Biden\u2019s margin of victory was considerable by modern standards; the broad, cross-class coalition united by Trump\u2019s incompetence in the face of the pandemic fulfilled, briefly so, the Democratic promise of a \u201cbig tent\u201d. But by the Bidenites\u2019 own admission, Biden\u2019s victory was the product of an exceptional historical moment: as the Democratic political consultant Anita Dunn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/24/covid-best-thing-biden-anita-dunn-lucky-book-jonathan-allen-annie-parnes\">admitted</a>: \u201cCovid is the best thing that ever happened to him.\u201d</p> <p>This is dark logic: a party requiring world-historic catastrophe to breathe life into its political fortunes can hardly be considered a serious contender for power. Anti-incumbent sentiment, though it can yield uniquely expansive coalitions, cuts both ways; it is not a reliable basis for a political project. But as long as the Democrats remain reliant upon tailing the fragments of American society and capital alienated from Trumpism, they will find themselves returning to the questions the party asked itself in 1981 \u2013 searching, still, for the common denominator that can make them a national party.</p> <ul> <li><p>Alex Bronzini-Vender is a writer living in New York</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "In September 1981, 10 months after Ronald Reagan\u2019s sweeping 44-state victory over Jimmy Carter, 100 leading elected Democratic officials privately convened to formulate a response to Reaganism. Alan Cranston of California, the Senate minority whip, began the meeting with a fundamental question: \u201cIf our party is a coalition, unlike the Republicans, who tend to represent a single group, what are the common denominators, transcending regional differences and local interests, which make us a national party?\u201d In the four decades since the fracturing of the New Deal order, an answer to this question has largely eluded the Democratic party. Of the United States\u2019 20 highest-median-income states, Kamala Harris won 18; of the 20 lowest, Harris won just three. Democrats reliably win the counties that produce the majority of American economic output; Harris\u2019s losing base consisted of counties collectively representing 60% of the GDP. Yet the Democrats continue to depend upon some portion \u2013 smaller and smaller each election \u2013 of the less-affluent denizens of metropolitan America. The result is a deeply bifurcated coalition with little by way of a unifying \u201ccommon denominator\u201d. Seen in this light, the Harris campaign\u2019s noncommittal nature \u2013 some talk of a ceasefire in Gaza alongside an enthusiastic embrace of the Cheneys\u2019 endorsement, some remarkably progressive economic messaging alongside reassurances to corporate America \u2013 reflected not just a strategic misstep by the Harris campaign, but a basic political dilemma for the party: unifying two poles of a wildly disparate coalition. Even stalwart Democratic loyalists have bemoaned the party\u2019s failure to offer a meaningful positive program; less theorized by these loyalists, perhaps deliberately so, are the forces preventing the Democrats from doing so.

The <a href=\"https://www.gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2019-08/the-state-of-the-evidence-on-20mph-speed-limits-with-regards-to-road-safety-active-travel-and-air-pollution-impacts-august-2018.pdf\">evidence that this would save lives</a> was unequivocal and overwhelming. </p> <p>The response from some to the policy was unrestrained fury. A petition on the Senedd website opposing the new measures has reached nearly <a href=\"https://petitions.senedd.wales/petitions/245548\">470,000 signatures</a> (in a nation of just over 3 million people).</p> <p>Protests sprang up citing the cost of the policy (<a href=\"https://www.gov.wales/introducing-20mph-speed-limits-frequently-asked-questions\">\u00a332m</a>, mostly on changing the road signs and markings). Some of them were somewhat counterintuitive \u2013 many of the 20mph signs were vandalised, meaning they had to be replaced at additional cost. And to show their displeasure at having to drive slower through communities, protesters also held <a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/live-updates-20mph-protesters-stage-27817072\">a go-slow drive</a> on the M4 and several other major Welsh roads.</p> <p>A far from exhaustive list of other gripes included that it would apparently result in more emissions (<a href=\"https://assets.nationbuilder.com/20splentyforus/pages/129/attachments/original/1656667967/speed_restriction_air_quality_report_2013_for_web_%281%29.pdf?1656667967\">it probably won\u2019t</a>), it would \u201cdestroy\u201d car engines, it would increase congestion, and road rage incidents would spike. As I reported on the policy, I couldn\u2019t believe my inbox. One taxi driver sent me furious messages claiming that accidents would \u201cskyrocket\u201d because people like him would be constantly \u201cstaring at the speedometer\u201d rather than looking at the road. This seemed an odd admission for a professional driver to make.</p> <p>However, a year on from the scheme\u2019s introduction we can see pretty strong evidence that the 20mph limit is very effective in saving lives and preventing injuries. We now <a href=\"https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Transport/Roads/Road-Accidents/Casualties\">have the road collision data</a> for the first three quarters since the policy was introduced and the figures are pretty clear. Compared with the same period the year before, the number of people killed on the affected roads is down 35%, serious injuries are down 14.2% and slight injuries 31%.</p> <p>Leaving aside all the children who won\u2019t be killed, the lives not ruined, there is also a massive financial benefit. The Department for Transport estimates that the total societal cost of someone being killed on the road is just over \u00a32.4m. A serious injury is \u00a3271,000. Even a \u201cslight\u201d injury is nearly \u00a321,000. If we apply these estimates to the first nine months in Wales we can see the savings that the <a href=\"https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Transport/Roads/Road-Accidents/Casualties/numberofcasualties-by-quarter-year-severity\">20mph change has made</a>. On roads affected by the change there were 10 fewer deaths compared with the previous period, saving \u00a324m. In just nine months there has been a total saving of \u00a345.5m \u2013 not even counting the long-term savings to the NHS from people taking up cycling or walking instead of driving, or the savings for many Welsh drivers caused by the <a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/20mph-limit-reducing-your-car-29907251\">reduction in their insurance premiums</a>. Makes that \u00a332m on new road signs and markings look like a pretty smart investment, right?</p> <p>So why all the outrage? Well, it turns out that much of it was manufactured. In January of this year <a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/english-tory-politicians-running-facebook-28449407\">I did a little digging</a> through four of the main Facebook groups opposing the change to 20mph in Wales.

      "bodyText": "Imagine you\u2019re a politician running a country. In front of you there is a proposal that in just nine months would save your society more than \u00a345m, prevent almost 500 people being killed or injured, make your residential areas more appealing places to live in and reduce car insurance premiums by an average of \u00a350. Tempting, right? Still not convinced? It is also backed by multiple scientific studies and examples of where it has been enacted in other parts of the world. Better yet, it was in your manifesto at the last election, when you became easily the largest party in your parliament. It also has the universal support of all emergency services in your nation. This is the dream. Yet this is exactly what happened in Wales and it became the single most unpopular and controversial piece of lawmaking in the (admittedly short) history of our Senedd (parliament).

      "body": "<p>There were two games on Sunday that allowed fans and analysts to get a good read on the AFC. In the early slate, there was the now 8-2 Pittsburgh Steelers v the now 7-4 Baltimore Ravens. In the late slate, it was the Kansas City Chiefs against the Buffalo Bills.</p> <p>Lamar Jackson has been great against most opponents as a passer, but the Steelers have had his number. In six previous career games against Baltimore\u2019s most prominent divisional opponent, Jackson had completed 78 passes on 132 attempts for 870 yards, four touchdowns, seven interceptions, and a passer rating of 66.8 \u2013 by far his lowest against any opponent. And against Pittsburgh on Sunday, Jackson completed just 16 of 33 passes for 207 yards, one touchdown, one interception, and a passer rating of \u2026 66.1. Pittsburgh have a knack for forcing Jackson to stay in the pocket, compressing things with pressure, and blanketing his receivers with tight coverage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/17/nfl-roundup-week-11-scores-results\">NFL roundup: Allen\u2019s 26-yard gallop helps Bills end Chiefs\u2019 bid for perfect season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Things began less than optimally for the Ravens on Sunday with several unexpected debits. Running back Derrick Henry, who is also a legitimate Most Valuable Player candidate this season, fumbled for the first time in a Ravens uniform, and for the first time in his last 538 touches. And future Hall of Fame kicker Justin Tucker continued his recent accuracy maladies with two missed field goals on consecutive drives in the first half. Tucker has already missed six field goal attempts this season after missing just five in the entire 2023 campaign.</p> <p>Those Tucker misses mattered a lot, because this was a typical Steelers-Ravens rock fight with the final score 18-16 in Pittsburgh\u2019s favor. That\u2019s the seventh straight Steelers-Ravens game in which neither team managed more than 20 points, and it was Steelers kicker Chris Boswell\u2019s six field goals in six attempts that made all the difference this time around.</p> <p>As for the formerly 9-0 Chiefs \u2026 well, there\u2019s been a legitimate argument all season long that they haven\u2019t played to a level worthy of that title. Coming into Week 11, Andy Reid\u2019s team had <a href=\"https://ftnfantasy.com/nfl/week-10-dvoa-are-49ers-doomed-to-underachieve\">the lowest point differential (+58) of any 9-0 team in pro football history</a>, and they\u2019ve underperformed to their record by any metric you care to mention.</p> <p>Patrick Mahomes has looked like a lesser version of himself through most of 2024, and that story continued when he threw a horrible interception on the second play of the game \u2013 a desperation heave as Buffalo defensive lineman DaQuan Jones was bringing him down.</p> <p>Bills quarterback Josh Allen responded <a href=\"https://x.com/Chiefs/status/1858277585924276271\">with his own ill-advised interception</a> to Chiefs defensive back Chamarri Conner on a fourth-and-three from the Kansas City 34-yard line with 7:38 left in the first half.</p> <p>So, that evened itself out.</p> <p>The Bills led 16-14 at halftime, which gave them no confidence whatsoever. The Chiefs came into this game with <a href=\"https://x.com/wingoz/status/1858283849702125740\">nine straight wins</a> in games where they\u2019ve trailed at any point in the second half, an NFL record.</p> <p>This time, luck worked in the Bills\u2019 favor. The Chiefs managed another touchdown in the second half, but Buffalo started to pull away when Allen hit receiver Curtis Samuel for a 12-yard touchdown with 12:51 left in the game.</p> <p>And then, with 2:17 remaining, head coach Sean McDermott decided to put things in Allen\u2019s hands \u2013 or, more specifically, his legs. On a fourth-and-two from the Kansas City 26-yard line, the Bills eschewed the easy field goal, and Allen <a href=\"https://x.com/NFL/status/1858303241391427722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">responded with a 26-yard touchdown run</a> that just about sealed the deal.</p> <p>Linebacker Terrel Bernard\u2019s <a href=\"https://x.com/BuffaloBills/status/1858305993404244079\">interception of Mahomes\u2019 pass</a> with 1:17 left put the boot in.</p> <p>The 30-21 final ended the Chiefs\u2019 hopes of an undefeated season, and gave the now 9-2 Bills a small measure of revenge against the team that has been their primary postseason nightmare over the last few years. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see these two behemoths face off in the playoffs once again.</p> <h2>MVP(s) of the week</h2> <p><strong>David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs, RB, Detroit Lions. </strong>The 10-1 Lions have won games when Jared Goff threw for just 85 yards (Week 8 v the Titans), and when he threw five interceptions (Week 10 v the Houston Texans). But Goff has been lights-out for the most part this season, and he was assisted on Sunday by the Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 pitiful defense (more on the turmoil in Jacksonville in a bit). But what makes this Lions team so dangerous is that they can still get it done when Goff\u2019s lights <em>are</em> out.</p> <p>One reason is a defense that has improved drastically now that defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn has the players he wants, especially in coverage. Another is the Detroit rushing attack. In the Lions\u2019 52-6 thrashing of the Jaguars, David Montgomery gained 75 yards and scored two touchdowns on 15 carries. Jahmyr Gibbs, the lightning to Montgomery\u2019s thunder, gained 69 yards and scored a rushing touchdown on 11 carries. Gibbs also <a href=\"https://x.com/Nate_Tice/status/1858226165334560986\">had a big 54-yard reception</a> on a simple swing pass.</p> <p>That two-headed rushing attack isn\u2019t just great \u2013 it\u2019s <a href=\"https://x.com/NFL345/status/1858222554067898516\">historic</a>.</p>    <h2>Video of the week</h2> <p>Since the Titans selected him in the second round in the 2023 NFL draft, quarterback Will Levis hasn\u2019t exactly looked like a franchise guy. On Sunday, he was facing a Minnesota Vikings defense that throws more disguise and late movement at enemy quarterbacks than any other. So, disaster was foreseen. The Titans lost the game, 23-13, but Levis had a couple of serviceable plays, and one very big one \u2013 this 98-yard touchdown to receiver Nick Westbrook-Ikhine. The Vikings went with a five-man pressure, and Westbrook-Ikhine beat his defender for the massive play.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1858241582660788482\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">98-YARD TD! \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31 Will Levis takes a shot out of the end zone and it pays off for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Titans?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Titans</a>! <br><br>\ud83d\udcfa: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MINvsTEN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MINvsTEN</a> on CBS/Paramount+<br>\ud83d\udcf1: <a href=\"https://t.co/waVpO909ge\">https://t.co/waVpO909ge</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0o5Uj7RZ9q\">pic.twitter.com/0o5Uj7RZ9q</a></p>&mdash; NFL (@NFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1858241582660788482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 17, 2024</a></blockquote>   </figure>  <p>Amazingly enough, that\u2019s not the longest play in Titans history. That honor goes to the aforementioned Henry, who pulled off <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlZvgdcIXvI\">this 99-yard touchdown run</a> against the Jaguars on 6 December 2018.</p> <h2>Stat of the week</h2> <p><strong>Seven.</strong> We do have to give Goff some love here, because he did something against the Jaguars that was quite remarkable. In the entire history of professional football, <a href=\"https://stathead.com/football/player-game-finder.cgi?request=1&amp;order_by=pass_td&amp;timeframe=seasons&amp;ccomp%5B1%5D=gt&amp;cval%5B1%5D=400&amp;cstat%5B1%5D=pass_yds&amp;ccomp%5B2%5D=gt&amp;cval%5B2%5D=158.3&amp;cstat%5B2%5D=pass_rating\">there have been seven games</a> in which a quarterback has thrown for at least 400 yards and at least four touchdown passes while recording the highest possible passer rating of 158.3. Ken O\u2019Brien of the New York Jets did it in 1986. Nick Foles of the Philadelphia Eagles did it in 2013. Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers and Deshaun Watson of the Texans each did it in 2019.</p> <p>The only other quarterback to accomplish this feat is Mr Goff, and he\u2019s now done so twice in his career.

      "bodyText": "There were two games on Sunday that allowed fans and analysts to get a good read on the AFC. In the early slate, there was the now 8-2 Pittsburgh Steelers v the now 7-4 Baltimore Ravens. In the late slate, it was the Kansas City Chiefs against the Buffalo Bills. Lamar Jackson has been great against most opponents as a passer, but the Steelers have had his number. In six previous career games against Baltimore\u2019s most prominent divisional opponent, Jackson had completed 78 passes on 132 attempts for 870 yards, four touchdowns, seven interceptions, and a passer rating of 66.8 \u2013 by far his lowest against any opponent. And against Pittsburgh on Sunday, Jackson completed just 16 of 33 passes for 207 yards, one touchdown, one interception, and a passer rating of \u2026 66.1. Pittsburgh have a knack for forcing Jackson to stay in the pocket, compressing things with pressure, and blanketing his receivers with tight coverage. Things began less than optimally for the Ravens on Sunday with several unexpected debits. Running back Derrick Henry, who is also a legitimate Most Valuable Player candidate this season, fumbled for the first time in a Ravens uniform, and for the first time in his last 538 touches. And future Hall of Fame kicker Justin Tucker continued his recent accuracy maladies with two missed field goals on consecutive drives in the first half. Tucker has already missed six field goal attempts this season after missing just five in the entire 2023 campaign. Those Tucker misses mattered a lot, because this was a typical Steelers-Ravens rock fight with the final score 18-16 in Pittsburgh\u2019s favor. That\u2019s the seventh straight Steelers-Ravens game in which neither team managed more than 20 points, and it was Steelers kicker Chris Boswell\u2019s six field goals in six attempts that made all the difference this time around. As for the formerly 9-0 Chiefs \u2026 well, there\u2019s been a legitimate argument all season long that they haven\u2019t played to a level worthy of that title. Coming into Week 11, Andy Reid\u2019s team had the lowest point differential (+58) of any 9-0 team in pro football history, and they\u2019ve underperformed to their record by any metric you care to mention. Patrick Mahomes has looked like a lesser version of himself through most of 2024, and that story continued when he threw a horrible interception on the second play of the game \u2013 a desperation heave as Buffalo defensive lineman DaQuan Jones was bringing him down. Bills quarterback Josh Allen responded with his own ill-advised interception to Chiefs defensive back Chamarri Conner on a fourth-and-three from the Kansas City 34-yard line with 7:38 left in the first half. So, that evened itself out. The Bills led 16-14 at halftime, which gave them no confidence whatsoever. The Chiefs came into this game with nine straight wins in games where they\u2019ve trailed at any point in the second half, an NFL record. This time, luck worked in the Bills\u2019 favor. The Chiefs managed another touchdown in the second half, but Buffalo started to pull away when Allen hit receiver Curtis Samuel for a 12-yard touchdown with 12:51 left in the game. And then, with 2:17 remaining, head coach Sean McDermott decided to put things in Allen\u2019s hands \u2013 or, more specifically, his legs. On a fourth-and-two from the Kansas City 26-yard line, the Bills eschewed the easy field goal, and Allen responded with a 26-yard touchdown run that just about sealed the deal. Linebacker Terrel Bernard\u2019s interception of Mahomes\u2019 pass with 1:17 left put the boot in. The 30-21 final ended the Chiefs\u2019 hopes of an undefeated season, and gave the now 9-2 Bills a small measure of revenge against the team that has been their primary postseason nightmare over the last few years. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see these two behemoths face off in the playoffs once again. MVP(s) of the week David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs, RB, Detroit Lions. The 10-1 Lions have won games when Jared Goff threw for just 85 yards (Week 8 v the Titans), and when he threw five interceptions (Week 10 v the Houston Texans). But Goff has been lights-out for the most part this season, and he was assisted on Sunday by the Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 pitiful defense (more on the turmoil in Jacksonville in a bit). But what makes this Lions team so dangerous is that they can still get it done when Goff\u2019s lights are out. One reason is a defense that has improved drastically now that defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn has the players he wants, especially in coverage. Another is the Detroit rushing attack. In the Lions\u2019 52-6 thrashing of the Jaguars, David Montgomery gained 75 yards and scored two touchdowns on 15 carries. Jahmyr Gibbs, the lightning to Montgomery\u2019s thunder, gained 69 yards and scored a rushing touchdown on 11 carries. Gibbs also had a big 54-yard reception on a simple swing pass. That two-headed rushing attack isn\u2019t just great \u2013 it\u2019s historic. Video of the week Since the Titans selected him in the second round in the 2023 NFL draft, quarterback Will Levis hasn\u2019t exactly looked like a franchise guy. On Sunday, he was facing a Minnesota Vikings defense that throws more disguise and late movement at enemy quarterbacks than any other. So, disaster was foreseen. The Titans lost the game, 23-13, but Levis had a couple of serviceable plays, and one very big one \u2013 this 98-yard touchdown to receiver Nick Westbrook-Ikhine. The Vikings went with a five-man pressure, and Westbrook-Ikhine beat his defender for the massive play. Amazingly enough, that\u2019s not the longest play in Titans history. That honor goes to the aforementioned Henry, who pulled off this 99-yard touchdown run against the Jaguars on 6 December 2018. Stat of the week Seven. We do have to give Goff some love here, because he did something against the Jaguars that was quite remarkable. In the entire history of professional football, there have been seven games in which a quarterback has thrown for at least 400 yards and at least four touchdown passes while recording the highest possible passer rating of 158.3. Ken O\u2019Brien of the New York Jets did it in 1986. Nick Foles of the Philadelphia Eagles did it in 2013. Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers and Deshaun Watson of the Texans each did it in 2019. The only other quarterback to accomplish this feat is Mr Goff, and he\u2019s now done so twice in his career. There was his game against the Vikings on 27 September 2018, when he completed 26 of 33 passes for 465 yards, five touchdowns, and no interceptions. And there was Sunday\u2019s game against the Jaguars, when he completed 24 of 29 passes for 419 yards, four touchdowns, and no picks. Goff isn\u2019t always the most consistent quarterback, but when he\u2019s on, he\u2019s really on. As long as that\u2019s the case, and as much as we\u2019ve talked about the AFC, anybody trying to stop the Lions\u2019 Super Bowl chase might need more than a little bit of luck. Elsewhere around the league \u2022 The Chicago Bears fired offensive coordinator Shane Waldron after the team\u2019s 19-3 Week 10 loss to the New England Patriots because the entire unit was broken, and 2024 first overall pick Caleb Williams looked like a shell of the quarterback he was expected to be. There were all kinds of reasons for that \u2013 most on Waldron and some on Williams \u2013 but under replacement OC Thomas Brown against the Packers, Williams looked far more like the star he was at USC. While Waldron had Williams sitting in the pocket for too long so that he could throw hopelessly into route combinations that made little sense, Brown smartly designed things so the rookie would get the ball out more quickly, and his first reads were more readily open. Brown also clearly told Williams that if he didn\u2019t like what he saw downfield, he should use his legs. The rookie responded with a game in which he completed 23 of 31 passes for 231 yards, no touchdowns, no interceptions and a passer rating of 74.2. Not world-beating numbers, but there is now a semblance of a passing game in the Windy City. Sadly, the Bears could not turn that into a win; they lost 20-19 to the Packers in part because Green Bay defensive lineman Karl Brooks blocked Cairo Santos\u2019 46-yard field goal attempt as time expired. Bears head coach Matt Eberflus, whose in-game mismanagements have been a problem for a while, might want to read up on geometry. Instead of running another play to get more yardage and an easier try for Santos, Eberflus chose to bleed the clock down to the three-second mark. Several Packers players said that the longer field goal forced Santos to kick the ball at a lower trajectory, which made it easier to block. \u2022 Speaking of embattled coaches\u2026 After Jacksonville\u2019s Week 10 loss to the Vikings, Jaguars head coach Doug Pederson dismissively told a local reporter that he wouldn\u2019t explain backup quarterback Mac Jones\u2019 second interception in the 12-7 loss because \u201cyou guys wouldn\u2019t figure it out.\u201d That was the latest in a long line of embarrassments in the Jaguars\u2019 season, which began with team owner Shad Khan saying outright that the 2024 Jags were the best-assembled team in franchise history, and that the expectation was to win now. That has clearly not happened for the 2-9 Jags, who have been a disaster on both sides of the ball. This week, Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network reported that the seat under Pederson is white-hot, and were the Jags to be embarrassed by the Lions on Sunday, it could predicate movement for Pederson \u2013 ie, right out the door.

The only good news for the replacements is that the Jags are in position for the first overall pick in the 2025 draft. \u2022 The Denver Broncos have cycled through quarterback after quarterback (14, to be exact) since Peyton Manning retired at the end of the 2015 season. The search has been fruitless, and it includes the 2022 trade with the Seattle Seahawks for Russell Wilson that became one of the most onerous deals in recent history. The Broncos released Wilson in March, despite the fact that the cut left the Broncos with $85m in dead salary cap resources over the following two league years.

      "body": "<p>A little perspective is always useful at times like this. How many people, for example, genuinely expected England to beat the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/16/england-south-africa-autumn-nations-series-match-report\">world champions, South Africa, on Saturday</a>? A good side winning an absorbing game of rugby does not necessarily mean the gallant losers are totally hopeless. England\u2019s autumn has certainly been full of drama but is it really a full-blown crisis?</p> <p>A \u2018crisis\u2019, in sporting terms, refers to the indisputable point at which a team start to perform so far below expectations that there is no discernible hope. Yes, a fifth defeat on the trot is uncomfortable for a supposed top-tier nation. Yes, they continue to tail off in the final half-hours of too many big games. A limp finish is increasingly what springs to mind when analysts lie back and think of England.</p> <p>History, at this juncture, is also worth consulting. England have statistically endured far worse autumns; in 2008, the last time they lost at home to the southern hemisphere big three on consecutive weekends, the aggregate losing margin was a grim -76. Compare and contrast that with this month\u2019s equivalent figure of -16 and three cracking contests which, even given today\u2019s inflated ticket prices, gave spectators full value.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/17/the-only-thing-steve-borthwicks-england-are-developing-is-a-losing-habit\">The only thing Steve Borthwick\u2019s England are developing is a losing habit | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So let\u2019s sit back and ponder the slightly bigger picture. Has anyone been watching Marcus Smith and concluded England\u2019s future is bereft of possibility?</p> <p>Do they look at Sam Underhill and Freddie Steward and think England are seriously lacking in terms of squad depth? Do they assume that Alex Mitchell, Ollie Chessum, Manny Feyi-Waboso and Tom Curry will not make England any more competitive in next year\u2019s Six Nations.</p> <p>Nor do they have to face teams as strong as South Africa every week. The Springboks were unable to unleash their full \u201cBomb Squad\u201d because of Ox Nch\u00e9\u2019s gashed knee in the first half, but the reason they are the world\u2019s top ranked team is because of their mental and physical resilience in the latter stages of big games. To airbrush away the brilliant footwork of Cheslin Kolbe would also be unfair. Ditto the pace and spatial awareness of Grant Williams, whose opening try was an individual gem of which even the great Antoine Dupont would have been proud.</p>    <p>Viewed in isolation, then, England have had worse days. The problem is the cumulative drag of seven defeats in 11 games this year, their four wins coming against Italy, Wales, Ireland (by a point at home) and Japan. Even if they finally banish \u201cthe curse of Allianz Stadium\u201d and brush aside the Brave Blossoms again this Sunday, their 2024 stats will look pretty ugly.</p> <p>Perhaps of more significance, though, is England\u2019s record against the top four teams over the past 20 years, as highlighted by the sharp-eyed rugby statistician Russ Petty. Since being crowned world champions in 2003, they have played 84 Tests against sides ranked in the top four and have won 23 of them, with two draws. Between late 2006 and mid-2010, when their post-2003 slump was at its steepest, they lost 14 on the trot.</p> <p>Interestingly Andy Robinson and Eddie Jones also lost their jobs as England head coaches after home defeats \u2013 by 11 and 14 points respectively \u2013 by the Springboks. There were extenuating circumstances in both cases but the figure against the world\u2019s top four on Steve Borthwick\u2019s watch is P10 L9, with Ireland away and France at home kicking off their 2025 Six Nations campaign.</p> <p>Add it together and the 2025 Six Nations potentially looms as kill or cure for Borthwick\u2019s England project. Lose to Ireland and France (victorious over New Zealand on Saturday night) inside eight days, then slip up against Scotland or Italy at home or beleaguered Wales away and the political sands beneath his feet will definitely start to shift.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/16/its-painful-but-were-on-the-right-path-borthwick-positive-despite-springbok-defeat\">\u2018It\u2019s painful but we\u2019re on the right path\u2019: Borthwick positive despite Springbok defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because, for all Smith\u2019s abundant promise, one player cannot transform the landscape. On Saturday they had five lineouts in the Springbok 22 in the final quarter and came away with nil points. Kolbe\u2019s elusiveness was indeed mesmeric but some leaden-footed defending also played its part. Most glaring was the missed midfield tackle on Damian de Allende which permitted the all-important line break. Twelve opposition tries and an average of almost 32 points conceded in three games is not good enough.</p> <p>It further reinforces the sense that the abrupt summer resignations of Felix Jones and Aled Walters from England\u2019s coaching staff were every bit as disruptive as they felt at the time.</p> <p>Borthwick keeps talking about consistency and continuity while, behind him, the faces and roles keep rotating. Whoever is selected against Japan \u2013 and this is surely a perfect opportunity to give some fringe squad members a run \u2013 it will also not alter the fact the spine of England\u2019s side needs reinforcing. Borthwick is not certain of his best options at 15, 12 or 9, could do with a more powerful ball-carrying No 8 and has a 34-year-old hooker who may not make the next World Cup.</p> <p>It is similarly valid to wonder whether the gameplan is making the absolute most of the talent available and whether Borthwick\u2019s bench, as ever, needs more dynamism. A frustrated England are not yet in crisis but if they remain unable to kick their losing habit they soon will be.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A little perspective is always useful at times like this. How many people, for example, genuinely expected England to beat the world champions, South Africa, on Saturday? A good side winning an absorbing game of rugby does not necessarily mean the gallant losers are totally hopeless. England\u2019s autumn has certainly been full of drama but is it really a full-blown crisis? A \u2018crisis\u2019, in sporting terms, refers to the indisputable point at which a team start to perform so far below expectations that there is no discernible hope. Yes, a fifth defeat on the trot is uncomfortable for a supposed top-tier nation. Yes, they continue to tail off in the final half-hours of too many big games. A limp finish is increasingly what springs to mind when analysts lie back and think of England. History, at this juncture, is also worth consulting. England have statistically endured far worse autumns; in 2008, the last time they lost at home to the southern hemisphere big three on consecutive weekends, the aggregate losing margin was a grim -76. Compare and contrast that with this month\u2019s equivalent figure of -16 and three cracking contests which, even given today\u2019s inflated ticket prices, gave spectators full value. So let\u2019s sit back and ponder the slightly bigger picture. Has anyone been watching Marcus Smith and concluded England\u2019s future is bereft of possibility? Do they look at Sam Underhill and Freddie Steward and think England are seriously lacking in terms of squad depth? Do they assume that Alex Mitchell, Ollie Chessum, Manny Feyi-Waboso and Tom Curry will not make England any more competitive in next year\u2019s Six Nations. Nor do they have to face teams as strong as South Africa every week. The Springboks were unable to unleash their full \u201cBomb Squad\u201d because of Ox Nch\u00e9\u2019s gashed knee in the first half, but the reason they are the world\u2019s top ranked team is because of their mental and physical resilience in the latter stages of big games. To airbrush away the brilliant footwork of Cheslin Kolbe would also be unfair. Ditto the pace and spatial awareness of Grant Williams, whose opening try was an individual gem of which even the great Antoine Dupont would have been proud. Viewed in isolation, then, England have had worse days. The problem is the cumulative drag of seven defeats in 11 games this year, their four wins coming against Italy, Wales, Ireland (by a point at home) and Japan. Even if they finally banish \u201cthe curse of Allianz Stadium\u201d and brush aside the Brave Blossoms again this Sunday, their 2024 stats will look pretty ugly. Perhaps of more significance, though, is England\u2019s record against the top four teams over the past 20 years, as highlighted by the sharp-eyed rugby statistician Russ Petty. Since being crowned world champions in 2003, they have played 84 Tests against sides ranked in the top four and have won 23 of them, with two draws. Between late 2006 and mid-2010, when their post-2003 slump was at its steepest, they lost 14 on the trot. Interestingly Andy Robinson and Eddie Jones also lost their jobs as England head coaches after home defeats \u2013 by 11 and 14 points respectively \u2013 by the Springboks. There were extenuating circumstances in both cases but the figure against the world\u2019s top four on Steve Borthwick\u2019s watch is P10 L9, with Ireland away and France at home kicking off their 2025 Six Nations campaign. Add it together and the 2025 Six Nations potentially looms as kill or cure for Borthwick\u2019s England project. Lose to Ireland and France (victorious over New Zealand on Saturday night) inside eight days, then slip up against Scotland or Italy at home or beleaguered Wales away and the political sands beneath his feet will definitely start to shift. Because, for all Smith\u2019s abundant promise, one player cannot transform the landscape. On Saturday they had five lineouts in the Springbok 22 in the final quarter and came away with nil points. Kolbe\u2019s elusiveness was indeed mesmeric but some leaden-footed defending also played its part. Most glaring was the missed midfield tackle on Damian de Allende which permitted the all-important line break. Twelve opposition tries and an average of almost 32 points conceded in three games is not good enough. It further reinforces the sense that the abrupt summer resignations of Felix Jones and Aled Walters from England\u2019s coaching staff were every bit as disruptive as they felt at the time. Borthwick keeps talking about consistency and continuity while, behind him, the faces and roles keep rotating. Whoever is selected against Japan \u2013 and this is surely a perfect opportunity to give some fringe squad members a run \u2013 it will also not alter the fact the spine of England\u2019s side needs reinforcing. Borthwick is not certain of his best options at 15, 12 or 9, could do with a more powerful ball-carrying No 8 and has a 34-year-old hooker who may not make the next World Cup. It is similarly valid to wonder whether the gameplan is making the absolute most of the talent available and whether Borthwick\u2019s bench, as ever, needs more dynamism. A frustrated England are not yet in crisis but if they remain unable to kick their losing habit they soon will be.",

      "body": "<p>Benin City in modern-day Nigeria was once the capital of a bustling kingdom which left a magnificent artistic legacy of plaques and sculpture in cast bronze which were looted by British colonial forces in 1897.</p> <p>Now, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/08/the-guardian-view-on-the-benin-bronzes-leading-the-way-home\">an increasing number</a> of western museums are returning artefacts, or pledging to repatriate them, the south Nigerian city is getting a new museum that will put to rest the idea that \u201cAfrica has no space and capacity to look after its heritage,\u201d says Shadreck Chirikure, professor of archaeological science at the University of Oxford, and adviser to the new museum.</p> <p>The Museum of West African Art (<a href=\"https://wearemowaa.org/\">Mowaa</a>), a constellation of buildings and outdoor performance spaces spread out across a 6-hectare (15-acre) campus, will hold its inaugural exhibition in May 2025.</p> <p>While Mowaa will not be the home of the returned bronzes, the impetus that led to its establishment was to address the deficit in infrastructure that has hindered restitution efforts, says the museum.</p> <p>This month, Mowaa held what it called \u201cthe hard hat opening\u201d of its institute building, a research, conservation and collections centre equipped with climate-controlled storage rooms, cutting-edge labs and exhibition spaces.

      "bodyText": "Benin City in modern-day Nigeria was once the capital of a bustling kingdom which left a magnificent artistic legacy of plaques and sculpture in cast bronze which were looted by British colonial forces in 1897. Now, as an increasing number of western museums are returning artefacts, or pledging to repatriate them, the south Nigerian city is getting a new museum that will put to rest the idea that \u201cAfrica has no space and capacity to look after its heritage,\u201d says Shadreck Chirikure, professor of archaeological science at the University of Oxford, and adviser to the new museum. The Museum of West African Art (Mowaa), a constellation of buildings and outdoor performance spaces spread out across a 6-hectare (15-acre) campus, will hold its inaugural exhibition in May 2025. While Mowaa will not be the home of the returned bronzes, the impetus that led to its establishment was to address the deficit in infrastructure that has hindered restitution efforts, says the museum. This month, Mowaa held what it called \u201cthe hard hat opening\u201d of its institute building, a research, conservation and collections centre equipped with climate-controlled storage rooms, cutting-edge labs and exhibition spaces. A series of workshops and live archaeological excavations were held to introduce visitors to Mowaa, and \u201cstart an open dialogue on what it means to be an African museum in the 21st century\u201d. Chirikure says that Mowaa has the potential \u201cto be among the best in the world for holding returning objects\u201d. \u201cIt used to be argued that Africa has no space and capacity to look after its heritage,\u201d he says. \u201cIf there were those who did not believe in the vision or that Africans can do it, the opening of the institute demonstrates that Mowaa is now a reality, and that contemporary Africans, like their ancestors who made the famous Benin bronzes, are capable of looking after their heritage using the highest standards found anywhere in the world.\u201d There are two adjoining galleries in the institute, the atrium and special exhibition gallery. The atrium, expected to open in mid-2025, will be largely fixed, hosting Mowaa\u2019s long-term collection, showcasing archaeological finds alongside historical treasures, while the special exhibition gallery will be used for rotating temporary shows. Some of the works that will be shown at the institute include an ibwese, a large, carved and painted wooden thumb piano featuring human, antelope and cat-like forms, and bronze works from the middle Niger civilisations, including an arresting pendant of complex iconography dated between the 13th and 15th century from Mali. Nengi Omuku, a Lagos-based visual artist who specialises in abstract paintings that draw from the natural world, describes Mowaa\u2019s arrival as \u201ctruly a significant moment in our history\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s a great opportunity for artists to access art we have admired for so long but may have only seen in books\u201d. The museum, which is independent and not for profit, has received funding from a range of sources including the German government, the Mellon Foundation and the British Museum. \u201cMowaa is more than a cultural institution,\u201d says Phillip Ihenacho, its executive director. \u201cIt is a vital centre for economic opportunity, community development and supporting and celebrating West Africa\u2019s diverse creative energy across a broad range of disciplines.\u201d Ore Disu, director of the Mowaa Institute, says that she took up her post \u201cwith a strong sense that we should create something that gives Black and African people a sense of their place in the world\u201d. \u201cMuseums are repositories of our humanity \u2013 our relationships, our way of life, our worldview, our connection with the Earth and the supernatural, our hopes for the future,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is why the destruction and displacement of cultural material is so detrimental. It robs whole parts of society of a grounded way to articulate their sense of self. It threatens the very roots of our self-esteem.\u201d The international tide is turning on the restitution of looted art, with museums in the UK, Germany and the US already returning or pledging to return items, despite stalemates at bigger institutions such as the British Museum, which has more than 900 Benin bronzes in its collection. An Oba\u2019s head and cockerel, and a brass plaque and wooden altarpiece are among Benin bronzes already returned to Nigeria, but not held at Mowaa. Disu, who was born and raised in Lagos, says that Mowaa\u2019s vision is to reverse \u201ca sense of disconnect [that] is palpable\u201d in the museums that already exist in west Africa. \u201cWhile underfunding plays a role, many museums also have been slow to reinvent themselves for contemporary audiences, often remaining the clunky memorabilia of colonial systems of accumulation and nationalist narratives,\u201d she says. \u201cRather than a single monolithic museum, we are developing a campus with multiple exhibition spaces connected by memorial gardens and performance areas. This layout is inspired by historic Benin City, where guilds and entrepreneurial communities were woven into the ancient walled complex.\u201d Disu calls the institute \u201cMowaa\u2019s brainbox\u201d. The building, which will feature a 100-seat auditorium, conference rooms, conservation laboratories and a library, is made from rammed earth, a warm red material symbolic of Benin\u2019s traditional architecture.

What we found was truly magical,\u201d she said, adding that the home was like a \u201cshrine\u201d.</p>      <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/oct/12/eric-morecambe-ernie-wise-letter\">letter from Wise to Morecambe</a> shines light one of the great \u201cwhat if\u201d moments of British comedy history.</p> <p>\u201cWell Eric I want to get straight to the point,\u201d Wise writes. \u201cI want us to break up the act. I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>Wise talks of \u201cterrific amount\u201d of animosity that he is feeling at home and says it would be better if they parted.</p> <p>\u201cI know this will be quite a shock to you but I had to come to some decision. I can\u2019t go on as things are, I\u2019m not satisfied with my work, I have lost a lot of zip and it will take time to regain it. I can\u2019t keep you waiting around for me, I don\u2019t know definitely when I will be out.</p> <p>\u201cI feel it\u2019s a great pity after we had planned so much, but my mind\u2019s made up.\u201d</p> <p>Wise goes on to express hope they will remain friends and is signed, \u201cyour best pal, Ernie\u201d.</p> <p>Morecambe\u2019s response, he later told his son Gary, was to straight away write back and say he had never heard such rubbish in his life. He advised Wise to get some rest before they got back to finding work, which is precisely what happened.</p>    <p>The pair first worked as a double act as teenagers in 1941, appearing at the Liverpool Empire as Bartholomew and Wise. They got their own radio series, You\u2019re Only Young Once, in 1953 but it was the 60s when their careers really took off, after they accepted Lew Grade\u2019s offer of an ATV television series.</p> <p>They went on to become the biggest stars on British television, and their Christmas shows were as traditional a part of a 1970s family\u2019s Christmas Day as dry turkey, overcooked sprouts and drunken relatives.</p> <p>Among the 700 Morecambe lots being offered by Hansons auctioneers in Derbyshire is a well-used makeup box; the call sheet for the duo\u2019s 1965 film The Intelligence Men; and letters from Ronnie Barker, Prince Philip and Prince Charles.</p> <p>The items are being sold by Eric and Joan\u2019s three children: Gail, Gary and Steven.</p> <p>The couple\u2019s daughter, Gail Stuart, said 2024 had felt like an \u201cend of an era\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cGrowing up you have no idea your childhood is blessed not just with the material surroundings but blessed to have two such special individuals as our parents.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe grew up sharing dad with the British people, the amazing fans.

      "bodyText": "They became arguably the greatest comedy duo Britain has ever produced but if Eric Morecambe had listened to a young and despondent Ernie Wise they would have split up before ever getting properly started. A poignant 1950 letter from Wise to Morecambe is part of a remarkable treasure trove of memorabilia to be auctioned in the new year. The lots, all from Morecambe\u2019s former home in Hertfordshire, include letters from Margaret Thatcher and Tommy Cooper as well as sketch ideas, scripts, photographs and personal items such as his pipe and spectacles. As a whole it is a \u201ctruly remarkable\u201d collection, said Victoria Sheppard, the sale manager, who recalled her jaw dropping as she entered the Morecambe family home after the death of Eric\u2019s wife, Joan, earlier this year. \u201cI was in complete awe. What we found was truly magical,\u201d she said, adding that the home was like a \u201cshrine\u201d. The letter from Wise to Morecambe shines light one of the great \u201cwhat if\u201d moments of British comedy history. \u201cWell Eric I want to get straight to the point,\u201d Wise writes. \u201cI want us to break up the act. I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t work.\u201d Wise talks of \u201cterrific amount\u201d of animosity that he is feeling at home and says it would be better if they parted. \u201cI know this will be quite a shock to you but I had to come to some decision. I can\u2019t go on as things are, I\u2019m not satisfied with my work, I have lost a lot of zip and it will take time to regain it. I can\u2019t keep you waiting around for me, I don\u2019t know definitely when I will be out. \u201cI feel it\u2019s a great pity after we had planned so much, but my mind\u2019s made up.\u201d Wise goes on to express hope they will remain friends and is signed, \u201cyour best pal, Ernie\u201d. Morecambe\u2019s response, he later told his son Gary, was to straight away write back and say he had never heard such rubbish in his life. He advised Wise to get some rest before they got back to finding work, which is precisely what happened. The pair first worked as a double act as teenagers in 1941, appearing at the Liverpool Empire as Bartholomew and Wise. They got their own radio series, You\u2019re Only Young Once, in 1953 but it was the 60s when their careers really took off, after they accepted Lew Grade\u2019s offer of an ATV television series. They went on to become the biggest stars on British television, and their Christmas shows were as traditional a part of a 1970s family\u2019s Christmas Day as dry turkey, overcooked sprouts and drunken relatives. Among the 700 Morecambe lots being offered by Hansons auctioneers in Derbyshire is a well-used makeup box; the call sheet for the duo\u2019s 1965 film The Intelligence Men; and letters from Ronnie Barker, Prince Philip and Prince Charles. The items are being sold by Eric and Joan\u2019s three children: Gail, Gary and Steven. The couple\u2019s daughter, Gail Stuart, said 2024 had felt like an \u201cend of an era\u201d. She said: \u201cGrowing up you have no idea your childhood is blessed not just with the material surroundings but blessed to have two such special individuals as our parents.\u201d \u201cWe grew up sharing dad with the British people, the amazing fans. It wasn\u2019t until dad died that I realised the affection for dad and for Morecambe and Wise ran so deep. \u201cKnowing it made sharing him through my childhood feel OK. It has helped to inform this decision to share what was left in our home with the world at large. \u201cDad would love that. That is the legacy.\u201d The collection will be offered by Hansons auctioneers on 10 and 11 January , with the catalogue due to go live on 1 December.",

      "body": "<p>I sometimes think of mysticism \u2013 the name we give to ecstatic, transformative experiences of absorption into absolute reality or, if you will, into God \u2013 as the subject that fascinates where all others merely interest. And yet it denotes something singularly hard to talk or write about, indeed virtually defined by its ineffability. <em>On Mysticism</em>, the philosopher Simon Critchley\u2019s stab at effing the ineffable, feels oddly timely. As he notes: \u201cThere is an awful lot of mysticism about. More than ever in recent years.\u201d He doesn\u2019t speculate, but the widespread interest may point to that metaphysical restlessness that wells up during periods of acute cultural change \u2013 the return of the transcendental to a reality system no longer adequate for the times.</p> <p>Among the more widely read and prolific of modern academic philosophers, Critchley has written books on topics as disparate as football, suicide and David Bowie. In a faintly defensive account of his interest in his current subject, he rightly points out that mysticism has been relegated and ignored within modern philosophy (with rare exceptions such as Nietzsche and Georges Bataille), whose rationalist bias favours critique, sobriety, laboriousness and rigour. He sees his book as a bid to push back against this epochal neglect.</p> <p>An Englishman with a love of TS Eliot\u2019s poetic evocations of the country and for medieval (mostly female) mystics \u2013 he knows his Hadewijch of Antwerp from his Mechthild of Magdeburg \u2013 Critchley sticks to the religious tradition he knows best: his study should more accurately be titled On <em>Christian </em>Mysticism. The riches of the Hindu-Buddhist east don\u2019t get a look-in. Nor do Sufism, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/kabbalah-religion-marcus-weston-madonna\">Kabbalah</a>, or the philosophically subversive field of psychedelic experience \u2013 a post-monotheist bleeding edge of mystical consciousness. This narrowness notwithstanding, <em>On Mysticism </em>is a welcome, sometimes fascinating, perhaps inevitably frustrating book.</p>    <p>Most of the historical figures we think of as mystics did not see themselves as such: they were, rather, religious people whose devotion inspired experiences that revitalised, and in some cases, threatened the religious traditions they lived within (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/jun/07/marguerite-porete-mirror-simple-souls\">Marguerite Porete</a>, a French Catholic mystic, was burned as a heretic in 1310). Critchley delves into the often fragmentary writings of various medieval Christian mystics \u2013 with particular focus on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/23/for-thy-great-pain-have-mercy-on-my-little-pain-by-victoria-mackenzie-review\">Julian of Norwich</a>, notable for being the first female autobiographer in English, and Meister Eckhart, a cryptic German mystical theologian (and another heretic) who would influence Martin Heidegger.</p> <p>Critchley prefers to talk of mystical <em>consciousness </em>rather than mystical experience. More than a matter of intense sensations, mysticism comprises \u201cnew ways of knowing and loving\u201d that flower from elevated awareness. Following the theologian Bernard McGinn, he sees \u201cmysticism as a practice that melds together experience and theology\u2026 Mystical experience without theology is blind. Mystical theology without experience is empty.\u201d Critchley highlights the interplay between reading and contemplation: studying texts can trigger ecstatic transport, which in turn leads to a deeper \u201clayering of concepts with experience\u201d.</p> <p>He runs us through various distinctions within the tradition of mystical theology. Cue plenty of exotic words: <em>kenosis</em>, <em>kataphasis</em>,<em> </em><em>soteriology</em>, <em>theosis</em>.<em> </em>He\u2019s particularly drawn towards <em>apophatic</em><em> </em>or negative theology: the tradition of moving ever closer to the divine by naming everything that God is <em>not</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The best sections depart from the medievals to broaden our sense of who and what the mystical tradition includes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Post-Enlightenment philosophy, Critchley notes, writes off mysticism as delusion, charlatanism or nonsense \u2013 and yet I wondered if he remains too much within academic orthodoxy to effectively spike his discipline with the mystical virus. (His admission to stridently professing a less than robust atheism to fit in with \u201cfiercely secular\u201d colleagues doesn\u2019t allay such suspicions.) Mystical vision naturally calls for conceptualisation \u2013 Julian of Norwich had a single divine experience lasting a few hours, then spent decades working out what it meant \u2013 but Critchley\u2019s compulsive parsing of mystical utterance into ever finer abstractions <em>comes between </em>his fascination with mysticism and the blood-red heart of the thing itself. His vivisections of Julian of Norwich and Meister Eckhart work against the mystics\u2019 promise of immediacy, transfiguration, \u201cexperience in its most intense form\u201d. We\u2019re left wistfully eyeing mystical transport in a shop window: \u201cI admire mystics who luxuriate in God and I luxuriate in their luxuriations.\u201d</p> <p>But perhaps this is splitting hairs on my part, towards a writer professionally committed to hair-splitting: it\u2019s a stretch to expect a book <em>about </em>mysticism to deliver mystical experience. Critchley is largely content to serve as a tour guide to other people\u2019s transports (he unambitiously claims he will consider his project a success if it persuades a few readers to check out the biblical Song of Songs). The best sections depart from the medievals to broaden our sense of who and what the mystical tradition includes: a bravura series of chapters traces a line from Julian of Norwich through the wondrous American nature writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/for-the-time-being-annie-dillard-1975-book-religion\">Annie Dillard</a> \u2013 in particular her short, crazily metaphysical book <em>Holy the Firm</em>, which features a little girl named Julie Norwich \u2013 to the incantatory mysteries of Eliot\u2019s late, great <em>Four Quartets</em>\u2026 which, looping back around in a mystical spiral, quotes Julian (\u201cAnd all shall be well and/All manner of thing shall be well\u201d). While Eliot was himself no mystic (bar \u201ca few flashes during my life\u201d), Critchley\u2019s reading paints the quartets as a kind of poetic mysticism \u2013 a work that approaches, and ultimately vanishes into, <em>that which</em> <em>is beyond </em>poetry.</p> <p>Reflecting on how the monastically incubated mysticism of old has diffused through modernity as aesthetic experience, Critchley veers close to banality in suggesting that by listening to the music we love (and Critchley not very illuminatingly tells us about music <em>he </em>loves), we\u2019re enjoying mystical consciousness. Better to think of music \u2013 or drugs \u2013 as the gateway drug that turns people on to mystical promise in the first place. Critchley can undermine his own credibility \u2013 I like Jarvis Cocker as much as the next guy, but calling him \u201ca poet of the first magnitude\u201d does no one any favours. Fortunately, though, he\u2019s sceptical enough to see that the channelling of religious intensity into aesthetic bliss entails a domestication of the ecstatic. A corollary might be that we think of mystical yearning under capitalism as a kind of underground resistance \u2013 the glimpses that break through, despite everything, of a mysterious splendour invulnerable to economic, technological or political encroachment.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>On Mysticism: The Experience of Ecstasy</em> by Simon Critchley is published by Profile (\u00a318.99).

      "bodyText": "I sometimes think of mysticism \u2013 the name we give to ecstatic, transformative experiences of absorption into absolute reality or, if you will, into God \u2013 as the subject that fascinates where all others merely interest. And yet it denotes something singularly hard to talk or write about, indeed virtually defined by its ineffability. On Mysticism, the philosopher Simon Critchley\u2019s stab at effing the ineffable, feels oddly timely. As he notes: \u201cThere is an awful lot of mysticism about. More than ever in recent years.\u201d He doesn\u2019t speculate, but the widespread interest may point to that metaphysical restlessness that wells up during periods of acute cultural change \u2013 the return of the transcendental to a reality system no longer adequate for the times. Among the more widely read and prolific of modern academic philosophers, Critchley has written books on topics as disparate as football, suicide and David Bowie. In a faintly defensive account of his interest in his current subject, he rightly points out that mysticism has been relegated and ignored within modern philosophy (with rare exceptions such as Nietzsche and Georges Bataille), whose rationalist bias favours critique, sobriety, laboriousness and rigour. He sees his book as a bid to push back against this epochal neglect. An Englishman with a love of TS Eliot\u2019s poetic evocations of the country and for medieval (mostly female) mystics \u2013 he knows his Hadewijch of Antwerp from his Mechthild of Magdeburg \u2013 Critchley sticks to the religious tradition he knows best: his study should more accurately be titled On Christian Mysticism. The riches of the Hindu-Buddhist east don\u2019t get a look-in. Nor do Sufism, Kabbalah, or the philosophically subversive field of psychedelic experience \u2013 a post-monotheist bleeding edge of mystical consciousness. This narrowness notwithstanding, On Mysticism is a welcome, sometimes fascinating, perhaps inevitably frustrating book. Most of the historical figures we think of as mystics did not see themselves as such: they were, rather, religious people whose devotion inspired experiences that revitalised, and in some cases, threatened the religious traditions they lived within (Marguerite Porete, a French Catholic mystic, was burned as a heretic in 1310). Critchley delves into the often fragmentary writings of various medieval Christian mystics \u2013 with particular focus on Julian of Norwich, notable for being the first female autobiographer in English, and Meister Eckhart, a cryptic German mystical theologian (and another heretic) who would influence Martin Heidegger. Critchley prefers to talk of mystical consciousness rather than mystical experience. More than a matter of intense sensations, mysticism comprises \u201cnew ways of knowing and loving\u201d that flower from elevated awareness. Following the theologian Bernard McGinn, he sees \u201cmysticism as a practice that melds together experience and theology\u2026 Mystical experience without theology is blind. Mystical theology without experience is empty.\u201d Critchley highlights the interplay between reading and contemplation: studying texts can trigger ecstatic transport, which in turn leads to a deeper \u201clayering of concepts with experience\u201d. He runs us through various distinctions within the tradition of mystical theology. Cue plenty of exotic words: kenosis, kataphasis, soteriology, theosis. He\u2019s particularly drawn towards apophatic or negative theology: the tradition of moving ever closer to the divine by naming everything that God is not. Post-Enlightenment philosophy, Critchley notes, writes off mysticism as delusion, charlatanism or nonsense \u2013 and yet I wondered if he remains too much within academic orthodoxy to effectively spike his discipline with the mystical virus. (His admission to stridently professing a less than robust atheism to fit in with \u201cfiercely secular\u201d colleagues doesn\u2019t allay such suspicions.) Mystical vision naturally calls for conceptualisation \u2013 Julian of Norwich had a single divine experience lasting a few hours, then spent decades working out what it meant \u2013 but Critchley\u2019s compulsive parsing of mystical utterance into ever finer abstractions comes between his fascination with mysticism and the blood-red heart of the thing itself. His vivisections of Julian of Norwich and Meister Eckhart work against the mystics\u2019 promise of immediacy, transfiguration, \u201cexperience in its most intense form\u201d. We\u2019re left wistfully eyeing mystical transport in a shop window: \u201cI admire mystics who luxuriate in God and I luxuriate in their luxuriations.\u201d But perhaps this is splitting hairs on my part, towards a writer professionally committed to hair-splitting: it\u2019s a stretch to expect a book about mysticism to deliver mystical experience. Critchley is largely content to serve as a tour guide to other people\u2019s transports (he unambitiously claims he will consider his project a success if it persuades a few readers to check out the biblical Song of Songs). The best sections depart from the medievals to broaden our sense of who and what the mystical tradition includes: a bravura series of chapters traces a line from Julian of Norwich through the wondrous American nature writer Annie Dillard \u2013 in particular her short, crazily metaphysical book Holy the Firm, which features a little girl named Julie Norwich \u2013 to the incantatory mysteries of Eliot\u2019s late, great Four Quartets\u2026 which, looping back around in a mystical spiral, quotes Julian (\u201cAnd all shall be well and/All manner of thing shall be well\u201d). While Eliot was himself no mystic (bar \u201ca few flashes during my life\u201d), Critchley\u2019s reading paints the quartets as a kind of poetic mysticism \u2013 a work that approaches, and ultimately vanishes into, that which is beyond poetry. Reflecting on how the monastically incubated mysticism of old has diffused through modernity as aesthetic experience, Critchley veers close to banality in suggesting that by listening to the music we love (and Critchley not very illuminatingly tells us about music he loves), we\u2019re enjoying mystical consciousness. Better to think of music \u2013 or drugs \u2013 as the gateway drug that turns people on to mystical promise in the first place. Critchley can undermine his own credibility \u2013 I like Jarvis Cocker as much as the next guy, but calling him \u201ca poet of the first magnitude\u201d does no one any favours. Fortunately, though, he\u2019s sceptical enough to see that the channelling of religious intensity into aesthetic bliss entails a domestication of the ecstatic. A corollary might be that we think of mystical yearning under capitalism as a kind of underground resistance \u2013 the glimpses that break through, despite everything, of a mysterious splendour invulnerable to economic, technological or political encroachment.

Adelaide council rejects Aukus nuclear waste plan Plans to dispose of low-level nuclear waste from Aukus submarines at an Adelaide naval facility have been unanimously opposed by the local council for the area, which says it was not consulted. The Osborne naval shipyard, 25km north of the Adelaide CBD, and HMAS Stirling at Garden Island, 50km south of Perth in Western Australia, have both been designated as \u201cradioactive waste management facilities\u201d for nuclear waste from Aukus submarines under the Australian naval nuclear power safety bill, which passed parliament in October. Last week, the City of Port Adelaide Enfield \u2013 responsible for the area surrounding the Osborne shipyard \u2013 voted to unanimously oppose the storage and disposal of radioactive waste at the site.

McAllister defends Labor\u2019s electoral reform proposals Jenny McAllister is also asked about the government\u2019s proposed electoral reform, and comments from the independent MP Kate Chaney earlier today, denouncing the policy. Responding to criticism the reform would allow big money to be splashed at the major parties, she says: The core of this legislation is about making sure people get to parliament because they have got support from their communities, not because they are sponsored by one wealthy individual \u2026 People will still be able to donate, to be able to support the candidates. But by placing caps, we stop the capacity for a handful of people, that very limited number of Australians who have access to very large amounts of money, to disproportionately influence the outcome of elections. And I think it is a proposition most Australians understand is pretty sensible. Dutton \u2018needs to explain\u2019 international student backflip, McAllister says The emergency management minister, Jenny McAllister, is also up on Afternoon Briefing this afternoon, where she weighs in on the international student cap \u2013 is there a way through this? She says the \u201clast two weeks in every sitting year are always a big couple of weeks for the Senate\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s a time when we see people\u2019s true colours\u201d. It seems that [Peter] Dutton is planning to vote against this very sensible policy reform \u2026 Why Mr Dutton will not support this when he has publicly said he will in the past is really something he needs to explain. Asked if there is a plan B, McAllister \u2013 like Aly \u2013 says this is a matter for the minister, Jason Clare. We think this is good legislation \u2026 If the Liberals don\u2019t support this, they really need to explain why that is \u2026 It seems like a reckless approach to an important policy question, done without any explanation. Anne Aly, the minister for youth and early childhood education, has been speaking with the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing about the Coalition\u2019s backflip over plans to cap international student numbers from next year. She describes the move as \u201cpretty extraordinary and baffling\u201d because \u201cPeter Dutton has thus far thrown his support behind\u201d the caps. I think there is still negotiating to do \u2026 The minister for education, Jason Clare, will have to talk to the crossbench and the Coalition. But I don\u2019t know what the intent behind this is. I don\u2019t think anyone knows what the intent behind this is because Peter Dutton has always maintained that they would support a cap on international students, now they have done a complete turnaround. Aly says that \u201cif the legislation does not get through, there is still a ministerial order in place\u201d. This is ministerial direction 107, a regulation enacted in December 2023 that gave priority to students applying to low-risk institutions. Coalition makes last-minute backflip on plans to cap international student numbers from next year The Albanese government has been left red-faced after the Coalition made a last-minute backflip over plans to cap international student numbers from next year. The education minister, Jason Clare, has accused Peter Dutton of being a \u201cfraud\u201d on tough immigration policies after the opposition sided with the Greens and independents on changes to limit new enrolments from overseas students to 270,000 in 2025. In a statement, the shadow education minister, Sarah Henderson, joined by the Liberals\u2019 home affairs spokesperson, James Paterson, and immigration spokesperson, Dan Tehan, said Labor\u2019s proposal was a \u201cpiecemeal approach\u201d and did \u201cnothing to address the structural issues it has created\u201d. You can read the full story with all the details below: Malinauskas to jet to Cop29 for Adelaide host city bid South Australia will attempt to bolster its bid to host a future UN climate summit when the premier, Peter Malinauskas, heads to Cop29 to promote Adelaide as a potential site. As AAP reports, Malinauskas will travel to Azerbaijan this week to attend the conference, where he will press SA\u2019s case for Adelaide to be the host city for the 2026 summit if the Albanese government\u2019s bid to host Cop31 is successful. He says: This conference will attract tens of thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars into our state. It will provide an incredible opportunity to market our state to investors across the world, enhance global visibility and deliver long-lasting benefits for our tourism and events industry. If Australia is chosen to host Cop31 it would be one of the most significant diplomatic events in the nation\u2019s history, bringing an unprecedented number of leaders from governments, business and the global community to Adelaide. It would also be the largest event ever held in SA, with more than 30,000 people attending the conference, delivering an estimated economic benefit of more than $500m. Work on the bid started in 2022. Blocking Newcastle climate protest is \u2018disgraceful overreach\u2019, Bandt says The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, has criticised the NSW government\u2019s decision to block public access to a Newcastle port ahead of a climate protest as a \u201cdisgraceful overreach\u201d. The state government has imposed an exclusion zone around Newcastle harbour ahead of a Rising Tide protest to call for an end to new coal and gas approvals and for the introduction of a 78% tax on coal and gas exports. The plan was to paddle out from this Friday to Sunday, staying close to shore and not entering the shipping channel. In a post to X this afternoon, Bandt said he attended last year\u2019s Rising Tide protest and it was \u201cfamily-friendly, safe, and one of the most inspiring displays of community power I\u2019ve ever been a part of\u201d. The NSW government\u2019s multiple attempts to shut it down this year are a disgraceful overreach. And they will not work. We\u2019ve just had our hottest year in human history. Again. Yet Labor has approved 28 coal [and] gas projects since coming into office. People wouldn\u2019t have to take to the water if the government did their job. Peaceful protest is justified. Fuelling climate collapse is not. And with that, question time has now wrapped up. Chalmers hits back at opposition\u2019s \u2018dishonest comparisons\u2019 on inflation The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, has asked the acting PM, Richard Marles, if the \u201creckless spending of this weak and incompetent Albanese Labor government [is] fuelling homegrown inflation?\u201d He argues that interest rates have fallen in the US, New Zealand, Europe and Canada, but not in Australia. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, responds to the question, and says if Australia measured core inflation the same way the US and the UK do, \u201cours would be lower\u201d. If he wants to talk about movements and inflation around the world, he should be honest enough to say that inflation just went up in the US and it went up in Europe as well. And if he wants to make international comparisons about inflation, he should fess up and say that our services inflation is lower than the UK and the US as well. Chalmers says the government isn\u2019t under any illusion about the pressures that people are under, but \u201cany objective observer\u201d would see progress \u201csince the hole that they were left in under those opposite when we came to office\u201d. I say to the shadow treasurer \u2026 try to ask me a question \u2026 because every time he jumps up here and asks these dishonest international comparisons, he leaves out the key facts \u2026 Greens leader urges 2035 emissions target \u2018that builds on the UK\u2019s ambition\u2019 The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, is asking about the government\u2019s 2035 emissions target \u2013 amid the UK\u2019s 2035 commitment to cut emissions by 81% on 1990 levels. Bandt asks why won\u2019t Australia\u2019s government announce a new climate target that builds on the UK\u2019s ambition, instead of opening new coal and gas projects? The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, responds and says the question \u201ccontains a force of inaccuracy right at the centre of it, and that\u2019s the number of coal and gas projects he\u2019s pointed to\u201d. We have approved 10 times more renewable energy projects than coal projects \u2026 but on to the specific question about the 2035 target. Can I reassure the member that the Climate Change Act that he voted for included within it a limitation that says that the Climate Change Authority must provide advice \u2026 We\u2019re awaiting advice from the Climate Change Authority that\u2019s considering the important issue of setting a 2035 target, which will be both ambitious and achievable. Will Snapchat be included in social media ban for under-16s? The shadow communications minister, David Coleman, has asked the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, about whether or not Snapchat will be included in the government\u2019s social media ban for under-16s. Rowland responds that under the legislation, \u201cthere will be a broader definition of social media to what is currently in the Online Safety Act\u201d. Defining an age-restricted service is a new legal term, and \u2026 we have been clear the definition is likely to capture what is commonly understood to be social media. The framework will be clearly set out for the public in the parliament when it is introduced. Coalition \u2018completely stuck in the past\u2019 on renewables, acting PM says The shadow climate minister, Ted O\u2019Brien, is back up, and asks the acting PM, Richard Marles, about a report which criticises the government\u2019s renewables plan and claims it ignores key costs. The independent MP Zali Steggall attempts to make a point of order on the accuracy of the report, but after a bit of back-and-forth, Marles responds to the question: Short answer is I don\u2019t accept the assertions which have been contained in the question that has been asked by the honourable member \u2026 The series of questions, Mr Speaker, that we have had from those opposite, makes it plain for every Australian to see that this is a party that is opposed to renewable energy and what is absolutely clear is that this is a party still wrestling with itself and the Nationals about whether climate change is actually happening at all. This is a party stubbornly and permanently refusing to move with where the planet needs us to go. He takes aim at the opposition\u2019s nuclear policy, and says \u201cthose opposite can be completely stuck in the past when it comes to these policies\u201d. If you\u2019re wondering why the independent MP Monique Ryan is answering a question during question time (when, famously, it\u2019s usually a time for government ministers to answer questions), then you clearly aren\u2019t au fait with the standing orders of the parliament. Fellow crossbencher Helen Haines said she was asking a question of Ryan, the member for Kooyong, under standing order 99 of the House of Representatives. That doesn\u2019t happen very often, with questions typically posed to ministers or the prime minister. If you haven\u2019t got your copy of the standing orders sitting handy by your side while reading the live blog and watching parliament (shocking, if you don\u2019t!) then standing order 99 states: During Question Time, a Member may ask a question orally of another Member who is not a Minister (or Parliamentary Secretary). Questions must relate to a bill, motion, or other business of the House or of a committee, for which the Member asked is responsible. Haines asked Ryan about her bill on lobbying, improving government honesty and trust. That allowed the question to stand, and Ryan to get a full few minutes to explain her bill (on national television), including pressuring the government to allow her bill to be brought on for debate and vote. It doesn\u2019t happen often, but with the crossbench increasingly agitated about several government decisions \u2013 not the least of which being the electoral reforms \u2013 we might see some more of these moves in the last days of this parliamentary term. Plibersek accuses Coalition of \u2018delay and disfunction\u2019 on coal-fired power The deputy leader of the opposition, Sussan Ley, has asked Richard Marles to confirm if state Labor governments have entered into contracts to extend the lives of coal-fired power stations into the 2040s? Tony Burke, the leader of the house, questions how \u201cany minister here is meant to be responsible for contracts that states undertake that have no connection with the commonwealth?\u201d The speaker asks Ley to reword the question, and she asks Marles: Given the government\u2019s responsibility for the national energy market, which includes coordination with state Labor governments, can the acting prime minister confirm that state Labor governments have entered into contracts to extend the lives of coal-fired power stations into the 2040s? The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, responds to the question and says \u201cthe biggest reason to keep coal and gas power generation going longer is the expensive 20-year delay proposed by those opposite, which is the fantasy of nuclear energy policy that they have\u201d. The reason that state governments are contemplating having to extend the life of any of these stations is because those opposite were warned that 24 coal-fired power stations were closing, and what did they do in response to those 24 coal-fired power stations that gave their closure dates to those opposite? They did nothing. They did absolutely nothing in response to the delays that were telegraphed while they were in government \u2026 We are having to double down to move more quickly because of the delay and dysfunction that we inherited, and that\u2019s the same position the states and territories are in. Independent MP calls for debate on lobbying bill The Indi MP, Helen Haines, has asked the Kooyong MP, Monique Ryan, why debate on her lobbying bill should be resumed urgently. Ryan introduced a private member\u2019s bill last year to \u201cclean up politics\u201d by enforcing stronger rules and more transparency around lobbying, as well as making ministers\u2019 diaries publicly available. Responding to the question, Ryan says the bill was not debated when placed before the house last year: With the help of Senator David Pocock, we secured a Senate inquiry into the bill. That received 346 submissions but received only a single day of hearings. That inquiry concluded that the government should improve its regulation of lobbyist activities in this house. The government has not done so and it has not indicated any plan to do so. In this 47th parliamentary [term], the member for Indi and many of my crossbench colleagues have placed integrity measures before this house. Bills to stop pork barrelling, bills for truth in political advertising, bills for meaningful and equitable reform of electoral donations \u2013 we\u2019ve seen what goes on with that \u2013 bills that stop jobs for mates, bills that protect whistleblowers. Not one of the bills has been debated by this government. Ryan says she wants the government to \u201ctell my electorate and the electorates of the other members of the crossbench, when and how they\u2019re going to take action to restore Australia\u2019s faith in the integrity, transparency and honesty of its government\u201d. More than 10 independent senators and MPs band together to admonish electoral reforms Breaking out of question time for a moment, and crossbenchers are enraged at proposed electoral reforms that will impose spending and donation caps they say will benefit the major parties. More than 10 independent senators and MPs banded together in parliament before question time to admonish the major parties for teaming up to \u201crig\u201d the electoral system in their favour. The independent member for Curtin, Kate Chaney, says there is particular concern for the $800,000 spending cap in each electorate if advertising includes the candidate\u2019s name. Chaney says incumbency advantages and the increase in public funding from $3.35 a vote to $5 are also hot issues. The teal MPs have been unsuccessful in deferring the bills to a committee after Labor used their voting numbers against them. The Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie, who joined her lower house colleagues, delivered an impassioned speech in her usual colourful way. They have their snouts in the trough so far that they\u2019re blowing that many bubbles I could jump in and have a bubble bath \u2026 there is nothing I can think of worse, towards the end of the year, the end of sittings, and all the major parties are worried about is money and trying to maintain their seats. Here\u2019s a good idea, why don\u2019t you go and do what we all have to do go \u2013 earn [votes], instead of buying. Renewables v nuclear: Labor and Coalition clash on cost of energy Ted O\u2019Brien, the shadow climate minister, has asked Richard Marles why the government is \u201chiding the true cost from Australian families who will have to foot the bill for its renewable energies-only plan\u201d. Marles says he does not accept the assertions in the body of the question, and \u201cwhat is clear in the world today, whether those opposite understand it or not, is that the cheapest form of electricity is renewable electricity\u201d. And that\u2019s why we have got the renewable sector going again. Something which those opposite did their absolute best to crush \u2026 but we have got investment in renewables going again, such that there is a 25% increase in the grid. Now, we are doing that in terms of putting downward pressure on energy prices. Marles continues that the government is committed to \u201chaving our nation climb the technological ladder and face modernity by having a transition to net zero emissions by 2050 and having more renewables in the grid in a way which is completely firmed\u201d. That\u2019s what we are doing, because that is what every responsible economy on the planet is doing, and the only other option that you hear in the developed world, literally, is from those opposite, which is talking about establishing a nuclear \u2026 industry from scratch at an enormous cost to Australian households, and that is a policy that we will not pursue. For more context on this, you can have a read of this analysis by Peter Hannam: Richard Marles has taken a dixer on cost-of-living measures, and the speaker has just sent the Liberal MP for La Trobe, Jason Wood, out under 94a. Milton Dick urged MPs to \u201cshow some restraint today and to show each other more respect\u201d. Question time has begun, with Richard Marles standing in as acting prime minister until Wednesday as he attends the G20 leaders summit in Brisbane. Liberal MP Melissa McIntosh asks Marles if the government can guarantee Australians will not face an increase in energy prices as a result of its \u201csecret target\u201d, with the government not releasing its 2025 emissions reduction target until next year. Marles responds: Since coming to government, what this government has understood is that the cheapest form of energy today is renewable energy \u2026 He says that through increasing renewables in the grid the government is \u201cputting both downward pressure on energy prices but also meeting our emissions reduction target by 2030.\u201d He argues the Coalition\u2019s plan to introduce nuclear energy into the grid \u201cwill absolutely increase energy prices, because \u2026 what those opposite are doing is doubling down on the single most expensive form of electricity which exists in the world today.\u201d A reminder that Question Time is due to begin in the House of Representatives in about ten minutes \u2013 we\u2019ll bring you all the key moments right here on the blog. Kennedy on Kevin Rudd: \u2018incredibly energetic\u2019 and \u2018capable of dealing with whatever comes\u2019 Caroline Kennedy was also asked about Kevin Rudd\u2019s role as ambassador to the US, after he deleted his previous tweets about Donald Trump. Asked if he can he remain in that position, if she has any \u201cadvice\u201d for how he should conduct himself, she responded: Ambassador Rudd has the full confidence of the prime minister, and whoever is the ambassador is a choice of the government that sends them to Washington DC. I will say that I have seen Ambassador Rudd, he\u2019s incredibly energetic. He\u2019s forged really strong relationships in Congress on both sides of the aisle. So I\u2019m sure he is fully capable \u2013 I have seen Australians argue, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s capable of dealing with whatever comes. Responding to a question from our own Paul Karp, Caroline Kennedy says that \u201cin terms of the tariffs, we just have to wait and see what really happens.\u201d Who knows, but also as the prime minister suggested, you know, Australia can come out ahead either way. So this is all speculation and we\u2019re picking out sort of the most inflammatory and frightening things that were said. Kennedy says \u2018Australia has a very privileged position\u2019 Another reporter asked Caroline Kennedy about her use of the work \u201cbest friends\u201d to describe the US-Australia relationship, and questioned whether \u201cbest friends [should] really have to fight for tariff exemptions and submarine deals made under the office of the president?\u201d She says the FTA is about to be 20 years\u2019 old and \u201cthere\u2019s unprecedented two-way investment, record levels of trade happening every single year.\u201d The US invests here, you\u2019re one of the biggest sources of foreign investment. I think that, as I said, Australia qualifies under the Defence Reduction Act and has a status that no other country except for the UK has. I think out of all of those things, they do contribute to us being best friends. I don\u2019t think Australia actually was subject to the tariffs under the previous Trump administration. So there\u2019s a lot of things that get said in the campaign, but I think that if you look at the positive side of it, which may not be the feeling sometimes, you\u2019ll see that I think Australia has a very privileged position and that\u2019s because we work so closely together across the board. Caroline Kennedy says cousin RFK Jr\u2019s views on vaccines \u2018dangerous\u2019 Sticking with RFK, Caroline Kennedy was also asked about his views on vaccines and fluoride in water \u2013 and if she is concerned about such views being mainstreamed? She jokes that she is \u201cnot supposed to comment on politics and now you\u2019re asking me to also comment on family\u201d but says: Yes, I think Kennedy\u2019s views on vaccines is dangerous \u2026 but I don\u2019t think that most Americans share them \u2026 I would say that our family is united in terms of our support for the public health sector and infrastructure and has the greatest admiration for the medical profession in our country, and Bobby Kennedy has got a different set of views. Kennedy on Tulsi Gabbard nomination: \u2018let\u2019s just calm down and see what happens\u2019 Earlier at the NPC, a reporter asked Caroline Kennedy about Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s nomination by Donald Trump for director of national intelligence \u2013 with accusations she poses a threat to US national intelligence through vocal support of Russia. Asked why Australia should trust the US with sensitive intelligence going forward, Kennedy responded there are \u201cthousands\u201d of people who work in their intelligence agencies and work closely with Australia. Let\u2019s see what happens with president Trump\u2019s appointments \u2026 There\u2019s another one, he\u2019s nominated for health and human services. So let\u2019s just calm down and see what happens. But obviously that would be of great concern and we\u2019ll see who [actually gets the role]. Kennedy\u2019s cousin, Robert F Kennedy, is to be nominated for health secretary by incoming president Trump. Coalition says Labor\u2019s foreign-students bill not good enough The federal Coalition has confirmed it plans to oppose the government\u2019s legislation to cap foreign students at universities, accusing Labor of having opened \u201cthe floodgates\u201d on immigration. In a statement, the shadow ministers for education, home affairs and immigration - Sarah Henderson, James Paterson and Dan Tehan \u2013 described the legislation as \u201cchaotic and confused\u201d. Labor\u2019s piecemeal approach does nothing to address the structural issues it has created. The proposed cap in the education bill before parliament will not even touch the sides of this problem. They said it would \u201ccompound this crisis of the government\u2019s making\u201d. The Greens are also opposing the bill. The education minister Jason Clare has accused the opposition of hypocrisy for campaigning in favour of lower immigration but refusing to support the government\u2019s bill. Just circling back to an earlier moment in Caroline Kennedy\u2019s speech. She spoke to those who \u201cstill question whether Aukus is necessary\u201d, and said: To those who still question whether Aukus is necessary, ask the Philippines and Vietnam what it\u2019s like to have your ships rammed and sunk by Chinese \u2018coast guard\u2019 vessels, or Japan what happens when missiles land close to shore, or the Pacific nations when your most precious resource is destroyed by an industrial-scale fishing armada. The long delays and higher prices that result from the Middle East conflict are insignificant compared to the global consequences of a conflict in this region. Aukus is an existential investment in Australia\u2019s sovereignty and way of life, and you can\u2019t put a price on that. Kennedy says Trump return doesn\u2019t mean US won\u2019t be present in Asia-Pacific The US ambassador is asked whether the re-election of Trump heralds the return of \u201cAmerica first isolationism\u201d, and whether Australia should prepare for life without the US. I don\u2019t think it shows that America is not going to be present in this region at all. President Biden has made our alliances [US\u2019s with Japan and Australia] his top foreign policy priority. The United States has made commitments over many decades, they are not going to change and our national interests are not going to change. Overall, the United States needs our friends and allies. Caroline Kennedy says US \u2018has no more trusted or capable ally\u2019 than Australia Kennedy, at the press club, reckons the thing that surprises her most about Australia is that it doesn\u2019t realise how important it is. She says no country is more important to the US. Australia may be a middle power but to the United States, you are number one. We have no more trusted or capable ally. In every dimension of our relationship, I have seen the United States rely on Australian leadership and experience. Australia is no longer America\u2019s \u201cdeputy sheriff\u201d or whatever the critics like to say. Australia is our teacher and our partner as the United States navigates a multipolar world. That is true in our bilateral relationship, it is true in multilateral fora, and it is vital in this region. She says she will most miss the inspiring women she has worked with. Following on from our post earlier, the shadow ministers for education, home affairs and immigration - Sarah Henderson, James Paterson and Dan Tehan - have described the government\u2019s immigration legislation as \u201cchaotic and confused\u201d. \u201cLabor\u2019s piecemeal approach does nothing to address the structural issues it has created. The proposed cap in the education bill before parliament will not even touch the sides of this problem,\u201d the trio said in a statement. They said it would \u201ccompound this crisis of the government\u2019s making\u201d. The Greens are also opposing the bill. Independent Kate Chaney pans electoral reform \u2018stitch-up\u2019 The independent member for Curtin, Kate Chaney, has expressed her disappointment at the major party \u201cstitch-up\u201d on electoral reform. As mentioned, the long-awaited changes would add donation and spending caps to candidates and parties, lower reporting thresholds for donations and real-time reporting. But independent MPs and senators are concerned the changes will make it harder for political candidates outside the major parties. Chaney, who has advocated for an overhaul of the federal electoral system, said the major parties\u2019 share of the vote had diminished in recent elections and if they wanted to \u201crebuild trust and regain their vote share, this is not the way to do it\u201d. \u201cIf this bill is so complicated that it has taken an entire term of parliament to draft, surely it needs to be considered by a committee and the public [be] given an opportunity to comment.\u201d She added: The transparency reform is too little, too late, and is a huge disappointment and an insult to the electorate who demanded better. The major parties are relying on the increasing disengagement of the public. The complexity of this bill, the crowded media space, and rushing it through to get away with the only path they\u2019ve got left to arrest the trend of declining support for the sclerotic leadership the two parties offer to the public. Chaney wrote this piece on the changes last week: Education minister Jason Clare has accused the opposition of hypocrisy in its campaign to lower immigration, as reports emerge that it plans to vote against the government\u2019s proposed cap on foreign students at Australian universities. Clare said opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s credibility would be destroyed if the Coalition votes against the bill, which is before parliament on Monday. He said: You can\u2019t talk tough on immigration and then go soft on this. You can\u2019t talk tough on immigration and then vote against putting a limit on the number of people that come to this country every year. Over the course of the next few months, Peter Dutton is going to wander around the country pretending to be a tough guy on immigration, and every time he says, the word \u2018immigration\u2019, remember this week. Clare urged Nationals MPs, who he suggested favoured passing the bill, to put pressure on their Liberal colleagues to support it. Dutton\u2019s office was contacted for comment. Caroline Kennedy is speaking from the National Press Club in Canberra. She is coming to the end of her term, so says she will be speaking about her time in Australia, but says she is also expecting questions about the recent US election. \u201cWe can save the best til last,\u201d she quips. Pacific expresses interest in Cook Islands\u2019 super deal Cook Islanders will be able to easily transfer their superannuation funds under an agreement with Australia, AAP reports, as more Pacific island nations express interest in the reform. The change allows people who move to the Cook Islands permanently to transfer their nest egg to the Cook Islands National Superannuation Fund. The agreement between the two nations covers a gap in an Australia-New Zealand scheme that allows people to transfer retirement savings to their home country. Cook Islanders were in a unique situation where they were also New Zealand citizens with the scheme not flowing through to them, financial services minister Stephen Jones told reporters earlier. In effect, what that deal does is equalised the arrangements between New Zealand and Cook Islands. Australia was working through similar requests from other Pacific island leaders, he said. Tens of thousands of Pacific islanders are working in Australia under a labour scheme and receive the same benefits as their Australian counterparts, including superannuation. They can withdraw their superannuation funds when leaving Australia permanently but there are access concerns around navigating paperwork, fees and internet access once back in their home countries with little support. It\u2019s also taxed at 35 or 45%, or 65% for working holiday maker visa holders. Fatima Payman says Lidia Thorpe \u2018was refused the right to respond\u2019 to censure motion Australia\u2019s Voice senator Fatima Payman is the latest to weigh in on the censure motion against Lidia Thorpe, writing on X: \u201cSo much for democracy\u201d. When Senator Thorpe informed the government that her Qantas flight is running late, they ignored her and proceeded with the censure motion against her. She was refused the right to respond. [Thorpe] has that right as much as any other senator. The federal government has introduced its electoral changes in parliament, promising the changes would ensure federal elections are not \u201cunfairly skewed by big money\u201d. The proposal will add donation and spending caps for candidates and parties and would commence from mid-2026 if it gains the support of parliament. Independent MPs have been critical of the reforms, accusing the major parties of trying to \u201crig\u201d electoral laws in their favour. In the lower house on Monday, the assistant minister to the prime minister, Pat Gorman, said the bills would \u201cremove the influence of big money in politics, ensuring that our electoral system remains a system we can all trust\u201d. Trust that election results are not unfairly skewed by big money. Trust that elections are a contest of ideas, not bank balances. Trust that we know who is funding election campaigns with more information about campaign financing provided before voting day. The independent member for Curtin, Kate Chaney, has pushed to send the bill to a committee, which would delay its passage until the electoral matters committee delivers its report next year. But without the numbers in the House of Representatives, it\u2019s unlikely the teal MPs will be able to force that. Read more about the changes from my colleague, Paul Karp, below: Save the Children Australia responds to government\u2019s social media ban for under 16s Save the Children Australia has released a statement in response to the government\u2019s social media ban for children under 16, set to be introduced before the federal parliament this fortnight. It said that while the desire to keep young people safe online is welcome, the focus should be on \u201cmechanisms to hold social media corporations to account, and responses that would address root causes of harm.\u201d CEO Mat Tinkler said the government needs to continue \u201cdemanding accountability from social media giants to make their platforms safer by design\u201d \u2013 including through the recently announced plan to introduce a digital duty of care bill. As a parent, I hold the same concerns that many parents do about the potential harms that our children face online. I welcome the government\u2019s efforts to try and keep our kids safer online and drive accountability home to social media giants. But I also trust the experts and the views of children and young people themselves when they are raising serious concerns about this proposed solution. Kylea Tink accuses Labor of \u2018political cowardice\u2019 for not announcing 2035 emissions target until next year Teal MP Kylea Tink has issued a statement on news Labor will detail its 2035 emission reduction targets \u201csometime next year\u201d \u2013 raising the prospect the government might delay committing to a next-phase target until after the federal election. In a statement, Tink accused the government is \u201ccreating a climate of secrecy when it comes to Australia\u2019s climate policies\u201d. Love them or hate them, at least Australians know where we stand with the opposition \u2013 with Peter Dutton confirming he is committed to taking us backwards if elected. The Coalition have said they will walk back Australia\u2019s 2030 target and have not outlined any policies beyond that which will get us remotely close to achieving net zero by 2050. While the Coalition will delay the rollout of renewables by chasing a nuclear fantasy which will hurt our economy, jack up electricity bills and extend the life of fossil fuels \u2013 at least they have been transparent with their climate denial. Tink said it was \u201cpolitical cowardice from Labor\u201d to wait until next year to announce its targets, adding that Labor \u201ccannot hide behind Donald Trump when it comes to climate action\u201d. Australian voters deserve to know if they are voting for a party in 2025 that is condemning future generations to a dangerous and less prosperous future. Watch: Lidia Thorpe censure motion In case you missed it, here\u2019s the moment the Senate passed a censure motion against Lidia Thorpe: Victorian education minister says VCE bungle a \u2018publishing error that should never have occurred\u2019 Circling back to Victorian education minister Ben Carroll, who was speaking to reporters about the VCE defacto cheat sheet bungle. He said the publishing error was caused by hidden text included on published cover sheets. In some instances, only one to two multiple choice questions were published. In no cases were the full examinations published once the VCAA became aware of the issues. Carroll said the assurances he was given from the VCAA CEO that the exams had been rewritten following the discovery were \u201cfalse\u201d: I was given reassurances that the exams hade been re written that has now proven to be inaccurate. While some exams were rewritten to a satisfactory standard, others were not, and this has been a publishing error that should never have occurred in the first place. Woolworths questioned over claims sector is \u2018incredibly competitive\u2019 Woolworths executives have been questioned over their description of the supermarket sector as \u201cincredibly competitive\u201d after conceding only Coles offers an equivalent range. In its submission to the competition regulator\u2019s inquiry into the sector, Woolworths nominated 44 outlets, from Spudshed to 7-Eleven and The Cheesecake Shop, in a list it described as a \u201cbroad set of competitors\u201d. Woolworths chief executive Amanda Bardwell told the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry today she accepted that only Coles offered an equivalent range for consumers doing a \u201cone stop shop\u201d. \u201cIf you want to define it that way, then yes, you could say that,\u201d Bardwell said under questioning from ACCC\u2019s counsel, Naomi Sharp SC. Bardwell said many consumers shopped around for individual items that could be purchased from multiple retailers: Sometimes they might be looking for a full weekly shop, but more often than not we\u2019re seeing customers actually shop multiple times a week and so they\u2019re looking for convenience when it comes to that. The government ordered the competition regulator to examine grocery prices and competition in the sector, with a final report due by February. Coles and Woolworths control about two-thirds of the sector, which is far more concentrated than equivalent overseas markets. Thorpe compares censure motion to M\u0101ori debate in New Zealand While speaking to reporters, Lidia Thorpe has ripped up a piece of paper \u2013 in reference to the protest in New Zealand parliament last week led by Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke. Thorpe told reporters: If we look at what our brothers and sisters did in New Zealand, [the] censure motion is like that to me. I don\u2019t give a damn about [the] censure motion. In fact, I\u2019m going to use it for kindling later on in the week. Lidia Thorpe clarified that it was minister Don Farrell who texted her about the impending Senate motion, not Murray Watt as she earlier said. Two old white blokes in a suit, they all look the same to me after a while here. Thorpe says it was 'good to see Canavan \u2018backing me up\u2019 Lidia Thorpe was asked about comments from Nationals senator Matt Canavan, who said she and Ralph Babet should have been in the chamber for the censure motions against them. She said she and Canavan \u201chave a lot in common actually\u201d. It was good to see him backing me up, and on process, because that\u2019s my argument \u2026 where\u2019s the due diligence, where\u2019s the process for me to be in that chamber and to be able to respond? So they didn\u2019t afford me that opportunity when my staff worked very, very hard, to have that motion postponed till later in the day until I arrived. So the government didn\u2019t want me in the chamber, they probably held up the plane, who knows! So here I am. I\u2019m here, and I\u2019ll make a noise all day if I have to. Lidia Thorpe said her flight was delayed this morning and she wasn\u2019t able to get to the Senate chamber by 10am for the censure motion. I had minister [Murray] Watt texting me while I\u2019m on the plane. I said \u2018I\u2019m on a plane delayed. Can you wait? I want to be there.\u2019 And so I was denied my right to be in that chamber whilst everybody else voted to shut me down. I\u2019m not one to be shut down. As I say, you got three and a half years left of me and I\u2019ll continue to decolonise and in a way that is best for this country, best for everybody in this country. Lidia Thorpe says she will never \u2018kneel to the coloniser\u2019 Lidia Thorpe labelled those who supported the censure motion as \u201chypocrites\u201d and said it is \u201ca diversion away from the real issues in this country\u201d. Everybody who swears allegiance here, every soldier, every Navy person, they\u2019re not swearing allegiance to the people of this country. Wake up, people. They are swearing allegiance to some random colonising king of England. Where are our true allegiances? My allegiances are with the grassroots working class people of this country, and First Peoples. So until we decolonise and understand that colonial rule harms our communities, harms our people, then you\u2019re just kneeling to the coloniser, that\u2019s not what I will do ever. Lidia Thorpe defiant after Senate censure: \u2018I\u2019ll do it again\u2019 Independent senator Lidia Thorpe is addressing the media in Canberra, following the successful censure motion against her in the Senate this morning. She labelled it an attempt to shut her down and said she has only been given more media exposure: If the colonising king were to come to my country again, our country, then I\u2019ll do it again. And I will keep doing it. I will resist colonisation in this country. I swear my allegiance to the real sovereigns of these lands, First Peoples are the real sovereigns. You don\u2019t have some random king rock up and say he\u2019s sovereign. Would you like that happening to your home? Would you like someone to knock on your door and say, \u2018Time for you to leave, I\u2019m taking over and these are the new rules of your house\u2019? Well, not on my watch. Victorian education minister apologises for \u2018inadvertent publication of examination material\u2019 An independent advisory panel will oversee this process, and will be chaired by former chief executive of VCAA, John Firth. Ben Carroll is now speaking and has begun by apologising to students: First and foremost, I apologise to all students impacted by the inadvertent publication of examination material on the exam cover sheets. The VCE exams are stressful enough, the last thing that year 12 students need is additional stress and uncertainty from the administration of examinations. Today we\u2019re taking action and taking the right steps to ensure that no student is disadvantaged in the marking of the 2024 examinations. Whilst I\u2019m extremely disappointed and angry by what has occurred, we are taking the right steps to ensure all students are treated fairly and no student is disadvantaged in the marking of this year\u2019s examinations. Carroll says Kylie White\u2019s resignation was effective immediately. She has been replaced by Marcia Devlin, the chief executive of the Victorian Academy of Teaching and Leadership, in an acting capacity. Carroll is also explaining the grade-check process: This process will identify any student who has performed significantly above the expected levels. If so, results will be investigated to identify if they had advantage from the early publication of VCE examination questions. Following this process, if questions have been identified that any student has an unfair advantage, adjusting will be made to student marks. Grade-check process to be used to review all VCE exams where defacto cheat sheets uploaded online Circling back to the Victorian education minister, Ben Carroll, who said in a statement an existing anomalous grade-check process will be used to review all the VCE exams where defacto cheat sheets were uploaded online. He said the process will: Review student marks in the affected exams and identify any anomalies in how students have responded to the affected questions. Analyse if any discrepancies are identified and if so, further analysis will be undertaken. This could include comparing how students performed compared to other students, and how students performed on other examinations. Adjust student marks if any questions are identified as providing anyone with an unfair advantage. This could mean invalidating questions and awarding all students who sat this exam a full mark if necessary. Ralph Babet has texted us a statement responding to his censure in the Senate this morning, over a tweet which was strongly condemned by both Labor and the Coalition. The radical authoritarian left has taken offence for a tweet which did not mention, target or reference any individual. Maybe they should have considered censuring my colleagues who regularly and consistently direct abuse and vitriol towards other people and our great nation. The selective outrage and hypocrisy from the far left is far more offensive to the general public than my simple tweet. Babet \u2013 who told us he is still at Melbourne airport waiting for a flight to Canberra \u2013 also criticised the government\u2019s proposed misinformation bill. If an elected member of the Australian Senate is not free to say what he or she thinks, then none of us are free to say what we think. The truth is, their target isn\u2019t me; it\u2019s you. I\u2019m just in their way. Long live free speech. Head of VCAA resigns over VCE bungle The head of the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA) has resigned over the VCE defacto cheat sheet bungle. Victorian education minister, Ben Carroll, is about to hold a press conference announcing the resignation of Kylie White after practice exams uploaded online by VCAA for several exams reportedly contained almost identical questions to those used in their final exams. While they were pulled in late October, they were widely shared by students online. The saga \u2013 just a year after several errors were found in the 2022 and 2023 maths exams \u2013 led Carroll order to a \u201croot and branch\u201d review into VCAA. Elephant in the Apec room What a time to be talking trade and hobnobbing with world leaders! President-elect Donald Trump will have been the elephant in the room. As far as I can tell prime minister Anthony Albanese has not been asked about that time he said Trump scared the shit out of him. The censure motion against Ralph Babet has also passed in the Senate. It passed \u201con the voices\u201d, without a formal vote being called for. As mentioned earlier, opposition Senate leader Simon Birmingham called Babet\u2019s tweets \u201crepugnant\u201d, saying it was fine to push back against political correctness but that senators shouldn\u2019t offend or demean their fellow Australians in the process. Nationals senator Matt Canavan called Babet a \u201cmate\u201d but said the words were \u201creprehensible\u201d; although he repeated his earlier concerns that neither Babet or Lidia Thorpe were in the chamber to address the censure motions against them, to defend themselves. Canavan said he understood both Babet and Thorpe\u2019s travel to Canberra had been affected by flight delays. Canavan said he would vote against both motions due to that issue. Wong said the censure motions were about \u201cprotecting the institution\u201d of the Senate. She said the majority of the senators were in the chamber. We have to make a decision about expressing a view about what behaviours are appropriate in the expressions of those views, and in relation to senator Babet, whether in 2024 the sorts of views he\u2019s articulated \u2013 which are frankly hateful, about our fellow Australians \u2013 are something we should be condoning as a Senate. I for one, do not. The Babet motion passed. The Senate has resumed its regular business. We\u2019re expecting a press conference from Thorpe around 11.30am today for her response. Bandt urges Labor to come to negotiating table on key legislation stalled in Senate Earlier, Greens leader Adam Bandt spoke to reporters about the final sitting fortnight \u2013 with a number of bills stalled in the Senate amid negotiations. He argued that Labor needs to \u201cdecide whether they want to bulldoze and block or whether they want to negotiate\u201d. The Greens have put on the table some good faith offers to pass legislation this fortnight. We have seen throughout this parliament so far, that when the government decides to be cooperative, then we can pass legislation with good and important amendments \u2026 But as we get closer to the election, Labor\u2019s playing politics and refusing to negotiate, and is instead bulldozing bills through the Senate. We hope that good sense prevails, that Labor listens to these good faith offers that the Greens have put forward on a range of legislation, and that we do this year what we\u2019ve done in previous years, and have some good amendments and pass legislation through the Senate. But at the moment, Labor is blocking and bulldozing and they need to stop it, and they need to come to the negotiating table. The Greens are prepared to negotiate in good faith. Matt Canavan says censure process a \u2018kangaroo court\u2019 Nationals senator Matt Canavan said he would have supported this morning\u2019s censure motions, however the government \u201cbrought them on without the senators here to hear the arguments against them or defend themselves\u201d. He described the process as a \u201cKangaroo Court\u201d in a post to X, and added: We have unfortunately cheapened what should be one of the more serious actions the Senate can take. The Senate has passed the censure motion against Lidia Thorpe. The motion received 46 yes and 12 no votes, passing easily. The Senate is now moving on to the proposed censure against Ralph Babet, for a tweet he made last week. Opposition Senate leader Simon Birmingham called his words \u201crepugnant, abhorrent, and have no place in proper, orderly, civil conduct and debate in 2024\u201d. Thorpe appears to have entered the chamber shortly after her motion was agreed on, interrupting loudly from the back of the Senate. It\u2019s hard to make her words out from the video stream I\u2019m watching, but we can hear words like \u201cprocess\u201d. \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t I allowed to be here?\u201d Thorpe can be heard calling out. Shame on you all ... I\u2019ll do it again! Senate president Sue Lines is trying to call for order in the Senate. Babet\u2019s flight to Canberra cancelled Speaking of Ralph Babet, the senator posted on X earlier this morning that his Qantas flight to Canberra had been cancelled today. He previously said he would be voting no to the mis- and disinformation bill, and voting no to the banning of social media for under 16s. Babet has not confirmed whether he has secured alternative transport. Senate voting on Thorpe\u2019s censure motion The Senate is dealing with Lidia Thorpe\u2019s censure motion first, then Ralph Babet\u2019s afterward. Coalition Senate leader Simon Birmingham says the opposition will support the censure motion against Thorpe \u2013 meaning it\u2019ll almost surely pass. Birmingham called her behaviour \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and says politicians should use their platform with \u201crespect and care\u201d, and also notes that bizarre period where Thorpe later appeared to claim she had intentionally misspoken her oath of office - and then recanted that claim. Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi calls the Thorpe censure motion a \u201cdisgrace\u201d, claiming the former Greens member is being punished \u201cfor telling the truth about invasion, dispossession and the genocide of First Nations people in this country\u201d. Next up is Nationals senator Matt Canavan. He has raised issues about Thorpe and Babet both apparently not being in the Senate yet, claiming the censure motions were brought on with little notice. Canavan calls it a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d, critical that neither Babet or Thorpe will likely be able to speak on their own censure motion \u2013 Penny Wong responds that the opposition Senate leader, Birmingham, backed the timing already. The Senate is voting on the censure motion now. Independent MP Andrew Wilkie will today introduce a bill that could force gambling companies to return stolen funds used to finance bets. Wilkie, who has moved similar legislation in the past without support from major parties, was developed in consultation with a former financial advisor who stole millions of dollars from his clients to service his gambling addiction. Gavin Fineff has pleaded guilty to multiple fraud-related offences. But the bookmakers who accepted his bets have kept the money. Wilkie said his bill would ensure gambling companies pay closer attention to how bets are financed: My bill puts a positive obligation on gambling companies to report to Austrac if they have reason to suspect a person is paying for a gambling service with money they\u2019ve obtained illegally. It also enables the federal court to order a gambling company to return stolen funds, where it\u2019s found that a bettor has paid for a gambling service using funds they obtained illegally. Details of the censure motions for Thorpe and Babet The censure motions are online. The proposed censure motion for Lidia Thorpe says the Senate \u201cexpresses its profound disapproval of Senator Thorpe\u2019s disrespectful and disruptive protest at the Parliamentary Reception for their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla on 21 October 2024 given that the senator has many other avenues to express her views\u201d \u2013 calling her behaviour \u201cdisruptive and disrespectful conduct\u201d. It goes further, to say that \u2013 if passed \u2013 the Senate \u201cdoes not regard it as appropriate for Senator Thorpe to represent the Senate as a member of any delegation during the life of this parliament\u201d. The proposed censure motion for Ralph Babet calls on him to be censured \u201cfor his inflammatory use of hate speech, designed to drive division for his own political benefit\u201d and that the Senate \u201cassures all Australians that no matter their race, religion, gender, sex, or sexuality that they are valued, welcome members of our society\u201d. The censure motion \u201ccalls on all senators to engage in debates and commentary respectfully, and to refrain from inflammatory and divisive comments, both inside and outside the chamber, at all times\u201d. Wong calls for \u2018standards of respect\u2019 in parliament Back in the senate, Penny Wong is continuing on the censure motions: These are actions which seek to incite outrage and grievance, actually to boost their own profiles, and this is part of a trend that we do see internationally, but quite frankly we don\u2019t need here in Australia. We should deny them the attention they seek, but in doing so, we should also signal the upholding of standards. Standards of respect, when we have dignitaries visit our parliament; in Senator [Lidia] Thorpe\u2019s case, no less than the head of state. And standards of respect when it comes to talking about our fellow Australians, and in Senator [Ralph] Babet\u2019s case, deliberate abuse of some of our fellow Australians. Thorpe issues statement on censure motion: \u2018I will not be silent\u2019 Independent senator Lidia Thorpe issued a statement just prior to the censure motion, stating she \u201cin no way\u201d regrets protesting King Charles and \u201cwould do it again\u201d. It is time this country reckons with its history, and puts a stop to the continuing Genocide on First Peoples \u2026 Across the world, we see a fierce, united front declaring that the era of silence is over, truth-telling is here and the power of First People\u2019s solidarity will not be denied. Thorpe said she was \u201csilenced and removed\u201d from the king\u2019s parliamentary reception \u201cfor pointing out that the Crown stole from First Peoples, and now the major parties want to try again to silence me and shut me down\u201d. I will not be silent. The truth is, this colony is built on stolen land, stolen wealth and stolen lives. The British Crown committed heinous crimes against the First Peoples of this country. These crimes include war crimes, crimes against humanity and failure to prevent genocide. The Crown must be held accountable for these crimes. And this government must be held accountable for ongoing injustice against First Peoples in this country. Since my protest to the king in parliament, there have been three First Nations people die in custody that we know about. In just the last 11 months there have been 22 black deaths in custody. Happening right now in the Senate, Labor\u2019s Senate leader Penny Wong says the government and opposition are seeking to censure Lidia Thorpe and Ralph Babet with separate censure motions. Thorpe\u2019s censure relates to her interruption of King Charles\u2019 reception at Parliament House on his visit \u2013 and Babet\u2019s appears to be related to a controversial tweet he made after Donald Trump\u2019s election win. Wong claims the government \u201cmoves these motions reluctantly\u201d and accuses both Thorpe and Babet of seeking to \u201cget attention\u201d with what she called \u201cactions and stunts designed to create storms on social media\u201d. \u2018Covid is still with us\u2019: Greens senator to miss parliament due to coronavirus infection Greens senator Penny Allman-Payne says she will not attend parliament today as she has been diagnosed with Covid-19. She wrote in a post to X: Thankfully I\u2019m on the mend but this is a good reminder that Covid is still with us. Please take care. It\u2019s maddening to be stuck in bed but hopefully I\u2019ll be able to join my colleagues later in the week! Hanson-Young on environment, housing legislation before the Senate Let\u2019s just circle back to an interview that Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young gave to ABC TV earlier this morning. As we\u2019ve already mentioned, the Greens have signalled they were prepared to pass the Nature Positive legislation in return for an Australia-wide ban on native-forest logging alone \u2013 the second concession on stalled legislation from the party in less than a week. Asked if there was much dissension within the party before coming to this decision, Hanson-Young said \u201cwe had a very robust and good conversation about this\u201d. We know that the science is clear. The ice caps are melting and the climate crisis is getting worse, every time a new coal and gas mine is approved by the government, it makes the climate crisis worse, we do have to stop that. But the prime minister won\u2019t budge. And you can lead a horse to water but you can\u2019t make it drink. So we will have that fight at the election. Asked if this was a reflection of the Greens being too obstructionist in the Senate, the senator said what the party is trying to do is \u201cmake sure we can deliver real positive change for people\u201d. Every negotiation takes movement from both sides, a bit of give and take. We have put on the table a new offer for the government over their housing legislation [and] we don\u2019t think the housing bills before the Senate go anywhere near dealing with the crisis \u2026 But we do want to see if we can get some more support for those who are really struggling at the crisis point. Dutton says he\u2019s confident he can \u2018work very effectively\u2019 with Trump Peter Dutton was asked about new polling suggesting 47% of voters believe he is better placed to engage and negotiate with Donald Trump. Dutton argued he was \u201cbetter equipped to lead our country\u201d because \u201cwe have a weak prime minister at the moment who doesn\u2019t know the difference between right and wrong when it comes to national security, his instincts are all wrong when it comes to the economy\u201d. I think in terms of our most important ally, the United States, and president Trump, I can work very effectively with him and with other world leaders, and I think I\u2019ve demonstrated that in senior portfolios over a long period of time. \u2018We want to see the books before we commit to any tax cuts,\u2019 Dutton says Peter Dutton was asked if the Coalition is walking away from committing to the stage-three tax cuts. He responded that \u201cwe want to see the books before we commit to any tax cuts\u201d. The government is spending money again. Back to the Reserve Bank governor\u2019s constant warnings. Interest rates are higher in this country because the Albanese government continues to splash money out, and that fuels inflation, which keeps interest rates higher \u2026 So let\u2019s see how much money is in the bank, and let\u2019s see what room we have to move, but we\u2019re going to act responsibly, as we\u2019ve always done. Dutton accuses PM of being \u2018obsessed with the Greens\u2019 and forgetting about people \u2018in the suburbs\u2019 The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has been speaking to Sky News about a range of issues this morning. Asked if there has there been any recalibration in his thinking since Trump\u2019s victory in the US, Dutton argued that prime minister Anthony Albanese has made a \u201cdeliberate political decision to go with the elites, and he\u2019s left behind people who are struggling in the suburbs\u201d. Asked who these \u201celites\u201d are, Dutton replied: If you look at the prime minister\u2019s own lens on the world, he looks at it through the granular lens. He looks at it through, what can he do to stop people leaving the Labor party to vote for the Greens? He\u2019s obsessed with the Greens, and he\u2019s forgotten about people who are working out in the suburbs. The Labor party now has been dragged so far to the left, not just on the woke stuff, but the economy and the national security decisions. He\u2019s made our country less safe because they\u2019ve let criminals out of immigration detention. Has made our country less safe because they bought in 3,000 Gazans without security checks, bringing people from a zone which is controlled by a terrorist organisation. And people are saying, well, hang on, what are you doing for us? New 24-hour crisis response to online extremism The government has established a 24-hour Indo-Pacific crisis response capability to monitor terrorist and violent extremist online content and alert both digital platforms and government agencies in Australia and around the region. Beginning today, the new monitoring function is designed to enhance the existing system for urgently referring extremist content to the eSafety Commissioner. The home affairs minister Tony Burke said the government was partnering with the Online Harms Foundation, which is part of the global Tech Against Terrorism organisation formed to tackle terrorist activity on the internet. This collaboration will help us strengthen our national security measures and protect our digital space from the spread of terrorist content, wherever in the world it originates. Adam Morton is in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku for the Cop29 summit. Australia has been accused of \u201cnot acting in good faith\u201d by promoting its climate credentials while still approving coal and gas projects: Farmers will receive around $1bn by the year 2030 for hosting large-scale wind and solar farm on their land, according to a new report from the Clean Energy Council and Farmers for Climate Action. The Billions in the Bush report suggests regional communities will receive another $200m through community benefits funds and local clean-energy schemes. Those payments to landholders are estimated to rise to between $7.7bn and $9.7bn by 2050, and regional community contributions to $2.2bn. The Farmers for Climate Action CEO, Natalie Collard, said renewable energy projects were making farmland more productive. Australia\u2019s clean, green farmers have been hosting clean energy since the windmill was invented. Hosting modern clean energy helps our farmers continue their traditions. Farmers that choose to host renewables are farming sheep and cattle around wind turbines and under solar panels, creating a double income from the land. The two organisations are seeking to improve understanding of the economic opportunities for landholders in the clean energy transition, in the face of pushback in some regional areas against solar and wind projects in particular. Chalmers says Coalition have no \u2018costed or credible or coherent policies\u2019 Taking a final question from reporters, Jim Chalmers took aim at the Coalition and accused them of having no \u201ccosted or credible or coherent policies\u201d yet: They\u2019ve opposed our cost-of-living help, they won\u2019t tell us what they\u2019ll do with the tax cuts, they won\u2019t tell us what their $315bn in cuts means for Medicare or housing. We know that Peter Dutton went after Medicare last time [the Coalition was in] office, we know that they hate wage increases, so ordinary Australians will go backwards in tangible ways if we hand the keys to Peter Dutton and Angus Taylor, who won\u2019t come clean on their plans, whether it\u2019s on income tax or in other areas as well. Back at Jim Chalmers\u2019 press conference, the treasurer was asked about the Greens\u2019 offer to pass the Nature Positive legislation, plus housing reforms that are held up in the Senate. He told reporters the government \u201cengage[s] respectfully with the Greens\u201d and \u201cwe know that we don\u2019t have a majority in the Senate, and so we play the cards we\u2019re dealt\u201d. We try and do the best we can to pass as much of our agenda as we can. I say to the Greens, if you want more investment in housing \u2026 stop teaming up with the Liberals and Nationals to prevent more investment in housing, or to prevent more rental properties being built, or prevent it being easier for people to get a job in the housing market. Now, we\u2019ve got a broad, ambitious housing agenda \u2026 We want to get cracking on this investment in housing. We engage respectfully, we negotiate where we have to. People should expect to see more of that over the course of the next couple of weeks. The corporate regulator is suing National Australia Bank over allegations it did not respond to hundreds of hardship requests within the required timeframe. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in a statement that NAB and one of its subsidiaries \u201cfailed 345 of its customers at their most vulnerable\u201d when it didn\u2019t respond to hardship applications within the 21-day legal timeframe. The Asic chair, Joe Longo, said: These customers included people who were domestic violence victims, battling serious medical conditions, dealing with business closures or job loss. NAB\u2019s failures likely compounded the already challenging situation for these people. Lenders are legally obliged to promptly consider all hardship requests, although they are not required to agree to any proposed loan changes. The alleged breaches occurred between 2018 and 2023, and the regulator is asking the federal court to impose various penalties including fines. Longo said there had been an increased number of customers seeking relief from their lenders amid rising cost of living pressures. NAB said in a statement today that it disclosed the issue to Asic in late 2023. NAB group executive, Sharon Cook, said: We\u2019re sorry that this happened when a number of our customers were in difficult situations and needed us to be there for them. We are focused on ensuring these customers receive the support they need. Chalmers responds to PBO analysis about bracket creep A reporter asked about analysis from the parliamentary budget office showing bracket creep is going to cost taxpayers about half a trillion dollars over the next decade, starting from next year. Does that mean the government has to start thinking about another round of tax cuts? Jim Chalmers responded: That PBO analysis does assume, I think bravely, that there\u2019ll be no changes to the income tax system for a decade, and often the floor and that sort of analysis is that assumption. It would be a rare period in Australian taxation for there not to be income tax changes over a full decade, and we should not likely dismiss the ways that we are returning bracket creep with the changes we made and the tax cuts that we are providing. We cut two rates and lifted two thresholds, and that recognises there\u2019s more than one way to return bracket creep in our tax system, and we\u2019re doing it in a way which is best for participation and make sure that every taxpayer gets a tax cut, not just some taxpayers getting a tax cut, and they\u2019re flowing into the economy right now. Chalmers added that \u201cpeople shouldn\u2019t expect us to take a big new income tax cut policy to the 2025 election\u201d. Jim Chalmers is now taking questions from reporters. Asked if he is concerned about an increase in pricing for businesses with the cash mandate, he said: We\u2019re prepared to be reasonable about it and we don\u2019t anticipate the sorts of pricing behaviour that you\u2019re concerned about. Chalmers outlines agenda for the fortnight ahead Speaking about the parliamentary fortnight ahead, Jim Chalmers outlined his agenda as follows: I\u2019ll be hoping to introduce new legislation, for example, the production tax credits as part of our Future Made in Australia agenda next week. [I will make] a ministerial statement to the parliament on Wednesday about the progress that Australians have made together when it comes to getting inflation down and wages up, and rolling out cost-of-living help at the same time as we reform our economy for the future. We\u2019ll have more to say, Stephen [Jones] and I, later in the week around superannuation and the retirement phase. We\u2019ll be hosting another investor round table on Friday, focused on housing and the energy transformation, and other matters. And next Friday, Friday week, I\u2019ll be hosting the state and territory treasurers here for the Council of Federal Financial Relations as well. Jim Chalmers addressing media from Canberra The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is speaking to the media from Canberra about the government\u2019s announcement that from 2026, businesses selling essential goods and services will be forced to accept cash unless granted a special exemption. As we\u2019ve already flagged in the blog, you can read all the details on this below: Chalmers touted the policy and said: [Cash] can be an important backup. It gives people peace of mind and a sense of security, and that\u2019s why we are making it an ongoing feature of our economy \u2026 We\u2019ve seen these sorts of mandates work in other parts of the world, we\u2019ve seen them work in parts of the United States, and we\u2019re confident that we can make it work here as well. The assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, is also speaking to reporters, and said this would be good \u201cfor the 1.5m Australians who use cash for about 80% of their transactions, but it\u2019s good for the rest of us as well\u201d. Jane Hume was also asked to weigh in on news that treasury is looking to impose a levy on banks to ensure they keep regional branches opened. She questioned that if this was such a priority for the government, \u201cwhy is it they have waited until the last two weeks of sitting for this year, potentially the last two weeks of sitting for this Parliament, to take action?\u201d Asked if she supported the move in principle, Hume said: We want to see that people in regional and rural areas are serviced appropriately and can be banked appropriately. Whether the appropriate way to go about that is by imposing more costs on banks that will be passed on to consumers, that remains to be seen. Jane Hume on government\u2019s proposal regarding cash payments for essentials The shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, was on ABC TV earlier, asked about a government mandate from 2026 that businesses selling essential goods and services will be forced to accept cash unless granted a special exemption. She argued that this was the government \u201cthrashing about for an economic narrative after 2.5 years, what they have come up with is a plan for a plan\u201d. It isn\u2019t coming into effect until 2026, not dissimilar to the surcharge announcement of a couple of weeks ago. This does seem to be a consultation about a consultation before we make a decision. Asked if the opposition supported this in principle, she said \u201call we have seen is a media release, we haven\u2019t seen anything else\u201d. \u2026 of course people should be able to use cash, but inflicting more regulation, more red tape, on businesses, large and small, does have implications for the cost of goods and services and Australians are already paying too higher a price for decisions this government is making. We\u2019ll wait and see what it is that they actually want to investigate because at the moment, it\u2019s just a consultation. It\u2019s just another plan for a plan. It\u2019s not action. Hanson-Young says parliament shouldn\u2019t \u2018bow down and kiss the feet of Trump\u2019 Turning to the United States, Sarah Hanson-Young said that in the wake of the Trump election Australia has \u201cgot to reassess [and] rethink our relationship with the US\u201d. The majority of Australians didn\u2019t want the Trump election result, but we\u2019ve got it, and we have to take this time now to think about what that means. And I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not going to be lectured to \u2013 and I don\u2019t think the parliament or the government or Kevin Rudd for that matter, should be lectured to by the rightwing nut jobs who think that we should bow down and kiss the feet of Donald Trump. I mean, they\u2019re selling out Australia if they\u2019re asking us to bow down like that. This is a time for Australia to be clear-eyed, assess our independence, assess our needs and the interests of Australia, and just, you know, bowing down and kissing the feet of somebody who, frankly, is continuing to push more lies and disinformation about healthcare, about women, about climate change \u2013 Australians are horrified at what might come next. Hanson-Young said Australia wants a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the US, but \u201cit\u2019s got to be an honest relationship\u201d. Asked what she thinks the chance of the Nature Positive legislation passing is, Sarah Hanson-Young said: The government has continued to say to us that their big problem with negotiating with us and the rest of the crossbench was the concerns around the climate trigger. Well, we\u2019ve heard that. We\u2019ve put that aside. It\u2019s now time to talk turkey. And asked if Greens supporters may have been expecting the party to stand firm on the climate trigger, Hanson-Young said: \u201cI think people can see that the prime minister was unwilling to budge, that he came to the demands of Gina Rinehart of the mining lobby.\u201d Greens hope dropping of climate trigger demand seen as \u2018offer of goodwill\u2019 Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young is speaking with ABC RN after the party signalled they were prepared to pass the Nature Positive legislation in return for an Australia-wide ban on native-forest logging alone. She said the Greens would put aside its push for a climate trigger until the federal election: We have decided to put aside our demand for the climate trigger. We\u2019ll have that fight at the election, and we\u2019ll push the next government to deliver it, because it has to happen. It\u2019s just bonkers not to have the climate impacts assessed before [getting the] ticket approved by the environment minister. But I\u2019m trying to get something done here, and we know that deforestation and the logging of native forests is at a point in Australia now that it just can\u2019t continue. Hanson-Young said she had a scheduled meeting with the minister today and \u201cI hope that this is seen as an offer of goodwill.\u201d Minns on pay negotiations with NSW nurses: \u2018We\u2019ve hit a brick wall\u2019 Chris Minns was also asked about the ongoing midwives and nurses strikes in NSW, who are asked for an immediate 15% wage increase, citing higher rates of pay in other states and the cost-of-living crisis. Nurses and midwives said they were \u201cinfuriated\u201d after NSW police won a pay deal that will see wages rise by up to 40%, while they have been negotiating with the state government since April \u2013 who are not budging on a blanket 10.5% pay rise offered over three years for all NSW public-sector workers. Speaking this morning, Minns said \u201cof course nurses deserve a pay rise\u201d: We\u2019ve tried to do that in NSW. We\u2019ve got rid of the wages cap that was in place, we\u2019ve put in an independent industrial court. So if we don\u2019t agree with the union, we\u2019ll let the judge make a determination on our behalf and we\u2019ll stick by it. And crucially, we\u2019ve introduced ratios for public hospitals, which the union\u2019s been fighting for 20 years. The premier said he wishes he could \u201cannounce a breakthrough this morning\u201d. We\u2019ve genuinely been trying around the negotiating table for six months, but we\u2019ve hit a brick wall. And the reason we\u2019ve hit a brick wall is we can\u2019t afford 16% in one year, which is what the nurses are asking for. We\u2019ve tried to work out a different arrangement with them to get to get more in the pockets of nurses and midwives in the state. We haven\u2019t got there yet, and I\u2019m sorry about that, but we\u2019re at a cul de sac here. NSW premier touts social media ban for under 16s The NSW premier, Chris Minns, was just speaking with the Today Show about the social media ban for children under 16 set to be introduced before the federal parliament this fortnight. Minns said \u201cit\u2019s very difficult for parents to say no to kids\u201d and the government knows some children would breach the proposed ban \u2013 \u201cjust as we know some kids smoke before they turn 18\u201d \u2013 but \u201cthe vast majority don\u2019t because the rules are in place\u201d. And what this does by putting in the law, by putting in the regulation, it means that parents can say, at the very least to their kids, \u2018I\u2019m not going to breach the protections that are in place to get you on social media because it\u2019s against the law.\u2019 I\u2019m a parent of teenage kids. We\u2019ve had similar conversations with our own children. We need to strengthen parents hands in relation to this. Give them an opportunity to let their children lead a normal life. My strong suspicion is in 20 years\u2019 time, we\u2019ll look back and say, \u2018Why did we allow this to happen?\u2019 And the truth is, it crept up on us. This technological change has been so quick, so rapid. It\u2019s been difficult for governments and parents to get in front of it. But we need to start now. Chalmers to the Greens: pass our bills The treasurer Jim Chalmers has upped the pressure on the Greens to pass a raft of stalled government legislation as parliament begins its final sitting fortnight for the year. Speaking to ABC RN, Chalmers called on the Greens \u201cto do the right and responsible thing\u201d and pass the government\u2019s bills, as the party offered a compromise on both the stalled Help to Buy legislation and on its proposed Nature Positive laws. We take nothing for granted. We know there\u2019s a lot of negotiating going on right now. Our interest here and our objective here is to pass as much legislation as we can in the next couple of weeks. We know that we\u2019re running out of parliamentary runway in this year at least and so we want to get as much done as we can. Chalmers confirmed he will address the parliament on Wednesday about the state of the economy and is working towards bringing down a budget in March. Continuing from our last post, the CEO of Homelessness Australia, Kate Colvin, said demand for homelessness services had \u201cerupted\u201d and \u201cthe system is so under-resourced that people who are homeless can\u2019t get in front of a worker who can help them\u201d. With more than three million Australians now at risk of homelessness, services are forced to close their doors, leave calls unanswered, and turn away families with children on one in five days. People who could have afforded private rentals just a few years ago are now resorting to couch surfing, sleeping in cars or pitching a tent. Homelessness services simply don\u2019t have the staff to stretch to everyone needing help, and have to go on \u2018by-pass\u2019, and triage support to people each day. This means opportunities to help people avoid homelessness are missed; and people go longer without support or miss out entirely, making the path out of homelessness longer, more brutal and less likely to succeed. Three million Australians are at risk of homelessness, a 63% increase since 2016, a new report from Homelessness NSW and Impact Economics has revealed. By looking at household data including income, support and rental stress, the report found in 2022 there were 3.04m Australians now at risk of homelessness, an increase on the 1.87m reported in 2016. A key driver was the 17.9% increase in people experiencing rental stress since the 2021 Census, the report said. In 2022-23 over 250,000 Australians received assistance from a Specialist Homelessness Service, but many more are now being turned away, including families and young people. Surveying 23 frontline services, the report found: 1 in every five days the frontline services could not assist a family with children because they were so stretched. Individuals without children were turned away 1 in every 2 days. Unaccompanied young people and children without accommodation were turned away on 1 in 9 days. Chalmers accuses Dutton of \u2018reckless arrogance\u2019 not suited to managing foreign policy The treasurer Jim Chalmers has been making the rounds on breakfast programs this morning, also speaking with the Today Show. He was also asked about polling showing 47% of voters believe Peter Dutton is better placed to engage and negotiate with Donald Trump. Asked how he plans on shifting that opinion, Chalmers said: \u201cI focus on numbers in the economy, not not numbers in the opinion polls.\u201d I think more broadly, the government under Anthony Albanese has got an excellent record of managing relationships around the world, making genuine progress, whether it\u2019s with China, whether it\u2019s with American friends or others. Asked if Trump and Dutton are more aligned, Chalmers said Albanese had \u201calready had a very productive conversation\u201d with Trump: I think when it comes to Peter Dutton, I think he has a kind of a reckless arrogance which doesn\u2019t lend itself to foreign policy and maintaining and managing some of these complex relationships. I think he would be a risk to our economy, and that\u2019s because that reckless arrogance, which has been a defining feature of his time as a politician over a long period of time now \u2026 [it] doesn\u2019t lend itself to managing these relationships, which are so important to us. Politicians weigh in on new polling suggesting voters think Dutton better suited to deal with Trump Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie and Greens senator Nick McKim were up on the Today Show earlier, asked about new polling suggesting 47% of voters believe Peter Dutton is better placed to engage and negotiate with Donald Trump. Lambie said she doesn\u2019t think it matters who deals with Trump, because he is \u201cgoing to make his own decisions and he\u2019s going to do whatever he wants to do\u201d. It won\u2019t matter who\u2019s dealing with him. He\u2019s unstable. McKim added it was \u201cno surprise\u201d because \u201cTrump and Dutton are cut from the same cloth\u201d. Interestingly, in that poll, 55% of Australians say that Trump\u2019s going to make the world a less safe place, which is quite right. And that\u2019s why we should be re-evaluating our lockstep with the US at the moment. Lambie said the number one thing Australians are worried about is the cost of living, and the major parties should \u201cstart zooming in to what they\u2019re going to do to fix that\u201d. And instead of having those sort of conversations, tell us what you\u2019re going to do in the future because the election is around the corner \u2026 The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has confirmed he is considering a levy on banks to help maintain services in regional areas, saying he has not finalised any decision. Chalmers has told ABC TV that it was no secret that regional banking services were under pressure, and he routinely consulted the banks on what could be done about it. This is not an especially new thing that we\u2019d be talking to the banks about some of these sorts of challenges. I think every Australian in the bush understands that there has been a withdrawal of services. As the government \u2013 which governs for the whole country \u2013 we\u2019re very focused on that, and so we engage in these consultations and conversations from time to time. We don\u2019t have a concluded view. We have a respectful relationship with the major financial institutions. We like to work together where we can. We like to consult where we can. He said recent media reports about the possible levy should be \u201cseen in that light\u201d. Holmes \u00e0 Court says \u2018many weaknesses in the bill\u2019 Clive Palmer has flagged a possible high court challenge to the electoral reforms \u2013 does he have a case? Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court argued there are \u201cmany weaknesses in the bill\u201d and said he\u2019s \u201cnot sure which one [Palmer\u2019s] going after.\u201d He instead pointed to a case in Victoria: There\u2019s an interesting case brewing in Victoria where a group of independent candidates at the last state election are challenging the Victorian laws \u2013 which these federal laws seem to be significantly based on. In the Victorian system, the major parties can nominate an entity from which they can receive unlimited funds. So, for example, the $120m Cormack Foundation is allowed to circumvent the donation caps and give as much as it wants to the Liberal party. No such arrangement exists for independents. This group of independents believe that that violates the constitutional right to political communication and are progressing a high court challenge on that. That\u2019s really one to watch, because this new legislation brings in a similar exemption, such that the federal parties will be able to raid their slush funds. But anyone who\u2019s new to politics won\u2019t be able to set up one of these funds. Holmes \u00e0 Court says electoral reform law being \u2018rammed through\u2019 Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court was asked what the electoral reform would mean for future and existing teal candidates running with the assistance of Climate 200. He told ABC RN that the changes would \u201cmake it harder for community campaigns to win\u201d. He said the sole reason for the existence of Climate 200 is to \u201clevel that playing field\u201d because as it stands, it is \u201calready too hard for for independents to run against the party machines\u201d. It\u2019s too early to say how deeply this will affect the model. Between the explanatory memorandum and the legislative mission, there are 410 pages. So people are just starting to get into this, and it\u2019s complex stuff. The definition of a political gift spans four pages, and two of those pages are exceptions. This is a very complex set of changes, the biggest changes to electoral laws since 1984 and it\u2019s being rammed through. Holmes \u00e0 Court argued there was talk there wouldn\u2019t be a Senate inquiry or public consultation on the matter and \u201cthis is just going to get rammed through\u201d. We\u2019re very concerned. We don\u2019t understand the rush these, these reforms don\u2019t come in until 2026 so there is time for those processes. But clearly the major parties aren\u2019t welcoming scrutiny for this bill. Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court on proposed electoral reforms Climate 200 founder, Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court, spoke with ABC RN this morning about the government\u2019s proposed electoral law reform. Paul Karp has an explainer on this, which you can read below: Holmes \u00e0 Court said there are \u201csome good bits\u201d to the bill, including the fact \u201cit\u2019s going to kill Clive Palmer\u2019s business model\u201d, but said it \u201ctilts the playing field even further favour of the major parties\u201d. We\u2019ve already got an electoral system that gives massive advantages to the two major parties. This is going to entrench that [and] put up a wall around incumbency and build a moat, making it hard for outsiders to come in. Climate 200 has calculated the likely increase in the amount the Labor and Liberal parties could claim in public funding at the 2028 election, showing they will reap a combined $140m under the proposed changes. You can read all the details on this here. Holmes \u00e0 Court said this was taxpayer money and \u201cno justification has been given\u201d. Which is quite incredible, quite courageous, really, that the government is proposing this in a cost-of-living crisis. The state of play for this sitting fortnight As we flagged just earlier, there are more than 30 pieces of legislation scheduled to be considered this sitting fortnight \u2013 as well as the electoral reform proposals. For the full details on what\u2019s ahead, Josh Butler has written this fantastic explainer: The Greens will push Labor to legislate their pledge to cut 20% of student debt immediately and not wait until after the next election when the federal government\u2019s student support bill is debated today. The measures, announced in the federal budget, would cut around $3bn in student debt by capping the indexation rate for Hecs and Help loans \u2013 tying them to whichever is lower of the consumer price index (CPI) or wage price index (WPI). The legislation would be retrospective and backdated to 2023, turning back the clock on last year\u2019s indexation rate of 7.1%. In amendments to be put forward by deputy Greens leader and higher education spokesperson, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, the Greens will challenge Labor to legislate further election promises on student debt immediately. The pledges, announced earlier this month, would wipe 20% of current student debts, raise the minimum repayment income to $67,000 and change to a marginal repayment rate. Faruqi told Guardian Australia spiralling student debt must be tackled \u201cimmediately\u201d. My amendments will be a chance for Labor to show they actually care about those struggling under the weight of student debt right now. There is absolutely no reason to wait to legislate these changes until after the next election. It\u2019s frankly irresponsible and cruel to be dangling student debt relief to win votes for an election when Labor is in government and we have the opportunity and the numbers to do this now. Happy Monday, and welcome back to the Australian politics live blog as we enter the final two sitting weeks of this year\u2019s parliament. There are more than 30 pieces of legislation set to be considered this fortnight, which could shape the looming election, just months away. Questions remain as to whether \u2013 or how \u2013 the government will negotiate its bills that remain stalled in the Senate, with the prime minister declaring the government\u2019s position \u201cis final\u201d on key legislation. This includes the Help to Buy, mis- and disinformation, Future Made in Australia, Nature Positive and aged care bills. Overnight, the Greens signalled they were prepared to pass the Nature Positive legislation in return for an Australia-wide ban on native-forest logging alone \u2013 the second concession on stalled legislation from the party in less than a week. Anthony Albanese has just wrapped up the Apec economic forum in Peru, and will now attend the G20 leaders\u2019 summit in Brazil, where the climate crisis is expected to be a focus and the PM may meet with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. We will have Richard Marles as acting prime minister in his place. Meanwhile, the Greens are set to push Labor to legislate their pledge to cut 20% of student debt immediately and not wait until after the next election, when the federal government\u2019s student support bill is debated today. Caitlin Cassidy will bring us those exclusive details in a moment. I\u2019m Emily Wind and I\u2019ll be helming the live blog this fortnight.

      "bodyText": "Plans to dispose of low-level nuclear waste from Aukus submarines at an Adelaide naval facility have been unanimously opposed by the local council for the area, who say they weren\u2019t consulted. The Osborne naval shipyard, 25km north of Adelaide CBD, and HMAS Stirling at Garden Island 50km south of Perth in Western Australia, have both been designated as \u201cradioactive waste management facilities\u201d for nuclear waste from Aukus submarines under the Australian naval nuclear power safety bill, which passed parliament in October. Last week, the City of Port Adelaide Enfield \u2013 responsible for the area surrounding the Osborne shipyard \u2013 voted to unanimously oppose the storage and disposal of radioactive waste at the site. Its mayor, Claire Boan, said council had been briefed on aspects of the Aukus project but it had not received any correspondence or communication about management and disposal of nuclear waste at the site. \u201cWhile the decision-making regarding this is out of the control of the council, we will continue to advocate for our community and lobby for community consultation throughout the process,\u201d she said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Rex Patrick, a former independent senator for South Australia, said the situation highlighted the lack of consultation and transparency regarding Aukus nuclear waste. \u201cAlbanese called for Dutton to disclose where he was going to put his nuclear power reactors, and yet there\u2019s been complete secrecy around the entire process associated with where they\u2019ll put the high-level waste from naval reactors,\u201d he said. No public announcements have been made about the site selection or consultation process for dealing with the high-level nuclear waste associated with the Aukus submarines, which the government agreed Australia would dispose of in March last year. While the type of radioactive waste to be managed at the Osborne shipyard was not detailed in the legislation, the health minister, Mark Butler, the Labor member for Port Adelaide and Hindmarsh, told the ABC that it would be low-level material. A spokesperson for the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said submarine construction, test and commissioning activities planned for Osborne would generate \u201csmall amounts\u201d of low-level waste like gloves, wipes or personal protective equipment that would need to be managed and temporarily stored at the site. \u201cNo intermediate-level or high-level radioactive waste (spent nuclear fuel) will be managed or stored at HMAS Stirling or the Osborne Submarine Construction Yard facilities,\u201d the spokesperson said.

      "body": "<p>Good morning. As anyone who listened to Keir Starmer for more than about three seconds during the election campaign could tell you, Labour\u2019s arrival has led to a clear shift in government messaging on Channel crossings: where once we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/06/forget-stop-the-boats-starmer-wants-to-smash-the-gangs-but-will-it-work\">stopped the boats</a>, now we smash the gangs.</p> <p>The government has put some money behind that one-liner, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/03/keir-starmer-to-create-team-to-tackle-national-security-threat-of-people-smugglers\">a new border security command established</a> with funding of \u00a3150m over two years, and new counter-terrorism powers for use in smuggling cases.

But whether any of this will be effective is another question.</p> <p>Today\u2019s newsletter, with <em><strong>David Suber</strong></em>, a doctoral research fellow on people smuggling and border policing at University College London, is about why the gangs may not be smashable \u2013 and what might work instead.

It\u2019s ultimately saying the same thing. And by seeing the smugglers as the reason that irregular migration happens, it ignores what\u2019s really going on.\u201d</p> <p>Here\u2019s what the policy has meant so far, and whether it can work \u2013 or if new deals aimed at reducing the flow of asylum seekers might be any better.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What does \u2018smash the gangs\u2019 mean in practice?</strong></p> <p>The centrepiece of Labour\u2019s approach is the creation of a new agency, border security command (BSC), which is getting \u00a3150m of funding over the next two years. In a speech to the Interpol conference in Glasgow earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-to-the-interpol-general-assembly-4-november-2024\">Keir Starmer said</a> that the body would support \u201ca new organised immigration crime intelligence unit, hundreds of new investigators and intelligence officers backed by state-of-the-art technology\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the government will apply counter-terrorism powers to people smugglers. That means the BSC will be able to trace suspected traffickers\u2019 movements, drawing on information from the intelligence services, and shut down their bank accounts or cut off internet access. The BSC will also be able to arrest people for making preparations to commit a crime, a power not currently available in these cases.</p> <p>\u201cThe counter-terrorism approach is the real difference,\u201d Suber said. \u201cIt should expand what Border Security Command is able to do. But the fundamental difficulty is that, ultimately, they will generally be working on foreign soil, because that\u2019s where the smugglers are. So good cooperation with European counterparts is the crux of the issue.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever powers may be available domestically to switch off phones and the internet, when the targets are overseas the UK\u2019s role will primarily be \u201cto collect as much intelligence as possible,\u201d he added. \u201cUltimately, enforcement is down to the authorities in those countries.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>How is it working in practice?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s obviously very early days. But officials at the Home Office <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/smash-the-gangs-wont-work-home-office-officials-doubt-labour-small-boats-plan-3369917?srsltid=AfmBOoqzMTOeJbq-OSNaQVIuGeA-6sDEN2DCpPX3248z4M57kBoAqZ4M\">quoted by the i last week</a> sounded sceptical about the new arrangements. One said that so far, BSC is \u201cpartly a \u2018holding pen for people who didn\u2019t have anything to do any more because they got rid of the Rwanda policy\u2019\u201d and added: \u201cNobody quite knows how it\u2019s going to work.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, a joint investigation by the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency and its Dutch and Belgian counterparts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/14/man-suspected-of-supplying-boats-to-human-traffickers-arrested-in-amsterdam\">led to the arrest of a 44-year-old man in Amsterdam</a> on charges of being involved in human trafficking as part of a criminal organisation. Starmer hailed the arrest as a \u201csignificant piece of the jigsaw\u201d, but it is not part of the BSC\u2019s work, and an emphasis on a single arrest seems to suggest how distorting that focus can be.</p> <p>While much remains to be seen, Suber is also sceptical that reorganising the UK\u2019s resources will prove significant. \u201cI struggle to see how it will be that different to Channel threat command, which Boris Johnson and Priti Patel launched in 2020,\u201d he said. (One of that body\u2019s key aims: \u201cDisrupt organised crime groups.\u201d) \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen detailed plans on the staffing yet. Ultimately, it is likely to be set up as an interagency co-ordination group, bringing together Border Force, MI5, the Crown Prosecution Service, and so on.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>How are people-smuggling gangs organised?</strong></p>    <p>In using the term gangs and introducing a new agency with counter-terrorism powers, Starmer appears to be seeking to cast trafficking as part of familiar organised crime networks. Tellingly, the announcement of the new money for the BSC earlier this month also described an additional investment to take on \u201cinternational serious organised crime affecting the UK, including drugs and firearms, fraud, trafficking and exploitation\u201d.</p> <p>But there is little evidence for the idea that people smuggling in western Europe is linked to other forms of organised crime at a high level. Instead, smugglers tend to be loosely affiliated groups without a central command structure, which may make it difficult to disrupt through an approach modelled on drug or firearm enforcement. Members of these groups are easily replaceable if they are caught, and there is no \u201ckingpin\u201d to remove or crucial system to destroy.</p> <p>\u201cIf simply increasing law enforcement resources was the answer, smuggling would have been solved a decade ago,\u201d Suber said. \u201cYou might be able to have an operation which arrests people today, but in three or four months, others will take over. These are not complicated operations to run. They\u2019re opportunistic groups that keep on shifting according to the availability of the people to run them.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, if those people are migrating themselves, and get caught once they\u2019ve made it to the UK, their arrest does little to impact the wider problem. \u201cEven in France, we\u2019ve seen an increase in arrests as the French have stepped up their operations on the north coast, but it hasn\u2019t substantively changed the numbers.\u201d</p> <p>Because the gangs are so loosely affiliated and informal, they adapt very quickly to new threats to their business model, Suber added: \u201cWe saw that with the way that lorry crossings were made unviable, and so people started coming by boat. If you surveil all the beaches in the north of France 24/7, it is likely that they will simply start from further away, and actually increase the risk for those making the journey.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What about \u2018Italian-style migration deals\u2019?</strong></p> <p>That was the new prong of Labour\u2019s approach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/17/starmer-italian-style-migration-deals-crossings\">confirmed by Keir Starmer yesterday</a>: offering financial incentives to authorities in countries or regions where many of those who cross the Channel begin their journeys, in the hope that doing so might help stem the flow at source. (This is \u2018Italian-style\u2019 because Giorgia Meloni\u2019s government struck similar deals with Libya and Tunisia.)</p> <p>But the path from Vietnam or Kurdistan to the UK is much less direct than the cross-Mediterranean route from north Africa to Italy, and there is \u201cvery little evidence that these deals would reduce net migration to the UK,\u201d Suber said. While Meloni\u2019s approach has had some success recently, \u201cItaly has had agreements with Tunisia and Libya since the 1990s \u2013 it is no new recipe.\u201d Such deals can be quickly left redundant by changing dynamics in the partner country, and have tended to \u201conly work on a temporary basis, not long term \u2026 they might reduce numbers [in Italy] for the first half of 2024, but if conditions change in Tunisia and Libya flows will start again.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Are there other approaches that might be more effective?</strong></p> <p>There are alternatives to the whack-a-mole strategy, but they are very far from the mainstream of British political discourse. \u201cNo one country can find a solution to an international issue,\u201d Suber said. \u201cAnd it is very difficult to imagine collective solutions in the current political climate.\u201d</p> <p>If the will was there, though, there are steps that could make a difference. It is a legal requirement for anyone claiming asylum to do so in person in the UK, but no visa exists to allow prospective asylum seekers to legally enter the UK to make their claim. \u201cAt the very least, you could test having reception centres in France, and see what happens to the numbers of people crossing by boat.\u201d That model could be extended to making it possible to apply for asylum directly from countries where there is a high likelihood that asylum claims will be accepted.</p> <p>As things stand, Suber added, that kind of approach appears almost utopian. Also, \u201cGrant the visas!\u201d and \u201cOpen the asylum application processing centres in France!\u201d don\u2019t sound so punchy in a stump speech. But if scepticism about the gang-smashing strategy proves well-founded, where is the next three-word slogan going to come from in a few years\u2019 time?</p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Helen Pidd and Lexy Topping have been best mates since their early days at the Guardian \u2013 but life gets complicated as you get older. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/16/friendship-after-motherhood\">Their dual pieces in Saturday magazine</a> on how kids changed things are a lovely reflection on their <strong>friendship</strong>, and how complicated doesn\u2019t necessarily mean worse. <em><strong>Archie</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Even though <strong>Donald Trump</strong> isn\u2019t going to be president for another two months, his first week of transition has dominated the news cycle.

Environment | At least 24 previously impossible heatwaves have struck communities across the planet, a new assessment has shown, providing stark evidence of how severely human-caused global heating is supercharging extreme weather. Scientific analyses shows that these impossible heatwaves would have had virtually zero chance of happening without the extra heat trapped by fossil fuel emissions. Social care | Excessive profiteering by unscrupulous private companies charging sky-high fees for substandard placements for vulnerable children will be clamped down on as part of a major overhaul of children\u2019s social care in England.

But the fundamental difficulty is that, ultimately, they will generally be working on foreign soil, because that\u2019s where the smugglers are. So good cooperation with European counterparts is the crux of the issue.\u201d Whatever powers may be available domestically to switch off phones and the internet, when the targets are overseas the UK\u2019s role will primarily be \u201cto collect as much intelligence as possible,\u201d he added. \u201cUltimately, enforcement is down to the authorities in those countries.\u201d *** How is it working in practice? It\u2019s obviously very early days. But officials at the Home Office quoted by the i last week sounded sceptical about the new arrangements. One said that so far, BSC is \u201cpartly a \u2018holding pen for people who didn\u2019t have anything to do any more because they got rid of the Rwanda policy\u2019\u201d and added: \u201cNobody quite knows how it\u2019s going to work.\u201d Last week, a joint investigation by the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency and its Dutch and Belgian counterparts led to the arrest of a 44-year-old man in Amsterdam on charges of being involved in human trafficking as part of a criminal organisation. Starmer hailed the arrest as a \u201csignificant piece of the jigsaw\u201d, but it is not part of the BSC\u2019s work, and an emphasis on a single arrest seems to suggest how distorting that focus can be. While much remains to be seen, Suber is also sceptical that reorganising the UK\u2019s resources will prove significant. \u201cI struggle to see how it will be that different to Channel threat command, which Boris Johnson and Priti Patel launched in 2020,\u201d he said. (One of that body\u2019s key aims: \u201cDisrupt organised crime groups.\u201d) \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen detailed plans on the staffing yet. Ultimately, it is likely to be set up as an interagency co-ordination group, bringing together Border Force, MI5, the Crown Prosecution Service, and so on.\u201d *** How are people-smuggling gangs organised? In using the term gangs and introducing a new agency with counter-terrorism powers, Starmer appears to be seeking to cast trafficking as part of familiar organised crime networks. Tellingly, the announcement of the new money for the BSC earlier this month also described an additional investment to take on \u201cinternational serious organised crime affecting the UK, including drugs and firearms, fraud, trafficking and exploitation\u201d. But there is little evidence for the idea that people smuggling in western Europe is linked to other forms of organised crime at a high level. Instead, smugglers tend to be loosely affiliated groups without a central command structure, which may make it difficult to disrupt through an approach modelled on drug or firearm enforcement. Members of these groups are easily replaceable if they are caught, and there is no \u201ckingpin\u201d to remove or crucial system to destroy. \u201cIf simply increasing law enforcement resources was the answer, smuggling would have been solved a decade ago,\u201d Suber said. \u201cYou might be able to have an operation which arrests people today, but in three or four months, others will take over. These are not complicated operations to run. They\u2019re opportunistic groups that keep on shifting according to the availability of the people to run them.\u201d Of course, if those people are migrating themselves, and get caught once they\u2019ve made it to the UK, their arrest does little to impact the wider problem. \u201cEven in France, we\u2019ve seen an increase in arrests as the French have stepped up their operations on the north coast, but it hasn\u2019t substantively changed the numbers.\u201d Because the gangs are so loosely affiliated and informal, they adapt very quickly to new threats to their business model, Suber added: \u201cWe saw that with the way that lorry crossings were made unviable, and so people started coming by boat. If you surveil all the beaches in the north of France 24/7, it is likely that they will simply start from further away, and actually increase the risk for those making the journey.\u201d *** What about \u2018Italian-style migration deals\u2019? That was the new prong of Labour\u2019s approach confirmed by Keir Starmer yesterday: offering financial incentives to authorities in countries or regions where many of those who cross the Channel begin their journeys, in the hope that doing so might help stem the flow at source. (This is \u2018Italian-style\u2019 because Giorgia Meloni\u2019s government struck similar deals with Libya and Tunisia.) But the path from Vietnam or Kurdistan to the UK is much less direct than the cross-Mediterranean route from north Africa to Italy, and there is \u201cvery little evidence that these deals would reduce net migration to the UK,\u201d Suber said. While Meloni\u2019s approach has had some success recently, \u201cItaly has had agreements with Tunisia and Libya since the 1990s \u2013 it is no new recipe.\u201d Such deals can be quickly left redundant by changing dynamics in the partner country, and have tended to \u201conly work on a temporary basis, not long term \u2026 they might reduce numbers [in Italy] for the first half of 2024, but if conditions change in Tunisia and Libya flows will start again.\u201d *** Are there other approaches that might be more effective? There are alternatives to the whack-a-mole strategy, but they are very far from the mainstream of British political discourse. \u201cNo one country can find a solution to an international issue,\u201d Suber said. \u201cAnd it is very difficult to imagine collective solutions in the current political climate.\u201d If the will was there, though, there are steps that could make a difference. It is a legal requirement for anyone claiming asylum to do so in person in the UK, but no visa exists to allow prospective asylum seekers to legally enter the UK to make their claim. \u201cAt the very least, you could test having reception centres in France, and see what happens to the numbers of people crossing by boat.\u201d That model could be extended to making it possible to apply for asylum directly from countries where there is a high likelihood that asylum claims will be accepted. As things stand, Suber added, that kind of approach appears almost utopian. Also, \u201cGrant the visas!\u201d and \u201cOpen the asylum application processing centres in France!\u201d don\u2019t sound so punchy in a stump speech. But if scepticism about the gang-smashing strategy proves well-founded, where is the next three-word slogan going to come from in a few years\u2019 time?

She indicated a clear threat to us: she would have attacked us with the knife if anyone came near her.\u201d</p> <p>He told the court he felt \u201cthe threat was increasing significantly\u201d. \u201cShe was now pointing the knife at us, and clearly communicating the intent that she was going to use the knife if anyone got near her.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to try to keep communicating to Clare, that because of her age, I wanted to give her \u2026 every opportunity possible to put down the knife.\u201d</p> <p>In his examination-in-chief, White\u2019s barrister, Troy Edwards SC, asked him why he did not simply let Nowland walk out of the small room: \u201cWhy not just walk away?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have resolved the situation,\u201d White replied. \u201cWe\u2019re likely putting more people\u2019s safety at risk by letting her wander. Our job is to maintain the peace, despite her being a 95-year-old, letting her wander the corridor with a knife would definitely, in my mind, be a breach of that peace.\u201d</p> <p>In the early hours of 17 May, White was called, along with his police partner, Sgt Jess Pank, to the Yallambee Lodge nursing home in Cooma. Nowland \u2013 who weighed just 47.5kg \u2013 had been walking around the nursing home, armed with a knife, disturbing patients and posing risk to staff.</p> <p>The court has heard Nowland did not respond to instructions over several hours to put down the knife, leading staff to call an ambulance and police. Nowland had not been formally diagnosed with dementia, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/13/clare-nowland-dementia-taser-police-court-kristian-white-ntwnfb\">had displayed symptoms consistent with it</a>.</p> <p>After disappearing from a resident\u2019s room, she was found in a nurses\u2019 office.</p> <p>White told the court he gave Nowland repeated verbal instructions to \u201cput down the knife\u201d. He said Nowland walked towards him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/14/clare-nowland-kristian-white-manslaughter-trial-tasering-paramedic-evidence-ntwnfb\">and his police partner, Pank</a>. White said he repeatedly told Nowland to drop the knife, but said she appeared not to understand the command: \u201cShe looked right through us.\u201d</p> <p>He then warned Nowland \u201cyou\u2019re going to get tased\u201d, and discharged his Taser at her. Nowland fell backwards, striking her head, and died a week later after suffering inoperable bleeding on the brain.</p> <p>White\u2019s barrister told the court in opening arguments it was not in dispute that the injuries caused by White tasering Nowland ultimately killed her. But he argued that White\u2019s use of the Taser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/11/clare-nowland-tasering-case-kristian-white-manslaughter-trial-ntwnfb\">involved a reasonable use of force</a>.</p> <p>White gave evidence that he considered there was a risk to Nowland if he tasered her. But he said he had deployed his Taser twice previously, both times without serious injury.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be significantly injured.\u201d</p> <p>White was asked: \u201cDid you consider it would result in her dying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d White said. \u201cI\u2019m upset and devastated by it. I never intended for her to be injured by it at all. I accept Tasers cause an injury, but I\u2019ve never seen it cause a serious injury.\u201d</p> <p>Under cross-examination, the crown prosecutor Brett Hatfield SC put it to White that Nowland posed no immediate risk to him or any other person.</p> <p>White said a potential stabbing was \u201cpretty imminent\u201d and that Nowland had raised the knife at his police partner.</p> <p>Hatfield put to White that \u201cyou could avoid being stabbed by stepping away\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility,\u201d White replied.</p> <p>White said he thought the Taser would temporarily incapacitate Nowland so she could be disarmed, and she would likely fall forward on to her walker, rather than backwards as she did.</p> <p>He said he thought Nowland might suffer a minor burn injury, or puncture wound, from the Taser barbs. \u201cI took it there would be some form of injury, as there always is with a Taser, but I didn\u2019t think she would be seriously injured.\u201d</p> <p>White, under cross examination, agreed it was clear when they found Nowland sitting in the treatment room that she was small and elderly. But he said whether she was frail was a \u201csubjective question\u201d and he couldn\u2019t give an answer on whether she appeared weak.</p> <p>He disagreed that one of the responders could have walked up and taken it out of Nowland\u2019s hand. \u201cThat strategy actually comes with risk, high risk,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However, he said he did not disagree with Pank\u2019s suggestion at the time she could grab the knife off Nowland.</p> <p>\u201cI felt comfortable if she felt comfortable to walk into that room to attempt it,\u201d White said. \u201cShe\u2019s also my supervisor so I\u2019m not going to say no.\u201d</p> <p>He told the court that once he raised the Taser he \u201cfelt like\u201d he would use it but he did not feel it was justified to use it at that point. \u201cI considered that I would still use communication to have her at least drop the knife,\u201d White told the court.</p> <p>White was questioned by Hatfield about his statement he wanted to give \u201cas much time as possible\u201d for Nowland to stop or drop the knife, despite the footage showing he only took one minute between discharging his Taser and firing it. White said he would have to take Hatfield\u2019s \u201cword for the seconds on the clock\u201d.</p> <p>Asked if White said \u201cbugger it\u201d because he was fed up, he said that it in reference to feeling the use of force was his only option at the time to ensure a \u201csafe resolution\u201d. He said the strategy to contain Nowland in the room was falling apart. He agreed, under questioning, that the paramedics, staff and Pank were a safe distance away.</p> <p>When White returned to the police station after the incident, he agreed that he looked at the standard operating procedures (SOPs) in the course of writing his incident report into the police database.</p> <p>Asked by Hatfield if he changed what he wrote after he saw that the procedures said it was advised that Tasers are not used against \u201celderly\u201d people, he said he did not.</p> <p>\u201cDid it concern you that when you looked at the SOPs \u2026?,\u201d Hatfield asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo because I still felt I met the criteria and the exceptional circumstances,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cEven though you didn\u2019t have exceptional circumstances in mind when you did it?,\u201d White asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, they weren\u2019t on my mind,\u201d he said.</p> <p>White had also written in his report that Nowland had been carrying a boning knife because the knife looked like a similar boning knife he had at home. Asked if a boning knife is a sharper knife than a steak knife, he said it was, but then said it depends on the quality.</p> <p>\u201cAt this point you knew it was a steak knife, do you agree,\u201d Hatfield asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d White said.</p> <p>The trial, before Justice Ian Harrison, continues.</p>",

She indicated a clear threat to us: she would have attacked us with the knife if anyone came near her.\u201d He told the court he felt \u201cthe threat was increasing significantly\u201d. \u201cShe was now pointing the knife at us, and clearly communicating the intent that she was going to use the knife if anyone got near her. \u201cI wanted to try to keep communicating to Clare, that because of her age, I wanted to give her \u2026 every opportunity possible to put down the knife.\u201d In his examination-in-chief, White\u2019s barrister, Troy Edwards SC, asked him why he did not simply let Nowland walk out of the small room: \u201cWhy not just walk away?\u201d \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have resolved the situation,\u201d White replied. \u201cWe\u2019re likely putting more people\u2019s safety at risk by letting her wander. Our job is to maintain the peace, despite her being a 95-year-old, letting her wander the corridor with a knife would definitely, in my mind, be a breach of that peace.\u201d In the early hours of 17 May, White was called, along with his police partner, Sgt Jess Pank, to the Yallambee Lodge nursing home in Cooma. Nowland \u2013 who weighed just 47.5kg \u2013 had been walking around the nursing home, armed with a knife, disturbing patients and posing risk to staff. The court has heard Nowland did not respond to instructions over several hours to put down the knife, leading staff to call an ambulance and police. Nowland had not been formally diagnosed with dementia, but had displayed symptoms consistent with it. After disappearing from a resident\u2019s room, she was found in a nurses\u2019 office. White told the court he gave Nowland repeated verbal instructions to \u201cput down the knife\u201d. He said Nowland walked towards him and his police partner, Pank. White said he repeatedly told Nowland to drop the knife, but said she appeared not to understand the command: \u201cShe looked right through us.\u201d He then warned Nowland \u201cyou\u2019re going to get tased\u201d, and discharged his Taser at her. Nowland fell backwards, striking her head, and died a week later after suffering inoperable bleeding on the brain. White\u2019s barrister told the court in opening arguments it was not in dispute that the injuries caused by White tasering Nowland ultimately killed her. But he argued that White\u2019s use of the Taser involved a reasonable use of force. White gave evidence that he considered there was a risk to Nowland if he tasered her. But he said he had deployed his Taser twice previously, both times without serious injury. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be significantly injured.\u201d White was asked: \u201cDid you consider it would result in her dying?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d White said. \u201cI\u2019m upset and devastated by it. I never intended for her to be injured by it at all. I accept Tasers cause an injury, but I\u2019ve never seen it cause a serious injury.\u201d Under cross-examination, the crown prosecutor Brett Hatfield SC put it to White that Nowland posed no immediate risk to him or any other person. White said a potential stabbing was \u201cpretty imminent\u201d and that Nowland had raised the knife at his police partner. Hatfield put to White that \u201cyou could avoid being stabbed by stepping away\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility,\u201d White replied. White said he thought the Taser would temporarily incapacitate Nowland so she could be disarmed, and she would likely fall forward on to her walker, rather than backwards as she did. He said he thought Nowland might suffer a minor burn injury, or puncture wound, from the Taser barbs. \u201cI took it there would be some form of injury, as there always is with a Taser, but I didn\u2019t think she would be seriously injured.\u201d White, under cross examination, agreed it was clear when they found Nowland sitting in the treatment room that she was small and elderly. But he said whether she was frail was a \u201csubjective question\u201d and he couldn\u2019t give an answer on whether she appeared weak. He disagreed that one of the responders could have walked up and taken it out of Nowland\u2019s hand. \u201cThat strategy actually comes with risk, high risk,\u201d he said. However, he said he did not disagree with Pank\u2019s suggestion at the time she could grab the knife off Nowland. \u201cI felt comfortable if she felt comfortable to walk into that room to attempt it,\u201d White said. \u201cShe\u2019s also my supervisor so I\u2019m not going to say no.\u201d He told the court that once he raised the Taser he \u201cfelt like\u201d he would use it but he did not feel it was justified to use it at that point. \u201cI considered that I would still use communication to have her at least drop the knife,\u201d White told the court. White was questioned by Hatfield about his statement he wanted to give \u201cas much time as possible\u201d for Nowland to stop or drop the knife, despite the footage showing he only took one minute between discharging his Taser and firing it. White said he would have to take Hatfield\u2019s \u201cword for the seconds on the clock\u201d. Asked if White said \u201cbugger it\u201d because he was fed up, he said that it in reference to feeling the use of force was his only option at the time to ensure a \u201csafe resolution\u201d. He said the strategy to contain Nowland in the room was falling apart. He agreed, under questioning, that the paramedics, staff and Pank were a safe distance away. When White returned to the police station after the incident, he agreed that he looked at the standard operating procedures (SOPs) in the course of writing his incident report into the police database. Asked by Hatfield if he changed what he wrote after he saw that the procedures said it was advised that Tasers are not used against \u201celderly\u201d people, he said he did not. \u201cDid it concern you that when you looked at the SOPs \u2026?,\u201d Hatfield asked. \u201cNo because I still felt I met the criteria and the exceptional circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though you didn\u2019t have exceptional circumstances in mind when you did it?,\u201d White asked. \u201cNo, they weren\u2019t on my mind,\u201d he said. White had also written in his report that Nowland had been carrying a boning knife because the knife looked like a similar boning knife he had at home. Asked if a boning knife is a sharper knife than a steak knife, he said it was, but then said it depends on the quality. \u201cAt this point you knew it was a steak knife, do you agree,\u201d Hatfield asked. \u201cYes,\u201d White said. The trial, before Justice Ian Harrison, continues.",

It is a new world, for which cities, hospitals, roads and farms are unprepared, and a world that gets even more dangerous every day as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/13/no-sign-of-promised-fossil-fuel-transition-as-emissions-hit-new-high\">carbon emissions continue</a> to be pumped into the atmosphere.</p>    <p>Nowhere is safe. In the last two years, previously impossible heat struck from the <a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/deadly-mediterranean-heatwave-would-not-have-occurred-without-human-induced-climate-change/\">Mediterranean</a> to <a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/extreme-humid-heat-in-south-asia-in-april-2023-largely-driven-by-climate-change-detrimental-to-vulnerable-and-disadvantaged-communities/\">Thailand</a>, and from the <a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-made-the-deadly-heatwaves-that-hit-millions-of-highly-vulnerable-people-across-asia-more-frequent-and-extreme/\">Philippines</a> to the highly vulnerable populations in<a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/extreme-sahel-heatwave-that-hit-highly-vulnerable-population-at-the-end-of-ramadan-would-not-have-occurred-without-climate-change/\">Sahel in Africa</a> at the end of Ramadan.

The oceans have also suffered, with impossible marine heatwaves striking the <a href=\"http://www.ametsoc.net/eee/2017a/ch20_EEEof2017_Perkins.pdf\">Tasman Sea</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-022-00461-2\">north-east Pacific</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01215-y\">Arctic ocean</a> in recent years.</p> <p>Many other extreme events have been made far more likely, heavily loading the weather dice. The sweltering heat in <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/climate-science/attribution/indian_heatwave_2022.pdf\">northern India and Pakistan in May 2022</a> was made 100 times more likely, as was the torrential rain that caused <a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/interplay-of-climate-change-exacerbated-rainfall-exposure-and-vulnerability-led-to-widespread-impacts-in-the-mediterranean-region/\">appalling flooding in Libya</a> in September 2023 and the <a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-not-el-nino-main-driver-of-exceptional-drought-in-highly-vulnerable-amazon-river-basin/\">Amazon river basin drought</a> in 2023.</p> <h2>The consequences</h2> <p>Attribution scientists are no longer only analysing the extreme weather events themselves but also making the human cost tangible by estimating how much of the damage caused would have been avoided if fossil fuel burning had not heated the world.</p> <p>One study has found that <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49890-x\">one in three newborn babies that died</a> due to heat would have survived if global heating had not pushed temperatures beyond normal bounds \u2013 that is about 10,000 lost babies a year. The study assessed low and middle income countries from 2001-2019.</p> <p>Another study of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01058-x\">heat-related deaths in summer</a> from 1991-2018 also found a deadly impact of global heating in the 43 countries assessed. Extrapolating these findings to a global figure is not straightforward, but an approximate estimate given by the scientists is more than 100,000 deaths a year. Over the two decades, that implies a toll of millions of lives due to the climate crisis.</p>    <p>The deadly supercharging of extreme weather is not new \u2013 it has existed for at least 20 years, largely undetected. But more than <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096321000140?via%3Dihub\">1,000 people who died prematurely</a> in the UK in the 2003 heatwave would have lived without global heating.</p> <p>More recently, the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096321000140?via%3Dihub\">increased intensity of 2017\u2019s Hurricane Maria</a>, fuelled by climate change, was the reason for 3,700 deaths in Puerto Rico, while 13,000 people would not have been <a href=\"https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/23/3467/2023/\">forced from their homes</a> by Tropical Cyclone Idai in Mozambique in 2019 without global heating.</p> <p>Global heating is destroying homes as well as lives. Hurricane Harvey would <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31056-2\">not have flooded 30%-50%</a> of the US properties that it did submerge in 2017 without global heating.</p>    <p>It has driven up the price tags of hurricane destruction by billions of dollars, such as <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22838-1\">Hurricane Sandy</a> in the US in 2012 and <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-022-03344-9\">Typhoon Hagabis</a> in Japan in 2019. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096321000140?via%3Dihub\">Four major floods</a> in the UK would have caused only half the $18bn of wrecked buildings were it not for human-caused climate change.</p> <p>Adding to this litany of destruction is the <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1223\">loss of crops in the US</a> and <a href=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/99/1/bams-explainingextremeevents2016.1.xml\">Southern Africa</a>, with global heating responsible for taking billions of dollars worth of food off people\u2019s table. It is changing cultural events too, playing a major part in the <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac6bb4\">early flowering of the famous cherry trees</a> in Kyoto, Japan, the earliest date in more than 1,200 years of records.</p> <h2>The details</h2> <p>The 744 attribution studies collated by Carbon Brief used weather data to compare extreme events in today\u2019s heated climate with the same events in computer models of the climate that existed before large-scale fossil fuel burning. This comparison allows the scientists to calculate how much more likely and severe the extreme event was today, revealing the role of human-caused global heating in worsening the event.</p> <p>Three-quarters of the analyses of extreme weather events found global heating made them more severe or more likely to occur. A further 9% were made less likely, as would be expected as these were mostly extreme cold and snow events. The rest found either no discernible influence of global heating or were inconclusive, in part due to lack of sufficient data. The analysis includes studies published up to the end of September 2024.</p> <p>Major parts of the world, outside Europe, North America and China, have been little studied by attribution scientists, leaving the true impacts of the climate crisis underreported. Issues include lack of long term weather data and scientific capacity. There are particularly few in the Middle East and North Africa, despite these regions being both among the hardest hit and the biggest fossil fuel producers.</p>",

She said levels of funding were \u201cstrikingly and painfully insignificant compared with needs\u201d. Delivering at least a trillion dollars of finance is a key task for negotiators at Cop29 in Azerbaijan. \u201cThe sheer weight of this evidence reinforces the impact that human-caused warming is having today \u2013 not at some far-off point in the future,\u201d said Robert McSweeney, at Carbon Brief, who compiled the database. The impossibles The impossible extreme weather events, ie those with a vanishingly low probability of happening without the turbocharge of human-caused global heating, are particularly striking. They show that the burning of fossil fuels has so dramatically changed the climate that heatwaves are hitting communities with a severity and frequency never seen during the entire development of human civilisation over the past 5,000 years. It is a new world, for which cities, hospitals, roads and farms are unprepared, and a world that gets even more dangerous every day as carbon emissions continue to be pumped into the atmosphere. Nowhere is safe. In the last two years, previously impossible heat struck from the Mediterranean to Thailand, and from the Philippines to the highly vulnerable populations inSahel in Africa at the end of Ramadan. In the two years before that, both North America and Europe sweltered in unprecedented heat, along with South Korea and even the icy Tibetan plateau. The trail of impossibly scorched earth stretches back even further: China and Russia and the Arctic \u2013 where one town recorded 38C \u2013 in 2020, Europe again in 2019 and swathes of the northern hemisphere in 2018. The earliest recorded impossible heatwaves were in 2016, when in fact the heat the entire planet then endured could not have occurred without global heating. The oceans have also suffered, with impossible marine heatwaves striking the Tasman Sea, north-east Pacific and Arctic ocean in recent years. Many other extreme events have been made far more likely, heavily loading the weather dice. The sweltering heat in northern India and Pakistan in May 2022 was made 100 times more likely, as was the torrential rain that caused appalling flooding in Libya in September 2023 and the Amazon river basin drought in 2023. The consequences Attribution scientists are no longer only analysing the extreme weather events themselves but also making the human cost tangible by estimating how much of the damage caused would have been avoided if fossil fuel burning had not heated the world. One study has found that one in three newborn babies that died due to heat would have survived if global heating had not pushed temperatures beyond normal bounds \u2013 that is about 10,000 lost babies a year. The study assessed low and middle income countries from 2001-2019. Another study of heat-related deaths in summer from 1991-2018 also found a deadly impact of global heating in the 43 countries assessed. Extrapolating these findings to a global figure is not straightforward, but an approximate estimate given by the scientists is more than 100,000 deaths a year. Over the two decades, that implies a toll of millions of lives due to the climate crisis. The deadly supercharging of extreme weather is not new \u2013 it has existed for at least 20 years, largely undetected. But more than 1,000 people who died prematurely in the UK in the 2003 heatwave would have lived without global heating. More recently, the increased intensity of 2017\u2019s Hurricane Maria, fuelled by climate change, was the reason for 3,700 deaths in Puerto Rico, while 13,000 people would not have been forced from their homes by Tropical Cyclone Idai in Mozambique in 2019 without global heating. Global heating is destroying homes as well as lives. Hurricane Harvey would not have flooded 30%-50% of the US properties that it did submerge in 2017 without global heating. It has driven up the price tags of hurricane destruction by billions of dollars, such as Hurricane Sandy in the US in 2012 and Typhoon Hagabis in Japan in 2019. Four major floods in the UK would have caused only half the $18bn of wrecked buildings were it not for human-caused climate change. Adding to this litany of destruction is the loss of crops in the US and Southern Africa, with global heating responsible for taking billions of dollars worth of food off people\u2019s table. It is changing cultural events too, playing a major part in the early flowering of the famous cherry trees in Kyoto, Japan, the earliest date in more than 1,200 years of records. The details The 744 attribution studies collated by Carbon Brief used weather data to compare extreme events in today\u2019s heated climate with the same events in computer models of the climate that existed before large-scale fossil fuel burning. This comparison allows the scientists to calculate how much more likely and severe the extreme event was today, revealing the role of human-caused global heating in worsening the event. Three-quarters of the analyses of extreme weather events found global heating made them more severe or more likely to occur. A further 9% were made less likely, as would be expected as these were mostly extreme cold and snow events. The rest found either no discernible influence of global heating or were inconclusive, in part due to lack of sufficient data. The analysis includes studies published up to the end of September 2024. Major parts of the world, outside Europe, North America and China, have been little studied by attribution scientists, leaving the true impacts of the climate crisis underreported. Issues include lack of long term weather data and scientific capacity. There are particularly few in the Middle East and North Africa, despite these regions being both among the hardest hit and the biggest fossil fuel producers.",

      "body": "<p>The most useful lesson of growing up under a dictatorship is that dictatorships are never absolute. Sometimes they are even democracies \u2013 ones that thrive by co-opting those with proximity to power and managing those who do not benefit. That management is often through brute oppression, but mainly it is through securing consent by convincing enough people that things are about to get really great. Any minute now, once the enemies of the people are thwarted, a corner will be turned. Authoritarian democracies recognise anger, foment it, then bottle it for their own purposes.</p> <p>The trick is to always have a horizon, distant but in sight, beyond which things will get better. While this happens, the trappings of national success assuage the masses and give a sense of power, prosperity and momentum. In Egypt, as the jails swelled with political prisoners, the military government erected grand pharaonic monuments and embarked on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/08/cairo-why-egypt-build-new-capital-city-desert\">colossal construction project</a> in the capital. In India, Narendra Modi <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-authoritarian-leaders-playbook-how-narendra-modi-captured-indias-legal-system-and-is-rewriting-the-countrys-history-in-his-image-226889\">entrenched authoritarianism</a> while he wooed big business and launched enormous infrastructure projects and Hindu temples. Dictators establish themselves as both great modernisers and stabilisers, promising both conservatism and futurism. They emphasise traditions and values but wrap these up in technology, urbanisation and even a <a href=\"https://www.neom.com/en-us/regions/theline\">certain aesthetic</a> \u2013 clean lines, mirrors, glass and steel skyscrapers.</p> <p>But the beneficiaries of modernity remain relatively limited. And so the rest of the work of political stabilisation has to happen through populism \u2013 the creation of a threatening other (the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/02/who-are-the-muslim-brotherhood\">Muslim Brotherhood</a> in Egypt, or just all Muslims in India) and the promise to eliminate it. If all else fails, there is legal capture, persecution and imprisonment. Such governments have understood that, in the absence of social justice and redistribution, the way forward is to deal with disaffection through strongmen leaders, lies and the ostracism of those who object.</p> <p>This style of governance is not just confined to states in the global south. As someone with a foot both there and in the west, I can see a through line. Globalisation and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/aug/04/how-britain-fell-out-of-love-with-the-free-market\">free market capitalism</a>, the organising principles of all but a few states, delivered on their promise of bringing us all closer together. But what often gets overlooked is how these processes made us more similar by creating winners and losers in pretty much the same way across the world. The standardisation of ways of living and doing business that globalisation produced anchored the winners, and unmoored the losers. Our lives are much more recognisable to each other than they were 30 years ago. We have all been flooded by goods, services, apps and digital entertainment, and yet we still feel the need for something else \u2013 for a sense of security beyond just our ability to consume in the immediate term.</p> <p>Pretending to meet that need is what delivered Donald Trump\u2019s victory. He understands that an oligarchic system that enriches a few cannot deliver economic security to the masses. If you want the majority of the public on your side, you have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/07/discontent-americans-wanting-change-elect-trump\">promise change</a>, but not in a way that actually reconfigures society.</p> <p>The problem is not a rapaciously capitalist system that has resulted in broken healthcare provision, a legislature captured by rich lobbies or deregulation that has stripped workers of their statutory rights and consequently created an epic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/07/trump-victory-adds-record-wealth-richest-top-10\">transfer of wealth to a billionaire class</a>. The problem is the undocumented immigrants, the enemies within the bureaucracy who tried to bring Trump down, the diversity extremists. If you are the Democrats and all you have to counter this powerful vision is a lot of nice values and dancing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/opinion/kamala-harris-democratic-convention.html\">\u201cjoy\u201d but no material proposal</a> to radically change people\u2019s lives, you haven\u2019t even brought a knife to a gunfight \u2013 you\u2019ve brought Oprah Winfrey.</p> <p>The socially liberal free market model that progressives believe in has seized up. It was always going to without more aggressive regulation, redistributive policies and the sort of high tax and high spend safety net that is necessary when traditional social arrangements are shattered. In the wake of globalisation, whole communities in the west were deindustrialised while a poorly paid urban working class was created in the global south. After the 2008 financial crash, wealth became concentrated and shut an entire generation of people out from the life their parents had. In the 2010s, with the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley\">Silicon Valley</a> tech companies, another number was added to a ballooning precariat: drivers, riders and box packers were plunged into poorly protected and poorly paid work. Social media launched with the promise of crowdsourcing truth to power and bringing us all closer together, then <a href=\"https://doctorow.medium.com/social-quitting-1ce85b67b456\">succumbed to enshittification</a>, misinformation, deepfakes and racism.</p> <p>Modern life is out of control. There was no path for the Democrats to mimic the trick of Trump and the rest of the authoritarian crew. Hampered by the increasing exposure of what little can be done by liberals in a neoliberal world, progressives in the US can only point to the importance of law and order and institutions.

      "bodyText": "The most useful lesson of growing up under a dictatorship is that dictatorships are never absolute. Sometimes they are even democracies \u2013 ones that thrive by co-opting those with proximity to power and managing those who do not benefit. That management is often through brute oppression, but mainly it is through securing consent by convincing enough people that things are about to get really great. Any minute now, once the enemies of the people are thwarted, a corner will be turned. Authoritarian democracies recognise anger, foment it, then bottle it for their own purposes. The trick is to always have a horizon, distant but in sight, beyond which things will get better. While this happens, the trappings of national success assuage the masses and give a sense of power, prosperity and momentum. In Egypt, as the jails swelled with political prisoners, the military government erected grand pharaonic monuments and embarked on a colossal construction project in the capital. In India, Narendra Modi entrenched authoritarianism while he wooed big business and launched enormous infrastructure projects and Hindu temples. Dictators establish themselves as both great modernisers and stabilisers, promising both conservatism and futurism. They emphasise traditions and values but wrap these up in technology, urbanisation and even a certain aesthetic \u2013 clean lines, mirrors, glass and steel skyscrapers. But the beneficiaries of modernity remain relatively limited. And so the rest of the work of political stabilisation has to happen through populism \u2013 the creation of a threatening other (the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, or just all Muslims in India) and the promise to eliminate it. If all else fails, there is legal capture, persecution and imprisonment. Such governments have understood that, in the absence of social justice and redistribution, the way forward is to deal with disaffection through strongmen leaders, lies and the ostracism of those who object. This style of governance is not just confined to states in the global south. As someone with a foot both there and in the west, I can see a through line. Globalisation and free market capitalism, the organising principles of all but a few states, delivered on their promise of bringing us all closer together. But what often gets overlooked is how these processes made us more similar by creating winners and losers in pretty much the same way across the world. The standardisation of ways of living and doing business that globalisation produced anchored the winners, and unmoored the losers. Our lives are much more recognisable to each other than they were 30 years ago. We have all been flooded by goods, services, apps and digital entertainment, and yet we still feel the need for something else \u2013 for a sense of security beyond just our ability to consume in the immediate term. Pretending to meet that need is what delivered Donald Trump\u2019s victory. He understands that an oligarchic system that enriches a few cannot deliver economic security to the masses. If you want the majority of the public on your side, you have to promise change, but not in a way that actually reconfigures society. The problem is not a rapaciously capitalist system that has resulted in broken healthcare provision, a legislature captured by rich lobbies or deregulation that has stripped workers of their statutory rights and consequently created an epic transfer of wealth to a billionaire class. The problem is the undocumented immigrants, the enemies within the bureaucracy who tried to bring Trump down, the diversity extremists. If you are the Democrats and all you have to counter this powerful vision is a lot of nice values and dancing \u201cjoy\u201d but no material proposal to radically change people\u2019s lives, you haven\u2019t even brought a knife to a gunfight \u2013 you\u2019ve brought Oprah Winfrey. The socially liberal free market model that progressives believe in has seized up. It was always going to without more aggressive regulation, redistributive policies and the sort of high tax and high spend safety net that is necessary when traditional social arrangements are shattered. In the wake of globalisation, whole communities in the west were deindustrialised while a poorly paid urban working class was created in the global south. After the 2008 financial crash, wealth became concentrated and shut an entire generation of people out from the life their parents had. In the 2010s, with the rise of Silicon Valley tech companies, another number was added to a ballooning precariat: drivers, riders and box packers were plunged into poorly protected and poorly paid work. Social media launched with the promise of crowdsourcing truth to power and bringing us all closer together, then succumbed to enshittification, misinformation, deepfakes and racism. Modern life is out of control. There was no path for the Democrats to mimic the trick of Trump and the rest of the authoritarian crew. Hampered by the increasing exposure of what little can be done by liberals in a neoliberal world, progressives in the US can only point to the importance of law and order and institutions. It\u2019s a problem that Labour in the UK may well soon face. All you need is one compelling rightwing figure and Labour\u2019s rousing \u201cthings will get worse before they get better\u201d approach will be shredded. So long as centrists double down on this system and hope for the best, western democracies will be vulnerable. I remember, in the tumultuous aftermath of the Arab spring, the question over whether Arabs were \u201cready for democracy\u201d \u2013 but democracy alone cannot guarantee freedom and equality if the economic system in which it exists prevents those very qualities from emerging. It was easier to overthrow Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak than unseat the military-private commercial partnerships behind him. The authoritarians have an answer to the problem of systems too established and lucrative to undo: lie, scapegoat and appeal to people\u2019s fears, prejudices and vanities. Liberals don\u2019t. Because they cannot grasp that within such systems, the benefits of rationality and individual freedoms, and the pursuit of scientific endeavour and personal prosperity just do not accrue meaningfully to enough people any more. It is easier to believe that it is racism that elected Trump, or backwardness that reversed the Egyptian revolution, or ethnic supremacism that elevated Modi. But the truth is that, all over the world, the old order is gone and the new one is bewildering. People feel trapped and want a sense of release, a promise of a dramatically different future, or just a future. Even if that sense of freedom comes vicariously from an autocrat who has flexed and snapped the chains of the system. And they want to feel as if they are part of something bigger and stronger as they get lonelier and weaker and their worlds fracture and atomise by the day.

      "body": "<p>The Halloween cobwebs had barely been brushed off the shop windows of Birmingham city centre when the German-style Christmas market, one of the largest in the UK, opened on 1 November.</p> <p>Stretching over 500 yards down the city\u2019s main shopping street and spilling out into the main square, for just over seven weeks dozens of stalls will sell bratwurst sausages, sweet treats, trinkets and beer \u2013 at \u00a312 for a pint (including the deposit for the glass).</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not the same any more. It\u2019s too commercial. It starts too early, and it\u2019s got too expensive,\u201d said Kate Jones, 46, walking through the market on her way home from work. \u201cI\u2019ve been working here for 20 years, and I\u2019ve seen it get so much bigger. It\u2019s not as intimate. I never really go any more, and I think a lot of people who live and work here feel like that.\u201d</p> <p>Christmas markets, bigger than ever and open for longer, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/11/thinking-of-going-to-a-christmas-market-maybe-dont\">increasingly polarising opinion across the UK</a> as some residents and businesses grow tired of the busy crowds and repetitive stalls.</p>    <p>\u201cI wish they\u2019d go back to how it used to be when it opened later \u2013 1 November is a bit much,\u201d said Hannah, 36, walking by on a Wednesday evening. \u201cIf every stand was its own independent stall, it would be better, but they just all sell the same stuff. It\u2019s overpriced tat, but it\u2019s fun overpriced tat I suppose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvery six stalls is a marshmallow stall,\u201d added her friend, Matt, 36. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so big it really does affect the whole city centre.\u201d</p> <p>Beatrice Douzjian, co-owner of family-run Ju Ju\u2019s cafe in the city, said she thought it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d so much time and resources were given over to the Christmas market when small businesses were struggling.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as it starts, we notice there\u2019s a lull in business,\u201d she said. \u201cIt pulls trade away from small independents like ourselves but it doesn\u2019t offer value for customers, with the same tat being sold across the market for extortionate prices.\u201d</p> <p>A similar issue is playing out in Manchester, where the night-time economy adviser, Sacha Lord, said that although 9 million people are expected to visit the city centre market this year, local businesses were losing customers to the Christmas stalls.</p>    <p>\u201cThe extra tourism is great but it can have a downside for pubs, bars and restaurants, which can see footfall decrease if they\u2019re not located by the markets, or who just don\u2019t get the benefit of all that foot traffic,\u201d said Lord.</p> <p>\u201cCity planners should be helping by keeping food stalls away from similar restaurants, but there\u2019s also massive opportunities for venues themselves to create their own experiences that draw people in from the cold.\u201d</p> <p>Matthew Lockren from Pure Craft Bar and Kitchen, next door to the Christmas market in Birmingham, has felt the benefit, saying sales \u201cdouble every year after it opens\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe opportunity for us as a business is massive,\u201d he said.</p>    <p>In some parts of the country, Christmas markets have become too successful for their own good. The market in Lincoln, which had run for 40 years, was permanently cancelled last year due to fears about overcrowding, after attracting a record 300,000 visitors over four days in 2022.</p> <p>Manchester\u2019s Christmas markets began in 1998 with just a handful of stalls, later spreading to Albert Square, where European traders would flog their wares under the watchful eye of the famous \u201cZippy Santa\u201d that adorned the town hall.</p> <p>With the building under renovation, since 2018 the markets have dispersed further across the city, with 240 stalls this year. Many here say the range of goods on offer has declined, while prices have increased. Brexit has also meant more local traders take up pitches than visiting Europeans.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t even have to walk through it. You\u2019ve seen one bit and you\u2019ve seen it all. They used to have all different things, but now it\u2019s just all food and drink,\u201d said Michelle, 56.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they first started there used to be a lot of people from Europe,\u201d her friend Lisa, 57, said. \u201cNow it\u2019s all the same. It\u2019s too expensive for what it is; food and drink has gone up a lot.\u201d</p>    <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not a novelty any more because I\u2019ve lived in Manchester so long,\u201d said Caroline Durkin, 69. \u201cBut I love it when they\u2019re arriving and there\u2019s an atmosphere of Christmas starting.\u201d</p> <p>The markets also have an impact on disabled people, as their access to city centres is restricted by obstructions in the form of stalls and street furniture \u2013 as well as an influx of people.</p> <p>In York, blue badge holders have been restricted from the city centre during Christmas market opening hours. \u201cIt massively impacts disabled people\u2019s ability to access goods and services in the way that non-disabled people take for granted,\u201d said Flick Williams from the campaign group Reverse The Ban.</p> <p>After the complaints the council changed its policy. James Gilchrist, the director of environment, transport and planning at the council, said: \u201cThe council\u2019s executive decided to establish blue badge holders\u2019 access to the city centre during the Christmas market for two hours at less busy times. Council officers are now working with market organisers Make it York and other stakeholders to implement arrangements as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Birmingham city council said: \u201cThe Frankfurt Christmas market brings millions of visitors into the city each year, providing a huge economic boost and we are proud that the market also provides jobs for over 350 local people working alongside German staff.\u201d</p>    <p>\u201cWe\u2019re very proud that Manchester Christmas markets are the biggest Christmas markets in the country and are really pleased that since opening last Friday they have broken all attendance records,\u201d said Pat Karney, a local councillor. \u201cThe intoxicating Christmas atmosphere across our markets is free for everyone to enjoy with no requirement to buy anything.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Halloween cobwebs had barely been brushed off the shop windows of Birmingham city centre when the German-style Christmas market, one of the largest in the UK, opened on 1 November. Stretching over 500 yards down the city\u2019s main shopping street and spilling out into the main square, for just over seven weeks dozens of stalls will sell bratwurst sausages, sweet treats, trinkets and beer \u2013 at \u00a312 for a pint (including the deposit for the glass). \u201cIt\u2019s just not the same any more. It\u2019s too commercial. It starts too early, and it\u2019s got too expensive,\u201d said Kate Jones, 46, walking through the market on her way home from work. \u201cI\u2019ve been working here for 20 years, and I\u2019ve seen it get so much bigger. It\u2019s not as intimate. I never really go any more, and I think a lot of people who live and work here feel like that.\u201d Christmas markets, bigger than ever and open for longer, are increasingly polarising opinion across the UK as some residents and businesses grow tired of the busy crowds and repetitive stalls. \u201cI wish they\u2019d go back to how it used to be when it opened later \u2013 1 November is a bit much,\u201d said Hannah, 36, walking by on a Wednesday evening. \u201cIf every stand was its own independent stall, it would be better, but they just all sell the same stuff. It\u2019s overpriced tat, but it\u2019s fun overpriced tat I suppose.\u201d \u201cEvery six stalls is a marshmallow stall,\u201d added her friend, Matt, 36. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so big it really does affect the whole city centre.\u201d Beatrice Douzjian, co-owner of family-run Ju Ju\u2019s cafe in the city, said she thought it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d so much time and resources were given over to the Christmas market when small businesses were struggling. \u201cAs soon as it starts, we notice there\u2019s a lull in business,\u201d she said. \u201cIt pulls trade away from small independents like ourselves but it doesn\u2019t offer value for customers, with the same tat being sold across the market for extortionate prices.\u201d A similar issue is playing out in Manchester, where the night-time economy adviser, Sacha Lord, said that although 9 million people are expected to visit the city centre market this year, local businesses were losing customers to the Christmas stalls. \u201cThe extra tourism is great but it can have a downside for pubs, bars and restaurants, which can see footfall decrease if they\u2019re not located by the markets, or who just don\u2019t get the benefit of all that foot traffic,\u201d said Lord. \u201cCity planners should be helping by keeping food stalls away from similar restaurants, but there\u2019s also massive opportunities for venues themselves to create their own experiences that draw people in from the cold.\u201d Matthew Lockren from Pure Craft Bar and Kitchen, next door to the Christmas market in Birmingham, has felt the benefit, saying sales \u201cdouble every year after it opens\u201d. \u201cThe opportunity for us as a business is massive,\u201d he said. In some parts of the country, Christmas markets have become too successful for their own good. The market in Lincoln, which had run for 40 years, was permanently cancelled last year due to fears about overcrowding, after attracting a record 300,000 visitors over four days in 2022. Manchester\u2019s Christmas markets began in 1998 with just a handful of stalls, later spreading to Albert Square, where European traders would flog their wares under the watchful eye of the famous \u201cZippy Santa\u201d that adorned the town hall. With the building under renovation, since 2018 the markets have dispersed further across the city, with 240 stalls this year. Many here say the range of goods on offer has declined, while prices have increased. Brexit has also meant more local traders take up pitches than visiting Europeans. \u201cI don\u2019t even have to walk through it. You\u2019ve seen one bit and you\u2019ve seen it all. They used to have all different things, but now it\u2019s just all food and drink,\u201d said Michelle, 56. \u201cWhen they first started there used to be a lot of people from Europe,\u201d her friend Lisa, 57, said. \u201cNow it\u2019s all the same. It\u2019s too expensive for what it is; food and drink has gone up a lot.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re not a novelty any more because I\u2019ve lived in Manchester so long,\u201d said Caroline Durkin, 69. \u201cBut I love it when they\u2019re arriving and there\u2019s an atmosphere of Christmas starting.\u201d The markets also have an impact on disabled people, as their access to city centres is restricted by obstructions in the form of stalls and street furniture \u2013 as well as an influx of people. In York, blue badge holders have been restricted from the city centre during Christmas market opening hours. \u201cIt massively impacts disabled people\u2019s ability to access goods and services in the way that non-disabled people take for granted,\u201d said Flick Williams from the campaign group Reverse The Ban. After the complaints the council changed its policy. James Gilchrist, the director of environment, transport and planning at the council, said: \u201cThe council\u2019s executive decided to establish blue badge holders\u2019 access to the city centre during the Christmas market for two hours at less busy times. Council officers are now working with market organisers Make it York and other stakeholders to implement arrangements as soon as possible.\u201d A spokesperson for Birmingham city council said: \u201cThe Frankfurt Christmas market brings millions of visitors into the city each year, providing a huge economic boost and we are proud that the market also provides jobs for over 350 local people working alongside German staff.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very proud that Manchester Christmas markets are the biggest Christmas markets in the country and are really pleased that since opening last Friday they have broken all attendance records,\u201d said Pat Karney, a local councillor. \u201cThe intoxicating Christmas atmosphere across our markets is free for everyone to enjoy with no requirement to buy anything.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s townhouse is a stone\u2019s throw from the Houses of Parliament. The family nanny, Veronica Crook, greets me with a smile. Crook was Rees-Mogg\u2019s nanny from the day he was born and is now nanny to him and his six children. There is a huge, handsome portrait of her next to the kitchen. In the large room opposite, huge handsome portraits of family members and historical figures hang on the walls.</p> <p>It wouldn\u2019t take long to work out who lives here if you were playing Through the Keyhole. The loo is plastered with newspaper cartoons about the former Conservative MP and minister, riffing on his scorn for civil servants, lockdown regulations and the EU. Then there are the cartoons celebrating his image as Mr Nasty: Rees-Mogg as a bespectacled cat saying: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly\u201d while his left front paw pins down a petrified mouse; with a baby Boris Johnson in his arms, as a spitting Theresa May says: \u201cYour daddy is a horrible person!\u201d Rees-Mogg, 55, is famous for floccinaucinihilipilification \u2013 a word he introduced into parliamentary debate in 2012, meaning the act of considering something to be worthless.</p> <p>With Crook\u2019s blessing, I head up the stairs to a large living room. Rees-Mogg enters \u2013 6ft 2in, paper thin, owlish, with the air of a buoyant undertaker. As always, he is immaculately dressed: a perfectly pressed double-breasted suit, striped shirt, polka-dot tie. \u201cThank you for coming round. It\u2019s rather chilly in here,\u201d he says apologetically. Rees-Mogg is supremely polite in an old-fashioned way. He was known by some in parliament as the \u201chonourable member for the 18th century\u201d. But for all the politeness, at times he comes across as an unmannerly schoolboy. When he slouched across the frontbench as if bored senseless in a vital 2019 Brexit debate, the then Green MP Caroline Lucas accused him of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/sit-up-jacob-rees-mogg-under-fire-for-slouching-in-commons\">showing contempt for parliament</a>.</p> <p>Rees-Mogg lost his seat in July when his party was routed in the general election after 14 years in power. Now, he presents State of the Nation, a politics programme on GB News four nights a week. Perhaps more surprisingly, he and his family are starring in a five-part reality show, Meet the Rees-Moggs.</p> <p>As he sits down, so does the show\u2019s publicist. I ask if she intends to stay for the whole interview. \u201cYes, it\u2019s policy,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m just going to be listening in.\u201d It\u2019s funny that this intrepid champion of free speech is being chaperoned through our talk, not least when the nanny is downstairs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he laughs. \u201cPoppy\u2019s not a spad who\u2019s going to tell me what I\u2019m meant to say.\u201d</p> <p>Meet the Rees-Moggs follows him, his wife, Helena de Chair, and their six children \u2013 five sons and one daughter \u2013 in the final few weeks of the Tory administration, as it becomes clear that he is likely to lose his seat, despite a whopping majority of 14,729. One of his sons is bemused by the idea that his father could be unemployed. \u201cI\u2019ve never even heard of anyone losing their job, let alone someone in our family,\u201d he says. His boys look like mini-Moggs. We see the family at home in their Somerset mansion, decked out in bow ties at formal suppers, attending the family chapel for Sunday mass, and playing cricket with their father.</p>    <p>Rees-Mogg himself was a child TV star of sorts. The precocious son of the then Times editor, William Rees-Mogg, was filmed aged 12 for a documentary. He was shown being chauffeur-driven in a Rolls-Royce, suited and booted, attending the annual general meeting of the General Electric Company (GEC), which he already had shares in. He told the cameras that he hoped to be a millionaire by the age of 20, running GEC by 30 and prime minister by 70.

He says he got an email from out of the blue asking if he fancied making a show. \u201cTo be <em>perfectly</em> honest, my first thought was that it was a <em>spooooof</em>. Why would anyone want to do this?\u201d Rees-Mogg has a particular way of speaking \u2013 chewing on each syllable like a toffee, words randomly stretched with relish.</p> <p>So what convinced him to do it? \u201cTo get your message across as a politician you have to be known, and I was quite impressed by the success Nigel Farage had going into the jungle. Now I wouldn\u2019t go into the jungle in a million years. I like my creature comforts too much \u2026 So this in a way is my version of the jungle.\u201d And the Kardashians? \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t go <em>that far</em>! It\u2019s more like At Home With the Furys, in that Mrs Fury comes across wonderfully. Helena is my Mrs Fury and I\u2019m the grumpy one in the background.\u201d You\u2019re Tyson Fury? \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t compare myself to Mr Fury, who has attributes that I couldn\u2019t <em>begin</em> to match up to.\u201d</p> <p>I ask him if there was anything he wouldn\u2019t allow to be shown. \u201cI was very clear from the beginning I wasn\u2019t going to be filmed in a state of undress.\u201d</p> <p>Was he worried about exposing his children? After all, he\u2019s previously said that his oldest son, Peter, 17, received hate mail because he was a Rees-Mogg. \u201cI obviously thought carefully about the children and discussed it with Helena. The basic conclusion is that because our surname is relatively unusual, when people hear their name the children are tarred by my brush, so to speak, and therefore this doesn\u2019t <em>particularly</em> make it any better or any worse.\u201d</p> <p>Did you ask them if they wanted to be part of it? \u201cI did speak to the children. They thought it was quite a good idea and Mary [his teenage daughter] was particularly keen on it.\u201d Why? \u201cShe thought it would be <em>fun</em>! And it has been fun.\u201d</p> <p>Mary is eloquent and uninhibited in front of the cameras, talking about how the mother of a fellow pupil told her daughter that Rees-Mogg hates foreigners. Well, he says, that\u2019s the price they pay for being his progeny. \u201cEven the Rees-Mogg nieces and nephews have people be randomly rude to them because they\u2019re called Rees-Mogg. That\u2019s a little bit unfair. They can\u2019t be held responsible for their uncle. So that is part of public life. And in a way, when it came to doing this, it was <em>too late</em>. That was already the situation, and I didn\u2019t think this would make it any better or any worse.\u201d Maybe. Keir Starmer, whom Rees-Mogg sarcastically refers to as the Reverend, is ferociously protective of his children\u2019s privacy.</p>    <p>What did he say to Mary when she was told that he hates foreigners? \u201cWell, it\u2019s simply not true. I want immigration to be controlled and these are two totally different concepts. I\u2019ve always explained and discussed politics with my children. Probably, I have no other conversation so there\u2019s nothing else I can talk to them about.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s not strictly true when Rees-Mogg says he has no subject but politics. It emerges in the show that he is even more doctrinaire about his Roman Catholicism. I tell him I find it hard to reconcile his religion with his free-market absolutism and obsession with money. As a 12-year-old, he talked about how he loved money just for the sake of it. I quote Matthew 6:24. \u201cYou cannot serve both God and money.\u201d He smiles and throws another quote back at me. \u201cAnd the love of money is also the root of all evil. Yup. But there is <em>also</em>: \u2018Wine maketh merry but money cureth all things.\u2019 The devil can quote scripture. I hadn\u2019t thought about it in those terms, but certainly I would say that faith is more important to me now than it was, and in relation to money that faith is ultimately important and money is just a means to an end in this life.\u201d</p> <p>How does he spend his money? Another smile. \u201cSchool fees! Plus 20% VAT.\u201d</p> <p>Meet the Rees-Moggs repeatedly tells us that he is one of the most divisive politicians in the country. One of his most controversial positions is on abortion, which he has called \u201cmorally indefensible\u201d. His opposition to it even applies for pregnancies as a result of rape or incest. \u201cI accept the teaching of the church,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the point of which life begins, and the question is whether it\u2019s right to take life, and it\u2019s the importance of the <em>second</em> life. There are <em>two</em> lives, not one to be considered.\u201d He is also vehemently opposed to gay marriage. When asked about it previously, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/06/jacob-rees-mogg-opposed-to-gay-marriage-and-abortion-even-after\">he said</a>: \u201cI take the teaching of the Catholic church seriously. Marriage is a sacrament and the view of what marriage is is taken by the church, not parliament.\u201d Another Roman Catholic view is that sex should wait until after marriage. Can I ask a personal question, I say? \u201cYou can ask any question \u2013 I may not answer it!\u2019</p> <p>Well, I say, I\u2019ve been thinking about the fundamentalism of your Catholicism and how deep it goes. I wonder if you were a virgin when you married?</p> <p>His voice rises. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go into <em>personal</em> details of that kind.\u201d</p>    <p>I\u2019m asking, I say, because we\u2019re talking about the core tenets of Catholicism and how they impact your political views. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hold myself up as somebody of utter moral rectitude,\u201d he says. \u201cBut such sins as I have committed are a matter between me and my father confessor.\u201d</p> <p>Is he opposed to contraception? \u201cI, I, I, certainly,\u201d he stammers bashfully.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s move on from there,\u201d Poppy says.</p> <p>I think it\u2019s an important question, I say.</p> <p>Poppy gives me a look. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make him feel uncomfortable,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Now he comes to my defence. \u201c<em>Nononono</em>, you\u2019re free to ask questions. The teaching of the church is set out in Humanae Vitae, the encyclical of Pope Paul VI. And I accept the church\u2019s teaching on contraception. But I don\u2019t think this is a matter for legislation. This is a matter of private morality rather than public morality.\u201d</p> <p>We change the subject. You pride yourself on your truthfulness, I say. \u201cWell, I certainly try.\u201d And truth is obviously an important tenet in any religion. He nods. How do you accommodate that with the fact that two of your favourite contemporary politicians, Trump and Johnson, are known as liars? \u201cOK. Donald Trump says things that are obviously inaccurate.\u201d That\u2019s a kind word for it, I say. \u201cI use the word deliberately,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anybody <em>thinks</em> they are accurate when he says them. And I think that\u2019s important.\u201d</p> <p>Ideologically, he and Trump have a lot in common. Do you see anything of him in you? \u201c<em>Nononoono</em>, other than we\u2019ve both been called Nazis by David Lammy. I think that\u2019s the one point we have in common. I was actually called worse than a Nazi.\u201d This was in 2019, after Rees-Mogg tweeted a video of a speech by a senior member of Germany\u2019s far-right AfD party.</p> <p>And Johnson? \u201cBoris in my opinion is a truthful man. He inevitably says things that are spun. All politicians do that. Even I do that. You want to put your policy and views in the best possible light. But if you take the Partygate thing, Boris told the truth. I think the whole Partygate thing is <em>ridiculous</em>. I don\u2019t think Boris lied or misled the House of Commons.\u201d The 2023 report by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/15/partygate-report-key-findings-of-commons-privileges-committee-boris-johnson\">privileges committee</a> found that Johnson deliberately misled parliament over Partygate and was part of a campaign to abuse and intimidate MPs investigating him.</p> <p>Have any of his children rebelled against his beliefs? \u201cAre they broadly sympathetic to Conservatism and Catholicism at the moment? Yes, they are.\u201d Would it bother him if they weren\u2019t? \u201cI\u2019d be happier if they changed politics than they changed religion. Religion is fundamentally more important. I would be more concerned about that.\u201d</p> <p>In the show, Rees-Mogg says that, after the general election defeat, it\u2019s time to reflect and people won\u2019t want to hear from the Tories for a while. But now he\u2019s more positive, not least because of Trump\u2019s victory in the US. \u201cIt\u2019s <em>very</em> important,\u201d he says. Why? \u201cBecause he is challenging the liberal orthodoxy. He\u2019s challenging it on net zero, which is <em>tremendously</em> important.\u201d Rees-Mogg believes that Britain\u2019s net zero aspirations are destroying the economy.</p> <p>He\u2019s even got a kind word for the new Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch. \u201cI think Kemi\u2019s <em>very</em> impressive.\u201d Would he like to see Farage\u2019s Reform and the Tories join forces? \u201cIt\u2019s very early days, but the Conservative party and Reform need to come to an accommodation. Nigel is a <em>phenomenal</em> politician. He manages to pick up issues that other people aren\u2019t looking at, and he connects with voters, but I don\u2019t think Nigel can win on his own.\u201d</p>    <p>Does he envy Farage\u2019s qualities?\u201d He throws his head back. \u201cHa! Envy is one of the seven deadly sins. No! But I admire the qualities Nigel has.\u201d As for Johnson, of course, he\u2019s not ruling out another comeback.</p> <p>But, he says, he\u2019s given up on his own dream of leading the country. \u201cAs a 12-year-old, one says all sorts of things that no longer apply. I\u2019m not going to be the prime minister, I\u2019m not even in parliament.\u201d Would he like to return? \u201cYes, I love being involved in politics.\u201d And does he think Meet the Rees-Moggs could be a good platform for his return? \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely right. But it\u2019s a risk.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if he\u2019s learned anything about himself from making the show. \u201cThat\u2019s a difficult question,\u201d he says. He thinks and thinks. Nothing comes to mind. Has he seen himself in a different light? \u201cNot really, no.\u201d And then an epiphany. \u201cPerhaps one exception actually. When Sara, who helps out in the house, says the first time she saw me she didn\u2019t know what to say, or something like that \u2026\u201d She said she was terrified of you, I offer. \u201cThat\u2019s right, <em>that\u2019s right</em>. And that surprises me greatly because I must confess I do not consider myself as a <em>particularly</em> terrifying person.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Meet the Rees-Moggs streams on discovery+ from 2 December</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s townhouse is a stone\u2019s throw from the Houses of Parliament. The family nanny, Veronica Crook, greets me with a smile. Crook was Rees-Mogg\u2019s nanny from the day he was born and is now nanny to him and his six children. There is a huge, handsome portrait of her next to the kitchen. In the large room opposite, huge handsome portraits of family members and historical figures hang on the walls. It wouldn\u2019t take long to work out who lives here if you were playing Through the Keyhole. The loo is plastered with newspaper cartoons about the former Conservative MP and minister, riffing on his scorn for civil servants, lockdown regulations and the EU. Then there are the cartoons celebrating his image as Mr Nasty: Rees-Mogg as a bespectacled cat saying: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly\u201d while his left front paw pins down a petrified mouse; with a baby Boris Johnson in his arms, as a spitting Theresa May says: \u201cYour daddy is a horrible person!\u201d Rees-Mogg, 55, is famous for floccinaucinihilipilification \u2013 a word he introduced into parliamentary debate in 2012, meaning the act of considering something to be worthless. With Crook\u2019s blessing, I head up the stairs to a large living room. Rees-Mogg enters \u2013 6ft 2in, paper thin, owlish, with the air of a buoyant undertaker. As always, he is immaculately dressed: a perfectly pressed double-breasted suit, striped shirt, polka-dot tie. \u201cThank you for coming round. It\u2019s rather chilly in here,\u201d he says apologetically. Rees-Mogg is supremely polite in an old-fashioned way. He was known by some in parliament as the \u201chonourable member for the 18th century\u201d. But for all the politeness, at times he comes across as an unmannerly schoolboy. When he slouched across the frontbench as if bored senseless in a vital 2019 Brexit debate, the then Green MP Caroline Lucas accused him of showing contempt for parliament. Rees-Mogg lost his seat in July when his party was routed in the general election after 14 years in power. Now, he presents State of the Nation, a politics programme on GB News four nights a week. Perhaps more surprisingly, he and his family are starring in a five-part reality show, Meet the Rees-Moggs. As he sits down, so does the show\u2019s publicist. I ask if she intends to stay for the whole interview. \u201cYes, it\u2019s policy,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m just going to be listening in.\u201d It\u2019s funny that this intrepid champion of free speech is being chaperoned through our talk, not least when the nanny is downstairs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he laughs. \u201cPoppy\u2019s not a spad who\u2019s going to tell me what I\u2019m meant to say.\u201d Meet the Rees-Moggs follows him, his wife, Helena de Chair, and their six children \u2013 five sons and one daughter \u2013 in the final few weeks of the Tory administration, as it becomes clear that he is likely to lose his seat, despite a whopping majority of 14,729. One of his sons is bemused by the idea that his father could be unemployed. \u201cI\u2019ve never even heard of anyone losing their job, let alone someone in our family,\u201d he says. His boys look like mini-Moggs. We see the family at home in their Somerset mansion, decked out in bow ties at formal suppers, attending the family chapel for Sunday mass, and playing cricket with their father. Rees-Mogg himself was a child TV star of sorts. The precocious son of the then Times editor, William Rees-Mogg, was filmed aged 12 for a documentary. He was shown being chauffeur-driven in a Rolls-Royce, suited and booted, attending the annual general meeting of the General Electric Company (GEC), which he already had shares in. He told the cameras that he hoped to be a millionaire by the age of 20, running GEC by 30 and prime minister by 70. He said he didn\u2019t expect to get married because he had seen too many money-grubbing wives divorce their husbands and end up with half their money. When introducing de Chair at the start of each episode, a caption explains that she is heiress to a \u00a345m fortune. To be fair, Rees-Mogg is also worth tens of millions thanks to the hedge fund business he co-founded, Somerset Capital Management (SCM). The couple\u2019s wealth was estimated at \u201cwell over \u00a3100m\u201d by Spear\u2019s magazine in 2019, though profits halved at SCM in the year before it was wound down in 2023. Reality TV has boosted the careers of some of the politicians he most admires \u2013 notably Donald Trump on The Apprentice and Nigel Farage on I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here! How did Meet the Rees-Moggs come about? He says he got an email from out of the blue asking if he fancied making a show. \u201cTo be perfectly honest, my first thought was that it was a spooooof. Why would anyone want to do this?\u201d Rees-Mogg has a particular way of speaking \u2013 chewing on each syllable like a toffee, words randomly stretched with relish. So what convinced him to do it? \u201cTo get your message across as a politician you have to be known, and I was quite impressed by the success Nigel Farage had going into the jungle. Now I wouldn\u2019t go into the jungle in a million years. I like my creature comforts too much \u2026 So this in a way is my version of the jungle.\u201d And the Kardashians? \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t go that far!

I think it\u2019s an important question, I say. Poppy gives me a look. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make him feel uncomfortable,\u201d she says. Now he comes to my defence. \u201cNononono, you\u2019re free to ask questions. The teaching of the church is set out in Humanae Vitae, the encyclical of Pope Paul VI.

I was actually called worse than a Nazi.\u201d This was in 2019, after Rees-Mogg tweeted a video of a speech by a senior member of Germany\u2019s far-right AfD party. And Johnson? \u201cBoris in my opinion is a truthful man. He inevitably says things that are spun. All politicians do that. Even I do that. You want to put your policy and views in the best possible light. But if you take the Partygate thing, Boris told the truth. I think the whole Partygate thing is ridiculous. I don\u2019t think Boris lied or misled the House of Commons.\u201d The 2023 report by the privileges committee found that Johnson deliberately misled parliament over Partygate and was part of a campaign to abuse and intimidate MPs investigating him. Have any of his children rebelled against his beliefs? \u201cAre they broadly sympathetic to Conservatism and Catholicism at the moment? Yes, they are.\u201d Would it bother him if they weren\u2019t? \u201cI\u2019d be happier if they changed politics than they changed religion. Religion is fundamentally more important.

But now he\u2019s more positive, not least because of Trump\u2019s victory in the US. \u201cIt\u2019s very important,\u201d he says. Why? \u201cBecause he is challenging the liberal orthodoxy. He\u2019s challenging it on net zero, which is tremendously important.\u201d Rees-Mogg believes that Britain\u2019s net zero aspirations are destroying the economy. He\u2019s even got a kind word for the new Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch. \u201cI think Kemi\u2019s very impressive.\u201d Would he like to see Farage\u2019s Reform and the Tories join forces? \u201cIt\u2019s very early days, but the Conservative party and Reform need to come to an accommodation. Nigel is a phenomenal politician. He manages to pick up issues that other people aren\u2019t looking at, and he connects with voters, but I don\u2019t think Nigel can win on his own.\u201d Does he envy Farage\u2019s qualities?\u201d He throws his head back. \u201cHa! Envy is one of the seven deadly sins. No! But I admire the qualities Nigel has.\u201d As for Johnson, of course, he\u2019s not ruling out another comeback. But, he says, he\u2019s given up on his own dream of leading the country. \u201cAs a 12-year-old, one says all sorts of things that no longer apply. I\u2019m not going to be the prime minister, I\u2019m not even in parliament.\u201d Would he like to return? \u201cYes, I love being involved in politics.\u201d And does he think Meet the Rees-Moggs could be a good platform for his return? \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely right. But it\u2019s a risk.\u201d I ask if he\u2019s learned anything about himself from making the show. \u201cThat\u2019s a difficult question,\u201d he says. He thinks and thinks. Nothing comes to mind. Has he seen himself in a different light? \u201cNot really, no.\u201d And then an epiphany. \u201cPerhaps one exception actually. When Sara, who helps out in the house, says the first time she saw me she didn\u2019t know what to say, or something like that \u2026\u201d She said she was terrified of you, I offer. \u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. And that surprises me greatly because I must confess I do not consider myself as a particularly terrifying person.\u201d \u2022 Meet the Rees-Moggs streams on discovery+ from 2 December",

      "bodyText": "Women\u2019s rights campaigners have spoken of their concern over the spread of female genital mutilation among Sudanese refugees in camps across the border in Chad. Both countries have outlawed the practice but it continues in secret. The UN children\u2019s agency, Unicef, says that about 87% of Sudanese women aged 14-49 have been cut \u2013 one of the highest rates in the world. In Chad, the figure is 34.1%, though rates are higher in the south and east, which is where the camps for Sudanese people have been set up. On a recent visit to the main refugee camp in Adr\u00e9, which lies very close to the Sudanese border, the Guardian met three girls aged nine, seven and three who were being prepared by their family to be cut. The family was putting henna tattoos on the girls\u2019 feet and fingers \u2013 a traditional way of \u201ccelebrating\u201d the FGM procedure. A social worker at the camp said the cutting itself was taking place in secret because it contravened Chadian laws. She added that as well as children, married women were being subjected to another form of FGM after giving birth. The procedure, known as adal, which means \u201cfixing it\u201d, is common in Sudan. FGM, otherwise known as female genital cutting (FGC), is a procedure in which female genitals are cut, injured or changed in some way. There is no medical basis to the practice, which can seriously harm the health of women and girls, on top of being very painful. It is often carried out with inadequate equipment, in inappropriate places, by people with no medical qualifications. Chad has hosted refugees fleeing conflict in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan for decades, but the number of arrivals has increased dramatically since war broke out in April 2023 between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Before FGM was made illegal in Sudan in 2020, Sudanese refugees in Chad would return to their home country to cut their daughters then head back across the border to the camps, a staff member of UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said. Houida Ibrahim, the head of Mercy Shadows, an NGO working among the refugees in Chad, said women and girls usually paid the highest price when there were outbreaks of violence. \u201cWhole communities become more violent [during wars] and little girls are often the first victims,\u201d she said. Ibrahim, who used to work at a number of women\u2019s rights organisations in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, said there had been a number of cutting instances in the camp block where she was working. Another international aid worker who wished to remain anonymous said curbing FGM in Chad was very difficult because many communities held deep-rooted beliefs that it was an essential part of a girl\u2019s life. \u201cIt\u2019s legally banned but people still do it secretly,\u201d the aid worker said. \u201cWe see many cases of FGM in women when they arrive at hospitals for unrelated health issues.

      "bodyText": "When the Taliban began a sweeping redevelopment drive in Kabul soon after returning to power three years ago, they claimed there was a need to modernise Afghanistan\u2019s historic capital. A new investigation, however, reveals that the Taliban\u2019s regeneration programme has left thousands of people homeless and had a brutal impact on the most vulnerable communities, with claims of properties being demolished with children still inside. Using satellite imagery, social media footage and testimony from Afghan residents, the findings offer a first comprehensive insight into the Taliban\u2019s ambitious redevelopment of Kabul \u2013 but also its true cost. Satellite analysis indicates that 1.56 sq km (385 acres) of the city \u2013 the equivalent of more than 220 football pitches \u2013 was flattened within the city between August 2021 and August 2024. The investigation, a collaboration between the Guardian, the Centre for Information Resilience\u2019s Afghan Witness project, Lighthouse Reports and the Afghan news outlets Zan Times and Etilaat Roz also uncovered signs that the destruction is in part linked to ethnicity. The satellite analysis, carried out by Afghan Witness, showed that of the six most-affected districts \u2013 where at least 50,000 sq metres (12 acres) of residential properties were demolished \u2013 three were areas populated by the minority Hazara community and two were populated by the minority Tajiks. Most affected was Kabul\u2019s District 13, a predominantly Hazara area. The investigation also analysed the large-scale razing of \u201cinformal settlements\u201d. In some cases, the destruction of the sprawling slums, which are typically inhabited by poorer communities displaced by conflict or climate change \u2013 have been conducted so brutally that residents reported injuries and deaths. In at least two settlements, residents allege that homes were demolished with people still inside. In one large slum \u2013 in Kabul\u2019s District 22 \u2013 evicted families alleged that a four-year-old and a 15-year-old died during its demolition. \u201cWomen, children and elderly men were begging for them to stop the destruction until we can find a shelter, but they wouldn\u2019t listen,\u201d said a resident, who had spent a decade in the settlement after being displaced from Pakistan. He claimed in the aftermath of the demolition his young niece also died from lack of shelter after their home was destroyed during the heat of summer. Residents who attempted to film such demolitions were reportedly beaten. In another significant destruction of an informal settlement in the north of the city, the Taliban\u2019s administration in Kabul tweeted a series of photos in August 2024 chronicling bulldozers razing structures. Residents described scenes of mayhem and desperation as the site was demolished. \u201cIt was like the earthquake in Herat [which killed thousands last year]. Houses were buried; all our belongings were also buried,\u201d said one resident. Others testified that homes were demolished with people inside. \u201cMy nephew came by, crying that his mother and brother were inside the house and the loader was demolishing it,\u201d said one. Jalaluddin, who lived in the settlement with nearly 50 family members for two decades, said he could not afford to rent a new home and was now living in an abandoned factory. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have tents \u2013 we just have shelters made from plastic pieces. Some days we don\u2019t have anything to eat. We sleep with an empty stomach,\u201d he said. Many of the land-clearance projects in residential areas are for building or widening roads. Fakhrullah Sarwari, an urban planner who worked with the former Afghan government, said: \u201cMost of these plans were part of previous government plans, but they were unable to be implemented because they couldn\u2019t force people to evacuate the area. \u201cWe do need better mobility, but with the majority of the population living below the poverty line, demolishing homes to build wider roads doesn\u2019t address underlying issues,\u201d he said. Human rights groups say women are particularly vulnerable after eviction, warning it can increase gender-based violence. One woman, interviewed by Zan Times, reveals the difficulties of female-led households. Offering cleaning services door to door, she earns between one and three dollars a day and has struggled to get compensation from the Taliban after they demolished her home in a residential area in north Kabul. One reason is that she is not allowed into Kabul\u2019s municipal offices without a male guardian to accompany her, under the Taliban\u2019s rules of segregation. Another woman who lost her home in the same area can no longer work due to Taliban restrictions. Denied compensation, her family must rely solely on her husband\u2019s modest income repairing shoes. Of a dozen people evicted who were interviewed for the investigation, only one had found permanent accommodation since their eviction. Residents say fear prevents them from protesting at the destruction of their homes. The demolitions come months after the UN warned that Afghanistan\u2019s economy had \u201cbasically collapsed\u201d with rampant food insecurity and 6.3 million people displaced within the country. One woman, whose family home of 40 years was demolished in August 2023, said: \u201cAt first, they told us that they would compensate us and not leave us homeless, but once the houses were demolished, nobody cared about us.\u201d Her family stopped travelling to the municipal offices to ask for their compensation when they could no longer afford the bus fare. The Taliban authorities have not commented on the findings. They have previously justified the demolition of informal settlements as reclaiming stolen land acquired by \u201copportunists and usurpers\u201d. They also state that residential land is often cleared for infrastructure projects. * Additional reporting by Sabrina Slipchenko, Elyas Nawandish and Kreshma Fakhri",

      "body": "<h2>David Hoffman: \u2018It was the riot that pushed Thatcher out\u2019</h2> <p>This image is written in my bones somehow. There had been four quite vigorous poll tax marches before this one, and heavy clashes with police, so it seemed likely there would be trouble. But it wasn\u2019t until I was walking up Whitehall when, for no reason, a riot policeman ran straight at me and hit me in the throat with his shield that I knew this would be rough. To my amazement I was OK and I\u2019d kept the cameras out of the way also.</p> <p>The crowds became packed, and it turned into a washing machine of people and police. The police were charging and people were throwing things \u2013 a scaffold clamp thrown from the roof of the grand buildings hit my leg, ripping a hole in my trousers and my shin. There\u2019s often a spirit of joy at a protest. It\u2019s a place where social pressures are released and restraints are removed \u2013 which is why some people behave so badly and do things that are out of character. It\u2019s dangerous and beautiful.</p> <p>I\u2019d been taking photos of the burning buildings but they weren\u2019t very interesting, then I saw Laurence and Nidge kissing. It needed to have the burning buildings behind them \u2013 I shot five or six frames quickly and moved on. Later Nidge\u2019s solicitor used it to successfully throw out the police charge against him.</p> <p>I do think that riot was the one that pushed Thatcher out. Pictures change and mean different things as the decades soak into them. But this photograph doesn\u2019t say anything about the nature of the state, of how we relate to each other under those circumstances, about the underclass life Laurence and Nidge, who have both now passed away, were forced into. For me, it certainly brings back feelings of being young and fit and quick on my feet, as I sit here, aged 78.</p> <p>It\u2019s impossible to have that sort of demonstration now \u2013 one of real strength and energy. It\u2019s a massive loss to society. <em><strong>Charlotte Jansen</strong></em></p> <h2>Tom Wood: \u2018Someone at the club wrote a song about me\u2019</h2>    <p>My wife and I moved to a flat above New Brighton Promenade, in Wallasey on Merseyside, in 1978. We met a guy called Fid, who often held parties at the Chelsea Reach, a nightclub further down the prom. At these parties you\u2019d have to buy beer from the pub disco downstairs, where there\u2019d be crowds of people and I\u2019d think: \u201cWow, if I could photograph this!\u201d But I was too shy.</p> <p>Because of Fid, I was able to get into the Chelsea for free and was introduced to the manager, Paul Chase, who was always supportive. It was noisy, smoky, people were often very drunk and it could be difficult to explain what I was doing with my camera. But between 84 and 86, I was often there two or three nights a week, and gradually gained this unwritten consent.</p> <p>It was really dark and details wouldn\u2019t become apparent until my flash lit everything up. I shot in infrared for a while, so no one saw the flash, but it felt like cheating. I was forever being asked to take pictures, and would make prints to hand out. Years later, a singer-songwriter called Steve Roberts saw himself in one of the photographs at Tate Liverpool and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6_kmsL4_GU\">wrote a song</a> about it called Over Here Photie Man!</p> <p>I\u2019ve met so many people from these pictures at events and exhibition openings. Sometimes I learn that people I\u2019ve photographed are no longer with us, and one of those is Vernon, who we see here with two sisters from Wallasey. Vernon was part of a group, of girls as well as boys, who would come across from Liverpool in a van on the Monday night, when it was free to get in. He and his friend Dave were in so many of my pictures I could have made a book just of them. As the picture suggests, he didn\u2019t get lucky that night. <em><strong>Chris Broughton</strong></em></p> <h2>Syd Shelton: \u2018He was getting close to hitting me\u2019</h2>    <p>I found these two at a shop called The Last Resort, on the edge of Petticoat Lane. The sociologist Dick Hebdige was doing a piece about skinheads for New Socialist magazine and wanted me to take some photographs for it. I knew that\u2019s where skins went to buy their gear. I\u2019d already chosen the corrugated iron wall with all the crap underneath it, which I thought would make the perfect backdrop, and we were talking as we headed over there. As soon as the pair heard the word \u201csocialist\u201d they started to become quite combative.</p> <p>I\u2019m not the sort of photographer who pretends to be something different, and so as I was shooting we continued to argue and it got quite tense. Making what I call \u201creal\u201d portraits, these sort of studio photographs done outside, is extremely difficult. I\u2019m looking for the point when a trust develops, even in hostile situations, and the person I\u2019m photographing is no longer self-consciously setting up a pose. By the last couple of shots, the guy in the Crombie, Kevin, was starting to clench his fist. I knew he was getting close to hitting me, so I went, \u201cThanks very much,\u201d and legged it as fast as I could.</p> <p>Three or four years ago, I got an email from Lee Daly \u2013 the guy on the right in the Fred Perry shirt and braces. He described his younger self as \u201ca victim of the insidious extreme rightwing propaganda of the times\u201d and \u201ca rebel without a clue\u201d. Within two years, he\u2019d become a highly politicised socialist and anti-apartheid activist, and had joined the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/15/anti-nazi-league-founders-call-for-new-national-campaign\">Anti-Nazi League</a>. I was astonished and flattered that he remembered that day as clearly as I did and had the courage to send me this incredible confessional message. He\u2019s stayed in touch with Kevin, who\u2019s now a cuddly grandad, according to Lee. <em><strong>CB</strong></em></p> <h2>Brenda Prince: \u2018I used my elbows to get to the front\u2019</h2>    <p>This photograph was taken during a march on parliament to repeal the anti-gay laws in 1992. I joined Format Photographers in 1983, <a href=\"https://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/collections/format-photographers-agency#:~:text=Established%20in%201983(2)%2C,Raissa%20Page%20and%20Val%20Wilmer\">the first all-women photographic agency</a>, and this protest is something we would have covered. As usual, there were several of us there. As a lesbian and a feminist, I would have supported this protest anyway. I remember those demos were quite exciting \u2013 at that one, everyone lay down on Charing Cross Road, police everywhere, but at this point, everyone was on their feet. As a short woman \u2013 I\u2019m 5ft 3 \u2013 I used my elbows to get to the front of the press pack. I recognised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/27/olivia-laing-derek-jarman-modern-nature\">Derek Jarman</a> immediately. It\u2019s not a bad shot of him.</p> <p>I came to photography through my politics. From the age of 18, I was very interested in documenting issues and challenging stereotypes. I didn\u2019t like the way women\u2019s bodies were used \u2013 and are still \u2013 selling things like cars: pictures of women sitting half-naked on car bonnets enraged me. At the beginning of my career, I naively thought my photographs might help to change the way people think about and look at women, and I do believe the images we produced at Format skewered the prevailing images of the time. When we\u2019d get a request at Format for an image of an engineer or plumber, we\u2019d send a picture of a woman engineer or plumber \u2013 we had plenty of those.</p> <p>I hung up my cameras in my 50s and the agency closed in 2003. But we feel we\u2019re being rediscovered now. Some of our photographers put their work into the Format archives, which are now housed at the <a href=\"https://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/collections/format-photographers-agency\">Bishopsgate Institute</a> in London. As women photographers, I do believe we have a different view of the world, and I hope we have contributed in a small way to changing attitudes. When Format started, most of the women had the experience of not being taken seriously and getting work. They were fed up with the assumption that all photographers were men. So, it was a great place to be. And in a way, Format Photographers itself was a form of protest. <em><strong>CJ</strong></em></p> <h2>John Davies: \u2018At the top, I found a homage to Duran Duran\u2019</h2>    <p>In the early 80s I became interested in the enormous role industry has played in shaping the British landscape. When I visited Rhymney, in south Wales, for <a href=\"https://www.ffotogallery.org/thevalleysproject\">the Valleys Project</a>, I was looking at the remains of the coal-mining industry, which had been massive in Wales at the beginning of the century. I made this picture during the miners\u2019 strike, when nearby Penallta colliery was one of only two working coal mines remaining in the area: it survived the strike, but closed in 1991. As well as striking miners, I photographed workers in the new industries that had sprung up in endless anonymous sheds like the ones you see here.</p> <p>In order to map out the landscape and see its elements in context with one another, I would pursue high vantage points and I climbed this rock outcrop to photograph the valley beneath and the railway line that once moved the coal to Cardiff. The outcrop is about 20 metres high. On one side it\u2019s a slope, on the other there\u2019s a sheer drop.</p> <p>When I reached the top I discovered this graffiti and was quite impressed \u2013 because it\u2019s not an easy climb. I assume a young woman had carried a brush and a can of brilliant white gloss up there, and painted \u201cDuran Duran\u201d \u2013 in homage to the gods, like people inscribe a tree with a heart and the name of their lover. The name painted nearby suggests she was called Kate.</p> <p>Duran Duran made spectacular videos at the time that had a visual impact, and this, too, seemed quite a statement in this relatively isolated place, hidden in an industrial area. If it wasn\u2019t for the graffiti, I would just have made a picture of the view. Instead, I found this surprising conflict between the natural and the modern cultural life of the time. <em><strong>CB</strong></em></p> <h2>Joy Gregory: \u2018Back then, people of colour couldn\u2019t be framed as beautiful\u2019</h2>    <p>I grew up in a world where people of colour were not represented in a positive way \u2013 definitely not in beauty or fashion magazines. Where they did appear, there had to be a back story of exoticism; they couldn\u2019t just be, there had to be a reason to be a spectacle. You couldn\u2019t be framed as beautiful \u2013 you didn\u2019t belong in that world.</p> <p>When I made Autoportrait I saw the images as acting out an aspect of myself, though I didn\u2019t look like myself in real life. This idea of putting the Black body into that context of fashion and beauty became an obsession of mine for many years \u2013 I was obsessed with magazines. One of the greatest days of my life was going for an interview at Cond\u00e9 Nast, and being offered a job in their darkroom. But by the time I got home, they had withdrawn my offer. The men who worked in the darkroom were mortified at having a young girl working with them.</p> <p>I had never thought of doing pictures of myself but people didn\u2019t turn up to be models, so I ended up using myself. This was the first time I designed it as well. I didn\u2019t think of myself as beautiful \u2013 no one that age does \u2013 but it was an opportunity to inhabit that space. I had Polaroids and one roll of 120 film. I was shooting on a Hasselblad, and I didn\u2019t have much money at the time so I had to get it completely right.</p> <p>The printing process was an important part of the work and a way to talk about skin hue. I used <a href=\"https://www.alternativephotography.com/the-lithprint-process/\">lith printing</a> but I did it my own way: I worked with a weak solution of developer and processed it in the dark for 30 minutes \u2013 only at the last minute did I put the light on. The making of each print was very performative and dependent on chance, but also a lot of trying over and over again.</p> <p>I think people were quite surprised by them when I first showed them. The only negative reaction was mine \u2013 I was mortified at being in the exhibition with all these giant pictures of my head on the wall, so I sat outside! But I don\u2019t mind being in the room with them now. They\u2019re not me, they\u2019re someone else. <em><strong>CJ</strong></em></p> <h2>Anna Fox: \u2018They drank fizz then went out for breakfast\u2019</h2>    <p>We\u2019re looking at a sales team from Rank Xerox having breakfast in 1988. They\u2019re celebrating the end of the sales year, they\u2019d had some champagne in the office and then piled down to the nearest cafe for breakfast. I\u2019m sitting at the end of the table, probably having a bit of toast, with my medium-format camera and my portable flash. This guy was quite pushy and I was constantly half-arguing and joking with him. I could only get this kind of intimate shot because I had been hanging out with them for quite a period of time. When I gave him a copy of the image, he was very proud of it and put it on his desk.</p> <p>This image was part of a commission, Work Stations, a study of life in 40 offices in London. It\u2019s not a conventional documentary project in any respect \u2013 photographing offices then was seen as a banal thing to do, and there\u2019s an overdramatic, fictional feel. The pictures look staged, but they\u2019re not \u2013 though of course when there\u2019s a photographer around, people are always performing to some extent.</p> <p>Before I became a photographer, I worked in an office, for an insurance company. My whole family worked in offices. Offices were spaces I knew quite well, but this was an opportunity to look at things from an analytical distance.

      "bodyText": "David Hoffman: \u2018It was the riot that pushed Thatcher out\u2019 This image is written in my bones somehow. There had been four quite vigorous poll tax marches before this one, and heavy clashes with police, so it seemed likely there would be trouble. But it wasn\u2019t until I was walking up Whitehall when, for no reason, a riot policeman ran straight at me and hit me in the throat with his shield that I knew this would be rough. To my amazement I was OK and I\u2019d kept the cameras out of the way also. The crowds became packed, and it turned into a washing machine of people and police. The police were charging and people were throwing things \u2013 a scaffold clamp thrown from the roof of the grand buildings hit my leg, ripping a hole in my trousers and my shin. There\u2019s often a spirit of joy at a protest. It\u2019s a place where social pressures are released and restraints are removed \u2013 which is why some people behave so badly and do things that are out of character. It\u2019s dangerous and beautiful. I\u2019d been taking photos of the burning buildings but they weren\u2019t very interesting, then I saw Laurence and Nidge kissing. It needed to have the burning buildings behind them \u2013 I shot five or six frames quickly and moved on. Later Nidge\u2019s solicitor used it to successfully throw out the police charge against him. I do think that riot was the one that pushed Thatcher out. Pictures change and mean different things as the decades soak into them. But this photograph doesn\u2019t say anything about the nature of the state, of how we relate to each other under those circumstances, about the underclass life Laurence and Nidge, who have both now passed away, were forced into. For me, it certainly brings back feelings of being young and fit and quick on my feet, as I sit here, aged 78. It\u2019s impossible to have that sort of demonstration now \u2013 one of real strength and energy. It\u2019s a massive loss to society. Charlotte Jansen Tom Wood: \u2018Someone at the club wrote a song about me\u2019 My wife and I moved to a flat above New Brighton Promenade, in Wallasey on Merseyside, in 1978. We met a guy called Fid, who often held parties at the Chelsea Reach, a nightclub further down the prom. At these parties you\u2019d have to buy beer from the pub disco downstairs, where there\u2019d be crowds of people and I\u2019d think: \u201cWow, if I could photograph this!\u201d But I was too shy. Because of Fid, I was able to get into the Chelsea for free and was introduced to the manager, Paul Chase, who was always supportive. It was noisy, smoky, people were often very drunk and it could be difficult to explain what I was doing with my camera. But between 84 and 86, I was often there two or three nights a week, and gradually gained this unwritten consent. It was really dark and details wouldn\u2019t become apparent until my flash lit everything up. I shot in infrared for a while, so no one saw the flash, but it felt like cheating. I was forever being asked to take pictures, and would make prints to hand out. Years later, a singer-songwriter called Steve Roberts saw himself in one of the photographs at Tate Liverpool and wrote a song about it called Over Here Photie Man! I\u2019ve met so many people from these pictures at events and exhibition openings. Sometimes I learn that people I\u2019ve photographed are no longer with us, and one of those is Vernon, who we see here with two sisters from Wallasey. Vernon was part of a group, of girls as well as boys, who would come across from Liverpool in a van on the Monday night, when it was free to get in. He and his friend Dave were in so many of my pictures I could have made a book just of them. As the picture suggests, he didn\u2019t get lucky that night. Chris Broughton Syd Shelton: \u2018He was getting close to hitting me\u2019 I found these two at a shop called The Last Resort, on the edge of Petticoat Lane. The sociologist Dick Hebdige was doing a piece about skinheads for New Socialist magazine and wanted me to take some photographs for it. I knew that\u2019s where skins went to buy their gear. I\u2019d already chosen the corrugated iron wall with all the crap underneath it, which I thought would make the perfect backdrop, and we were talking as we headed over there. As soon as the pair heard the word \u201csocialist\u201d they started to become quite combative. I\u2019m not the sort of photographer who pretends to be something different, and so as I was shooting we continued to argue and it got quite tense. Making what I call \u201creal\u201d portraits, these sort of studio photographs done outside, is extremely difficult. I\u2019m looking for the point when a trust develops, even in hostile situations, and the person I\u2019m photographing is no longer self-consciously setting up a pose. By the last couple of shots, the guy in the Crombie, Kevin, was starting to clench his fist. I knew he was getting close to hitting me, so I went, \u201cThanks very much,\u201d and legged it as fast as I could. Three or four years ago, I got an email from Lee Daly \u2013 the guy on the right in the Fred Perry shirt and braces. He described his younger self as \u201ca victim of the insidious extreme rightwing propaganda of the times\u201d and \u201ca rebel without a clue\u201d. Within two years, he\u2019d become a highly politicised socialist and anti-apartheid activist, and had joined the Anti-Nazi League. I was astonished and flattered that he remembered that day as clearly as I did and had the courage to send me this incredible confessional message. He\u2019s stayed in touch with Kevin, who\u2019s now a cuddly grandad, according to Lee. CB Brenda Prince: \u2018I used my elbows to get to the front\u2019 This photograph was taken during a march on parliament to repeal the anti-gay laws in 1992. I joined Format Photographers in 1983, the first all-women photographic agency, and this protest is something we would have covered. As usual, there were several of us there. As a lesbian and a feminist, I would have supported this protest anyway. I remember those demos were quite exciting \u2013 at that one, everyone lay down on Charing Cross Road, police everywhere, but at this point, everyone was on their feet. As a short woman \u2013 I\u2019m 5ft 3 \u2013 I used my elbows to get to the front of the press pack. I recognised Derek Jarman immediately. It\u2019s not a bad shot of him. I came to photography through my politics. From the age of 18, I was very interested in documenting issues and challenging stereotypes. I didn\u2019t like the way women\u2019s bodies were used \u2013 and are still \u2013 selling things like cars: pictures of women sitting half-naked on car bonnets enraged me. At the beginning of my career, I naively thought my photographs might help to change the way people think about and look at women, and I do believe the images we produced at Format skewered the prevailing images of the time. When we\u2019d get a request at Format for an image of an engineer or plumber, we\u2019d send a picture of a woman engineer or plumber \u2013 we had plenty of those. I hung up my cameras in my 50s and the agency closed in 2003. But we feel we\u2019re being rediscovered now. Some of our photographers put their work into the Format archives, which are now housed at the Bishopsgate Institute in London. As women photographers, I do believe we have a different view of the world, and I hope we have contributed in a small way to changing attitudes. When Format started, most of the women had the experience of not being taken seriously and getting work. They were fed up with the assumption that all photographers were men. So, it was a great place to be. And in a way, Format Photographers itself was a form of protest. CJ John Davies: \u2018At the top, I found a homage to Duran Duran\u2019 In the early 80s I became interested in the enormous role industry has played in shaping the British landscape. When I visited Rhymney, in south Wales, for the Valleys Project, I was looking at the remains of the coal-mining industry, which had been massive in Wales at the beginning of the century. I made this picture during the miners\u2019 strike, when nearby Penallta colliery was one of only two working coal mines remaining in the area: it survived the strike, but closed in 1991. As well as striking miners, I photographed workers in the new industries that had sprung up in endless anonymous sheds like the ones you see here. In order to map out the landscape and see its elements in context with one another, I would pursue high vantage points and I climbed this rock outcrop to photograph the valley beneath and the railway line that once moved the coal to Cardiff. The outcrop is about 20 metres high. On one side it\u2019s a slope, on the other there\u2019s a sheer drop. When I reached the top I discovered this graffiti and was quite impressed \u2013 because it\u2019s not an easy climb. I assume a young woman had carried a brush and a can of brilliant white gloss up there, and painted \u201cDuran Duran\u201d \u2013 in homage to the gods, like people inscribe a tree with a heart and the name of their lover. The name painted nearby suggests she was called Kate. Duran Duran made spectacular videos at the time that had a visual impact, and this, too, seemed quite a statement in this relatively isolated place, hidden in an industrial area. If it wasn\u2019t for the graffiti, I would just have made a picture of the view. Instead, I found this surprising conflict between the natural and the modern cultural life of the time. CB Joy Gregory: \u2018Back then, people of colour couldn\u2019t be framed as beautiful\u2019 I grew up in a world where people of colour were not represented in a positive way \u2013 definitely not in beauty or fashion magazines. Where they did appear, there had to be a back story of exoticism; they couldn\u2019t just be, there had to be a reason to be a spectacle. You couldn\u2019t be framed as beautiful \u2013 you didn\u2019t belong in that world. When I made Autoportrait I saw the images as acting out an aspect of myself, though I didn\u2019t look like myself in real life. This idea of putting the Black body into that context of fashion and beauty became an obsession of mine for many years \u2013 I was obsessed with magazines. One of the greatest days of my life was going for an interview at Cond\u00e9 Nast, and being offered a job in their darkroom. But by the time I got home, they had withdrawn my offer. The men who worked in the darkroom were mortified at having a young girl working with them. I had never thought of doing pictures of myself but people didn\u2019t turn up to be models, so I ended up using myself. This was the first time I designed it as well. I didn\u2019t think of myself as beautiful \u2013 no one that age does \u2013 but it was an opportunity to inhabit that space. I had Polaroids and one roll of 120 film. I was shooting on a Hasselblad, and I didn\u2019t have much money at the time so I had to get it completely right. The printing process was an important part of the work and a way to talk about skin hue. I used lith printing but I did it my own way: I worked with a weak solution of developer and processed it in the dark for 30 minutes \u2013 only at the last minute did I put the light on. The making of each print was very performative and dependent on chance, but also a lot of trying over and over again. I think people were quite surprised by them when I first showed them. The only negative reaction was mine \u2013 I was mortified at being in the exhibition with all these giant pictures of my head on the wall, so I sat outside! But I don\u2019t mind being in the room with them now. They\u2019re not me, they\u2019re someone else. CJ Anna Fox: \u2018They drank fizz then went out for breakfast\u2019 We\u2019re looking at a sales team from Rank Xerox having breakfast in 1988. They\u2019re celebrating the end of the sales year, they\u2019d had some champagne in the office and then piled down to the nearest cafe for breakfast. I\u2019m sitting at the end of the table, probably having a bit of toast, with my medium-format camera and my portable flash. This guy was quite pushy and I was constantly half-arguing and joking with him. I could only get this kind of intimate shot because I had been hanging out with them for quite a period of time. When I gave him a copy of the image, he was very proud of it and put it on his desk. This image was part of a commission, Work Stations, a study of life in 40 offices in London. It\u2019s not a conventional documentary project in any respect \u2013 photographing offices then was seen as a banal thing to do, and there\u2019s an overdramatic, fictional feel. The pictures look staged, but they\u2019re not \u2013 though of course when there\u2019s a photographer around, people are always performing to some extent. Before I became a photographer, I worked in an office, for an insurance company. My whole family worked in offices. Offices were spaces I knew quite well, but this was an opportunity to look at things from an analytical distance. The changes in this period in Britain under Thatcher were massive. I was thinking about Thatcher\u2019s catchphrase: \u201cThere is no such thing as society, only individuals.\u201d I wanted to give a sense of what our society had become under someone like Thatcher, and the significance of work and the pursuit of individual wealth in Britain. The pictures are slightly absurd and straightforward \u2013 it\u2019s important to me that there\u2019s humour and irony embedded in the work. In another image, a man looks at a woman\u2019s legs from behind his giant, ship-like desk. The title of that is Headhunter.

Shooting at dawn, I could just about hold a 30th of a second at the widest aperture at 3200 ASA. There\u2019s all the steam from the cooling towers of the power station connected to the coal mine and there\u2019s another light source floodlighting from behind. If you look on the left, you can see pickets were still being allowed to speak to workers going in and that stoical copper is also telling \u2013 this was taken just as the way the strike was being policed changed drastically, with pickets subsequently being prevented from talking to workers. The policing moved from a fairly conventional process to full military-style, with police convoys moving in, surrounding villages and attacking entire communities. The battle of Orgreave was horrific but I remember even worse violence in the autumn of 1984. My medium is light and for much of the time there just wasn\u2019t any. I\u2019d have to get very close with a big Hammerhead flash gun, so a lot of pictures involved grabbing a shot and escaping before getting clobbered. I was quite fit in those days.

After a speech to the National Press Club in Canberra, Australia on Monday, Caroline Kennedy took aim at a number of Trump administration appointees including Tulsi Gabbard, warning that her appointment would \u201cobviously \u2026 be of great concern\u201d. Donald Trump has nominated RFK Jr to oversee US health agencies, despite his propagation of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, and Gabbard to be director of national intelligence, despite her being a vocal supporter of Russia. Caroline Kennedy told reporters that as an ambassador, she\u2019s \u201cnot supposed to comment on politics and now you\u2019re asking me to also comment on family\u201d. \u201cBut, yes, I think Bobby Kennedy\u2019s views on vaccines are dangerous \u2026 but I don\u2019t think that most Americans share them.

      "body": "<p>Evie Gardiner tries hard to avoid advertisements for weight-loss injections, but they seem to crop up everywhere. The 28-year-old Sydney PhD student says treatments that include the drugs are \u201cmarketed quite aggressively\u201d, even if the ads seem \u201ckind of vague\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere should be stricter guidelines and restrictions on that sort of advertising,\u201d Gardiner says. \u201cI\u2019m definitely lucky to be in a place now, personally, where I have a much better relationship with food and my body and health.\u201d</p> <p>The ads are for digital healthcare companies \u2013 not drug manufacturers \u2013 which typically offer \u201ctreatment plans\u201d for weight loss that include the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/21/ozempic-weight-loss-drug-replicas-generic-brands-crackdown-australian-government-compound-pharmacies\">GLP1 class of drugs</a> \u2013 semaglutide, known by brand names Wegovy and Ozempic, or tirzepatide, known as Mounjaro. Most of the advertisers do not refer explicitly to drugs, instead offering \u201cmedical weight treatments\u201d or \u201cmodern weight loss treatments\u201d.</p> <p>Most of the telehealth companies invite people who respond to their ads to fill out an online questionnaire. They may have a consultation with a GP working for the company by phone, video or even text in at least one case. If they are approved for treatment, the drugs are prescribed and posted to them.</p> <p>The ads are commonly seen on buses, and as sponsored posts on social media. </p> <p>The number of ads targeting consumers for weight loss treatments has raised questions about the regulation of semaglutide promotion \u2013 it is illegal to advertise prescription drugs in Australia, including on the internet, but health services can be advertised subject to certain restrictions.</p> <h2>Rules on advertising</h2> <p>The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) <a href=\"https://www.tga.gov.au/resources/guidance/advertising-health-service\">does not regulate the promotion of health services</a>, but advises that such promotions may breach regulations if they are also considered to be advertising therapeutic goods. To ensure they do not, \u201cit is best not to refer to any therapeutic goods used in the delivery of the service in the advertisement\u201d, the TGA says. And businesses \u201cadvertising health services where the available treatment(s) involve the use of prescription-only medicines \u2026 should only refer to the type of consultations the service offers\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/18/queensland-fails-to-crack-down-on-rebranded-sunbed-that-claims-to-stimulate-collagen-but-accelerates-ageing\">Queensland fails to crack down on \u2018rebranded sunbed\u2019 that claims to stimulate collagen but accelerates ageing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The TGA<a href=\"https://www.tga.gov.au/resources/guidance/advertising-health-service#treatments-involving-prescriptiononly-medicines\"> advises that</a> \u201calmost all references to a prescription-only medicine in the context of an advertisement for a health service\u201d will risk the promotion being considered an advertisement for prescription products.</p> <p>\u201cThis applies to terms that act as a substitute for direct references to prescription-only medicines such as \u2026 \u2018weight loss injections\u2019,\u201d its website states.</p> <p>Between February and August, the TGA issued more than 70 infringement notices worth more than $1m to 19 entities for alleged unlawful advertising of prescription-only medicines. Of the fines, $319,260 related to weight-loss drugs.</p> <p>Guardian Australia sent the TGA examples of social media advertisements posted in recent weeks by five digital healthcare companies offering weight loss services: Juniper, Youly, Moshy, Get Lean and ModPeptiHub \u2013 only ModPeptiHub mentioned drugs in its ad.</p> <p>The TGA would not say whether it considered any of the ads to have breached the ban on advertising prescription medications. A spokesperson said it did not comment on individual matters, including whether they may be subject to investigation or compliance and enforcement action.</p> <p>Speaking generally, the TGA said websites could also be considered advertising if they \u201ccontain information that would draw a consumer\u2019s mind to a particular therapeutic good and encourage them to seek out that good\u201d.</p> <p>The companies that responded to Guardian Australia\u2019s request for comment said they advertised within the rules.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Juniper\u2019s advertising offers a \u201ccomprehensive medical weight-loss program\u201d and says \u201cmedical weight loss is not cheating\u201d. Included in a customer\u2019s first order is a \u201csharps disposal bin\u201d, the ad passed to the TGA says, but it does not refer to prescription drugs.</p> <p>Juniper\u2019s website offers \u201chealth coaching and support\u201d as well as \u201cmedically backed weight loss treatments\u201d and does not mention any medications by name before a consultation \u201cdue to Australian Therapeutic Goods regulations\u201d.</p> <p>Juniper is owned by the digital healthcare company Eucalyptus, which is backed by Woolworths and the Blackbird Ventures investment fund, and markets primarily to women.</p> <p>Its chief executive, Tim Doyle, said: \u201cWe advertise the overall program offering rather than any individual prescription medications and strive to comply with TGA advertising rules.</p> <p>\u201cThe decision whether to prescribe a particular medication (if any) rests with the patient\u2019s practitioner.\u201d</p> <p>He said it was \u201cimportant to remember that medication alone is never a silver bullet. Long-term weight loss and health outcomes are improved by changing lifestyle habits such as understanding nutrition and exercise, which is a core part of the comprehensive treatment offered by Juniper.\u201d</p> <p>A smaller, Sydney-based company, Get Lean Pty Ltd, has been running ads on Facebook and Instagram. </p> <p>One ad active in late September stated: \u201cYes \u2026 we have it, the weight loss treatment everyone is raving about.\u201d It did not name the treatment. That ad appears to have been taken down after the company was contacted by Guardian Australia in mid-October. Get Lean did not respond to questions about the advertisements or what specific medicines it was prescribing.</p> <p>Midnight \u2013 backed by the private insurer NIB \u2013 told Guardian Australia it sold medicines including Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda and Contrave through its platforms hub.health and Youly. The ad for Youly sent to the TGA did not refer to prescription drugs, but offered \u201cdiscreet shipping\u201d.</p>    <p>Hub.health\u2019s website refers to \u201cprescription medications\u201d and \u201cinjectable treatments\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Midnight said customers were not guaranteed a prescription and the company was focused on \u201ceducating Australians about health issues \u2026 rather than promoting specific treatment pathways or prescription medications\u201d, which \u201censures compliance with TGA guidelines\u201d.</p> <p>The company\u2019s chief executive officer, Nic Blair, said it was the responsibility of businesses like Midnight to ensure only eligible patients received treatment.</p> <p>\u201cAt Midnight Health we consider it critically important that those who have experienced eating disorders or disordered eating cannot access our service and as such include evidence-based eating disorder screening tools as part of our pre-consultation questionnaire,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Moshy, which markets weight-loss treatments for women, was running 23 ads across Meta\u2019s social media platforms in early November. Some of the ads promise \u201cmodern medicines and expert tailored plans available 100% online and delivered to you\u201d. The ads did not refer to prescription drugs.</p> <p>Its website does not name specific medications, but says prescription treatments \u201cmay come in tablet or injection form\u201d. The company, which also runs Mosh Health \u2013 geared towards men \u2013 did not respond to Guardian Australia\u2019s request for comment.</p> <p>ModPeptiHub, which directly promotes a semaglutide \u201cskinny shot\u201d and appears to sell directly to customers on its website, did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <h2>Not judging consumers</h2> <p>Eating disorder experts have urged the TGA to introduce tougher advertising restrictions.</p> <p>Gardiner says she developed and overcame disordered eating after being bullied for \u201cgrowing up in a larger body\u201d. Now working on a thesis about how to make public health more weight-inclusive, she says she wouldn\u2019t judge anyone for considering weight-loss injections.</p> <p>\u201cI just want people to have the opportunity to make informed decisions,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cI think it would be much better if they could have an informed discussion with a health professional that isn\u2019t linked to a company selling the medication.\u201d</p> <p>Some medical experts say the drugs are life-changing for people struggling with obesity and they may have other health benefits, such as helping people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/03/can-diabetes-and-weight-loss-drug-ozempic-break-addictions-too\">break free from nicotine and alcohol addiction</a>.

The 28-year-old Sydney PhD student says treatments that include the drugs are \u201cmarketed quite aggressively\u201d, even if the ads seem \u201ckind of vague\u201d. \u201cThere should be stricter guidelines and restrictions on that sort of advertising,\u201d Gardiner says. \u201cI\u2019m definitely lucky to be in a place now, personally, where I have a much better relationship with food and my body and health.\u201d The ads are for digital healthcare companies \u2013 not drug manufacturers \u2013 which typically offer \u201ctreatment plans\u201d for weight loss that include the GLP1 class of drugs \u2013 semaglutide, known by brand names Wegovy and Ozempic, or tirzepatide, known as Mounjaro. Most of the advertisers do not refer explicitly to drugs, instead offering \u201cmedical weight treatments\u201d or \u201cmodern weight loss treatments\u201d. Most of the telehealth companies invite people who respond to their ads to fill out an online questionnaire. They may have a consultation with a GP working for the company by phone, video or even text in at least one case. If they are approved for treatment, the drugs are prescribed and posted to them. The ads are commonly seen on buses, and as sponsored posts on social media. The number of ads targeting consumers for weight loss treatments has raised questions about the regulation of semaglutide promotion \u2013 it is illegal to advertise prescription drugs in Australia, including on the internet, but health services can be advertised subject to certain restrictions. Rules on advertising The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) does not regulate the promotion of health services, but advises that such promotions may breach regulations if they are also considered to be advertising therapeutic goods. To ensure they do not, \u201cit is best not to refer to any therapeutic goods used in the delivery of the service in the advertisement\u201d, the TGA says. And businesses \u201cadvertising health services where the available treatment(s) involve the use of prescription-only medicines \u2026 should only refer to the type of consultations the service offers\u201d. The TGA advises that \u201calmost all references to a prescription-only medicine in the context of an advertisement for a health service\u201d will risk the promotion being considered an advertisement for prescription products. \u201cThis applies to terms that act as a substitute for direct references to prescription-only medicines such as \u2026 \u2018weight loss injections\u2019,\u201d its website states. Between February and August, the TGA issued more than 70 infringement notices worth more than $1m to 19 entities for alleged unlawful advertising of prescription-only medicines. Of the fines, $319,260 related to weight-loss drugs. Guardian Australia sent the TGA examples of social media advertisements posted in recent weeks by five digital healthcare companies offering weight loss services: Juniper, Youly, Moshy, Get Lean and ModPeptiHub \u2013 only ModPeptiHub mentioned drugs in its ad. The TGA would not say whether it considered any of the ads to have breached the ban on advertising prescription medications. A spokesperson said it did not comment on individual matters, including whether they may be subject to investigation or compliance and enforcement action. Speaking generally, the TGA said websites could also be considered advertising if they \u201ccontain information that would draw a consumer\u2019s mind to a particular therapeutic good and encourage them to seek out that good\u201d. The companies that responded to Guardian Australia\u2019s request for comment said they advertised within the rules. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Juniper\u2019s advertising offers a \u201ccomprehensive medical weight-loss program\u201d and says \u201cmedical weight loss is not cheating\u201d. Included in a customer\u2019s first order is a \u201csharps disposal bin\u201d, the ad passed to the TGA says, but it does not refer to prescription drugs. Juniper\u2019s website offers \u201chealth coaching and support\u201d as well as \u201cmedically backed weight loss treatments\u201d and does not mention any medications by name before a consultation \u201cdue to Australian Therapeutic Goods regulations\u201d. Juniper is owned by the digital healthcare company Eucalyptus, which is backed by Woolworths and the Blackbird Ventures investment fund, and markets primarily to women. Its chief executive, Tim Doyle, said: \u201cWe advertise the overall program offering rather than any individual prescription medications and strive to comply with TGA advertising rules. \u201cThe decision whether to prescribe a particular medication (if any) rests with the patient\u2019s practitioner.\u201d He said it was \u201cimportant to remember that medication alone is never a silver bullet. Long-term weight loss and health outcomes are improved by changing lifestyle habits such as understanding nutrition and exercise, which is a core part of the comprehensive treatment offered by Juniper.\u201d A smaller, Sydney-based company, Get Lean Pty Ltd, has been running ads on Facebook and Instagram. One ad active in late September stated: \u201cYes \u2026 we have it, the weight loss treatment everyone is raving about.\u201d It did not name the treatment. That ad appears to have been taken down after the company was contacted by Guardian Australia in mid-October. Get Lean did not respond to questions about the advertisements or what specific medicines it was prescribing. Midnight \u2013 backed by the private insurer NIB \u2013 told Guardian Australia it sold medicines including Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda and Contrave through its platforms hub.health and Youly. The ad for Youly sent to the TGA did not refer to prescription drugs, but offered \u201cdiscreet shipping\u201d. Hub.health\u2019s website refers to \u201cprescription medications\u201d and \u201cinjectable treatments\u201d. A spokesperson for Midnight said customers were not guaranteed a prescription and the company was focused on \u201ceducating Australians about health issues \u2026 rather than promoting specific treatment pathways or prescription medications\u201d, which \u201censures compliance with TGA guidelines\u201d. The company\u2019s chief executive officer, Nic Blair, said it was the responsibility of businesses like Midnight to ensure only eligible patients received treatment. \u201cAt Midnight Health we consider it critically important that those who have experienced eating disorders or disordered eating cannot access our service and as such include evidence-based eating disorder screening tools as part of our pre-consultation questionnaire,\u201d he said. Moshy, which markets weight-loss treatments for women, was running 23 ads across Meta\u2019s social media platforms in early November. Some of the ads promise \u201cmodern medicines and expert tailored plans available 100% online and delivered to you\u201d. The ads did not refer to prescription drugs. Its website does not name specific medications, but says prescription treatments \u201cmay come in tablet or injection form\u201d. The company, which also runs Mosh Health \u2013 geared towards men \u2013 did not respond to Guardian Australia\u2019s request for comment. ModPeptiHub, which directly promotes a semaglutide \u201cskinny shot\u201d and appears to sell directly to customers on its website, did not respond to a request for comment. Not judging consumers Eating disorder experts have urged the TGA to introduce tougher advertising restrictions. Gardiner says she developed and overcame disordered eating after being bullied for \u201cgrowing up in a larger body\u201d. Now working on a thesis about how to make public health more weight-inclusive, she says she wouldn\u2019t judge anyone for considering weight-loss injections. \u201cI just want people to have the opportunity to make informed decisions,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it would be much better if they could have an informed discussion with a health professional that isn\u2019t linked to a company selling the medication.\u201d Some medical experts say the drugs are life-changing for people struggling with obesity and they may have other health benefits, such as helping people break free from nicotine and alcohol addiction. Others argue not enough is known about the potential long-term side-effects. The use of Ozempic may cause serious side effects such as possible thyroid tumours, low blood sugar, kidney problems and inflammation of the pancreas. In October last year, the TGA began investigating reports of potential bowel dysfunction linked to the drug. The Butterfly Foundation\u2019s Melissa Wilton says she is concerned that telehealth companies may not have enough safeguards to stop vulnerable people, of any weight, from getting a prescription. \u201cIn terms of advertising and \u2026 accessibility, there definitely needs to be stricter regulations, because it\u2019s just too easy now to have it prescribed and delivered to your door,\u201d she says. \u201cIf someone isn\u2019t being screened for an eating disorder or disordered eating, it can be very dangerous.\u201d Wilton believes the companies should be banned from advertising altogether. Dr Terri-Lynne South, a GP and dietitian who chairs the obesity management group of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, says direct-to-consumer marketing means people with obesity could be missing out on holistic care. \u201cA lot of the \u2026 hype around the injectable medications is that people are thinking they\u2019re a miracle drug that is a short-term fix,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have been the most effective medical intervention for some time, but people are not understanding that this is only one part of a complex management and that in general they are expected to be taken long-term, if not indefinitely.\u201d Dr Jennifer Hamer, a former endurance runner who lived with an eating disorder for 17 years and is now a sports science academic, says it is difficult not to notice the volume of ads. \u201cIf there ever was a place for any of these medications \u2026 I really do think the only time they should be discussed is in a consulting room,\u201d Hamer says. \u201cThey are not a lifestyle choice. We need regulation on where they are shared, who is managing these discussions, how they are promoted \u2013 which they shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 and who has access to them.\u201d Do you know more?

The US president will allow Ukraine to use US-made Atacms rockets, which have a range of 190 miles (300km) \u2013 a decision being justified by the presence of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia against Ukraine. Though there was no public comment from the White House, the story first appeared in coordinated briefings to the New York Times, the Washington Post and the news agencies Reuters and Associated Press. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appeared to confirm the news, though he said any proof about the change in policy would emerge on the battlefield, if and when the missiles are used. \u201cToday, there\u2019s a lot of talk in the media about us receiving permission for respective actions. But strikes are not carried out with words. Such things are not announced. Missiles will speak for themselves. They certainly will,\u201d Zelenskyy said. Ten people, including two children, were killed and 52 were injured on Sunday night when a Russian missile hit a residential nine-storey building in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern region of Sumy, Ukraine\u2019s emergency services and military said. \u201cSunday evening for the city of Sumy became hell, a tragedy that Russia brought to our land,\u201d Volodymyr Artyukh, the head of the Sumy military administration said in a post on the administration\u2019s Telegram messaging channel. The attack on Sumy followed a morning of Russia pounding Ukraine\u2019s power grid in what Kyiv said was a \u201cmassive\u201d attack with 120 missiles and 90 drones that killed at least seven people. The attack was the largest missile and drone assault on Ukraine since August and the first big Russian assault since the US election, showing the Kremlin in little mood to compromise after Donald Trump\u2019s victory. Ukrenergo, Ukraine\u2019s principal energy supplier, said blackouts and consumption restrictions would be introduced \u201cin all regions\u201d from Monday as engineers tried to repair as much of the damage to power facilities as possible. With the harsh Ukrainian winter fast approaching, the country is already suffering from major energy shortfalls. Polish prime minister Donald Tusk said the attack showed that talking to Russian president Vladimir Putin on the phone would not stop the war, two days after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz rang him. \u201cNo one will stop Putin with phone calls.

The exercise conducted in the northern Lapland region in November is part of Dynamic Front 25, the largest Nato artillery exercise ever held in Europe, with fire drills in Finland as well as Estonia, Germany, Romania and Poland. The Nordic nation, which shares a border with Russia, joined Nato last year, dropping decades of military non-alignment after Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. About 1,500 supporters of Russia\u2019s exiled opposition marched through central Berlin on Sunday \u2013 led by Yulia Navalnaya and chanting \u201cNo to war!\u201d and \u201cNo to Putin\u201d \u2013 in a demonstration against Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.

Those in the top 3% in terms of survival time are eligible.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t expect people with these cancers to live beyond two years or three years, but around 3-5% do live,\u201d said Dr Thankamma Ajithkumar, a consultant clinical oncologist at Cambridge University hospital NHS trust. \u201cIt always puzzles us why these people are alive. Is there anything in the tumour or anything in their genetics that is actually making it easier to fight this cancer?\u201d</p> <p>The Rosalind study is named after Rosalind Franklin, the British X-ray crystallographer whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jun/23/sexism-in-science-did-watson-and-crick-really-steal-rosalind-franklins-data\">Photo 51</a> famously captured the double helix structure of DNA. The photo was taken in 1952, six years before Franklin died of ovarian cancer.</p> <p>Ajithkumar said: \u201cBefore this study, few attempted to look at the people who have done very well with these dreadful cancers to see whether we can learn anything, and if we can, how we can translate it to make the outcome of the disease better.\u201d</p> <p>Some patients will owe their survival to genetic quirks in their tumours that make them particularly susceptible to cancer drugs. For others, the answer will lie in their immune system\u2019s ability to destroy cancer cells. The study aims to understand these and other factors that help patients survive.</p> <p>Data gathered from the super-survivors will be held in a worldwide database run by Cure51, a French startup that is funding Project Rosalind with investment from Sofinnova, a Paris-based venture capital firm.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that these people survive,\u201d said Nicolas Wolikow, the chief executive and co-founder of Cure51. \u201cWe must understand why and unlock the mechanism of survival. If we are successful in doing that, there\u2019s a good chance we can contribute to the eradication of cancer.\u201d</p> <p>Finding and enrolling super-survivors may not be easy, however. In the UK, cancer patients who are doing well after five years are discharged, making it harder for doctors to follow their progress. \u201cTracing them is going to be a huge problem,\u201d said Ajithkumar. Super-survivors who are interested in taking part in the UK arm of the study can contact the Cambridge Cancer Trials Centre at <a href=\"mailto:info@cancer.cam.ac.uk\">info@cancer.cam.ac.uk</a>.</p> <p>Dr Hattie Brooks, of Cancer Research UK, said: \u201cUnderstanding why treatments can affect people with the same type of cancer differently is important if we\u2019re to develop more effective ways to beat it. This could ultimately allow doctors to develop new therapies that are more likely to work for people with these harder-to-treat cancers, who currently have fewer options.</p> <p>\u201cStudies like this are especially welcome in cancers that fewer people are surviving for at least 10 years. While this study is at an early stage, it could be an important step towards new ways to treat aggressive cancers.\u201d</p>",

Researchers on the study will collect detailed biological information on 1,000 patients and their tumours and analyse DNA, blood proteins, microbes and molecular biomarkers in the hope of learning why they fared so well. The insights gleaned will be used to understand cancer weaknesses and design new therapies for aggressive tumours, with some treatments aiming to mimic the crucial biological features seen in so-called super-survivors to improve the prospects for other patients. Cancer specialists in more than 40 countries are taking part in the study and looking to enrol people who have lived exceptionally long after diagnosis with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, the aggressive brain cancer glioblastoma, or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Those in the top 3% in terms of survival time are eligible. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect people with these cancers to live beyond two years or three years, but around 3-5% do live,\u201d said Dr Thankamma Ajithkumar, a consultant clinical oncologist at Cambridge University hospital NHS trust. \u201cIt always puzzles us why these people are alive. Is there anything in the tumour or anything in their genetics that is actually making it easier to fight this cancer?\u201d The Rosalind study is named after Rosalind Franklin, the British X-ray crystallographer whose Photo 51 famously captured the double helix structure of DNA. The photo was taken in 1952, six years before Franklin died of ovarian cancer. Ajithkumar said: \u201cBefore this study, few attempted to look at the people who have done very well with these dreadful cancers to see whether we can learn anything, and if we can, how we can translate it to make the outcome of the disease better.\u201d Some patients will owe their survival to genetic quirks in their tumours that make them particularly susceptible to cancer drugs. For others, the answer will lie in their immune system\u2019s ability to destroy cancer cells. The study aims to understand these and other factors that help patients survive. Data gathered from the super-survivors will be held in a worldwide database run by Cure51, a French startup that is funding Project Rosalind with investment from Sofinnova, a Paris-based venture capital firm. \u201cWe know that these people survive,\u201d said Nicolas Wolikow, the chief executive and co-founder of Cure51. \u201cWe must understand why and unlock the mechanism of survival. If we are successful in doing that, there\u2019s a good chance we can contribute to the eradication of cancer.\u201d Finding and enrolling super-survivors may not be easy, however. In the UK, cancer patients who are doing well after five years are discharged, making it harder for doctors to follow their progress. \u201cTracing them is going to be a huge problem,\u201d said Ajithkumar. Super-survivors who are interested in taking part in the UK arm of the study can contact the Cambridge Cancer Trials Centre at info@cancer.cam.ac.uk. Dr Hattie Brooks, of Cancer Research UK, said: \u201cUnderstanding why treatments can affect people with the same type of cancer differently is important if we\u2019re to develop more effective ways to beat it. This could ultimately allow doctors to develop new therapies that are more likely to work for people with these harder-to-treat cancers, who currently have fewer options. \u201cStudies like this are especially welcome in cancers that fewer people are surviving for at least 10 years. While this study is at an early stage, it could be an important step towards new ways to treat aggressive cancers.\u201d",

The latest figures from NHS England reveal that ambulance response times for category 2 calls, which includes stroke, have increased to 42 minutes and 15 seconds in October from 36 minutes and 2 seconds in September, meaning they arrive later at hospital, causing 1.9m brain cells to die every minute that a stroke is left untreated. SSNAP data also shows that 3.9% of stroke patients had a thrombectomy last year, well below NHS England\u2019s target of 10% by 2027-28. Although about 20% of stroke patients are eligible for thrombolysis, a treatment to dissolve blood clots, only an average of 11.6% patients received it in 2023-24. The Stroke Association is calling on the government to invest in stroke prevention, such as regular blood pressure checks; support the delivery of universal 24/7 access to an acute stroke unit and stroke treatments such as thrombectomy and thrombolysis; and provide more funding for in-hospital and community rehabilitation services. Eight years ago Phil Woodford, 53, from Preston, had a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) \u2013 a type of mini stroke \u2013 and full stroke the next day. He was given thrombolysis, but he was unable to have a thrombectomy because his local hospital did not provide the service on a weekend, which he believes may have ruined his quality of life. He said: \u201cMy life changed overnight. It took four months\u2019 rehabilitation in hospital and then another four months until I could return to work. My stroke caused musculoskeletal problems, permanent pain and weight gain because I\u2019m less mobile now. I walk with a limp and my left arm sometime moves on its own and suffers from spasticity and cramps.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cIt is unacceptable that so many stroke survivors are not receiving the support and care they need with their recovery. We are committed to improving stroke prevention, treatment and recovery for all stroke survivors. \u201cWe have introduced health checks in workplaces and blood pressure checks on high streets to help catch illness earlier, and we\u2019re also acting to prevent strokes in the first place by tackling the biggest killers such as smoking and obesity. \u201cWe will deliver the investment and reform needed to turn the NHS around, which includes shifting the focus of healthcare from treatment to prevention, as part of our 10-year health plan.",

The announcement includes an extension of a scheme that allows young people under 21 to travel on public transport for \u00a31 and a \u00a350m investment programme aimed at helping people to find and stay in work. There will also be a \u00a31.4m investment to expand a scheme helping parents and children.
