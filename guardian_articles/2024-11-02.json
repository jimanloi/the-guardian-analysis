      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a Tuesday afternoon in the emergency department at one of Melbourne\u2019s busiest public hospitals, St Vincent\u2019s. Over a loudspeaker, a nurse announces a code grey: an attack on a staff member. It punctuates a cacophony of yelling voices, buzzing machines and groaning patients. Police mingle amid the chaos while people wait on stretchers or strung over chairs outside.</p> <p>Immediately next door, the hospital\u2019s mental health, alcohol and other drugs hub is quiet and, for the most part, calm.</p> <p>People treated in this sealed-off section of the emergency department (ED) are either having an acute mental health crisis or are struggling with addiction. But you wouldn\u2019t know it.</p> <p>Away from the tumult of the ED, the hub is designed to feel calming, soothing and safe. The effect is almost immediate.</p> <p>As GP costs have skyrocketed, those on the frontline of Australia\u2019s mental health crisis say demand is increasing as patients\u2019 cases grow more complex and severe.</p>    <p>Located in Fitzroy on Victoria Parade, just outside Melbourne\u2019s CBD, the hub has treated about 10,000 patients since it opened six years ago. It was the first of six state-funded hubs in Victoria announced as part of a $32m package for alcohol and drug services. Together, the hubs have 34 beds.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/21/sign-up-for-five-great-reads-guardian-australias-wrap-of-our-best-summer-stories\">Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Similar models to Victoria\u2019s hubs are now being rolled out in Sydney as mental health disorders increase there, triggering growing calls for more support.</p> <p>Each of the eight generously sized cubicles at the St Vincent\u2019s hub are decorated with pictures of Wilson\u2019s Promontory national park. They all have safety features, including locked-away equipment.</p> <p>Liv Bollington is one of the hub\u2019s coordinators. \u201cThese are slightly different setups to a main [ED] cubicle,\u201d she says from inside one of the rooms. \u201cSo if you have anyone who\u2019s at risk of self-harming, they don\u2019t have access [to unsafe implements].\u201d </p>    <p>Other safety measures include having nothing attached to ceilings that can hold any weight. There are also no curtains or bin bags, and patients\u2019 belongings are searched before they are admitted. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/03/brainstorm-richard-scolyer-book-interview-brain-cancer\">The scientist who tested his revolutionary medicine on his own brain cancer: \u2018It seemed worth it to give it a crack\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The team then determines if the patient is agitated, in need of a sedative and/or physically hurt. </p> <p>Bollington has been a nurse for 20 years, primarily specialising in patients with drug and alcohol addictions. She talks in a no-nonsense way that many nurses adopt. She is sharp and doesn\u2019t suffer fools.</p> <p>She says there has been an increase in patients needing the service, with its eight beds filled twice daily.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a knock-on effect of patients who would have, in the past, gone to their GP now presenting to the ED,\u201d she says. \u201cWe say to patients \u2018here, go to your GP, go get your mental health care plan\u2019. Well how realistic is that really when going to the GP is $60 to $80 out of pocket?\u201d Patients then need to find a psychologist in the community, she says. \u201cAnd that is so difficult.\u201d</p> <p>Bollington says the hub is still experiencing the reverberation of the lockdown years; people who lost businesses or were isolated and started drinking continue to be admitted. But now there is a fresh wave of people who need help due to the rising cost of living, including rent increases.</p>    <p>\u201cWe see patients all the time whose lease is expiring, or they can\u2019t afford the rental increase,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of patients [coming] in with depression or distress regarding changes to their social circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>She pauses and nods.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s huge.\u201d</p> <p>A man in his 40s bounds out of one of the rooms. Josh, whose name has been changed for privacy, is about to be discharged.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a Tuesday afternoon in the emergency department at one of Melbourne\u2019s busiest public hospitals, St Vincent\u2019s. Over a loudspeaker, a nurse announces a code grey: an attack on a staff member. It punctuates a cacophony of yelling voices, buzzing machines and groaning patients. Police mingle amid the chaos while people wait on stretchers or strung over chairs outside. Immediately next door, the hospital\u2019s mental health, alcohol and other drugs hub is quiet and, for the most part, calm. People treated in this sealed-off section of the emergency department (ED) are either having an acute mental health crisis or are struggling with addiction. But you wouldn\u2019t know it. Away from the tumult of the ED, the hub is designed to feel calming, soothing and safe. The effect is almost immediate. As GP costs have skyrocketed, those on the frontline of Australia\u2019s mental health crisis say demand is increasing as patients\u2019 cases grow more complex and severe. Located in Fitzroy on Victoria Parade, just outside Melbourne\u2019s CBD, the hub has treated about 10,000 patients since it opened six years ago. It was the first of six state-funded hubs in Victoria announced as part of a $32m package for alcohol and drug services. Together, the hubs have 34 beds. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Similar models to Victoria\u2019s hubs are now being rolled out in Sydney as mental health disorders increase there, triggering growing calls for more support. Each of the eight generously sized cubicles at the St Vincent\u2019s hub are decorated with pictures of Wilson\u2019s Promontory national park. They all have safety features, including locked-away equipment. Liv Bollington is one of the hub\u2019s coordinators. \u201cThese are slightly different setups to a main [ED] cubicle,\u201d she says from inside one of the rooms. \u201cSo if you have anyone who\u2019s at risk of self-harming, they don\u2019t have access [to unsafe implements].\u201d Other safety measures include having nothing attached to ceilings that can hold any weight. There are also no curtains or bin bags, and patients\u2019 belongings are searched before they are admitted. The team then determines if the patient is agitated, in need of a sedative and/or physically hurt. Bollington has been a nurse for 20 years, primarily specialising in patients with drug and alcohol addictions. She talks in a no-nonsense way that many nurses adopt. She is sharp and doesn\u2019t suffer fools. She says there has been an increase in patients needing the service, with its eight beds filled twice daily. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a knock-on effect of patients who would have, in the past, gone to their GP now presenting to the ED,\u201d she says. \u201cWe say to patients \u2018here, go to your GP, go get your mental health care plan\u2019. Well how realistic is that really when going to the GP is $60 to $80 out of pocket?\u201d Patients then need to find a psychologist in the community, she says. \u201cAnd that is so difficult.\u201d Bollington says the hub is still experiencing the reverberation of the lockdown years; people who lost businesses or were isolated and started drinking continue to be admitted. But now there is a fresh wave of people who need help due to the rising cost of living, including rent increases. \u201cWe see patients all the time whose lease is expiring, or they can\u2019t afford the rental increase,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of patients [coming] in with depression or distress regarding changes to their social circumstances.\u201d She pauses and nods. \u201cIt\u2019s huge.\u201d A man in his 40s bounds out of one of the rooms. Josh, whose name has been changed for privacy, is about to be discharged. Bollington runs through a list of medications with him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she says when he starts looking stressed. He raises his hands and smiles. \u201cI wish I had your outlook,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve just been using a lot of black humour to hide the severe anxiety.\u201d Josh arrived the day before.

      "body": "<p><strong>What\u2019s the oldest thing you own?</strong></p> <p>Probably my four-wheel drive Land Cruiser, because I\u2019ve had it for 20 years. It\u2019s done nearly 777,777.7 [kilometres], and when that happens, it\u2019ll be a blessed day of my life to know full well that my mate has travelled with me over the last 20 years and done over three-quarters of a million kilometres around this island.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your favourite place to visit in Australia?</strong></p> <p>Probably up to Kimberley, [I\u2019ve got] lots of good family and friends up in the Kimberley. I\u2019d go back to the desert \u2013 Mparntwe, out to Ntaria, even out to Uluru. Even south of there, in the desert. I\u2019m a freshwater man, so I\u2019d go and enjoy that. But if I had to go coast ways, I\u2019d go back up to Kimberley, [from] Broome to Wyndham, near Kununurra. You don\u2019t have to say much at all, you just be there, in and around people who enjoy life. I\u2019ve done my fair share of barking inquisitives, now I just want to enjoy life. And people from there that I\u2019ve known for 50-plus years; it\u2019s good to just sit down and have a cup of tea.</p>    <p><strong>What would be on your ideal road trip playlist?</strong></p> <p>Sun Don\u2019t Shine [by the Pigram Brothers], then that would go into [their songs] Dry River Bed and Maysong, and then I\u2019d listen to the brothers do Moonlight. Then Stephen\u2019s [Pigram] got a new album out, called Solfish \u2013 so I\u2019ll chuck that on and just let that play. A bit of Fitzroy Xpress, a bit of John Williamson, Ernest Tubb or something like that, a bit of Missy Higgins and a bit of TCD [Troy Cassar-Daley] \u2013 rounded out with a bit of Dan Sultan, and the old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/20/warumpi-bands-trail-blazing-legacy-we-just-wanted-to-give-our-music-to-everybody\">Warumpi Band</a>.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a party trick?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019d probably pick up a vacuum cleaner and blow it like a didj. I\u2019m not a drinker, so I wouldn\u2019t have a clue when it comes to alcohol. I\u2019ll play pool \u2013 kick-arse playing pool.

I do like a bit of Swiss cheese and a bit of gherkin, good roma tomato, some good ham. Mm, yeah.

Like security guards \u2013 basically their job is to observe and report; I observe, I don\u2019t have to report. I enjoy watching a lot of things: watching the sun, colours, environment change; watching [and] listening to birds, the sounds that they make at different times of day; watching kids; watching my own kids; watching people around me. If somebody walks with a bit of a limp, is it the shoe they\u2019re wearing? Or [maybe] they\u2019ve got an injury from the weekend, because they didn\u2019t have it last week. Sometimes I\u2019m wrong, but I love making up stories.</p> <p><strong>What is your go-to dinner party dish?</strong></p> <p>It depends on the time of the year. Chicken and vegetable soup in winter time. Chop a lot of vegetables up in a pot, make a vegetable soup out of that. Break it into four quarters and use one quarter, freeze the other three-quarters. When you\u2019re halfway through the quarter, you\u2019d get what is called a bachelor\u2019s handbag \u2013 a cooked chook in a bag from the supermarket \u2013 and trim all the meat off it and put half the chook into your vegetable soup.</p> <p><strong>What animal do you most relate to?</strong></p> <p>Well, at the moment it\u2019s a cobberdog. They\u2019re like a little labradoodle, but they\u2019re bred for temperament. Amazing little dogs. I love my little cobberdog; she\u2019s only about 18 months old, and I\u2019ve spent the last year and a bit with her. She\u2019s left me today, to go to school.</p> <p><strong>What is your least favourite animal?</strong></p> <p>Probably a chihuahua \u2013 those things are like a ball of fluff with demonic mannerisms.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a nemesis?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m a mad [West Coast] Eagles fan so probably the Fremantle Dockers Football Club. Personal nemeses \u2013 I\u2019ve got a couple of mates from when I started playing basketball over 50 years ago: a bloke called Ian Satie, because I\u2019m still better looking that he is and keep reminding him; and Eric Watterson, he\u2019s an ugly bugger now and he knows it, and I remind him of it. So just sporting rivalries. It\u2019s all we can brag about at our age, because some of us still play but we\u2019re not as good as we were 50 years ago.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The new season of <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/tv-series/going-places-with-ernie-dingo\">Going Places with Ernie Dingo</a> is on NITV and SBS on Thursdays at 7.30pm, with new episodes premiering weekly</em></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s the oldest thing you own? Probably my four-wheel drive Land Cruiser, because I\u2019ve had it for 20 years. It\u2019s done nearly 777,777.7 [kilometres], and when that happens, it\u2019ll be a blessed day of my life to know full well that my mate has travelled with me over the last 20 years and done over three-quarters of a million kilometres around this island. What\u2019s your favourite place to visit in Australia? Probably up to Kimberley, [I\u2019ve got] lots of good family and friends up in the Kimberley. I\u2019d go back to the desert \u2013 Mparntwe, out to Ntaria, even out to Uluru. Even south of there, in the desert. I\u2019m a freshwater man, so I\u2019d go and enjoy that. But if I had to go coast ways, I\u2019d go back up to Kimberley, [from] Broome to Wyndham, near Kununurra. You don\u2019t have to say much at all, you just be there, in and around people who enjoy life. I\u2019ve done my fair share of barking inquisitives, now I just want to enjoy life. And people from there that I\u2019ve known for 50-plus years; it\u2019s good to just sit down and have a cup of tea. What would be on your ideal road trip playlist? Sun Don\u2019t Shine [by the Pigram Brothers], then that would go into [their songs] Dry River Bed and Maysong, and then I\u2019d listen to the brothers do Moonlight. Then Stephen\u2019s [Pigram] got a new album out, called Solfish \u2013 so I\u2019ll chuck that on and just let that play. A bit of Fitzroy Xpress, a bit of John Williamson, Ernest Tubb or something like that, a bit of Missy Higgins and a bit of TCD [Troy Cassar-Daley] \u2013 rounded out with a bit of Dan Sultan, and the old Warumpi Band. Do you have a party trick? I\u2019d probably pick up a vacuum cleaner and blow it like a didj. I\u2019m not a drinker, so I wouldn\u2019t have a clue when it comes to alcohol. I\u2019ll play pool \u2013 kick-arse playing pool. A lot of people are still chasing me to try and win a game back off me. If you could have a sandwich named after you, what would be on it? Something like a BLT, maybe. I do like a bit of Swiss cheese and a bit of gherkin, good roma tomato, some good ham. Mm, yeah. But then again, I wouldn\u2019t knock back some crayfish from the midwest \u2013 Turkish bread, hot with melted butter, and a nice hot piece of crayfish. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning What are you secretly really good at? I\u2019m very good at watching. Like security guards \u2013 basically their job is to observe and report; I observe, I don\u2019t have to report. I enjoy watching a lot of things: watching the sun, colours, environment change; watching [and] listening to birds, the sounds that they make at different times of day; watching kids; watching my own kids; watching people around me. If somebody walks with a bit of a limp, is it the shoe they\u2019re wearing? Or [maybe] they\u2019ve got an injury from the weekend, because they didn\u2019t have it last week. Sometimes I\u2019m wrong, but I love making up stories. What is your go-to dinner party dish? It depends on the time of the year. Chicken and vegetable soup in winter time. Chop a lot of vegetables up in a pot, make a vegetable soup out of that. Break it into four quarters and use one quarter, freeze the other three-quarters. When you\u2019re halfway through the quarter, you\u2019d get what is called a bachelor\u2019s handbag \u2013 a cooked chook in a bag from the supermarket \u2013 and trim all the meat off it and put half the chook into your vegetable soup. What animal do you most relate to? Well, at the moment it\u2019s a cobberdog. They\u2019re like a little labradoodle, but they\u2019re bred for temperament. Amazing little dogs. I love my little cobberdog; she\u2019s only about 18 months old, and I\u2019ve spent the last year and a bit with her. She\u2019s left me today, to go to school. What is your least favourite animal? Probably a chihuahua \u2013 those things are like a ball of fluff with demonic mannerisms. Do you have a nemesis? I\u2019m a mad [West Coast] Eagles fan so probably the Fremantle Dockers Football Club. Personal nemeses \u2013 I\u2019ve got a couple of mates from when I started playing basketball over 50 years ago: a bloke called Ian Satie, because I\u2019m still better looking that he is and keep reminding him; and Eric Watterson, he\u2019s an ugly bugger now and he knows it, and I remind him of it. So just sporting rivalries. It\u2019s all we can brag about at our age, because some of us still play but we\u2019re not as good as we were 50 years ago. The new season of Going Places with Ernie Dingo is on NITV and SBS on Thursdays at 7.30pm, with new episodes premiering weekly",

This is what he meant, as he prodded then crashed his way to a career-best and match-winning 124 not out. His first 50 had taken him 60 balls, his second took 17.</p> <p>Faced with 329 to win after the West Indies captain, Shai Hope, made a superb 117, England showed the restraint that eluded them on Thursday when they were bowled out for 209, as on top of Livingstone\u2019s century, Phil Salt, Jacob Bethell and Sam Curran all made 50s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/nov/02/west-indies-england-second-one-day-cricket-international-live-score-updates\">West Indies v England: second men\u2019s one-day cricket international \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Livingstone and Curran combined for the key partnership. With 169 to win from 22 overs and four wickets down, England were behind the game but not by miles.</p> <p>Their 50 partnership arrived in 47 balls but soon they hit the brakes as the pair looked to take the contest as deep as possible. At one stage, they didn\u2019t score a boundary for 34 balls before two arrived in consecutive deliveries.</p> <p>It was only the beginning of the onslaught. The West Indies total of 328 was a record ODI total at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, and until Jayden Seales delivered the 45th over it looked like it would be enough, before Livingstone blazed 22 off five deliveries.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no point at which I thought the game was out of touch,\u201d said an exhausted Livingstone. \u201cMore than anything, I\u2019m happy to have been able to lead from the front.\u201d</p> <p>Six weeks ago, England had dropped Livingstone for the ODIs against Australia before Jos Buttler\u2019s calf injury gave him a route back in. In an honest conversation with managing director Rob Key, Livingstone said his one complaint was that he felt he hadn\u2019t been given enough responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cI had two years when I should\u2019ve done more than I did,\u201d Livingstone explained. \u201dBut I don\u2019t always think I was given the responsibility that I wanted.

      "bodyText": "A Liam Livingstone masterclass secured England an unlikely victory and levelled the series in the West Indies, as the visitors chased down an imposing 329 in Antigua. After England\u2019s defeat in the opening match on Thursday, the captain implored his side to \u201cbat smarter\u201d. This is what he meant, as he prodded then crashed his way to a career-best and match-winning 124 not out. His first 50 had taken him 60 balls, his second took 17. Faced with 329 to win after the West Indies captain, Shai Hope, made a superb 117, England showed the restraint that eluded them on Thursday when they were bowled out for 209, as on top of Livingstone\u2019s century, Phil Salt, Jacob Bethell and Sam Curran all made 50s. Livingstone and Curran combined for the key partnership. With 169 to win from 22 overs and four wickets down, England were behind the game but not by miles. Their 50 partnership arrived in 47 balls but soon they hit the brakes as the pair looked to take the contest as deep as possible. At one stage, they didn\u2019t score a boundary for 34 balls before two arrived in consecutive deliveries. It was only the beginning of the onslaught. The West Indies total of 328 was a record ODI total at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, and until Jayden Seales delivered the 45th over it looked like it would be enough, before Livingstone blazed 22 off five deliveries. \u201cThere was no point at which I thought the game was out of touch,\u201d said an exhausted Livingstone. \u201cMore than anything, I\u2019m happy to have been able to lead from the front.\u201d Six weeks ago, England had dropped Livingstone for the ODIs against Australia before Jos Buttler\u2019s calf injury gave him a route back in. In an honest conversation with managing director Rob Key, Livingstone said his one complaint was that he felt he hadn\u2019t been given enough responsibility. \u201cI had two years when I should\u2019ve done more than I did,\u201d Livingstone explained. \u201dBut I don\u2019t always think I was given the responsibility that I wanted. It\u2019s a two-way thing. I\u2019ve just asked for a bit more responsibility. I\u2019ve always believed in my abilities, especially in one-day cricket. \u201cPeople see me as this guy who can go in and smack a few sixes in a T20 innings, but I see myself as being able to hit more than a couple. I always believed I could do things like I did today.\u201d However, this was by no means the complete performance from England. Their showing in the field was bizarre, as four catches were dropped, sloppy fielding mistakes were made and stern words between teammates were traded. For only the second time in England\u2019s history, they used nine bowlers across an innings. In theory, it was Livingstone being proactive, but in reality, it came across as muddled. Of England\u2019s four specialist bowlers in Jofra Archer, Saqib Mahmood, Adil Rashid and John Turner, only Rashid bowled his full allocation with the remaining three left with seven overs spare between them. But where clarity was lacking in the field, it was present in abundance with the bat. The winning moment came in a flash. With 26 required off 24 balls, Livingstone struck Shamar Joseph for three consecutive sixes and a four to leave two runs required off the last three overs. A single from Dan Mousley meant that, fittingly, it was Livingstone who struck the winning runs and lifted his arms to the air in celebration.

Hopefully the one day side will be better prepared. And Oman were vibrant in orange outfits, too, they really stood out. With 12 nations playing, the crowd was a real mixture, not just the home side and their single opponents, and there was a really cool and friendly atmosphere. </p> <p>\u201cAre the sixes competitions elsewhere, do you know?

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from us today. Cameron Ponsonby\u2019s report from Antigua should land any moment. Thanks for your company, we\u2019ll be back on Wednesday to bring you the series decider from Barbados. Goodnight! Shai Hope doesn\u2019t pull any punches in his post match interview describing his own hundred as \u201cirrelevant\u201d adding \u201cif it doesn\u2019t contribute to wins, it does not matter.\u2019 Personally I thought it was a decent score, especially with the conditions, the outfield was heavy, the surface was up and down, but it was not enough. We need to be more disciplined, in the first game we showed that when he hit our straps things happen. We thought we had clear plans but we did not execute them well today. Liam Livingstone is the Player of the Match sponsored by \u2018Well, duh\u2019: The Tv coverage helpfully cuts out just as he starts to speak but I managed to get down that he felt he was back to his best at the end of summer, he feels like his game is maturing and it is a proud day for him and his loved ones. He heaps praise on his side and Sam Curran in particular \u201cSammy played beautifully.\u201d What a few weeks Liam Livingstone has had. Dropped for the Australia series. Recalled. Made Captain. Maiden ODI Century. Liam Livingstone seals the win with a drive to mid off. A broad grin bursts across his face as he sees his side home and finishes unbeaten on 124* off 84 balls. Sublime innings. The series is level at 1-1 with a decider in Barbados coming up on Wednesday. 47th over: England 327-5 (Livingstone 123, Mousley 3) Dan Mousley opens the face to glide a single and get Livingstone on strike to Shamar Joseph. SIX! Low full toss and Livingstone stoops low and hockey flicks for SIX over fine leg. AND AGAIN! Another full toss is dispatched into the stands over midwicket! Lookout! Joseph goes full and Livingstone bunts the ball back at him with ferocity, the bowler ducks and the ball skims for four like a pebble across an ice rink. All over bar the shouting now, England need two more runs to level the series \u2013 what a knock it has been from Livingstone, incredible acceleration. 46th over: England 303-5 (Livingstone 101, Mousley 2) Dan Mousley comes to the crease to join his captain and tickles a single off his pads to get off the mark. England need 26 from 24. West Indies need wickets. Curran slugs the next ball and finds the man on the deep point fence. Too little too late for West Indies? A drive down the ground sees Livingstone reach three figures. Warmly applauded by the England balcony, no great celebration from the England captain, he\u2019s still got a job to do. England need 33 more runs from 28 balls \u2013 he\u2019d dearly love to be there at the end. 45th over: England 298-4 (Livingstone 99, Curran 51) Liam Livingstone thrashes Jayden Seales for 26 runs off the over! Seales goes wide and England\u2019s captain picks him time and again, throwing his bat and seeing the ball disappear over the rope for back to back SIXES! A four through midwicket sees Livingstone to the cusp of his maiden ODI century! 44th over: England 272-4 (Livingstone 75, Curran 51) Shamar Joseph returns, West Indies desperately need to break this partnership. England would love it Kevin Keegan style if Livingstone and Curran saw them over the line. Sam Curran goes to a well made half century with a clip down to long on. Joseph can\u2019t get the breakthrough but he has been impressive in his first ODI appearance, he has 1-48 with one over left up his sleeve. England need 57 from 36. 43rd over: England 267-4 (Livingstone 73, Curran 49) Motie drops short and is slugged onto the grass banks for SIX by Livingstone. The next ball is length but Livingstone is onto his knees in a flash and smearing away flat for SIX more! Motie has 0-55 from his eight overs, this is already his most expensive ODI spell. England need 63 from 42 and Livingstone is ticking. 42nd over: England 250-4 (Livingstone 60, Curran 46) No boundaries off Roston Chase\u2019s final over but seven runs keeps England ticking, 79 needed from 48. 41st over: England 243-4 (Livingstone 58, Curran 41) Four singles off Motie and then Livinsgtone flicks the switch. He drives past long on for four to go to fifty and then smears a slog sweep over midwicket for SIX! Has the skipper timed this to perfection? 14 off the over and experience at the crease \u2013 England need 86 from 54 balls to keep the series alive. 40th over: England 229-4 (Livingstone 46, Curran 39) Chase it is and it is just three singles. England need 100 from the last ten overs. You do the math(s). Something\u2019s gotta give and soon. 39th over: England 226-4 (Livingstone 44, Curran 38) Shamar Joseph mixes his line, length and speed up nicely to get out of his over for the cost of just five runs. England need a big over - a twenty plusser - to get them back in touch. Who are they going to target? Chase has been hard to get away so far, he has two overs left and will likely bowl through. 38th over: England 221-4 (Livingstone 42, Curran 36) Tight lines. (Visions, dreams of passion) Just three singles eked off Roston Chase\u2019s latest frugal over. England need 108 from 72 balls and will need to open up the shoulders soon. 37th over: England 218-4 (Livingstone 41, Curran 34) Five off the returning Shamar Joseph. Livingstone has used up 47 balls for his 41, this must be his slowest innings for England? 36th over: England 213-4 (Livingstone 38, Curran 32) Eight runs off the over as Livingstone and Curran up the ante. Gah! 35th over: England 205-4 (Livingstone 36, Curran 29) There we go! Sam Curran breaks the maroon shackles with a four through midwicket, the first boundary in 34 balls. London bus boundaries \u2013 Curran drives the next to the fence too. 124 needed from 90 balls. You\u2019re still thinking about the Ants in the risotto rice aren\u2019t you? It\u2019s an OBOvershare. Erm \u2013 X marks the spot? 34th over: England 193-4 (Livingstone 30, Curran 18) Curran and Livingstone can\u2019t find the boundary, it\u2019s been more than five overs since the sponge was last breached. Five more singles off Chase \u2013 136 needed from 96 balls. RISOTTO UPDATE \u2013 There were ANTS in the Arborio. Ants. Actual creepy crawlies in the box of rice. Nevermind England\u2019s run rate \u2013 this is a culinary disaster. ANTS! 33rd over: England 188-4 (Livingstone 30, Curran 18) DEATH BY THREE SINGLES AN OVER. 32nd over: England 185-4 (Livingstone 28, Curran 17) Just three singles off the over and the rate climbs above eight an over. England are labouring. 31st over: England 182-4 (Livingstone 26, Curran 16) The game is simmering.  30th over: England 178-4 (Livingstone 24, Curran 14) Just three singles off Chase. England need 151 off the last twenty\u2026 29th over: England 175-4 (Livingstone 23, Curran 12) Hello Gruesome! Sam Curran clobbers his second ball from Motie over the leg side for SIX. It was a no ball too \u2013 freebie incoming\u2026 four more! Curran off to a flier. Incredible scenes at Casa Wallace as my beloved offers up cheese on toast for dinner before immediately bursting up from the sofa and declaring a haddock risotto is in the offing. What a rollercoaster. I can already hear the ladle in action. Uh oh. Just as I gave him the biggun\u2026 Bethell holes out to Roston Chase. The bat twisted in his hands as he attempted another swipe down the ground, Jayden Seales taking a solid catch. Right approach (England need runs and quick) but poor execution. Bethell\u2019s eye-catching knock comes to an end. 28th over: England 160-4 (Livingstone 21) Sam Curran is the new man\u2026 27th over: England 158-3 (Bethell 54, Livingstone 20) Things calm down with just a couple of singles collected off Motie. 26th over: England 156-3 (Bethell 53, Livingstone 19) Some scintillating strokeplay sees Jacob Bethell hit three boundaries in the over and reach a maiden ODI half century in style! A SIX over midwicket from deep in his crease sees Bethell to fifty. He\u2019s got something this kid. Remember another young batter arriving on the scene in ODI cricket with a skunky doo, a swagger and a penchant for hitting sixes? Answers on a text message postcard\u2026 25th over: England 140-3 (Bethell 37, Livingstone 19) Bethell and Livingstone tick along with a single each as we reach the halfway stage. Plenty of discussion on the wireless about the nature of Salt\u2019s dismissal. 24th over: England 138-3 (Bethell 36, Livingstone 178) Bethell leans back and slams Shamar Jospeh over midwicket for SIX. Hold the pose young man. England need 191 runs from 26 overs to keep this series alive. Brian Withington, as ever, is a fount of knowledge: \u201cHi James, Your earlier mention of a potentially abstract OBO without the benefit of TV pictures reminded me of the description of \u2018synthetic\u2019 Ashes radio commentaries by ABC from the 30s. These involved the broadcaster in Australia receiving regular telegrams from England that were then lovingly embellished by the team \u2018as live\u2019 complete with pencil taps for batting strokes and gramophone sound effects for crowd noise etc. I\u2019m not sure whether ABC owned up to its audience about the nature of the coverage, or what the implications were for any Antipodean spread betting markets at the time\u2026\u201d 23rd over: England 127-3 (Bethell 27, Livingstone 17) It\u2019s not pretty but it is SIX! Livingstone smears Forde over square leg with one hand off the bat. Some wibbling rivalry afoot? \u201cHi James, please ask Kevin Wilson - over 19 - if he\u2019s \u201cthat one\u201d and if so, where\u2019s me feckin\u2019 bike?\u201d emails Gareth WILSON. I\u2019m on tenterhooks and Gareth, crucially, is seemingly not on two wheels\u2026 Penny for yer farthings, Kevin Wilson? 22nd over: England 117-3 (Bethell 25, Livingstone 9) Lucky Lad! Livingstone aims a huge hoick to Shamar and gets a meaty edge that flies between Shai Hope and slip and away for four! 21st over: England 108-3 (Bethell 24, Livingstone 1) Captain Livingstone comes to the crease with his side needing 222 more runs. Make that 221 as he gets of the mark with a firm drive. I don\u2019t think he plans to get them in singles BECAUSE THE MATHS DOESN\u2019T WORK FOR ONE THING. Matthew Forde comes back and strikes with his first ball! Disaster for England as they lose their set man. Salt tries to launch the first ball of the over but gets nowhere near the pitch, sending a skier miles up and eventually down into the hands of Motie. Good innings but England needed him to make it count and get a big one. 20th over: England 107-2 (Salt 59, Bethell 24) Roston Chase and his stuttering, *judderman off spin are summoned. Bethell dances down again and pierces the field for another sumptuous four! *Remember this? Chilling. 19th over: England 102-2 (Salt 58, Bethell 20) Shot! The hundred up for England as Bethell uses his feet to get to the pitch, driving Motie handsomely through the covers for four. He can bat this lad, just ask Rob Key and Brendon McCullum. Not that Kevin Wilson is convinced\u2026 \u201cClearly Cox and Bethell are way out of their depth at this level but taking that to one side, Livingstone with his experience should be batting at three, ahead of the two novices, surely?\u201d 18th over: England 94-2 (Salt 56, Bethell 14) Leg byes a bonus for England as Rutherford slides onto the his and the ball runs away fine past Hope for four. Salt drives down the ground for a single and Bethell works off the back foot in style. 17th over: England 86-2 (Salt 55, Bethell 12) Motie twirls away after drinks. Bethell drives for a couple but can\u2019t rotate strike for the rest of the over as the spinner stitches together five dots in a row. 16th over: England 84-2 (Salt 55, Bethell 10) Sherane Rutherford replaces Shamar Joseph and it all goes a bit medium pace out in Antigua. Bethell stands up tall and cuts into the off side for a couple. Time for a well deserved slurp of electrolytes Yorkshire Gold. Drinks. 15th over: England 78-2 (Salt 54, Bethell 5) Five singles worked off Motie with no alarms, no surprises and NO handshakes of carbon monoxide. 14th over: England 73-2 (Salt 51, Bethell 3) Salt slaps a short ball from Shamar through midwicket to go to fifty \u2013 his first of the calendar year in ODIs. He\u2019s looked in fine fettle so far today and will need to kick on to a big score if England are to have a chance. 13th over: England 68-2 (Salt 46, Bethell 3) Time for some spin. On comes Gudakesh Motie fresh off his match winning 4-41 in the first ODI. Bethell runs him away fine past point for three runs to open his account. \u201cYou suggested that Sir Alastair might have been wearing waterproof waders. Are there non-waterproof waders?\u201d Milletts are lucky to have you, Andrew Cosgrove. 12th over: England 63-2 (Salt 43, Bethell 0) The bleach bonced Jacob Bethell arrives in the middle. He jabs down on a Shamar Joseph yorker and is given an examination by the bowler that he does well to survive. Top over from Shamar, removing Cox and working over the new man Bethell. Hmmm Jordan Cox\u2019s vigil comes to a sorry end as he flaps at a Shamar Joseph short ball and gifts a dolly to Hope behind the stumps. A curious innings, Cox is a swaggeringly confident character but that batting display was the complete opposite. 11th over: England 62-1 (Salt 43, Cox 4) A few wags suggesting that Jordan Cox is auditioning for the Test side which doesn\u2019t really work as a joke because the Test side go at it like the clappers and Cox currently has 4 off 18 balls. But y\u2019know, fine to join in. 10th over: England 58-1 (Salt 42, Cox 2) Tidy over from Shamar Joseph to finish the poweplay. Just a Salt single and a Jordan Cox leg bye off it. 9th over: England 56-1 (Salt 41, Cox 2) Salt doesn\u2019t time a full ball from Seales but still manages to lift back over the bowler for four. \u201cIf Sir Alistair was channelling Sunak\u2019s look, how long were his trousers?\u201d asks Damian Clarke. His trews were hidden behind a gleaming TNT branded plinth but I reckon the lantern jawed one is sporting your classic combo of navy chinos and pundit shoes, you know the ones \u2013 black with white soles as thick as two slices of Warburtons. That or his waterproof waders, fresh from the farm. 8th over: England 50-1 (Salt 36, Cox 1) On comes Shamar Joseph. Salt greets him with a bosh down the ground for four! That\u2019s England\u2019s fifty up, largely down to Salt. Cox has been subdued since his arrival, patting back dot balls before eventually spluttering a single to get off the mark. 7th over: England 44-1 (Salt 31, Cox 0) Don\u2019t bowl there to Mr Sodium Chloride! Forde drops short and wide and salt duly clobbers it past point to the fence. That\u2019s elemental my dear Matthew. 6th over: England 38-1 (Salt 26, Cox 0) Salt drops and runs a quick single. Seales keeps Jordan Cox honest, five dots complete the over. 5th over: England 37-1 (Salt 25, Cox 0) Salt is joined by Jordan Cox who defends his first ball to see out the over. Jacks had just started to settle into his innings with a clip for three and a blistering drive for four but he gifted his wicket away to Forde the very next ball. Elsewhere, Topsy and Tim are discussing the merits or otherwise of Friedrich Nietzsche. I can\u2019t quite hear from the next room but am pretty sure that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. And they\u2019ve lost the next door neighbour\u2019s dog? \u201cTo live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering\u201d Topsy is not taking the hound\u2019s disappearance at all well. Jacks jumps across his stumps and flicks in the air straight to the man on the square leg fence. He pounds his pads in frustration as he walks off. Softer than room temp Mr Whippy that one. Oh, I\u2019ve twiddled the nobs to make the OBO mailbag go to my email and not Tanya\u2019s, do get in touch if you are tuning in\u2026 4th over: England 25-0 (Salt 20, Jacks 5) Jacks clips for two through midwicket and Salt continues to hit through the line nicely, threading another drive through the cover region for four. Decent start this from the England openers, they are up with the rate. My toddler has commandeered the television with some pre bath-time Topsy and Tim viewing so I\u2019m forced into the bedroom to watch on my phone for a while. Trust me, it\u2019s just easier like this. 3rd over: England 19-0 (Salt 14, Jacks 5) We\u2019re back with images from the ground. Phew. Things could have got quite abstract if I was left to do 40 odd overs off a scorecard. Just a couple of singles off Forde as Jacks and Salt try and fail to penetrate the ring. 2nd over: England 17-0 (Salt 13, Jacks 4) The tv coverage is down but I can tell you that Salt hit a boundary and Jacks is underway too with 9 runs pocketed off Jayden Seales\u2019 first over. 1st over: England 8-0 (Salt 8, Jacks 0) Sprightly start by Phil Salt who picks up four with a crunching drive through the covers off Forde and makes it 8 runs off the first over with a couple of scampered twos in the same region. The tv coverage has just gone haywire so the next over or two might be a bit vague. What do you mean\u2026 Like I say, England are up against it\u2026 The players are on their way out to the middle. Salt and Jacks take guard and shimmy their shoulders. Matthew Forde is going to start with the new ball fresh off smearing those mighty sixes at the end of West Indies\u2019 innings. Srralastair Cook is sporting a Rishi Sunak style funnel knit sweater on my tv as he heaps praise on Shai Hope. He\u2019s right about one thing and it ain\u2019t sartorial. Thanks Tanya and hello all. That feels very much like a match-winning total from West Indies, England started quite well with some thrifty stuff from John Turner at the start but Adil Rashid was uncharacteristically expensive and England\u2019s NINE bowlers failed to keep Hope, Carty and Rutherford under control. England\u2019s rookie line-up will attempt to haul down the sizeable total in a few minutes, they\u2019ll have to go some. A corking century from Shai Hope with hearty support from Carty and Rutherford, and destructive cameos from Hetmyer and Forde. It\u2019s going to be a tricky quest for this inexperienced England line-up but Jim is the man to take you through it. Thanks for all your messages \u2013 have a lovely evening. 50th over: West Indies 328-6 ( Chase 20, Forde 23) Saqib with the final over. One off the first two balls, then Forde switches the on button. Lofts Saqib straight, up to lick the clouds, and down over the rope for SIX. The next is flayed against the wind for SIX more. A third SIX follows with a swivel and a club. Saqib signs off with a wide yorker, but that\u2019s a hell of a total to chase. 49th over: West Indies 309-6 ( Chase 19, Forde 2) After a series of singles, Chase is able to get hold of a wider delivery and thrash it to the point boundary. 48th over: West Indies 300-6 ( Chase 13, Forde 2) Saqib\u2019s seventh over is a miserly one, and West Indies creep past 300, with two overs left. What can these not-set batters conjure form the final 12 balls? 47th over: West Indies 297-6 ( Chase 11) On. The. Button. (until a wide full toss sixth ball). Pace off as the commentators have been imploring. Hope flies for the rope but this time Livingstone is waiting at long off and holds on as he slips to the ground. Hope limps off to congratulations from the England fielders. 46th over: West Indies 293-5 ( Hope 116, Chase 10) Saqib steams in. Chase drives squarely and with gumption and the ball flies for four. Hope throws bat, hoover and unwanted box of brandy glasses, the result is a ball top-edged behind for four more. Windies fast approaching 300 with four overs still left. 45th over: West Indies 284-5 ( Hope 112, Chase 5) Hope looks like he has cramp, or a pulled muscle in his thigh. Decides the aerial route is the most lucrative and promptly thrashes Rashid for a stinging four and a swarthy six. 44th over: West Indies 271-5 ( Hope 101, Chase 2) With a shimmied drive, Hope reaches three figures to a touch of the gloves from Chase and enthusiastic applause from this teammates. Cracking innings. He now has 17 ODI hundreds, behind only Gayle, Haynes and Lara. Excellent over from the returning Mahmood. 43rd over: West Indies 267-4 ( Hope 99, Chase 1) Hetmeyer swings one more glorious six, before falling victim to the trusty Rashid googly. Dances merrily down to the googly, gets an outside edge which flies into the hands of Archer at point. England breathe a huge sigh of relief. 42nd over: West Indies 257-4 ( Hope 97, Hetmyer 17) Hetmyer, batting without a helmet against Livingstone, huge necklace with a cricket bat hanging from it. Is dropped by Will Jacks at long on, who turns a hot potato into an upside down plate of mash. Makes the most of his life by thrashing Livingstone for two elephantine sixes, interspersed only by two wides. Eighteen from the over. 41st over: West Indies 239-4 ( Hope 95, Hetmyer 3) Adil Rashid comes on and immediately pulls back the scoring rate. the umpire checks for a stumping, but no cigar. \u201cI love cricket, Tanya. But I am finding it hard to get overly excited about this series.\u201d (I don\u2019t think you\u2019re alone Guy Hornsby). \u201cIt\u2019s great to see these two teams play, and I\u2019ll always have time for the West Indies. And my, Sherfane Rutherford certainly isn\u2019t bothered what I think. In a 5-an-over game for everyone else, he\u2019s broken this open. If we need to chase more than 300, that\u2019s going to be a huge task. We seem a front line bowler short here.\u201d 40th over: West Indies 235-4 ( Hope 93, Hetmyer 1) Rutherford winds himself up for a booming four but bottom edges past the keeper and just beats Archer to the rope. Deliberately irritates Livingstone by once more walking away as he is about to bowl. Booms him for six, but Livi gets the final laugh. Awesome innings though \u2013 54 off 36. Leans back, aims to clear extra-cover once more but this time doesn\u2019t get the power and Mousley dives into a smart catch. 39th over: West Indies 223-3 ( Hope 92, Rutherford 44) Curran has been handed the filler overs. Rutherford muscles him with enviable power for four amongst a handful of singles. 38th over: West Indies 215-3 ( Hope 90, Rutherford 38) Singles milked, then a sweetly-time four through the covers from Hope to take him into the nineties. A tough test for Mousley. Good afternoon Tom Hopkins. \u201cI think it\u2019s notable that one player they haven\u2019t moved on from (and I\u2019m guessing are dreading the day they won\u2019t have the choice) is Adil Rashid. I\u2019m not sure he ever quite got the recognition he deserved, outside of Morgan (in a different way) he was for my money the most irreplaceable part of all that success. \u201dHe doesn\u2019t have the team around him that he once did, but let\u2019s still enjoy him while we can.\u201d Agree \u2013 he is quietly irreplaceable. England are desperately hoping that young Jafer Chohan, who came to Yorkshire via SACA, and has learnt under the watchful eye of Rashid, will grow to fill his shoes. 37th over: West Indies 206-3 ( Hope 85, Rutherford 34) Hope jiggles Curran past point where an adept bit of fielding saves four. A bit of this, a bit of that, but still six from the over. 36th over: West Indies 200-3 ( Hope 81, Rutherford 33) This feels like the calm before the storm. Livingstone brings on Mousley. A big shout for caught behind as Rutherford has a swing. England review for caught behind but not a quiver on the line to be seen. Rutherford finishes the over by opening up and grill-panning four \u2013 with pepper sauce. 35th over: West Indies 190-3 ( Hope 79, Rutherford 25) Sam Curran is thrown the ball for the first time, and scuttles in with his round shouldered approach. Four from the over. \"Age, experience and all the other excuses taken into account this is simply the worst ODI side we have had since 2016. Anyway good to speak to you in the winter months for a change.\u201d Good to speak to you too Peter Rutherford! Shorn of the Test players, this group do seem a little lacking in match-day wisdom (hardly surprising when they don\u2019t play any 50-over cricket). 34th over: West Indies 188-3 ( Hope 79, Rutherford 24) Turner is whistled back into the attack. Starts with a wide. A shorter ball is swung with a whip and swivel over a deep fine leg for six by Rutherford, who then pings four through deep midwicket. He and Hope share a hearty chuckle and they all take drinks. 33rd over: West Indies 174-3 ( Hope 74, Rutherford 16)Wow! Rutherford leans back and flays six against the wind. He and Livingstone have a petty battle over Rutherford not being ready for the delivery. The run rate creeps up to 5.27. 32nd over: West Indies 165-3 ( Hope 73, Rutherford 8) Archer puts the brake on, West Indies squeeze just three from his over. And we tick on. 31st over: West Indies 162-3 ( Hope 72, Rutherford 6) Rutherford replaces Carty and immediately has to tie his shoe laces. He pancakes his second ball up and over for four. Rashid looks quizzical. The cameras pan in on steaming barbeques of meat. A flick of the wrist, a googly, and an inside edge onto the pad and into the stumps. 30th over: West Indies 154-2 ( Carty 71, Hope 70) Carty goes for broke, swinging at a short ball from Archer. He\u2019s fallen for the trap but gets height on the ball \u2013 Turner gets his hands to the ball but over the boundary falling backwards, and can\u2019t push it back over the rope. Carty repeats the shot next delivery, the ball flies into Turner\u2019s hands again, but he can\u2019t hold on as he falls and rolls to the ground. Archer is furious and immediately serves up a wide. 29th over: West Indies 143-2 ( Carty 62, Hope 69) Adil Rashid back too, as Livingstone brings back the heavy mob in an attempt to make a breakthrough. Four singles from the over. 28th over: West Indies 139-2 ( Carty 60, Hope 67) Jofra Archer is back, now with sleeves on both arms. Immediately he turns off the tap, Carty nods out of the way of a bouncer. Ah, I speak to0 soon, as Carty playfully shimmies him over deep third. \u201cWe maybe need to give this England side a break for much of what has happened recently due to the young age and inexperience of the side,\u201d taps Brendan Large, \u201cbut the level of fielding, and particularly dropped catches, has been truly awful recently.\u201d 27th over: West Indies 133-2 ( Carty 55, Hope 66) Carty brings up his fifty by dropping to his knees, rolling the wrists and oiling the ball to the rope. Made at a pretty good lick too: 62 balls, the partnership now worth 121. 26th over: West Indies 124-2 ( Carty 47, Hope 65) Liam Livingstone pulls mid-off up; Shai Hope lofts Jacks over the top for four. At just over the half-way mark, West Indies have a reassuringly solid base. 25th over: West Indies 117-2 ( Carty 45, Hope 60) Ooof, I think that was a dropped catch by Salt behind the stumps, he certainly flies forward with the desperate air of a flailing man. Yes, the replay shows Hope pressing and the ball flies off the edge into Salt\u2019s gloves, but he can\u2019t hold on. Bethell falls to the ground dramatically, head in hands. 24th over: West Indies 114-2 ( Carty 43, Hope 59) A double change, as Will Jacks replaces Rashid. Nine from the over, topped off when Hope drives the last ball with style for four. 23rd over: West Indies 105-2 ( Carty 40, Hope 53) A youthful experiment with the peroxide bottle marks Jacob Bethell out in the field \u2013 and Livingstone beckons him to the bowling crease. Hope reaches fifty by lofting a pretty filthy pie way over midwicket for SIX \u2013 a sensible innings off just 66 balls. 21st over: West Indies 97-2 ( Carty 39, Hope 46) Enough! Hope flaps at Livingstone\u2019s first ball, Carty cuts his second which bissects the fielders and races to the rope \u2013 the first boundary for a while. Emboldened, Carty ploughs again \u2013 nine from the over. 21st over: West Indies 88-2 ( Carty 30, Hope 43) Mark Butcher reckons that Carty is struggling to pick Rashid, who with pushed up sleeve and impish beard reels in. A dab behind by Carty brings a single, but there are only another couple of singles to add to the pot. 20th over: West Indies 84-2 ( Carty 30, Hope 43) Three singles wrung from Liam Livingstone\u2019s hankerchief. Just 13 runs from the last five overs. 19th over: West Indies 80-2 ( Carty 29, Hope 41) England\u2019s spinners racing through their overs here, economically too. West Indies need to keep an eye on this. 18th over: West Indies 80-2 ( Carty 27, Hope 41) Marcus Trescothick watches with folded arms and a towel around his neck as Carty can only pick a single from Livingstone\u2019s over. An email! Hello Andrew Benton. \u201cI joined the multi-nation crowd at the excellent Cricket Sixes today here in Hong Kong, where in one match England let Oman score the highest of the tournament so far (160), dropping at least two catches in the process, and then proceeded to be on the receiving end of some excellent catching from their opponents that left them without a hope. Hopefully the one day side will be better prepared. And Oman were vibrant in orange outfits, too, they really stood out. With 12 nations playing, the crowd was a real mixture, not just the home side and their single opponents, and there was a really cool and friendly atmosphere. \u201cAre the sixes competitions elsewhere, do you know? Hong Kong\u2019s used to be big business in the 90\u2019s as I recall, but they stopped holding them a few years before covid and this is the first time in 7 years.\u201d All I know of is the Dermot-Reeve era 1990s competition \u2013 but OBO viewers around the world may know more. 17th over: West Indies 79-2 ( Carty 27, Hope 41) Rashid rattles through another, West Indies pick up three and they take DRINKS! 16th over: West Indies 76-2 ( Carty 24, Hope 40) Liam Livingstone brings himself on, sunglasses of course, and opens with a loopy legspinner, immediately dries his hands on the pitch. Mark Butcher says the ball is coming onto the bat better as the moisture rises from the pitch. 15th over: West Indies 72-2 ( Carty 23, Hope 37) A delicious on-drive from Hope as Saqib strays, celebrated with cow bells and flag waving as it crosses the rope. A handful of singles. 13th over: West Indies 64-2 ( Carty 21, Hope 31) \u2026so a repressed Hope sticks a big maroon pad down the pitch and lofts Rashid for six . The fifty partnership comes up off 62 balls. A testing googly squeezes through Carty\u2019s gate. 13th over: West Indies 54-2 ( Carty 19, Hope 23) England\u2019s shirt rises quite high around the neck, good for sunburn I suppose. Excellent from Saqib, who sends down nothing for the West Indies to go at\u2026. 12th over: West Indies 52-2 ( Carty 18, Hope 2) Time for Adil Rashid, who whistles through his first over of twirly stuff. 11th over: West Indies 48-2 ( Carty 17, Hope 19) Saqib, closely cropped of beard and head, strays a tad full and Hope drives him exquisitely for four down the ground. Saqib pulls things back with four consecutive dots. 10th over: West Indies 41-2 ( Carty 16, Hope 13) Turner goes short, Hope goes high, with the wind and a snuff of arrogance, and the ball sails over cover for the first six of the match. End of the first power play. 9th over: West Indies 33-2 ( Carty 15, Hope 6) Jofra gets a rest, to be replace by Saqib Mahmood \u2013 who recently signed a new three-year white-ball contract with Lancashire (though still with the hope of playing red ball should his body allow). The cameras pan to an inviting turquoise Caribbean Sea. Four stolen from the over. 8th over: West Indies 29-2 ( Carty 14, Hope 3) Carty has had enough of this cat and mouse and swings at Turner \u2013 missing wildly. Two balls later he drives recklessly to where three fielders are bunched like milk bottles, crouching square on the offside. Bethell leaps but can only palm the ball upwards (and save two runs in the process). Carty goes again later in the over, this time angling the ball down through the hovering trio, and picks up four. 7th over: West Indies 23-2 ( Carty 8, Hope 3) A cheeky breeze ruffles the flags and the T-shirts of the crowd, the sky full of fluffy mottled clouds \u2013 think a reception-class collage. \u201cA good battle between Jofra and Shai Hope\u201d says the commentator \u201cJofra is disciplined, as is Hope, knowing that this might be Jofra\u2019s last over.\u201d And a maiden it is. 6th over: West Indies 23-2 ( Carty 8, Hope 3) Turner tidy and quick. Quite an intimidating figure actually as he runs in. Most of the crowd lightly filling the stadium seem to be Brits. 5th over: West Indies 19-2 ( Carty 5, Hope 3) A third over on the trot for Archer, accelerating into the high 80s (mph) and varying his length. Five dots. 4th over: West Indies 17-2 ( Carty 5, Hope 1) A morale-boosting boundary from Turner\u2019s last ball, but a testing over from the young giant. West Indies defiantly not doing as Alastair Cook instructed and getting through England\u2019s initial burst. Turner goes around the wicket and Lewis swivels with six-hitting anticipation, but can only tipple the ball through to Salt 3rd over: West Indies 12-1 (Lewis 4, Carty 1) Archer tries to tempt Lewis with a bouncer, but he shows admirable restraint, and finishes the over with a fuller length ball that Lewis plays straight back down the pitch for a single. 2nd over: West Indies 7-1 (Lewis 0, Carty 0) King drives his second ball through the off side for four with some style, but two balls later is walking back to the dressing room. Turner raises his long arm in bouncing delight. A first international wicket for young Turner as King drives rakishly away from the body and Jordan Cox pounces at backward point. 1st over: West Indies 1-0 (King 1, Lewis 0) Jofra Archer has the new ball, little white beads threaded through the bottom of his braids, a sleeve on his right arm, red soles on his boots. One of his trouser legs looks as if its has been chewed off at the bottom by a hungry dog. Just a single from the over. The players are out, as is the sun, away we go. Apologies, I\u2019ve just realised the email address on the page was wrong. Should now work \u2013 ping things this way if you have something on your mind: tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com A steaming plate of cheese on toast enters the room alongside my son, sadly none for me. Cook thinks we could see 15 overs of \u201cheavy seam\u201d from England to start. Pitch watch: Carlos Brathwaite gets intimate with the batting surface \u2013 \u201cWhat is a good length? Six to eight metres from the popping crease. What Jaydon Seales did really well is get from being defensive at eight metres to being attacking a six metres.\u201d Jason Holder and Alastair Cook both agree that West Indies need to get through this initial burst from England. A twelfth ODI loss in 18 matches? \u201cNot where England is at\u201d One change for West Indies too, Shamar Joseph makes his debut, Alzarri Joseph takes a rest. West Indies XI: Brandon King, Evin Lewis, Keacy Carty, Shai Hope (capt and wk), Sherfane Rutherford, Shimron Hetmyer, Roston Chase, Shamar Joseph, Gudakesh Motie, Matthew Forde, Jayden Seales One change \u2013 Saqib Mahmood comes in for Jamie Overton. England XI: Phil Salt (wk), Will Jacks, Jordan Cox, Jacob Bethhell, Liam Livingstone (capt), Sam Curran, Dan Mousley, Adil Rashid, Jofra Archer, Saqib Mahmood, John Turner Alastair Cook says that this England size looks much better balanced. Liam Livingstone calls correctly! Hello and welcome to match two of this white-ball series, sliced into the schedules like a piece of processed cheese. An eight wicket defeat wasn\u2019t how England would have chosen to start their three ODI and five T20 Caribbean adventure but on they plug, at least Jordan Clark, Dan Mousley, Jamie Overton and John Turner now have an ODI under their belts. West Indies outgunned England in almost every area after Shai Hope won the toss, with the returning Evin Lewis a hurricane force success with the bat, and West Indies knocking off a revised target with 55 ball remaining. Today we return to the Sir Vivian Richards stadium, North Sound, Antigua \u2013 with an early 9.30am start Antiguan time (1.30pm GMT).",

Here is a summary of the latest developments:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Israel on Saturday again carried out deadly airstrikes on north Gaza, where the UN calls conditions \u201capocalyptic\u201d, as Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah intensified rocket fire near Israel\u2019s commercial hub of Tel Aviv.</strong> \u201cThe situation unfolding in north <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza\">Gaza</a> is apocalyptic,\u201d said a joint statement by UN agency heads. Witnesses told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that Israeli warplanes twice hit Beit Lahia, adjacent to Jabalia, overnight. Israel\u2019s military on Saturday said dozens of militants were killed around Jabalia \u201cin aerial and ground activity\u201d.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Iran\u2019s supreme leader on Saturday threatened Israel and the US with \u201ca crushing response\u201d over attacks on Iran and its allies</strong>.

Israeli strikes also killed 12 people in the town of Amhaz and 31 others across at least a dozen villages, bringing the total death toll to 52, the health ministry said. The bombardment left 72 people injured, the ministry added. There was no immediate comment from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a> on the strikes.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Israeli police said 19 people were injured before dawn on Saturday in the central town of Tira.</strong> Three projectiles crossed into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a> from Lebanon, Israel\u2019s military said, and some were intercepted. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said two of those injured were in moderate condition from the attack, and the others had lesser injuries. A photo the service released showed damage to what appeared to be an apartment building.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Medics and Gaza\u2019s civil defence rescuers on Saturday reported three people killed in a strike on Nuseirat</strong>, in central <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza\">Gaza</a>, a day after AFP images showed the blood-stained shrouds of several people killed there in an Israeli strike.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A strike in Israel\u2019s Sharon area north of Tel Aviv injured 19 people, police said early on Saturday, after the army reported three projectiles fired from Lebanon into central Israel</strong>.

The strike was not preceded by an Israeli evacuation warning, reported AFP.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Hezbollah said on Saturday it carried out a rocket attack against Israeli \u201cmilitary industries\u201d in Zvulun, near the northern city of Haifa, after a drone attack on a base south of Tel Aviv</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a wrap-up of the day\u2019s key events: Israeli naval forces have captured a senior Hezbollah operative in north Lebanon, an Israeli military official said on Saturday. The operative appears to be a Lebanese sea captain. Earlier, Lebanese authorities said it was investigating whether Israel was behind the capture of a sea captain who was taken away by a group of armed men who had landed on the coast near the northern town of Batroun on Friday. Lebanon\u2019s state-run national news agency said an \u201cunidentified military force\u201d carried out a \u201csea landing\u201d on the shore of Batroun, south of Tripoli, at dawn on Friday. The force \u201cwent with all its weapons and equipment to a chalet near the beach, kidnapping a Lebanese man \u2026 and sailing away into the open sea on a speedboat.\u201d Israeli forces have struck the Sheikh Radwan healthcare center in northern Gaza, injuring four children, according to reports. In a statement on Sunday, World Health Organization head Tedros Ghebreyesus wrote: \u201cThese vital humanitarian-area-specific pauses must be absolutely respected. Ceasefire!\u201d Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei has released the following statement on the US\u2019s military support to Israel amid its deadly wars in Gaza and Lebanon: \u201cOngoing events in Lebanon &amp; Gaza have resulted in the martyrdom of 50,000 ppl in the last year, mostly women &amp; children\u2026 The US that claims to be an advocate of human rights, supports &amp; is complicit in those crimes. Plans &amp; weapons used are from the US.\u201d UNRWA, the main UN relief aid agency in Gaza, as well as the World Health Organization and the UN Children\u2019s Fund has resumed the polio vaccination campaign in northern Gaza amid Israeli blockages on aid and food. \u201cThis polio campaign is critical, but while we protect children with vaccines, they will continue to die &amp; suffer each day until there is a comprehensive &amp; lasting ceasefire, which is needed more urgently than ever,\u201d the agencies said. At least 43,314 Palestinians have been killed and 102,019 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October 2023, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Saturday. The toll includes 55 deaths in the previous 24 hours, according to the ministry. Two Microsoft employees who were fired last week after organising a vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza say the company retaliated against them for their pro-Palestinian activism. The two, Abdo Mohamed, a researcher and data scientist, and Hossam Nasr, a software engineer, organised the event outside Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on 24 October. They were fired later that evening. Here are some images coming through the newswires from Lebanon where Israeli forces have killed nearly 3,000 people across the country in recent weeks while injuring more than 13,000 survivors: Israeli forces have struck the Sheikh Radwan healthcare center in northern Gaza, injuring four children, according to reports. In a statement on Sunday, World Health Organization head Tedros Ghebreyesus wrote: We have received an extremely concerning report that the Sheikh Radwan primary health care centre in northern #Gaza was struck today while parents were bringing their children to the life-saving #polio vaccination in an area where a humanitarian pause was agreed to allow vaccination to proceed. Six people, including four children, were injured. Israeli forces have routinely targeted healthcare facilities across Gaza, leaving only 17 out of 36 hospitals across the narrow strip partially functional. In a report last month, Medecins Sans Frontieres detailed Israel\u2019s attacks on healthcare facilities and aid blockades across Gaza, saying: \u201cThe lack of access to health care is compounded by the lack of humanitarian and medical supplies in Gaza. Israeli authorities have routinely imposed unclear, unpredictable criteria for authorizing the entry of supplies.\u201d Here is the Guardian\u2019s Beirut correspondent William Christou\u2019s report on the Israeli forces\u2019 abduction of the alleged Hezbollah official during a sea raid: The Israeli military abducted who it said was a senior Hezbollah official in an unprecedented operation on Saturday morning during which Israeli commandos landed on the shores of Batroun, northern Lebanon, captured the alleged official and escaped via speedboat. In a statement, an Israeli military official said its forces captured a \u201csenior operative of Hezbollah\u201d and transferred him to its territory to be investigated by military intelligence. Axios media outlet cited Israeli sources as saying the captured man \u2013 Imad Amhaz \u2013 was responsible for Hezbollah\u2019s naval operations. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker minister of transport, Ali Hamie, said that Amhaz was a civilian boat captain, while Hezbollah did not comment on allegations that he belonged to the organisation.

He was taken from student housing near the institute, but was a resident of the Shiite-majority town of Qmatiyeh, said the acquaintance, who wished to remain anonymous. He was completing courses to become a sea captain, the source told AFP, adding that the man was in his 30s and was well known by the teaching staff at the institute. US has warned Iran that it won\u2019t be able to restrain Israel if it attacks again. The US has warned Iran against launching another attack on Israel, adding that Washington will not be able to restrain Israel if it attacks again, the American news website Axios has reported, citing a US official and a former Israeli official. Axios previously reported that Israeli intelligence suggests Iran is preparing to attack Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days, possibly before the US presidential election on 5 Nov.

Israeli forces capture senior Hezbollah operative in north Lebanon, Israeli military official says. Israeli naval forces have captured a senior Hezbollah operative in north Lebanon, an Israeli military official said on Saturday. The operative appears to be a Lebanese sea captain. Earlier, Lebanese authorities said it was investigating whether Israel was behind the capture of a sea captain who was taken away by a group of armed men who had landed on the coast near the northern town of Batroun on Friday. \u201cThe operative has been transferred to Israeli territory and is being investigated,\u201d the Israeli military official said, without naming the captive. Two Lebanese military officials confirmed to the Associated Press that a naval force landed in Batroun, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of Beirut, and abducted a Lebanese citizen. Neither gave the man\u2019s identity or said whether he was thought to have links to Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group. They did not confirm whether the armed men were an Israeli force. Three Lebanese judicial officials told reporters the incident occurred at dawn on Friday, adding that the captain might have links with Hezbollah. The officials said an investigation is looking into whether the man is linked to Hezbollah or working for an Israeli spy agency and an Israeli force came to rescue him. Hezbollah issued a statement calling what happened a \u201cZionist aggression in the Batroun area\u201d, but did not confirm whether one its members had been captured by Israeli forces.

Is this a small matter? The US that claims to be an advocate of human rights, supports &amp; is complicit in those crimes. Plans &amp; weapons used are from the US. Egypt is hosting meetings between Fatah and Hamas in regards to forming a committee to run Gaza following Israel\u2019s war on the strip, Reuters reports, citing a senior Egyptian security source speaking to Egypt\u2019s state-affiliated Al Qahera News. According to the source, Hamas insists that the discussions should lead to a comprehensive agreement on ending the war, as well a deal to release the hostages and Palestinians detained across Israeli prisons. UNRWA, the main UN relief aid agency in Gaza, as well as the World Health Organization and the UN Children\u2019s Fund has resumed the polio vaccination campaign in northern Gaza amid Israeli blockages on aid and food. \u201cThis polio campaign is critical, but while we protect children with vaccines, they will continue to die &amp; suffer each day until there is a comprehensive &amp; lasting ceasefire, which is needed more urgently than ever,\u201d the agencies said.

A suspected Israeli naval force landed in the northern Lebanese coastal town of Batroun early on Saturday and captured one person, a security source said, while another source confirmed the incident but did not say who was responsible, reported Reuters. There was no immediate comment from Israeli and Lebanese authorities. Pro-Hezbollah journalist Hassan Illaik shared CCTV footage on X that appeared to show soldiers walking in a street, two of them holding a person. Lebanese transport minister Ali Hamiye, who represents Hezbollah in Lebanon\u2019s government, said the video was accurate but did not provide further details. Axios has reported that Israeli naval forces captured a senior Hezbollah official, Imad Amhaz, in an operation in northern Lebanon. Barak Ravid wrote the news on X, citing an Israeli official. Unicef has warned that the ongoing conflict in Lebanon is \u201cmassively impacting children\u2019s mental health\u201d. In its post on X on Saturday, Unicef wrote: \u201cTrue healing can only begin when this war on childhood ends. Ceasefire now.\u201d At least 43,314 Palestinians have been killed and 102,019 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October 2023, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Saturday. The toll includes 55 deaths in the previous 24 hours, according to the ministry. It does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Israel\u2019s military says 37 soldiers have been killed in Lebanon since it began ground operations on 30 September. According to Israeli figures, at least 63 people have been killed on the Israeli side since October last year. Two Microsoft employees who were fired last week after organising a vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza say the company retaliated against them for their pro-Palestinian activism. The two, Abdo Mohamed, a researcher and data scientist, and Hossam Nasr, a software engineer, organised the event outside Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on 24 October. They were fired later that evening. A Lebanese military source said on Saturday that unidentified naval commandos abducted a trainee mariner in the coastal city of Batroun, in an operation a judicial official said was likely carried out by Israel. \u201cA naval commando force kidnapped a civilian,\u201d the military source told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on condition of anonymity, adding an investigation was under way to determine whether the operation was carried out by Israel. A Lebanese judicial official said Israel was likely behind the \u201ckidnapping operation\u201d, the first of its kind since the Israel-Hezbollah war erupted in September. Speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, the official told AFP there was a \u201c90% chance\u201d that Israel was responsible. Contacted by AFP, the Israeli military said they were checking reports of the incident. Lebanon\u2019s official National News agency (NNA) said an \u201cunidentified military force\u201d carried out a \u201csea landing\u201d on the shore of Batroun, south of Tripoli, at dawn on Friday. The force \u201cwent with all its weapons and equipment to a chalet near the beach, kidnapping a Lebanese man \u2026 and sailing away into the open sea on a speedboat,\u201d the NNA said. An acquaintance of the abductee identified him as a student at the Maritime Sciences and Technology Institute (MARSATI) in Batroun, reports AFP. He was taken from student housing near the Batroun institute, but was a resident of the town of Qmatiyeh farther south, said the acquaintance who spoke on the condition of anonymity for security concerns. He was completing courses to become a sea captain, the source told AFP, adding that the man was in his 30s and was well known by the teaching staff at the centre. Unicef has warned that the ongoing conflict in Lebanon is \u201cmassively impacting children\u2019s mental health\u201d. In a post on the UN agency\u2019s X account on Saturday, Unicef shared a video and written message that read: The ongoing war in Lebanon is shattering children\u2019s lives, inflicting severe physical wounds and deep emotional scars. With prolonged periods of traumatic stress, children face severe health and psychological risks, and the consequences can last a lifetime. True healing can only begin when this war on childhood ends. Ceasefire now.\u201d Unicef said it had reached more than 10,000 children and caregivers with psychological and community support. The video also included the story of nine-year-old Mira, who shared the following: We were at home. Suddenly, there was the threat of bombing near our house. At that moment, we got scared and ran away. We don\u2019t know if our house was damaged, but the windows might be broken because they bombed near our house. Here we\u2019re doing social activities. I\u2019m making new friends, studying and learning. They\u2019re [Unicef] giving us blankets and supplies. I feel a strong sense of longing to return home, to sleep in my own bed and play with my toys. Once the war ends, the first thing I want to do is visit my relatives. I want to check on them, and I\u2019ll hope we\u2019ll all be safe and well.\u201d Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said 11 people were injured on Saturday in an Israeli strike on Hezbollah\u2019s south Beirut stronghold, which has been hard hit by the Israel-Hezbollah war, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The ministry announcement came as the official National News Agency said the \u201cIsraeli enemy launched a raid near Karout mall... in the southern suburbs of Beirut\u201d. The strike was not preceded by an Israeli evacuation warning, reports AFP.

The two, Abdo Mohamed, a researcher and data scientist, and Hossam Nasr, a software engineer, organised the event outside Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on 24 October. They were fired later that evening. \u201cMicrosoft really crumbled under pressure, internally and externally, to fire me and to shut down and retaliate against our event, not because of policy violations, simply because we were daring to humanize Palestinians, and simply because we were daring to say that Microsoft should not be complicit with an army that is plausibly accused of genocide,\u201d said Nasr, who has been criticized on social media and in internal Microsoft employee communication groups over his support for Palestine. Both employees were members of No Azure for Apartheid, a group of Microsoft workers protesting the company\u2019s sale of its cloud computing technology to Israel. The group demands Microsoft sever all Azure contracts and partnerships with the Israeli military and government, disclose all ties with Israel, call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the conflict in Gaza, and protect and uphold the free speech of employees.

Lebanese transport minister Ali Hamiye, who represents Hezbollah in Lebanon\u2019s government, said the video was accurate but did not provide further details, reports Reuters. Here are some of the latest images coming in via the newswires: Hezbollah said on Saturday it carried out a rocket attack against Israeli \u201cmilitary industries\u201d in Zvulun, near the northern city of Haifa, after a drone attack on a base south of Tel Aviv, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Twice on Saturday, \u201csalvoes of rockets\u201d were fired at \u201cthe Zvulun base for military industries north of the city of Haifa\u201d, the group said in a statement.

AFP images from Tira, a predominantly Arab town about 25 kilometres (15 miles) northeast of Tel Aviv, showed the upper wall blown out in what appeared to be a residential building. Several cars below were crushed. Israel\u2019s military said a strike around the southern Lebanese city of Tyre on Friday killed two fighters \u201cresponsible for firing over 400 projectiles at Israel over the last month alone\u201d. Israel on Saturday again carried out deadly airstrikes on north Gaza, where the UN calls conditions \u201capocalyptic\u201d, as Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah intensified rocket fire near Israel\u2019s commercial hub of Tel Aviv. Since 6 October Israeli forces have carried out a major air and ground assault on north Gaza, centred on the Jabalia area, vowing to stop attempts by Hamas militants from regrouping. \u201cThe situation unfolding in north Gaza is apocalyptic,\u201d said a joint statement by UN agency heads, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cThe area has been under siege for almost a month, denied basic aid and life-saving supplies while bombardment and other attacks continue,\u201d the heads of the humanitarian, health and other agencies said. The entire Palestinian population in north Gaza is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence.\u201d Witnesses told AFP that Israeli warplanes twice hit Beit Lahia, adjacent to Jabalia, overnight. Israel\u2019s military on Saturday said dozens of militants were killed around Jabalia \u201cin aerial and ground activity\u201d. Hezbollah said it had targeted Israel\u2019s Palmachim airbase in southern Tel Aviv on Saturday with drones, reports Reuters. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the attack. Bin bags were piling up at one end of the chaotic main thoroughfare in Shuafat refugee camp on Friday morning as shoppers walked by, stepping over a stream of wastewater trickling from a nearby drainpipe. Poor sanitation is just one of the UN-administered Palestinian camp\u2019s problems \u2013 but things will get much worse. Despite huge international pressure not to jeopardise the work of Unrwa, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, the Israeli parliament voted this week to ban the organisation from operating on its soil. It also declared it a terror group, in effect severing all cooperation and communication between the UN agency and the Jewish state. At present it is unclear how the new laws, which are supposed to come into effect in 90 days, will affect aid in Gaza, where UN officials say humanitarian efforts for 2.3 million people are \u201ccompletely dependent\u201d on Unrwa staff, facilities and logistical capabilities. Another 900,000 Palestinians in the West Bank rely on the organisation for basic services, which the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority does not have the capacity to take over, leading to fears it could collapse altogether. \u201cI have studied Unrwa for many years; I can emphatically say there is no alternative. It is not like other UN agencies in terms of the scope and scale of what the international community and Israel has asked it to provide while there is no solution to the conflict,\u201d said Dr Maya Rosenfeld, a sociologist and anthropologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \u201cEmergency providers can step in for a short time, but they cannot replace what Unrwa does long-term. It is too big to fail,\u201d she added. The new bills could yet be vetoed by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, if he can be persuaded to by western allies who support Unrwa\u2019s activities, and they will almost certainly be challenged in petitions made by human rights groups to Israel\u2019s supreme court. At stake are 96 schools in the West Bank serving 45,000 students, as well as 43 health centres, food distribution services for refugee families, and psychological support services, according to the agency\u2019s website. Before the war in Gaza, it operated 278 schools for 290,000 students, ran 22 medical centres, and distributed food packages to 1.1 million people, and now serves as a crucial emergency lifeline. The anti-Unrwa legislation, passed by a 92-10 vote in the Knesset late on Monday evening, marks an all-time low in Israel\u2019s relationship with the UN, which it has long accused of bias. A coalition of pro-Iran groups in Iraq said it carried out four drone attacks on the Israeli resort of Eilat on Saturday, after Israel said it intercepted three drones approaching from the east, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). In a statement, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq said it was behind the attacks on what it called \u201cfour vital targets\u201d in the resort on Israel\u2019s Red Sea coast, all conducted within one hour. Iraqi pro-Iran groups say they have carried out a drone attack on Israel\u2019s Eilat, according to a breaking news line by Agence France-Presse (AFP). More details soon \u2026 Hezbollah said on Saturday it had launched rockets at an Israeli intelligence base near Tel Aviv in the early hours of Saturday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). At 2.30am (12.30am GMT) militants \u201cfired a salvo of rockets at the Glilot base of the 8200 military intelligence unit in the suburbs of Tel Aviv\u201d the group said in a statement. The Israeli military said on Saturday it had intercepted three drones launched from the east over the Red Sea, without specifying where they came from, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cA short while ago, three UAVs that were launched from the east were intercepted over the Red Sea \u2026. the UAVs were intercepted prior to crossing into Israeli territory,\u201d the military said in a statement. Israeli airstrikes on Friday killed at least 52 people and injured scores more, the Lebanese health ministry said, while rockets fired from Lebanon fell on Israel on Saturday. Israeli police said 19 people were injured before dawn on Saturday in the central town of Tira. Three projectiles crossed into Israel from Lebanon, Israel\u2019s military said, and some were intercepted. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said two of those injured were in moderate condition from the attack, and the others had lesser injuries. A photo the service released showed damage to what appeared to be an apartment building. In Lebanon\u2019s north-eastern Bekaa valley, rescuers searched for survivors after airstrikes killed nine people and brought down a building that had housed 20 people in the town of Younine. Further Israeli strikes killed 12 people in the town of Amhaz and 31 others across at least a dozen villages, bringing the total death toll to 52, the health ministry said. The bombardment left 72 people injured, the ministry added. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the strikes. The latest violence comes against the backdrop of a renewed diplomatic push by Joe Biden\u2019s administration, days before the US presidential election, to reach temporary ceasefire deals. In central Gaza, Palestinians recovered the bodies of 25 people killed in a barrage of Israeli aerial attacks that began on Thursday, hospital officials said. Iran\u2019s supreme leader on Saturday threatened Israel and the US with \u201ca crushing response\u201d over attacks on Iran and its allies, reports the Associated Press (AP). Ayatollah Ali Khamenei spoke as Iranian officials are increasingly threatening to launch yet another strike against Israel after its 26 October attack that targeted military bases and other locations and killed at least five people. Any further attacks from either side could engulf the wider Middle East, already teetering over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and Israel\u2019s ground invasion of Lebanon, into a wider regional conflict just head of the US presidential election this Tuesday. \u201cThe enemies, whether the Zionist regime or the United States of America, will definitely receive a crushing response to what they are doing to Iran and the Iranian nation and to the resistance front,\u201d Khamenei said in video released by Iranian state media. The AP reports that Khamenei did not elaborate on the timing of the threatened attack, nor the scope. Khamenei had struck a more cautious approach in earlier remarks, saying officials would weigh Iran\u2019s response and that Israel\u2019s attack \u201cshould not be exaggerated nor downplayed.\u201d In other developments: Israeli airstrikes on Friday killed at least 52 people and injured scores more, the Lebanese health ministry said, while rockets fired from Lebanon fell on Israel on Saturday. Israeli police said 19 people were injured before dawn on Saturday in the central town of Tira. Three projectiles crossed into Israel from Lebanon, Israel\u2019s military said, and some were intercepted. The situation in the northern Gaza Strip is \u201capocalyptic\u201d as Israel pursues a military offensive against Hamas militants in the area, top United Nations officials have warned. \u201cThe entire Palestinian population in north Gaza is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence,\u201d they said in a statement on Friday signed by the heads of UN agencies, including the UN children\u2019s agency Unicef and the World Food Programme, and other aid groups. The US asked Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire to revive stalled talks to end hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a report later denied by the Lebanese prime minister. Two unnamed sources, a Lebanese political source and a senior diplomat, made the claim to Reuters, saying the US envoy, Amos Hochstein, had communicated the proposal to Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, this week.",

      "bodyText": "Detectives investigating historic allegations of sexual assault against Russell Brand have asked prosecutors to consider bringing charges against the actor and comedian. It follows a joint investigation by Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches and the Sunday Times, published in September 2023, in which four women accused Brand of offences including rape, sexual assault, and emotional abuse. The allegations date back to between 2006 and 2013, when the 49-year-old was at the height of his fame. He has denied any wrongdoing and insisted his sexual relationships have been \u201cabsolutely always consensual\u201d. Following the initial media reports, the Metropolitan police confirmed it had \u201creceived a number of allegations of sexual offences in London\u201d and elsewhere in the country. On Saturday it said \u201ca man in his 40s had been interviewed by officers under caution on three separate occasions\u201d. \u201cA file of evidence has now been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for their consideration,\u201d it said. At the time of the alleged offences, Brand was working as a presenter on BBC Radio 2 and Channel 4 and as an actor in Hollywood, appearing in films including Forgetting Sarah Marshall. One woman told Dispatches that Brand entered a relationship with her when he was 31 and she was 16. She alleged that the relationship, which lasted three months, was emotionally abusive and controlling and that Brand would refer to her as \u201cthe child\u201d. Another woman alleged Brand raped her in 2012 in his Los Angeles home, adding that she received treatment at a rape crisis centre the same day, the Sunday Times reported. The paper said she then messaged him to say she had been scared and felt taken advantage of, adding: \u201cWhen a girl say[s] NO it means no.\u201d Brand reportedly replied saying he was \u201cvery sorry\u201d. A third woman said Brand sexually assaulted her while she worked with him in Los Angeles and that he threatened to taken legal action against her if she told anyone, according to the paper. A fourth woman said she had also been sexually assaulted by Brand and that he had been \u201cphysically and emotionally abusive\u201d towards her, the Sunday Times said. The paper said the women it had spoken to did not know each other and had mostly chosen to remain anonymous. Following the allegations, the BBC and Channel 4 removed material featuring Brand from their websites, while YouTube stopped him making money from videos posted on his channel.",

      "body": "<p>Forget the details, forget the noise. Forget the specifics. Imagine you run a big club on a losing streak. You are looking to appoint a new manager. What do you want, ideally? You want a young manager on the way up, someone fresh, with vision and drive and personality. Someone who could perhaps still be leading the club a decade later.</p> \n<p>At the very highest level, most managerial careers are relatively short. The notion of a \u201cproven winner\u201d is a consoling but meaningless shorthand. There is no such thing; everything is fluid, everything is contingent; there is always a context; every career has an arc.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/01/manchester-united-confirm-ruben-amorim-manager-sporting-november\">Manchester United announce R\u00faben Amorim\u2019s appointment as head coach</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There are exceptions, most notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/sir-alex-ferguson\">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>, but few managers last more than a decade at the absolute peak. Management is hard. Football evolves constantly. For a head coach to keep developing occasionally at the cost of what has worked in the past, to stay ahead of the game, is brutally tough and requires not only insight but spectacular will and self-belief.</p> \n<p>Everyone tends, ultimately, to self-parody. It happened to Brian Clough, it happened to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and it is happening to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, as they reached not for the best solution to a problem but for the most characteristic solution. It is enormously to J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s credit that in his ninth season at Liverpool, after seven at Borussia Dortmund, he recognised that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/19/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-manager-farewell-anfield\">fatigue was gnawing at him and left</a>. And Klopp was somebody of unusual energy.</p> \n<p>So ideally you want a manager on the way up, about to blossom, with a full decade of greatness ahead. Identifying that figure is hard. Almost by definition they will not yet have achieved great things. Chelsea\u2019s appointment of Mourinho in 2004 was a rare case of the bright young thing being obvious, having just won the Uefa Cup and the Champions League with Porto. But when they tried to repeat the trick seven years later with Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, after he too had won the Europa League (as the Uefa Cup had become) with Porto, it failed. There are no certainties.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a sign of the lack of football knowledge at a decision-making level at Manchester United over the past 11 years that, until Erik ten Hag, they never tried to identify the rising star of world management. David Moyes was appointed seemingly because he bore a superficial similarity to Ferguson in being Glaswegian; in retrospect it seems mystifying that anyone thought the football with which he had sustained Everton would meet the demands of Old Trafford. Louis van&nbsp;Gaal was experienced and enjoying a pragmatic second flowering, but had turned 63 soon after taking the job; he was never a long-term appointment.</p> \n<p>Mourinho in 2013 might have worked but by the time he took over in 2016 he had been through his toxic exits from Real Madrid and Chelsea, second time around. There were plenty of warning signs he was past his peak and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/17/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-defensive-dogma\">the toxicity he naturally brought</a> \u2013 which is why Sir Bobby Charlton vetoed an approach when Ferguson left \u2013 would not be offset by silverware.</p> \n<p>Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was a necessary short-term antidote to that, a cheery club legend whose obvious happiness to be there immediately dispelled much of the gloom, but his appointment on a permanent deal was evidence of a board swept along by public opinion, unable to undertake strategic planning. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/fred-says-rangnicks-interim-status-a-little-bit-bad-for-manchester-united\">Ralf Rangnick\u2019s bizarre interim status</a> undermined him before he had begun.</p> \n<p>Ten Hag seemed a coach of great potential. He had won the Eredivisie three times with Ajax and, after thrillingly beating Real Madrid and Juventus, had taken them to within about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/08/ajax-tottenham-champions-league-semi-final-match-report-moura\">30 seconds of the Champions League final</a>. Not all promise is delivered upon \u2013 and he was 13 years older when he took the job than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/31/manchester-united-ruben-amorim-head-coach-start-international-break\">the incoming Ruben</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/31/manchester-united-ruben-amorim-head-coach-start-international-break\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/31/manchester-united-ruben-amorim-head-coach-start-international-break\">Amorim</a> is now.</p> \n<p>In Amorim, United finally have one of the thrusting pups of European management, somebody who drew interest from both Liverpool and Manchester City. Not only that, but there is an obvious similarity to Ferguson in that in a league that is essentially a duopoly, he took a third force to the title.</p> \n<p>Sporting are much closer to Benfica and Porto than Aberdeen were to Celtic and Rangers, and Ferguson had brought an almost unimaginable European success at Pittodrie as well. Ferguson was five years older when he took the United job than Amorim is now, but he too was a rising talent, who had succeeded with outsiders, ready for his chance in a wealthier, more glamorous league.</p> \n<p>As Ten Hag\u2019s example demonstrates, just because a coach has something approaching the desirable profile does not mean he will be a success. Perhaps more troubling for United, though, is the context that surrounds them, the size of the club, the depth of expectation, the incoherence of the squad.</p> \n<p>After early defeats by Brighton and Brentford, Ten Hag\u2019s first season seemed to have gone pretty well. Limitations of personnel forced him to amend his approach \u2013 as Amorim will have to change his too \u2013 and he did it well enough to get United to third in the Premier League albeit off the back of an exceptional season from Bruno Fernandes and a great and, as it&nbsp;turned out, unsustainable start from Casemiro.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2abd36a6-d392-42ba-9b76-d8f5e12af63f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VeA747mywek?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He resolved the Cristiano Ronaldo problem with admirable clear-sightedness and, while United were far from spectacular, it didn\u2019t seem unreasonable to think that his second season, with more of his own players, would bring further progress. It did not \u2013 and the players he brought in were ultimately what did for him. By the end the steely-eyed figure of that first season had become a risible character, who claimed that conceding 25 chances per game wasn\u2019t a concern and gibbered about the fluidity of Matthijs de Ligt\u2019s blood.</p> \n<p>In his fall lies a deeper fear. What if this is just what United do to managers? What if that is why only three coaches have ever won the title with United despite them being the most successful side in English league history, as though the club is a vast and truculent dragon who will submit to being ridden by only a tiny chosen few? What if there is simply something about the United job that is just too big, too difficult, too chaotic? Stare into it long enough, and the United job stares back into you.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Forget the details, forget the noise. Forget the specifics. Imagine you run a big club on a losing streak. You are looking to appoint a new manager. What do you want, ideally? You want a young manager on the way up, someone fresh, with vision and drive and personality. Someone who could perhaps still be leading the club a decade later. At the very highest level, most managerial careers are relatively short. The notion of a \u201cproven winner\u201d is a consoling but meaningless shorthand. There is no such thing; everything is fluid, everything is contingent; there is always a context; every career has an arc. There are exceptions, most notably Sir Alex Ferguson, but few managers last more than a decade at the absolute peak. Management is hard. Football evolves constantly. For a head coach to keep developing occasionally at the cost of what has worked in the past, to stay ahead of the game, is brutally tough and requires not only insight but spectacular will and self-belief. Everyone tends, ultimately, to self-parody. It happened to Brian Clough, it happened to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and it is happening to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, as they reached not for the best solution to a problem but for the most characteristic solution. It is enormously to J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s credit that in his ninth season at Liverpool, after seven at Borussia Dortmund, he recognised that fatigue was gnawing at him and left. And Klopp was somebody of unusual energy. So ideally you want a manager on the way up, about to blossom, with a full decade of greatness ahead. Identifying that figure is hard. Almost by definition they will not yet have achieved great things. Chelsea\u2019s appointment of Mourinho in 2004 was a rare case of the bright young thing being obvious, having just won the Uefa Cup and the Champions League with Porto. But when they tried to repeat the trick seven years later with Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, after he too had won the Europa League (as the Uefa Cup had become) with Porto, it failed. There are no certainties. It\u2019s a sign of the lack of football knowledge at a decision-making level at Manchester United over the past 11 years that, until Erik ten Hag, they never tried to identify the rising star of world management. David Moyes was appointed seemingly because he bore a superficial similarity to Ferguson in being Glaswegian; in retrospect it seems mystifying that anyone thought the football with which he had sustained Everton would meet the demands of Old Trafford. Louis van Gaal was experienced and enjoying a pragmatic second flowering, but had turned 63 soon after taking the job; he was never a long-term appointment. Mourinho in 2013 might have worked but by the time he took over in 2016 he had been through his toxic exits from Real Madrid and Chelsea, second time around. There were plenty of warning signs he was past his peak and the toxicity he naturally brought \u2013 which is why Sir Bobby Charlton vetoed an approach when Ferguson left \u2013 would not be offset by silverware. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was a necessary short-term antidote to that, a cheery club legend whose obvious happiness to be there immediately dispelled much of the gloom, but his appointment on a permanent deal was evidence of a board swept along by public opinion, unable to undertake strategic planning. Ralf Rangnick\u2019s bizarre interim status undermined him before he had begun. Ten Hag seemed a coach of great potential. He had won the Eredivisie three times with Ajax and, after thrillingly beating Real Madrid and Juventus, had taken them to within about 30 seconds of the Champions League final. Not all promise is delivered upon \u2013 and he was 13 years older when he took the job than the incoming Ruben Amorim is now. In Amorim, United finally have one of the thrusting pups of European management, somebody who drew interest from both Liverpool and Manchester City. Not only that, but there is an obvious similarity to Ferguson in that in a league that is essentially a duopoly, he took a third force to the title. Sporting are much closer to Benfica and Porto than Aberdeen were to Celtic and Rangers, and Ferguson had brought an almost unimaginable European success at Pittodrie as well. Ferguson was five years older when he took the United job than Amorim is now, but he too was a rising talent, who had succeeded with outsiders, ready for his chance in a wealthier, more glamorous league. As Ten Hag\u2019s example demonstrates, just because a coach has something approaching the desirable profile does not mean he will be a success. Perhaps more troubling for United, though, is the context that surrounds them, the size of the club, the depth of expectation, the incoherence of the squad. After early defeats by Brighton and Brentford, Ten Hag\u2019s first season seemed to have gone pretty well. Limitations of personnel forced him to amend his approach \u2013 as Amorim will have to change his too \u2013 and he did it well enough to get United to third in the Premier League albeit off the back of an exceptional season from Bruno Fernandes and a great and, as it turned out, unsustainable start from Casemiro. He resolved the Cristiano Ronaldo problem with admirable clear-sightedness and, while United were far from spectacular, it didn\u2019t seem unreasonable to think that his second season, with more of his own players, would bring further progress. It did not \u2013 and the players he brought in were ultimately what did for him. By the end the steely-eyed figure of that first season had become a risible character, who claimed that conceding 25 chances per game wasn\u2019t a concern and gibbered about the fluidity of Matthijs de Ligt\u2019s blood. In his fall lies a deeper fear. What if this is just what United do to managers? What if that is why only three coaches have ever won the title with United despite them being the most successful side in English league history, as though the club is a vast and truculent dragon who will submit to being ridden by only a tiny chosen few? What if there is simply something about the United job that is just too big, too difficult, too chaotic? Stare into it long enough, and the United job stares back into you.",

      "bodyText": "Right, here\u2019s your full time report via Ben Fisher at Molineux. That signals the end of this evening\u2019s minute-by-minute. Thanks for joining us. It was a really enjoyable game, and it\u2019s always a pleasure to bring you the live updates. Scroll down for all the gory details. Until next time! Matheus Cunha has got his breath back and been talking to the TV cameras after that one. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s all on him,\u201d he said on criticism of Gary O\u2019Neil. \u201cThe whole group has a lot of responsibility. We need to keep going. When you are a football player, you need to give your energy to the things you can manage.\u201d On Wolves\u2019 winless run: \u201cIt\u2019s so hard not to think about this because I don\u2019t think our performances are like having 10 games without a win. We need to keep smiling and keep working and the results will keep coming. This position is hard. It\u2019s like I always say, we have a lot of positives in the group. We need to believe.\u201d The official explanation from the PGMOL lads. The silver lining is they\u2019ve drawn their past two games 2-2 in battling fashion, coming from behind. Will it be enough to save O\u2019Neil? The post-match discussion probably shouldn\u2019t surround VAR after such a eye-catching game of football, but you can bet Oliver Glasner and Crystal Palace will voice a few complaints after that Mateta non-goal at the death. Thoughts welcome? I thought the officials probably got it right. Aaaaand breathe. The final whistle brings an exhausting 90 minutes of Premier League football to a close. A point apiece, a whole heap of entertainment, but very little satisfaction for either side in the end. Wolves remain winless this season; Palace have just the one victory. 97 min: The question was whether Jose Sa had two hands on the ball at any stage before the challenge came in, which resulted in Mateta getting the ball. He did. Just. Mateta has the ball in the Wolves net but the referee has blown his whistle for a foul. Now then. Will VAR take a look at this? Of course it will \u2026 95 min: An almighty cheer greets the awarding of a Wolves corner, which comes after Lemina\u2019s shot is deflected. Joao Gomes gets the broadcasters\u2019 player of the match award. 94 min: A point will satisfy neither manager and neither fanbase but it would be a fair result, in truth. There\u2019s still time for someone \u2026 92 min: Wolves are throwing everything including the kitchen sink at Palace here. They certainly don\u2019t lack for effort \u2013 and right now they look the more likely to grab a winner. Seven(!) minutes of stoppage time are signalled, as Henderson holds another header from Strand Larsen. 89 min: Guedes is booked for diving on the edge of the Palace box and accepts it willingly. It was, indeed, a dive. Can we please have plenty of added time here? This has been tremendous fun. 87 min: A nice bit of play from Bellegarde cutting in from the left results in a shot for Guedes, who picked up a good lay-off from Larsen. Saved. 86 min: Some semblance of composure and shape has returned to this game. Calm before the storm? 84 min: Glasner has blinked first. He\u2019s bringing on a defender. Boooo. Nathaniel Clyne replaces the luckless Nketiah. Goals: 82 min: This game is good evidence of why the Premier League is known as the most competitive and most entertaining league in the world, but not always the best league in the world. 81 min: Nketiah was played through there, in acres of space, but got his pass to Sarr wrong at the vital moment. Palace were pretty much one pass away from being 3-2 up. 80 min: Hughes does finally pick up a yellow card\u2026 he could have got one a while back. Actually, Glasner is going to replace the midfielder. On comes Cheick Doucoure. 79 min: No more predictions from me. This could end up any score. Told you it wouldn\u2019t stay at 2-1. Guehi ghosts in and scores! Munoz wins the header from a Palace corner, flicks it on and Guehi evades his man to tap home at close range. RIP defending. A great email comes in from Andy Flintoff (not that one). Unfortunately for Wolves fans, there\u2019s no catchy tune that fits the chant \u2018Maybe you do know what you\u2019re doing\u2019. 76 min: Palace are still cutting open the Wolves defence. Sarr has another chance but shoots straight at \u2026 Sa. I\u2019ll be shocked if this ends 2-1. It\u2019s just so alarmingly open at both ends. 75 min: Maybe Gary O\u2019Neil did know what he was doing with those changes? He was derided by the Wolves supporters, but the game has turned on its head. 74 min: Tell you what, Mario Lemina has made the world of difference in midfield. He\u2019s some player when he wants to be. Incredible from Wolves. Joao Gomes! Once again Palace are wide open in midfield but credit to the home side for putting a neat attacking sequence together. It\u2019s cut back nicely from the right for Gomes to slot it into the bottom right corner. 71 min: There\u2019s so much going on now in this game, it\u2019s hard to keep up. Mitchell sees a shot blocked from the left, then Kamada bundles it wide. It\u2019s like a basketball game. This was the Wolves\u2019 goal. The space in the Palace midfield is frightening, but it was fine play from Cunha. 69 min: Game on now! Wolves have been pretty listless since the break but that goal could be the shot in the arm they need. The noise level has ratcheted up a notch at Molineux. Where\u2019s that come from? Strand Larsen has levelled it up! Palace were seemingly growing in confidence and looking odds-on for 2-0 but Chalobah lets Cunha get the better of him; he squares for the Norwegian to slot home. 65 min: It\u2019s de ja vu. Wolves make another mistake in possession at the back and Sarr should do much better with the finish, curling well wide when he had time. Boos from the home supporters. They\u2019re furious with what they\u2019re seeing. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d chant the Wolves fans. Seems they don\u2019t agree with those changes. 63 min: Wolves are taking off Doyle, Sarabia and Toti Gomes. Lemina, Guedes and Bellegarde are all introduced. 62 min: The Palace fans have found their voices and their team could have scored two in a matter of minutes. Nketiah forges a way down the left and Sarr blazes over from 12 yards. Big chance for 2-0. Sa makes a mess of coming to punch a cross from Hughes and Chalobah fires home! There was some major miscommunication in the Wolves defence, with Strand Larsen heading it into space when Sa was coming to collect. Chalobah made a mess of a finish in the first half but that was superbly executed. 58 min: Sarabia is guilty of switching off and finds himself offside to stop an excellent Wolves chance on the counter in its tracks. The home fans are running out of patience. 56 min: It all suddenly gets very stretched but there\u2019s more wastefulness: first Ait-Nouri and then Sarr at the other end. Sigh. 54 min: \u2018Shoot!\u2019 cry the crowd as the ball drops from the Wolverhampton night sky for Doyle, but it\u2019s a tough volley from distance and his shot is scuffed. 53 min: Semedo has been on his bike up and down the right all evening. Wolves need to find him more often if they want to threaten the Palace danger zone. An email from Joe Pearson answering my xG query from earlier: Opta doesn\u2019t register Chalobah\u2019s effort at all, but gives Mateta 0.236 for his. Overall, it\u2019s 1.12 Palace, 0.12 Wolves. Looks like Opta is crediting Guehi 0.012 for the header, though. 50 min: Henderson needs a minute. He took that flush in the face, really brave goalkeeping. 48 min: Sarabia v Henderson round two in another 1v1 and it\u2019s the Palace goalkeeper who wins the battle once again. Henderson makes himself big and Sarabia takes his time (again) before firing straight into the goalkeeper. He took that one in the chops. 47 min: Wolves want a penalty for a shove by Lacroix on Strand Larsen. You\u2019ve seen them given but it won\u2019t be overturned by VAR. 46 min: Hughes wastes no time after the restart in sliding in heftily on Strand Larsen and he\u2019s fortunate not to be booked. Free-kick Wolves. Second half: A crucial 45 (to 50) minutes in the seasons of Wolves and Crystal Palace commences. You\u2019d have to think at least one of them will score a goal at some point. This was without doubt the moment of the half. Look away now Trevor Chalobah. Goalless at the break. Bring us goals. 44 min: As the first half draws to a close, I can tell you it\u2019s been a tale of wasted opportunities from both sides. Palace have certainly shaded it but you\u2019d hope the second half offers more in the way of quality. 42 min: Wolves are having a semi-decent spell before the break here. But their final ball\u2026 well, it\u2019s been abysmal. 40 min: Dean Henderson does his job when required for Crystal Palace. Sarabia will be kicking himself though\u2026 he took far too long with the 1v1 and the former Man United keeper smothered it. 39 min: Cunha is absolutely furious he hasn\u2019t been given a free-kick for a tug on his shirt by Kamada. Wolves will try and build an attack regardless but they can\u2019t play through the Palace lines at the moment. More grumbles. 37 min: Another good cross finds a Palace player in the box and this time it\u2019s Munoz on the six-yard line missing the target. Another criminal miss, really. 36 min: The home faithful are getting restless. Matheus Cunha has been profligate with the ball in forward areas, and there\u2019s some frustration being directed at Strand Larsen. He\u2019s not been involved enough \u2013 and he\u2019s been flagged offside on the occasions he has got involved. 34 min: Would love to know the xG of those two Crystal Palace chances. One of them ought to have gone in. Glasner will be tearing his hair out. 32 min: How on earth has that not gone in? Guehi\u2019s header finds Trevor Chalobah on the six-yard line but he takes a massive air-shot with the goal at his mercy \u2013 it then rebounds to Mateta whose effort smashes off Chalobah and flies wide. Goodness me. 31 min: Palace have upped the ante a little and it\u2019s largely down to Mateta, who is dropping deep to link the play, allowing the likes of Nketiah to run into the space beyond him. Will Hughes is having a decent game in midfield too. 30 min: Nearly an inch-perfect ball by Cunha. Larsen stretches out a leg to try and reach it but can\u2019t get there. Nice idea. 28 min: Mateta gets a chance to run through the centre, holding off the Wolves challenges superbly as he goes. Unfortunately for Palace, Nketiah doesn\u2019t quite connect with his shot after receiving the lay-off to the left. Sa saves easily. The keeper then comes out well to collect Munoz\u2019s cross from the right. 25 min: You can fully understand, watching this, why these two sides boast just one Premier League victory between them. There\u2019s effort by the bucket-load but close to zero finesse. I suspect the first goal this evening will be absolutely vital. 23 min: Some dicey play around the back from Wolves has supporters\u2019 hearts in mouths but they get away with it (just). They\u2019re lacking a bit of composure on the ball in general tonight. 21 min: Almost quarter of the game has passed and it\u2019s Rayan A\u00eft-Nouri 0-0 Crystal Palace. 19 min: A\u00eft-Nouri botches another promising opening for Wolves. He was trying to find Larsen in the middle but Palace got bodies back, so it\u2019s a corner. Guess who then smashes it over from the corner? A\u00eft-Nouri. He\u2019s been heavily involved so far, but it\u2019s not all been great. 17 min: Nketiah races through the middle once more and tries to buy a foul\u2026 Anthony Taylor the referee isn\u2019t having it. Neither side are keeping the ball particularly well. 15 min: Great defending by Lacroix to quash a Wolves counter-attack but there are groans from the home supporters after that. It really was a wasted opportunity by A\u00eft-Nouri, running into trouble. Palace are gradually becoming the dominant side in this contest. 12 min: Palace win their first two corners of the game. They\u2019ve got some height in their team tonight. 11 min: Nketiah is the latest to get his final ball wrong, but the former Arsenal man is looking dangerous as Palace\u2019s high pressing and quick attacks causes a number of concerns for the home side. Wolves have retreated somewhat after their early burst. 8 min: The pace of this game is lightning \u2013 and surely unsustainable. Both teams are flying harum-scarum into challenges but both are fluffing their lines when it comes to finishing chances. A\u00eft-Nouri drags a decent effort wide with his unfavoured right foot. 6 min: It\u2019s a triple chance for Palace and somehow they\u2019ve not scored. The second one fell to Hughes, which was the cleanest hit, but Dawson got his body in the way. 5 min: Looks like Palace aren\u2019t afraid of taking the direct route either. Sarr will be an outlet for the visitors down the right flank \u2013 he had the beating of Toti just now. Cunha has taken a knock for Wolves after a meaty ol\u2019 Guehi challenge. He left too much in there. 3 min: Talk about physical football\u2026 Wolves have been all about diagonal balls and towering headers in the opening few minutes. They\u2019re bang up for it. 2 min: Wolves have flown out of the blocks with some slick stuff, buoyed by a boisterous home crowd. Everyone around this place knows they have to win tonight. An early free-kick is floated onto Larsen\u2019s head and it all gets scrappy. Palace don\u2019t clear it properly and it\u2019s a corner. Let\u2019s go! The players come out of the tunnel and we\u2019re good to go in the west midlands. The music is dramatic and the lights are bright. After Southampton and Ipswich both picked up points in the earlier games, the best position Wolves would be able to climb to today would be 18th; while Palace \u2013 currently 17th \u2013 would jump a place above Everton to 16th. If Wolves do win, of course, it would leave Ipswich as the Premier League\u2019s only winless side after 10 games. Some of the afternoon reports have landed. Get stuck in. It will be fascinating to see how Palace fare without two of their most talented players, Eberechi Eze and Adam Wharton. Isma\u00efla Sarr was an exciting signing in the summer and should be good to watch in what looks like a mobile and speedy front line for the Eagles tonight. Daichi Kamada is a neat and tidy replacement for Wharton and should bring some bite alongside the tigerish Will Hughes. It\u2019s also interesting that Wolves have opted not to bring Mario Lemina straight back into the starting lineup after injury. Presumably that\u2019s a fitness thing, as he\u2019s usually a key player for Gary O\u2019Neil. I\u2019d politely suggest Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha need to step up with goals and assists to get the hosts going today. Some more Saturday football reading for you. Jonathan Wilson on Arsenal. *Grabs popcorn* There\u2019s been much talk about 3-4-3s in the past week with R\u00faben Amorim set to bring that system to Manchester United as part of his tactical revolution. The 3-4-3 is nothing new, of course, Antonio Conte and Chelsea won the Premier League using it a good eight seasons ago. And it looks like we\u2019ve got two teams using 3-4-3, or variants thereof, in this evening\u2019s clash. Both Wolves and Palace will play up to a focal point/target man striker, with two attacking midfielders/inside forwards playing in and around them. The benefit of such a system is that it lends itself to the \u2018box\u2019 midfield that managers like, while retaining some width and defensive solidity (that\u2019s the idea anyway). There\u2019s plenty happening in the 3pm kick-offs, in case it\u2019s escaped your attention. You can follow the games as they reach their denouements here. Wolves: S\u00e1; Bueno, Dawson, T.Gomes; Semedo, Doyle, J.Gomes, A\u00eft-Nouri; Sarabia, Cunha, Strand Larsen. Subs: Bentley, Doherty, Lemina, Andr\u00e9, R.Gomes, Forbs, Bellegarde, Guedes, Pond. Crystal Palace: Henderson; Chalobah, Lacroix, Gu\u00e9hi; Mu\u00f1oz, Kamada, Hughes, Mitchell; Sarr, Nketiah, Mateta. Subs: Matthews, Turner, Schlupp, Clyne, Doucour\u00e9, Umeh-Chibueze, Devenny, Kporha, Agbinone. Few at the start of the season would have predicted Wolves would be 19th and Crystal Palace 17th after nine games of this 2024/25 campaign \u2013 with just one victory between them. Wanderers have had their boardroom struggles, sure, but looked like they were going somewhere last season under Gary O\u2019Neil. And Palace claimed 19 points from a possible 21 at the end of last term \u2013 a run that included a 3-1 win in Wolverhampton \u2013 and generated some serious momentum under Oliver Glasner. This feels like a pretty big game at Molineux with both sides spotting seen some green shoots in the past week. Wolves could be buoyed by their comeback at Brighton last weekend, surging back from 2-0 down to clinch a spirited point, while Palace won at Villa in the Carabao Cup to give Glasner some welcome relief. In terms of team news, Mario Lemina is expected to be fit for the home side, while Sam Johnstone is available to come back in goal \u2013 although Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1 could be preferred. Palace are without key duo Adam Wharton and Eberechi Eze, which creates further headaches for Glasner. Kick off is at 5.30pm (GMT). Stay tuned for all the latest.",

      "body": "<p>How many more chances will Gary O\u2019Neil get to earn that elusive first league win of the season? Wolves, who deservedly trailed to Trevoh Chalobah\u2019s opener, contrived to squander a second-half lead after two goals in five minutes from J\u00f8rgen Strand Larsen and Jo\u00e3o Gomes had turned the tables on Crystal Palace. Perhaps Wolves were guilty of thinking the hard work was done.</p> <p>For long spells Wolves played like a team down on their luck and given they sacked their set-piece coach last month, it was not a great look for O\u2019Neil that both Palace goals came from dead balls, Marc Gu\u00e9hi eluding his marker, the substitute Gon\u00e7alo Guedes, at a corner to earn a point. Wolves have conceded a league-high nine goals from set pieces. Wolves are too easy to score against full stop; they also top the charts for goals conceded this season. The numbers make bleak reading. Wolves last beat a current top-flight team in March, when they overcame Fulham, and last kept a league clean sheet in February.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/ipswich-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">Jordan Ayew\u2019s late equaliser denies Ipswich first league win of season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the end \u2013 unusually \u2013 O\u2019Neil was grateful for the VAR, who backed up the referee Anthony Taylor\u2019s decision to disallow Jean-Philippe Mateta\u2019s 96th-minute strike for a foul on Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1. The Wolves goalkeeper knew he was in a race with Daniel Mu\u00f1oz for the loose ball after Mario Lemina slid in to prevent a Mateta cross from reaching Mu\u00f1oz. S\u00e1 attempted to smother with both hands, Mu\u00f1oz hung his right boot into the mix, the ball bobbled free and Mateta wellied into an empty net. The Palace bench ran wild. The PGMOL clarified that the decision stuck because the officials considered S\u00e1 to be in control of the ball.</p> <p>Critically, though, O\u2019Neil may have lost the support of the locals. Sections of the home crowd jeered his triple substitution soon after Isma\u00efla Sarr squandered a second chance to double Palace\u2019s lead.

      "bodyText": "How many more chances will Gary O\u2019Neil get to earn that elusive first league win of the season? Wolves, who deservedly trailed to Trevoh Chalobah\u2019s opener, contrived to squander a second-half lead after two goals in five minutes from J\u00f8rgen Strand Larsen and Jo\u00e3o Gomes had turned the tables on Crystal Palace. Perhaps Wolves were guilty of thinking the hard work was done. For long spells Wolves played like a team down on their luck and given they sacked their set-piece coach last month, it was not a great look for O\u2019Neil that both Palace goals came from dead balls, Marc Gu\u00e9hi eluding his marker, the substitute Gon\u00e7alo Guedes, at a corner to earn a point. Wolves have conceded a league-high nine goals from set pieces. Wolves are too easy to score against full stop; they also top the charts for goals conceded this season. The numbers make bleak reading. Wolves last beat a current top-flight team in March, when they overcame Fulham, and last kept a league clean sheet in February. In the end \u2013 unusually \u2013 O\u2019Neil was grateful for the VAR, who backed up the referee Anthony Taylor\u2019s decision to disallow Jean-Philippe Mateta\u2019s 96th-minute strike for a foul on Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1. The Wolves goalkeeper knew he was in a race with Daniel Mu\u00f1oz for the loose ball after Mario Lemina slid in to prevent a Mateta cross from reaching Mu\u00f1oz. S\u00e1 attempted to smother with both hands, Mu\u00f1oz hung his right boot into the mix, the ball bobbled free and Mateta wellied into an empty net. The Palace bench ran wild. The PGMOL clarified that the decision stuck because the officials considered S\u00e1 to be in control of the ball. Critically, though, O\u2019Neil may have lost the support of the locals. Sections of the home crowd jeered his triple substitution soon after Isma\u00efla Sarr squandered a second chance to double Palace\u2019s lead. Asked if he has the support of the hierarchy, the Wolves head coach replied: \u201cI\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m just going to carry on and do my job, I enjoy working with the group. We need to be better. All of it ends up being my responsibility, which I\u2019m happy to take.

      "body": "<p>The transfer to Russia of an estimated 10,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/north-korean-soldiers-at-ukraine-border-says-us\">North Korean troops</a> to bolster Vladimir Putin\u2019s illegal war in Ukraine represents an alarming escalation of a conflict that is causing ever-greater international insecurity and instability. The provocative deployment by the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, links the confrontation on Europe\u2019s border to the long-running <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/1/north-korea-pledges-to-stand-by-russia-until-victory-in-ukraine\">east-west standoff</a> on the Korean peninsula, potentially aggravating both.</p> <p>The US is plainly deeply concerned. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, forcefully warned Moscow and Pyongyang last week against sending North Korean troops on to Ukrainian battlefields. The US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, said that if Kim\u2019s soldiers \u201center Ukraine in support of Russia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/30/north-korea-troops-russia-kursk-ukraine-lloyd-austin\">they will surely return in body bags</a>\u201d.</p> <p>American alarm stems in part from the fact the war has not gone well for Ukraine of late. Weakened by faltering western military support, Kyiv lost more territory in October, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/31/world/europe/russia-gains-ukraine-maps.html\">mostly in the eastern Donbas region</a>, than at any point since the summer of 2022.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/22/high-russian-death-toll-fails-shift-opinion-ukraine-war\">cost to Russia</a> is high. It has reportedly been suffering up to 1,200 dead or injured soldiers a day \u2013 hence the need for reinforcements. But it is evident neither human suffering nor western sanctions are forcing Putin to back off.</p> <p>Broader political considerations are also in play. If Russia effectively internationalises the war by drawing in one of its allies, then pressure will grow on Ukraine\u2019s Nato backers to get more directly involved on the ground and in the air \u2013 which, despite the urgent pleas of Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, they self-defeatingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/13/nato-should-stop-seeking-new-foes-and-face-its-main-enemy-moscow\">refuse to do</a>.</p> <p>Kim\u2019s motives are not hard to read. Given his paranoid belief that the US, South Korea and Japan want to destroy his regime, he has welcomed the chance to get closer to Russia. He and Putin signed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/19/russia-and-north-korea-sign-mutual-defence-pact\">mutual defence treaty</a> in June. Washington says North Korea is supplying weapons, ammunition and drones as well as troops.</p> <p>In return, Kim gets cheap oil, food and, reportedly, Russian nuclear technology, in breach of UN sanctions. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/world/asia/north-korea-missile-launch.html\">North Korea test-fired</a> a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile towards Japan, the latest and most threatening launch in a long series. Kim is also said to be planning another underground atomic test.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Beijing is uneasy at Kim\u2019s courtship of Russia, fearing a loss of influence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>China has skin in this dangerous geopolitical contest. Long North Korea\u2019s most powerful ally and main aid provider, Beijing is uneasy at Kim\u2019s courtship of Russia, fearing a loss of influence. It worries that the troop deployments, on top of Kim\u2019s nuclear brinkmanship, may trigger increased US and European military and political involvement in the Asia-Pacific \u2013 and greater regional instability.</p> <p>Yet <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/us/politics/russia-north-korea-troops-china.html\">China\u2019s position is ambiguous</a>. Before the Ukraine invasion, President Xi Jinping and Putin agreed a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership. Like Kim, Xi is aiding Russia\u2019s war. He undoubtedly views the evolving China-Russia-North Korea-Iran axis as a key step on the road to 21st-century Chinese hegemony. But he does not want unpredictable Kim, or reckless, short-handed Putin, to blow up his plans.</p> <p>The North Korean deployment will strengthen fears that the war is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/26/ukraine-russia-war-nato-biden-putin\">fuelling a bigger, global conflict</a> between viscerally opposed systems of governance and ideology. For Ukraine itself, meanwhile, the North Korean move is more bad news. \u201cThe world is just watching, observing as this threat grows,\u201d a frustrated <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/world-merely-watching-as-north-korea-threat-grows-zelensky-warns/\">Zelenskyy said</a> last week.</p> <p>If Ukraine had permission to fire western long-range weapons into Russian territory, he argued, it could&nbsp;pre-emptively target \u201cevery camp\u201d in Russia where North Korean troops are assembling. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/sep/01/russia-putin-retaliation-ukraine-biden-arms-observer-view\">we have said before</a>, that permission should be granted.

      "bodyText": "The transfer to Russia of an estimated 10,000 North Korean troops to bolster Vladimir Putin\u2019s illegal war in Ukraine represents an alarming escalation of a conflict that is causing ever-greater international insecurity and instability. The provocative deployment by the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, links the confrontation on Europe\u2019s border to the long-running east-west standoff on the Korean peninsula, potentially aggravating both. The US is plainly deeply concerned. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, forcefully warned Moscow and Pyongyang last week against sending North Korean troops on to Ukrainian battlefields. The US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, said that if Kim\u2019s soldiers \u201center Ukraine in support of Russia, they will surely return in body bags\u201d. American alarm stems in part from the fact the war has not gone well for Ukraine of late. Weakened by faltering western military support, Kyiv lost more territory in October, mostly in the eastern Donbas region, than at any point since the summer of 2022. The cost to Russia is high. It has reportedly been suffering up to 1,200 dead or injured soldiers a day \u2013 hence the need for reinforcements. But it is evident neither human suffering nor western sanctions are forcing Putin to back off. Broader political considerations are also in play. If Russia effectively internationalises the war by drawing in one of its allies, then pressure will grow on Ukraine\u2019s Nato backers to get more directly involved on the ground and in the air \u2013 which, despite the urgent pleas of Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, they self-defeatingly refuse to do. Kim\u2019s motives are not hard to read. Given his paranoid belief that the US, South Korea and Japan want to destroy his regime, he has welcomed the chance to get closer to Russia. He and Putin signed a mutual defence treaty in June. Washington says North Korea is supplying weapons, ammunition and drones as well as troops. In return, Kim gets cheap oil, food and, reportedly, Russian nuclear technology, in breach of UN sanctions. Last week, North Korea test-fired a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile towards Japan, the latest and most threatening launch in a long series. Kim is also said to be planning another underground atomic test. China has skin in this dangerous geopolitical contest. Long North Korea\u2019s most powerful ally and main aid provider, Beijing is uneasy at Kim\u2019s courtship of Russia, fearing a loss of influence. It worries that the troop deployments, on top of Kim\u2019s nuclear brinkmanship, may trigger increased US and European military and political involvement in the Asia-Pacific \u2013 and greater regional instability. Yet China\u2019s position is ambiguous. Before the Ukraine invasion, President Xi Jinping and Putin agreed a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership. Like Kim, Xi is aiding Russia\u2019s war. He undoubtedly views the evolving China-Russia-North Korea-Iran axis as a key step on the road to 21st-century Chinese hegemony. But he does not want unpredictable Kim, or reckless, short-handed Putin, to blow up his plans. The North Korean deployment will strengthen fears that the war is fuelling a bigger, global conflict between viscerally opposed systems of governance and ideology. For Ukraine itself, meanwhile, the North Korean move is more bad news. \u201cThe world is just watching, observing as this threat grows,\u201d a frustrated Zelenskyy said last week. If Ukraine had permission to fire western long-range weapons into Russian territory, he argued, it could pre-emptively target \u201cevery camp\u201d in Russia where North Korean troops are assembling. As we have said before, that permission should be granted. Why must Ukraine keep fighting with one hand tied behind its back? Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "bodyText": "Labour has thrown down an immediate challenge to the new Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, to back Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget plans for big increases in tax, spending and borrowing, as a huge political divide threatened to open up over economic policy and the future of public services. All the main party leaders congratulated Badenoch on Saturday on becoming the first black leader of a main UK party after she stormed to victory over former immigration minister Robert Jenrick with 56.5% of the vote among Conservative party members. Badenoch, 44, the daughter of Nigerian parents, is the fourth female Tory leader after Margaret Thatcher, and more recently Theresa May and Liz Truss. The chair of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, Bob Blackman, who announced the result, hailed her election as \u201canother glass ceiling shattered\u201d. Another Tory grandee described Badenoch, who backed Brexit in 2016, as on the \u201canti-woke, pragmatic right of the party\u201d. In her victory speech, however, Badenoch made no mention of her race or gender, instead focusing on the need for her party to be \u201chonest\u201d about its recent failings and to admit \u201cthe fact that we let standards slip\u201d. She added: \u201cThe time has come to tell the truth.\u201d She suggested that, if it did this and developed a coherent plan for government over the next four to five years, it could challenge Labour at the next general election. During her leadership campaign, Badenoch made a point of announcing few specific policies. After her victory, leading Tories suggested she should also be in no rush to do so over the coming months. Martin Vickers, vice-chair of the 1922 Committee, said: \u201cI think biding our time is a sensible approach for a party in our position.\u201d But after Reeves announced \u00a340bn of tax rises and changes to fiscal rules to allow a similar amount of extra borrowing for capital investment projects in Wednesday\u2019s budget, Labour insisted that it had now made its \u201cbig choices\u201d. It said the Tories should do the same in the next few days, when budget votes are held in the Commons, by backing or rejecting them. Speaking to the Observer, Reeves said: \u201cIf Kemi Badenoch opposes this budget, then she has to tell the country if she opposes investment to cut waiting lists, investment to recruit teachers and investment to build critical infrastructure. Labour has made its choices, now the Tories need to make theirs.\u201d The chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Pat McFadden, added: \u201cIf the Tories want to go round the country opposing every new public investment, they can be our guests.\u201d Since the budget, both the Tory party\u2019s outgoing leader, Rishi Sunak, and the departing shadow chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, have condemned the increase in employer national insurance contributions as a \u201cjobs tax\u201d, while Conservative MPs have launched furious attacks on increases in inheritance tax for owners of farms. In the next fortnight, there will be key flashpoints in parliament at which the Tories will have to vote on the budget plans. Changes to national insurance rates will require a separate bill, while it is also expected there will be some form of vote on changes to the fiscal rules. Sources close to Badenoch said decisions on who would be in her shadow cabinet had yet to be made and would not be finalised until before it meets on Tuesday. While Reeves\u2019s budget has been heavily criticised by business leaders, party insiders are broadly happy that it has had the support of organisations such as the International Monetary Fund, which backed the budget\u2019s emphasis on long-term investment. Reeves acknowledged, however, that the government now had to focus on reform of services and emphasised that just pouring money in would not lead to lasting, sustainable improvement. \u201cNow we have fixed the foundations of our economy, I am going for reform,\u201d she said. Reeves will lay out more ideas in her Mansion House speech in two weeks\u2019 time. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer, taken after the budget, found that it had proved less unpopular than most other recent fiscal events, with the exception of the 2023 autumn budget, which saw a reduction in employee national insurance contributions. On the positive side, the budget led to jumps in the personal poll ratings of both Keir Starmer \u2013 up 7 percentage points to -24% compared with two weeks ago \u2013 and Rachel Reeves, whose rating is up 11 points compared with two weeks ago, when she was at -29%. The pro-Starmer thinktank Labour Together, which has been conducting research into public perceptions of all the Conservative party leadership candidates, released findings to the Observer suggesting Badenoch may be electorally vulnerable among key swing voters. Those voters who lent their support to Boris Johnson in 2019 but swung back towards Starmer in 2024 were markedly unimpressed with the new leader of the Conservative party, the organisation found. Among Conservative-to-Labour switchers, 58% had a somewhat or very unfavourable opinion of Badenoch. Just 6% of these voters had a very favourable view. Sunak, who has stepped down as leader, said he was sure that Badenoch would make a \u201csuperb\u201d party leader. Commentators suggested the election of Badenoch heralded a right-ward shift for the Conservatives, with a greater focus on culture war issues as the party sought to win back voters who opted for Reform UK in July. Prof Tim Bale, of Queen Mary University of London, told the BBC this could risk further \u201calienating\u201d more moderate voters who defected from the Tories to the Liberal Democrats. He said: \u201cUnless they make a reasonable offer to people on public services, most obviously the NHS, then for all [their] talk about boats, bathrooms and boilers, it\u2019s not going to make much difference.\u201d",

In the US, voters vote for a president and running mate, or a ticket \u2013 for example, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz or Donald Trump and JD Vance.

But her budget signals a decisive break with the past. First, she threw off the deception that public services and the welfare state can bear the further cuts that Hunt had planned for departments other than health, education and defence. This was a significantly tax-increasing budget: Reeves announced around \u00a340bn of tax rises, the bulk of which comes from an increase in employer national insurance contributions. That has its downsides: it risks disproportionately hitting the wages of the lower paid if employers pass it on through lower pay, as economists expect. It will also hit hard charities and small businesses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/01/ministers-urged-to-protect-gp-practices-charities-and-care-homes-from-nic-rise\">providing social care, health and childcare services</a>; they should have been more protected. But there are other specific tax changes, such as increases to capital gains tax, higher stamp duty for additional homes and reductions in inheritance tax relief, that will affect wealthy households more, and 3 million low-paid workers <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y37wqnvwxo\">will benefit from increases in the minimum wage</a>.</p> <p>Second, Reeves chose to relax her fiscal rule on public debt so that it accounts for the value of the financial assets that result from investment as well as its costs. This allowed her to increase planned levels of public investment over the next five years, which Paul Johnson, director of the <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/collections/autumn-budget-2024\">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a>, called \u201ca courageous move and a welcome focus on the long term\u201d.</p> <p>These two moves are very significant. The tax increase is big enough that there is sufficient left over after filling in the \u201cblack hole\u201d of Conservative unfunded spending commitments that Reeves can channel extra resources into public services, with the big winners being the NHS, schools and much-needed emergency funding for the justice department. The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that Reeves\u2019s boost to public investment will add an extra 1.4% to GDP over the long run.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problems across the public realm are so fundamental that even a fairly big cash injection will not go far</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But this budget could never be a panacea. The problems across the public realm are so fundamental that even a fairly big cash injection will not go far. The biggest sum is reserved for the NHS; but even that increase is in line with the average annual rise in funding it received from its inception until 2010. After increases in public service spending of 4.3% this year and 2.6% next, Reeves has only allowed for it to go up by 1.3% a year <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/collections/autumn-budget-2024?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwm5e5BhCWARIsANwm06gjdoih9Bi1SQYnr6M4lfJBpzAk8MlFIOy1FBJpu2kU3HEUqh286IwaAle0EALw_wcB\">for the last three years of the parliament</a>, <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2024/10/More-more-more-Budget-2024.pdf\">implying a further cut of \u00a38bn a year for unprotected departments by the next election</a>. The risk is that the extra spending slows the decline of the public realm but is not enough to improve it in line with people\u2019s expectations. While the tax burden is higher than it has been historically, a rising tax burden over the long term is the inevitable consequence of an ageing society with fewer working-age taxpayers to meet the costs of rising health and care costs: a fiscal reckoning that no politician has yet truly confronted. And there were important omissions on spending, notably on alleviating rising levels of child poverty through reversing some of the pernicious benefit and tax credit cuts of the last government.</p> <p>The OBR growth forecasts also make for difficult reading for the government; it predicts the extra growth that results from public investment will just be 0.14% of GDP by 2029, with the real benefits not secured until after the next election. But, as Will Hutton argues, that may be too pessimistic a prediction; and Labour has also promised to boost growth through other measures, such as planning reform and industrial strategy. Reeves will be very much hoping to beat the OBR forecast, because slow average growth translates into a worryingly anaemic prognosis for living standards.</p> <p>That this budget is laced with risk is not reflective of Reeves\u2019s ability as chancellor but of the terrible Conservative legacy she inherited. Ignore the howls of anguish from wealthy losers on inheritance and capital gains tax. This is a brave and bold budget that shows Labour understands the true scale of the economic challenge facing Britain in the 2020s.</p>",

The tax increase is big enough that there is sufficient left over after filling in the \u201cblack hole\u201d of Conservative unfunded spending commitments that Reeves can channel extra resources into public services, with the big winners being the NHS, schools and much-needed emergency funding for the justice department. The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that Reeves\u2019s boost to public investment will add an extra 1.4% to GDP over the long run. But this budget could never be a panacea. The problems across the public realm are so fundamental that even a fairly big cash injection will not go far. The biggest sum is reserved for the NHS; but even that increase is in line with the average annual rise in funding it received from its inception until 2010. After increases in public service spending of 4.3% this year and 2.6% next, Reeves has only allowed for it to go up by 1.3% a year for the last three years of the parliament, implying a further cut of \u00a38bn a year for unprotected departments by the next election. The risk is that the extra spending slows the decline of the public realm but is not enough to improve it in line with people\u2019s expectations. While the tax burden is higher than it has been historically, a rising tax burden over the long term is the inevitable consequence of an ageing society with fewer working-age taxpayers to meet the costs of rising health and care costs: a fiscal reckoning that no politician has yet truly confronted. And there were important omissions on spending, notably on alleviating rising levels of child poverty through reversing some of the pernicious benefit and tax credit cuts of the last government. The OBR growth forecasts also make for difficult reading for the government; it predicts the extra growth that results from public investment will just be 0.14% of GDP by 2029, with the real benefits not secured until after the next election. But, as Will Hutton argues, that may be too pessimistic a prediction; and Labour has also promised to boost growth through other measures, such as planning reform and industrial strategy. Reeves will be very much hoping to beat the OBR forecast, because slow average growth translates into a worryingly anaemic prognosis for living standards. That this budget is laced with risk is not reflective of Reeves\u2019s ability as chancellor but of the terrible Conservative legacy she inherited. Ignore the howls of anguish from wealthy losers on inheritance and capital gains tax. This is a brave and bold budget that shows Labour understands the true scale of the economic challenge facing Britain in the 2020s.",

Not just focusing on the negative \u2013 that we should be stopping fossil fuel exports. \u201cWe should be replacing fossil exports with renewable energy.

      "bodyText": "Netflix The Piano Lesson Film, US, 2024 \u2013 out 22 November August Wilson\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning play is about a black family living in Pittsburgh in the 1930s and the fate of their eponymous heirloom, which is of huge symbolic significance as it is etched with the faces of their ancestors. Willie Charles (John David Washington) wants to sell the piano, potentially to buy part of a Mississippi plantation and help them turn over a new leaf \u2013 but his sister Berniece (Danielle Deadwyler) is dead-set against it, the siblings split between moving forward and holding on to the past. The film generated strong reviews after premiering at the Telluride film festival in August, and has Oscar potential written all over it. A Man on the Inside TV, US, 2024 \u2013 release date TBC Ted Danson\u2019s new comedy series, from The Good Place creator Michael Schur, is a fictionalised adaptation of the 2020 documentary The Mole Agent, about an elderly man hired by a private detective to go undercover in a nursing home. Danson plays the titular mole, who poses as a resident of a retirement residence in San Francisco in order to solve a mystery involving the theft of a valuable necklace. The trailer shows the protagonist having a great time in his new digs, carving it up during happy hour (which begins at 3pm) and mingling with chatty old folk, who deliver lines like, \u201cEverything tastes like pennies, and none of us can feel our arms.\u201d Honourable mentions: Warm Bodies (film, 1 November), Alita: Battle Angel (film, 8 November), Return of the King: The Fall and Rise of Elvis Presley (film, 13 November), Cobra Kai season 6 part 2 (TV, 15 November), The Merry Gentlemen (film, 20 November), Joy (film, 22 November), Spellbound (film, 22 November), John Wick: Chapter 3 (film, 22 November), The Helicopter Heist (TV, 22 November), Cold Case: Who Killed JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey (TV, 25 November), Our Little Secret (film, 27 November), Senna (film, 29 November), Dune: Part Two (film, 29 November). Stan Nugget is Dead: A Christmas Story Film, Australia, 2024 \u2013 out 21 November For a long time Australia had very few Christmas movies, but in recent years the list has grown considerably partly thanks to Stan, who\u2019ve made new Aussie yuletide films an annual tradition. This year\u2019s is an authentic depiction of family in that it\u2019s full of bickering, squabbling and strange dynamics. Steph Stool (Vic Zerbst) intends to skip her usual return to her coastal hometown and spend the festive season with her boyfriend\u2019s more cultivated clan instead. Plans change when the Stool family\u2019s beloved pooch Nugget falls ill, the adorable lil canine being one thing \u2013 other than blood \u2013 that unites them. First-time feature director Imogen McCluskey\u2019s film has an air of restrained chaos, rather than the fully bonkers Christmas experience \u00e0 la 1998\u2019s Crackers, which not only kills a dog but blows it up in a barbecue accident. Tonally, Nugget is Dead is a bit bumpy and the ending fizzles, but the more time you spend with the characters the more endearing they become. Bribe, Inc Film, Australia, 2024 \u2013 out 3 November This dense documentary investigating oil industry bribes, presented by journalist Nick McKenzie and anti-corruption activist Alexandra Wrage, is filled with the kind of cloak-and-dagger developments one associates with potboilers and airport novels \u2013 clandestine meetings, coded emails and secret-filled hard drives. With a particular focus on the Ahsani family, owners of Monaco-based consultancy company Unaoil, the film is a little scattered structurally but does a decent job unpacking a complex and knotty tale. Honourable mentions: The Illusionist (film, 3 November), La Chimera (film, 4 November), The Mountain (film, 9 November), Rain Man (film, 16 November), Parasite (film, 16 November), Sleepless in Seattle (film, 17 November), Inception (film, 23 November), A Fish Called Wanda (film, 24 November), Army of Darkness (film, 25 November), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film, 27 November), Hell or High Water (film, 28 November), The Departed (film, 30 November). SBS on Demand The Jury: Death on the Staircase TV, Australia, 2024 \u2013 out 6 November Adapting a format from the UK, this reality TV-ish production enlists ordinary people to form the jury on a manslaughter case that\u2019s sort of real and sort of not. Everybody in the courtroom other than the jury are actors, performing, word for word, an actual Sydney court case, transcripts forming the script \u2013 similar to the concept underpinning the whistleblower drama Reality. The big question is whether the quasi jury will arrive at the same conclusion as the real one. The Zelensky Story TV, UK, 2024 \u2013 out 5 November This BBC-produced documentary series about Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been generating good buzz, pegged as \u201can astonishing story\u201d by the Guardian\u2019s Lucy Mangan and \u201cextremely gripping\u201d by the Independent\u2019s Sean O\u2019Grady. Divided into three hour-long instalments, The Zelensky Story charts the extraordinary journey of the former comedian and actor, who became leader of Ukraine during a crucial moment in its history, rising to the challenge with great courage and fortitude. Barbarella Film, France/Italy, 1968 \u2013 out 9 November Sexist smut or absurdist satire? Barbarella will continue to be debated; what we know for sure is that Roger Vadim\u2019s high-camp classic has clung to the zeitgeist like a prophylactic. Jane Fonda plays an eager-to-please space adventurer on a mission to rid the world of a new superweapon, in a future where war and conflict are things of the past. Double entendres, zany production design and famously skimpy costumes abound. Honourable mentions: Triangle of Sadness (film, 1 November), Suffragette (film, 1 November), Homeland seasons 1-8 (TV, 1 November), Tokyo Vice season 2 (TV, 3 November), Bad Behaviour (film, 29 November). ABC iView The Tracker Film, Australia, 2002 \u2013 out 30 November Set in rugged outback Australia during the early 1920s, the lingering image of Rolf de Heer\u2019s meat pie western is of David Gulpilil with a chain around his neck. The great Yol\u014bu actor plays the titular character, who leads a trio of white men (Gary Sweet, Damon Gameau and Grant Page) across the country, pursuing an Indigenous man accused of murder. The film is marked with violent incidents \u2013 some depicted using paintings \u2013 but it\u2019s staged reflectively, prominently deploying Archie Roach\u2019s elegant but haunting score. Honourable mentions: The Space Shuttle That Fell to Earth (TV, 11 November), Midnight Oil: The Hardest Line (film, 12 November), Countdown \u2013 50 Years On (TV, 16 November), Headliners (TV, 19 November). Amazon Prime Video Civil War Film, US, 2024 \u2013 out 29 November Depicting a not-too-distant future America ravaged by bloody civil war, Alex Garland\u2019s one-of-a-kind disaster movie felt eerily ominous when it arrived in cinemas earlier this year, evoking memories of the US Capitol attack. God knows how it\u2019s going to feel when it lands on Prime a couple of weeks after the US election. Kirsten Dunst\u2019s protagonist is a war photographer who no longer has to travel overseas to cover violent conflict, embarking on a dangerous trek to Washington with a small posse including a Reuters journalist (Wagner Moura) intent on interviewing the US president (Nick Offerman). The air in this film is choked and toxic, and the drama tinkers on a knife\u2019s edge. Borderlands Film, US, 2024 \u2013 out 1 November I wish I could say Cate Blanchett single-handedly saves Eli Roth\u2019s adaptation of the popular video game franchise, but alas, while the film is colourfully and gaudily designed, the writing is chaotic and the action scenes meekly staged. Blanchett, sporting bubblegum red hair, plays a bounty hunter who returns to her home planet of Pandora (not the one from Avatar) to retrieve the missing daughter of a mega-powerful CEO. The film\u2019s many annoying embellishments include a wisecracking droid (voiced by Jack Black); damn you, C-3PO, for entrenching this role in popular culture. My Old Ass Film, US, 2024 \u2013 out 7 November I found this romantic drama with a time travel-ish twist pleasant for a while but ultimately schmaltzy \u2013 still, it\u2019s got many appreciators. After tripping on shrooms, teen protagonist Elliott (Maisy Stella) is visited by an older version of herself (Aubrey Plaza) who returns even after the drugs wear off. Her advice is clear: stay away from a boy named Chad. So, of course, Elliott meets a boy named Chad (Percy Hynes White) and falls for him hard. In writer/director Megan Park\u2019s view, a more interesting question than \u201cWhat advice would you give to your younger self?\u201d is \u201cWould your younger self listen?\u201d Honourable mentions: Ford v Ferrari (film, 1 November), Shrek (film, 5 November), Grimsby (film, 5 November), Citadel: Honey Bunny (TV, 7 November), In Cold Water: The Shelter Bay Mystery (TV, 12 November), Cross (TV, 14 November), Prey (film, 15 November), Cruel Intentions (TV, 21 November), Pimpinero: Blood and Oil (film, 22 November). Binge The Day of the Jackal TV, UK, 2024 \u2013 out 7 November Frederick Forsyth\u2019s novel about a hitman commissioned to kill the president of France has already been brought to the screen a few times, most notably in the 1973 film of the same name. Its first TV adaptation stars Eddie Redmayne as old mate Jackal, the assassin in question, in a story the official synopsis promises will be \u201cset amidst the turbulent geopolitical landscape of our time\u201d. Lashana Lynch co-stars as the MI5 agent out to capture him. Abigail Film, US, 2024 \u2013 out 10 November The eponymous villain in this blood-soaked horror romp is a devoted vampire and a devoted ballerina; hobbies include dancing with headless corpses. A bunch of extremely dull criminals kidnap Abigail (Matilda the Musical star Alisha Weir), not realising she\u2019s a ferocious bloodsucker keen to bear her fangs; they experience grisly deaths while trapped in a creaky old mansion. The film has significant pacing issues: it takes way too long to reveal Abigail as a vampire (which everybody knows going in) and then, in the last act, never seems to end. But it cranks up the carnage and certainly does what it says on the tin. Honourable mentions: Golda (film, 1 November), Repo Man (film, 1 November), Hoop Dreams (film, 6 November), Get Millie Black (TV, 7 November), The Convert (film, 7 November), Dune: Prophecy (TV, 18 November), Surveilled (film, 21 November), Brilliant Minds (TV, 25 November), Man on Wire (film, 25 November), Touching the Void (film, 25 November), Stop Making Sense (film, 25 November), The Fall Guy (film, 30 November). Disney+ Interior Chinatown TV, US, 2024 \u2013 out 19 November The trailer for this Taika Waititi-produced and co-directed series is jam-packed with plot developments, action scenes and gags; I\u2019m a tad overwhelmed but my interest is piqued. The story follows Jimmy O Yang\u2019s Willis, a part-time waiter and actor who plays a small role in a TV drama. When he \u201cinadvertently becomes a witness to a crime\u201d, according to the official synopsis, \u201che begins to unravel a criminal web in Chinatown, while discovering his own family\u2019s buried history\u201d. Co-stars include the very funny Ronny Chieng. Beatles \u201864 Film, US, 2024 \u2013 out 29 November Beatlemaniacs have had an amazing run recently, with a new song released last year, a restored version of the 1970 documentary Let It Be, and the announcement of not one but four upcoming Sam Mendes-directed biopics. The big hitters keep a-comin\u2019 with this Martin Scorsese-produced doco exploring the band\u2019s first trip to America. They were famously greeted/mobbed by hysterical fans at JFK airport, where they held their first US press conference. Ringo Star later recalled that \u201con the airplane, I felt New York, it was like an octopus grabbing the plane\u201d. Not sure if he said this before or after he started taking acid. Honourable mentions: Music by John Williams (film, 1 November), FX\u2019s Say Nothing (TV, 14 November), Out of My Mind (film, 22 November). Apple TV+ Silo season 2 TV, US, 2024 \u2013 out 15 November I was a big fan of the original season of Silo, a dystopian sci-fi set in a massive underground edifice where 10,000 people live; none of them know who constructed it, why they\u2019re there or what happened to the outside world. The setting continues a rich history of vertical spaces being used to represent social disparities and class structures, from Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis to Netflix\u2019s recent The Platform movies. The first season, in which Rebecca Ferguson\u2019s Juliette led the charge to discover the truth about the silo and the wider universe, ended with a great, twist-revealing final shot that functioned as a great big narrative ellipsis, virtually guaranteeing a second run. Honourable mentions: Blitz (film, 22 November), Bread &amp; Roses (film, 22 November).",

      "body": "<p>As kids we\u2019re warned not to accept rides with strangers. But when my editors told me to take Uber Pools around Sydney and write about the characters I meet, I had little idea I\u2019d be in for fashion critiques, tales of backseat romances, plenty of awkward silences \u2013 and mostly solo rides.</p> <p>When it first launched before Covid, Uber Pool was perhaps the truest form of ride sharing.</p> <p>Not only would passengers literally share rides, it offered seriously cheap fares \u2013 lower than even the artificially low rates Uber initially charged in early years to capture market share.</p>    <p>The novelty of riding with a stranger, and the more circuitous routes at prices not much higher than a bus ticket, proved popular. It was also like playing Russian roulette \u2013 passengers still got the significantly cheaper fare even if the algorithm failed to match them with a co-rider.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/18/i-am-looking-for-friends-perhaps-marriage-in-an-uber-pool-but-nobody-will-talk-to-me\">I am looking for friends \u2013 perhaps marriage \u2013 in an Uber pool, but nobody will talk to me | Brigid Delaney\u2019s diary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Uber\u2019s pool option disappeared at the outbreak of the pandemic, and while it has since been reintroduced, its savings are now less pronounced, and marginal if the algorithm doesn\u2019t find you a co-rider. </p> <p>I was curious if passengers had re-embraced sharing confined spaces with randoms. Post-pandemic data shows Australians are driving private cars more than ever. Have Sydneysiders become a special breed of overly precious recluses?</p> <p>To find out, I set off to take Uber Pool aimlessly around Sydney for the better part of a week.</p> <p>Scarred by my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/18/i-am-looking-for-friends-perhaps-marriage-in-an-uber-pool-but-nobody-will-talk-to-me\">former colleague Brigid Delaney\u2019s experiences of co-riders ignoring her</a>, I made an effort to project myself as someone you\u2019d want to get in a conversation with.</p> <p>To me, this means the opposite of real estate agent energy. I was polite to drivers, avoided overpowering cologne and dressed casually, as if meeting friends at the pub.</p>    <p>But as I\u2019d soon learn, riding in Uber Pools can make even those with strict hygiene standards begin to wonder if they have body odour.</p> <h2>\u2018They don\u2019t want to talk to each other\u2019</h2> <p>On the first night, I headed out shortly after 7pm.</p> <p>I greet my first co-rider \u2013 a woman in her 20s \u2013 as she enters the car and get a smile and a one-word answer.</p> <p>Soon, she\u2019s ignoring my questions, seemingly pretending to be deep in her phone, scrolling. </p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/21/sign-up-for-five-great-reads-guardian-australias-wrap-of-our-best-summer-stories\">Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>I totally get someone might want to avoid a conversation with a random guy. But I can\u2019t help wonder: why take a pool ride? </p> <p>Once my co-rider is dropped off, my driver tells me it\u2019s rare for pool passengers to talk.</p> <p>He says, as a driver, he despises pool trips at night as it\u2019s often drunk passengers who try to bring mates along.</p>    <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t realise when they\u2019re drunk, they\u2019re booking just one seat, not the whole car,\u201d he says. \u201cThey only see the cheaper price,\u201d he explains. This becomes a common gripe from drivers. Some admit they instinctively reject pool trips, as drunk passengers wanting extra seats for friends get refused entry and leave bad reviews.</p> <p>While I get the occasional co-rider, it\u2019s a mixed bag. There\u2019s the student we pick up from the University of Sydney\u2019s engineering school, who ignores my greetings as he pretends to be busy reading the label on his water bottle as if he\u2019s Facetiming Mount Franklin. The driver felt so bad he leapt in, talking to me about his family.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I honestly think people in Sydney are so lonely</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cancellations are also a pain. When booking a ride from Redfern to Marrickville, in Sydney\u2019s inner west, my first driver cancels on me. My second one does too. Clearly, the phenomenon of Uber drivers cancelling shorter trips also applies to pool.</p> <p>A driver finally arrives, and a few minutes into our trip I\u2019m thrilled at a ping from my Uber app that another rider is joining.</p> <p>As we detour to collect them, my driver explains his theory: most pool passengers are in their 20s or 30s, usually heading home at night when they\u2019re not rushing. \u201cThey want to save money, they don\u2019t want to talk to each other.\u201d</p> <p>My co-rider, Rama, joins in Erskineville. The young finance professional is heading home after work drinks. She says that while she opts for Uber Pool frequently, this is only the second time she\u2019s ever been matched with another passenger.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a gamble, I was actually hoping I\u2019d be lucky tonight and that it\u2019d be empty,\u201d she says. But her bad luck is my good fortune, as she tells me more about the appeal she sees in Uber Pool \u2013 cheaper rides from a company she feels has been offering poorer service over time.</p> <h2>Discounts and backseat marriages</h2> <p>It\u2019s unclear how much money I\u2019m saving. On a ride from Marrickville to Edgecliff, the pool quote is $23-$24, instead of $30 for the UberX private ride. I book the pool, but by the end of the ride in which I\u2019m the only passenger, I was charged $31, because my driver has taken a toll road which I don\u2019t even think saves us much time.</p> <p>An Uber spokesperson says pool trips are up to 10% cheaper than UberX, with the potential to save up to 30% more if matched with fellow riders. In my experience, the actual amount saved was unreliable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/25/experience-i-fell-in-love-in-an-uber\">Experience: I fell in love in an Uber</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, fewer than a quarter of the pool rides I booked had a co-rider. What did happen frequently, however, was midway through a ride, I\u2019d get a notification I\u2019d been matched with a co-rider. It said we\u2019d pick them up shortly, before they\u2019d promptly cancel.</p> <p>One driver told me this was common; someone being tempted by the discount at the booking page, but once they saw there\u2019d be a co-rider and a longer trip, cancelling to try their luck again.</p> <p>This trend makes it difficult to know how popular Uber Pool is in Australia. An Uber spokesperson says pool trips have grown by a factor of 3.7 in the last year, and the number of pool trips was 65% higher in the first half of 2024 than the same period of 2019.</p> <p>But these figures don\u2019t differentiate between actual shared rides and pool trips where no co-rider is matched \u2013 which I found to be the norm. </p>    <p>However, there is anecdotal evidence of Australians getting friendly in Uber Pools. A colleague recalls striking up conversation with a stranger in a shared ride. After getting along with them, she got out with them at the house party they were headed to.</p> <p>There are also reports of romance blossoming. \u201cWe\u2019ve even had a few couples making their way down the aisle after hitching a ride together!\u201d Uber\u2019s spokesperson claims.</p> <p>In fact, one driver, in his broken English, tells me he once had two passengers who got a \u201cfriendship\u201d out of the ride.</p> <p>\u201cThey were becoming very friendly with each other in the back,\u201d he chuckles when recalling the ride from the city to Manly one weekend afternoon. \u201cThey got out together at his place.\u201d</p> <p>It seemed I was destined to be ignored by fellow passengers or meet my future wife.</p> <p>Passengers clearly leave impressions on drivers. During one trip a driver bragged about some famous sports personalities he had driven. I nod along, but become uneasy when he recites one star\u2019s home addresses in an attempt to impress.</p> <p>More often than not, it\u2019s just me in the car, talking to drivers about how antisocial the average passenger is.</p> <p>One driver tells me two passengers struck up a conversation recently about US politics, before having a loud argument about Trump.</p> <h2>Icebreakers and fashion critiques</h2> <p>One night, going from Ashfield to Moore Park at the end of the night, I get talking to my driver Francis, an older Chinese-Australian man in his 60s, who wears thick 80s-style glasses and a terribly lopsided toupee.</p> <p>I\u2019m lamenting to him how lonely my Uber Pool trips have been.

      "bodyText": "As kids we\u2019re warned not to accept rides with strangers. But when my editors told me to take Uber Pools around Sydney and write about the characters I meet, I had little idea I\u2019d be in for fashion critiques, tales of backseat romances, plenty of awkward silences \u2013 and mostly solo rides. When it first launched before Covid, Uber Pool was perhaps the truest form of ride sharing. Not only would passengers literally share rides, it offered seriously cheap fares \u2013 lower than even the artificially low rates Uber initially charged in early years to capture market share. The novelty of riding with a stranger, and the more circuitous routes at prices not much higher than a bus ticket, proved popular. It was also like playing Russian roulette \u2013 passengers still got the significantly cheaper fare even if the algorithm failed to match them with a co-rider. Uber\u2019s pool option disappeared at the outbreak of the pandemic, and while it has since been reintroduced, its savings are now less pronounced, and marginal if the algorithm doesn\u2019t find you a co-rider. I was curious if passengers had re-embraced sharing confined spaces with randoms. Post-pandemic data shows Australians are driving private cars more than ever. Have Sydneysiders become a special breed of overly precious recluses? To find out, I set off to take Uber Pool aimlessly around Sydney for the better part of a week. Scarred by my former colleague Brigid Delaney\u2019s experiences of co-riders ignoring her, I made an effort to project myself as someone you\u2019d want to get in a conversation with. To me, this means the opposite of real estate agent energy. I was polite to drivers, avoided overpowering cologne and dressed casually, as if meeting friends at the pub. But as I\u2019d soon learn, riding in Uber Pools can make even those with strict hygiene standards begin to wonder if they have body odour. \u2018They don\u2019t want to talk to each other\u2019 On the first night, I headed out shortly after 7pm. I greet my first co-rider \u2013 a woman in her 20s \u2013 as she enters the car and get a smile and a one-word answer. Soon, she\u2019s ignoring my questions, seemingly pretending to be deep in her phone, scrolling. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads I totally get someone might want to avoid a conversation with a random guy. But I can\u2019t help wonder: why take a pool ride? Once my co-rider is dropped off, my driver tells me it\u2019s rare for pool passengers to talk. He says, as a driver, he despises pool trips at night as it\u2019s often drunk passengers who try to bring mates along. \u201cThey don\u2019t realise when they\u2019re drunk, they\u2019re booking just one seat, not the whole car,\u201d he says. \u201cThey only see the cheaper price,\u201d he explains. This becomes a common gripe from drivers. Some admit they instinctively reject pool trips, as drunk passengers wanting extra seats for friends get refused entry and leave bad reviews. While I get the occasional co-rider, it\u2019s a mixed bag. There\u2019s the student we pick up from the University of Sydney\u2019s engineering school, who ignores my greetings as he pretends to be busy reading the label on his water bottle as if he\u2019s Facetiming Mount Franklin. The driver felt so bad he leapt in, talking to me about his family. Cancellations are also a pain. When booking a ride from Redfern to Marrickville, in Sydney\u2019s inner west, my first driver cancels on me. My second one does too. Clearly, the phenomenon of Uber drivers cancelling shorter trips also applies to pool. A driver finally arrives, and a few minutes into our trip I\u2019m thrilled at a ping from my Uber app that another rider is joining. As we detour to collect them, my driver explains his theory: most pool passengers are in their 20s or 30s, usually heading home at night when they\u2019re not rushing. \u201cThey want to save money, they don\u2019t want to talk to each other.\u201d My co-rider, Rama, joins in Erskineville. The young finance professional is heading home after work drinks. She says that while she opts for Uber Pool frequently, this is only the second time she\u2019s ever been matched with another passenger. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a gamble, I was actually hoping I\u2019d be lucky tonight and that it\u2019d be empty,\u201d she says. But her bad luck is my good fortune, as she tells me more about the appeal she sees in Uber Pool \u2013 cheaper rides from a company she feels has been offering poorer service over time. Discounts and backseat marriages It\u2019s unclear how much money I\u2019m saving. On a ride from Marrickville to Edgecliff, the pool quote is $23-$24, instead of $30 for the UberX private ride. I book the pool, but by the end of the ride in which I\u2019m the only passenger, I was charged $31, because my driver has taken a toll road which I don\u2019t even think saves us much time. An Uber spokesperson says pool trips are up to 10% cheaper than UberX, with the potential to save up to 30% more if matched with fellow riders. In my experience, the actual amount saved was unreliable. Ultimately, fewer than a quarter of the pool rides I booked had a co-rider. What did happen frequently, however, was midway through a ride, I\u2019d get a notification I\u2019d been matched with a co-rider. It said we\u2019d pick them up shortly, before they\u2019d promptly cancel. One driver told me this was common; someone being tempted by the discount at the booking page, but once they saw there\u2019d be a co-rider and a longer trip, cancelling to try their luck again. This trend makes it difficult to know how popular Uber Pool is in Australia. An Uber spokesperson says pool trips have grown by a factor of 3.7 in the last year, and the number of pool trips was 65% higher in the first half of 2024 than the same period of 2019. But these figures don\u2019t differentiate between actual shared rides and pool trips where no co-rider is matched \u2013 which I found to be the norm. However, there is anecdotal evidence of Australians getting friendly in Uber Pools. A colleague recalls striking up conversation with a stranger in a shared ride. After getting along with them, she got out with them at the house party they were headed to. There are also reports of romance blossoming. \u201cWe\u2019ve even had a few couples making their way down the aisle after hitching a ride together!\u201d Uber\u2019s spokesperson claims. In fact, one driver, in his broken English, tells me he once had two passengers who got a \u201cfriendship\u201d out of the ride. \u201cThey were becoming very friendly with each other in the back,\u201d he chuckles when recalling the ride from the city to Manly one weekend afternoon. \u201cThey got out together at his place.\u201d It seemed I was destined to be ignored by fellow passengers or meet my future wife. Passengers clearly leave impressions on drivers. During one trip a driver bragged about some famous sports personalities he had driven. I nod along, but become uneasy when he recites one star\u2019s home addresses in an attempt to impress. More often than not, it\u2019s just me in the car, talking to drivers about how antisocial the average passenger is. One driver tells me two passengers struck up a conversation recently about US politics, before having a loud argument about Trump. Icebreakers and fashion critiques One night, going from Ashfield to Moore Park at the end of the night, I get talking to my driver Francis, an older Chinese-Australian man in his 60s, who wears thick 80s-style glasses and a terribly lopsided toupee. I\u2019m lamenting to him how lonely my Uber Pool trips have been. He nods and tells me he runs icebreaker exercises. \u201cI like to introduce them to each other, and get them to ask each other a question to find something in common.\u201d Most people are receptive, but some have told him to \u201cpiss off\u201d. He says he\u2019s done 6,500 trips \u2013 both privately booked and pool rides \u2013 in his years as an Uber driver, and of those just 20 have been pool rides with more than one passenger. One of these roughly 20 trips has led to a date, he says, between two travellers \u2013 an Italian man and a Scottish woman. Francis believes this says much about who we are. \u201cTourists and people from outside Sydney like to talk. But Sydneysiders think they are far too busy. This is a money-driven city, so people don\u2019t want to be delayed where they\u2019re going, so if they even take a pool trip, they\u2019re preoccupied during it, thinking too much about themselves.\u201d \u201cI honestly think people in Sydney are so lonely,\u201d he says. My phone pings. We\u2019ll be picking up a co-rider. Lynn, a 26-year-old in a glamorous red dress, gets into the car. She\u2019s heading home after a concert. True to his word, Francis introduces us, and when I mention I\u2019m researching Uber Pool habits for a news article, Lynn is \u201cthrilled\u201d. Lynn, a personal stylist, is not fond of public transport and doesn\u2019t have a driving licence. This explains why she\u2019s a loyal pool rider. \u201cI know it\u2019s an expensive habit, taking Ubers everywhere, but either someone\u2019s driving me or I\u2019m not getting back home. I just don\u2019t care to drive, I\u2019ve never been interested to get behind the wheel.\u201d When I say how refreshing it is to find a talkative co-rider, Lynn tells me I\u2019ve struck gold. \u201cI\u2019m the chattiest person in the world, and I\u2019ve got good stories.\u201d What\u2019s a good story, I ask? \u201cI was Azealia Banks\u2019 personal assistant for three days,\u201d she says. Lynn then wonders out loud: maybe I was too plainly dressed to invite conversation in Uber Pools. \u201cA bit more colour could suit you well. Try something outlandish.\u201d The fashion critique leads to a bizarre conversation with someone I\u2019d otherwise never have crossed paths with. As we continue talking in the backseat, I can see Francis is elated, taking his hands off the wheel at times to clap as he watches us in his rearview mirror.",

Homes, as he called them in his speech to the \u201cForgotten People\u201d, were for living in and raising a family, not an asset to build wealth. When Menzies retired as prime minister after 16 years living in The Lodge, he and Pattie, although they had previously owned a home, were no longer homeowners and his friends did a whip around to buy them somewhere to live. The weakness of the current federal Liberal party\u2019s policies would also trouble him, and the relentless negativity of its parliamentarians, always attacking and blocking Labor\u2019s initiatives. When the Liberal party was formed, Australia was in the middle of a war and led by a popular and effective prime minister and government. To establish the credibility of the Liberal party as a party of government, the new party needed policies to challenge Labor\u2019s approach to postwar planning and a philosophy to give coherence to these policies. The purpose of a political party, Menzies believed, was not just to occupy the government benches but to serve the national interest, so he was always open to bipartisan cooperation. He would notice the absence of bipartisanship in the current opposition and wonder how many of its members were more focused on party political advantage than the national interest.

      "bodyText": "The British industrialist Sanjeev Gupta was dubbed the \u201csaviour of steel\u201d for his plans to rescue ailing plants around the world and decarbonise their operations. But seven years after Gupta\u2019s GFG Alliance bought the struggling Whyalla steelworks, jobs are being lost and promises to invest in the operations remain unfulfilled, eroding hopes of a green steel manufacturing future for the regional South Australian city. Just how bad is it? Ageing operations Whyalla\u2019s mining and steel operations represent the economic foundation of a city relied on by numerous workers along with other businesses, from contractors to cafes. The plant has been beset by problems due to a series of shutdowns of its coal-fired blast furnace, which lies at the heart of the steelmaking process. Observers point out the level of disruptions to the crucial smelting process \u2013 the furnace has been out of action for about six months this year \u2013 is unusual among steelmakers, raising concerns about its operations. When it is online, the plant produces finished steel used in construction and rail. While Gupta has pledged to have the furnace restarted promptly, timelines for upgrades, including installation plans for an electric arc furnace to replace the coal-based system, have blown out. Eddie Hughes, the South Australian Labor MP whose seat covers the Whyalla region, says the community is increasingly sceptical that the plant will be transformed as promised. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads \u201cThey overpromised and they\u2019ve underdelivered, and they have not delivered at this stage on their promises,\u201d says Hughes, referring to the Gupta-owned operations. \u201cThey created expectations that have to a significant degree been dashed. A lot of the community no longer have confidence in the company to deliver what is essentially a race between an ageing steel plant and the need for a technology transition.\u201d GFG-owned Liberty Steel recently cut about 50 jobs from the Whyalla operations, reminding locals of the plant\u2019s troubled past. The former owner, Arrium, collapsed in 2016, weighed down by billions of dollars of debt. The planned decarbonisation of the plant will ultimately require an investment of about $1.5bn to $2bn, according to industry estimates, with renewable energy-produced hydrogen ultimately required for the manufacturing process to make green steel. Many plants in similar situations around the world are looking to gas as a transition fuel. Hughes says that while there is public money on the table to assist with the technology transition, it would be provided on a milestone basis after the work is done to avoid any risk the funds are used by other parts of the GFG business. \u201cThat is subject to rigorous criteria, as it should be, because it\u2019s about the technology transition here in Whyalla, it\u2019s not about just propping up GFG,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cI think it will require a private sector, public sector partnership of some form or the other.\u201d \u2018Dire situation\u2019 Pressure at GFG\u2019s Liberty Steel business unit is not confined to Whyalla. IndustriAll European Trade Union, a Swiss-based global federation of unions, says thousands of workers at Liberty sites are facing an uncertain future with the announced bankruptcy of steelworks in Cz\u0119stochowa, Poland, which is being appealed. There are also liquidation proceedings under way at Duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros, Hungary. The trade union federation says the jobs of Liberty workers in Luxembourg, Belgium and Italy are in doubt because the sites are up for sale. Judith Kirton-Darling, the industriAll general secretary, says in times of crisis, the global union expects all employers to commit to good industrial relations, with the health and safety and the timely payment of full wages a priority. \u201cCurrently, workers at several Liberty Steel sites are unsure if they will definitely be paid at the end of each month, with some workers receiving salaries days late and some suffering pay cuts of 30%,\u201d Kirton-Darling says. \u201cWe can\u2019t stress enough just how dire the situation is.\u201d The global union, which has affiliates in 140 countries, says it is working with unions and policymakers to tackle urgent issues including the unfair dumping of steel on the open EU market, an issue cited by steelmakers for some of their financial stress. Economists have also raised concerns over the impact of a prolonged downturn in China\u2019s property market on steel consumption and prices. But there are specific challenges to Gupta\u2019s steel empire, such as its prolonged debt restructure sparked by the 2021 collapse of primary financier Greensill Capital. The UK business register agency is prosecuting more than 70 Gupta-linked companies, including those tied to Liberty Steel operations, for failing to lodge accounts. GFG is also subject to a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into suspected fraud linked to the collapse of Greensill. A spokesperson for GFG\u2019s Liberty Steel says the company is working constructively with its suppliers to manage through the market downturn. \u201cOur operations in Europe are not impacting our Australian business which continues to operate well despite the short-term challenges in Whyalla,\u201d the spokesperson says. \u201cWe remain resolute in our commitment to the green steel transformation which will take time but remains a multigenerational opportunity for Australia to lead the world.\u201d Green steel The GFG-owned Whyalla operation is one of two major integrated steel projects in Australia, alongside the larger BlueScope operations in Port Kembla, south of Sydney. Geoffrey Brooks, the joint Swinburne/CSIRO chair in sustainable mineral processing, says it\u2019s in Australia\u2019s strategic interests to have a thriving and advanced sector and warns that it would be a \u201ctechnological and economic disaster\u201d for the west to stop making steel. \u201cSteel production is [historically] an expression of power,\u201d Brooks says. \u201cIt\u2019s strategically important, but it also has to be the sort of steel industry that is prosperous so that we can provide long-term stability of jobs and technological innovation.\u201d But the global race to upgrade coal-based steel operations is proving difficult. After years of heavy losses, the Indian owner of a steel plant in the Welsh town of Port Talbot recently shut its last furnace, leading to about 1,900 job losses. The company, Tata, is planning to build an electric arc furnace on the site, although the transition away from coal is anything but smooth, prompting widespread disruptions to the community. Part of the upgrade difficulties have been linked to the current high costs of clean hydrogen, prompting governments around the world to partner with private industry to help transform the sector. \u201cGovernments realise they\u2019re going to have to help the industry go green, it\u2019s not going to just happen through private means. Having said that, it\u2019s entirely appropriate to scrutinise how any public money is being spent,\u201d Brooks says. \u201cThe steel industry does well at providing long-term employment. But when it goes wrong, it is a big setback for the local community, there\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d",

Smith\u2019s fifth penalty, on the hour, posed a proper test for the All Blacks. To their credit, they responded. Damian McKenzie, a player very much in the Beauden Barrett mould, was now on. His hands and feet played their part in all of the 10 points New Zealand reserved, as they always used to, for the part of the match that hurts most \u2013 on this occasion the last 15 minutes. Tele\u2019a was worked over out wide with four minutes remaining. That proved enough. A fourth defeat in their eighth match of the season had been averted. But the watching world will have noted that England were only a coat of paint away from knocking a few more flecks off that black sheen.",

Some mooted Cup upsets are born of the heart, fuelled by an alluring backstory that taps into society\u2019s natural inclination to cheer for underdogs that have overcome adversity to challenge those more distinguished. This match had that in abundance: the former Worthing player turned owner George Dowell transforming the non-league club he bought with the compensation money he received from a car crash that left him paralysed from the chest down as a teenager. But what the heart started, the head reinforced with dispassionate logic. Worthing\u2019s FA Cup first-round visitors Morecambe have been a shell of a Football League club for some time.

The signing of 15 players on one July day at least ensured their ability to fulfil the current campaign, but they have won only one of 14 League Two matches so far this term and are already five points adrift of safety at the bottom of the table.

The prospect of a return of Trump to the White House provokes anxiety for Harris supporters. \u201cI don\u2019t want a repeat of 2016,\u201d said Marshall Moore, a fantasy novelist from midtown Atlanta. \u201cIt was a gut punch \u2026 A lot of very vulnerable people will be directly impacted negatively by the outcome, and, you know, possibly the last election and end of the American experiment in democracy.\u201d Both Trump and Harris are scrambling with three days to go, looking for the remaining voters left to convince. Except, experts might ask: who is still convincible at this point? Tristan Harvin had to think about it a bit before voting last week, he said. At the Harris rally, he said it came down to fundamental values. \u201cI mean, of course, being a man of color, you know, making sure that there\u2019s equity in laws and opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cHealthcare, even things like abortion rights for my wife and other women. I have sisters. I have mothers. I have friends, Just making sure that people have a fair shot in the world.\u201d Climate change, women\u2019s health and defending democracy drove Megan McElroy to vote for Harris, she said. But the way her campaign has spoken about economic issues is also important to her. \u201cI\u2019m an accountant, but I think Kamala is better for the economy,\u201d McElroy said. \u201cThe tariffs that Trump is suggesting \u2013 that\u2019s not going to go well for us. I don\u2019t think the economy is the No 1 driver for me, but I think on all accounts, Kamala is the better choice.\u201d Mary Garrett, an Atlantan at the Harris rally, could not name one friend, family member or acquaintance who was still on the fence. Almost everyone she knows voted for Harris. She finds the closeness of the race exasperating. \u201cWhy is it like this?\u201d she asked.",

This includes its aggressive suppression of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamins, clean foods, sunshine, exercise, nutraceuticals and anything else that advances human health and can\u2019t be patented by Pharma.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIf you work for the FDA and are part of this corrupt system, I have two messages for you: 1 Preserve your records, and 2 Pack your bags.\u201d</p> <p>Ted Kennedy Jr, a cousin of RFK Jr and a healthcare lawyer, said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about Trump\u2019s choice.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t put anyone in charge of healthcare who doesn\u2019t understand how doctors and scientists develop best practices and keep us safe, and has no medical background and no knowledge about how health care is organized, delivered and paid for,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/01/ted-kennedy-jr-robert-kennedy-rfk-trump-public-health-alarm/\">he told Stat</a>.</p> <p>But Trump seems determined. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/trump-tells-tucker-carlson-that-musk-and-rfk-jr-could-be-influential-figures-if-he-wins\">told rightwing figure Tucker Carlson</a> last week that Kennedy was \u201cgoing to work on health and women\u2019s health\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe really wants to with the pesticides and the, you know, all the different things. I said, he can do it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe can do anything he wants. He wants to look at the vaccines. He wants \u2013 everything. I think it\u2019s great. I think it\u2019s great.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a great guy. I\u2019ve known him a long time. And all he wants to do \u2013 it\u2019s very simple \u2013 he wants to make people healthy,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna178389\">Trump told NBC News on Friday</a>. Campaign officials previously told the outlet that Kennedy might <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/rfk-jr-lead-trump-efforts-chronic-childhood-disease-rcna178293\">spearhead</a> an \u201cOperation Warp Speed for childhood chronic disease\u201d, a reference to the Trump administration\u2019s $20bn Covid vaccine development program.</p> <p>But the discussion over a potential role for Kennedy in a new Trump administration has also raised the topic of the response to the 2020-21 Covid-19 pandemic that has been largely absent from the campaign trail.</p> <p>JD Vance, Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick, expressed scepticism about the Covid vaccine during a sit-down with podcaster Joe Rogan released on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cI took the vax, and you know, I haven\u2019t been boosted or anything, but the moment where I really started to get red-pilled on the whole vax thing was the sickest that I have been in the last 15 years by far was when I took the vaccine,\u201d the Ohio senator told Rogan.</p> <p>Kennedy, who has also expressed doubts about Covid vaccines, told a rally last week that Trump had promised him \u201ccontrol\u201d of public health agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture.</p> <p>Howard Lutnick, the Trump transition team co-chair, confirmed to CNN this week that he\u2019d spent two-and-a-half hours with Kennedy \u201cand it was the most extraordinary thing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI said: \u2018So, tell me. How\u2019s it going to go?\u2019 And he said: \u2018Why don\u2019t you just listen to me explain things,\u2019\u201d Lutnick said. He did not deny that Kennedy was correct to say he would lead public health agencies in a Trump administration.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll be pretty cool to give him the data. Let\u2019s see what he comes up with,\u201d Lutnick added.</p> <p>In a statement, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said there were \u201cno formal decisions\u201d about potential Trump administration appointments. But she added that the former president \u201chas said he will work alongside passionate voices like RFK Jr to make America healthy again by providing families with safe food and ending the chronic disease epidemic plaguing our children\u201d, referring to type 2 diabetes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday, alarming Democrats who believe the former environmental lawyer and independent presidential candidate could be empowered to act on his vaccine-sceptical views. According to the Washington Post, Kennedy has met with Trump transition officials to help draw up an agenda for a new administration and could take a broad \u201chealth tsar\u201d position that would not require confirmation by the Senate. Kennedy, who ended his White House bid and endorsed Trump, and his advisers have also been drafting 30-, 60- and 90-day plans for a second Trump term, the outlet reported, citing a source \u201cfamiliar\u201d with the planning process. Kamala Harris slammed the idea, saying Friday that Kennedy is \u201cthe exact last person in America who should be setting healthcare policy for America\u2019s families and children\u201d. The Democratic candidate further described Kennedy as \u201csomeone who has routinely promoted junk science and crazy conspiracy theories\u201d. Last week, Kennedy warned in a post on X that the \u201cFDA\u2019s war on public health is about to end. This includes its aggressive suppression of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamins, clean foods, sunshine, exercise, nutraceuticals and anything else that advances human health and can\u2019t be patented by Pharma.\u201d He added: \u201cIf you work for the FDA and are part of this corrupt system, I have two messages for you: 1 Preserve your records, and 2 Pack your bags.\u201d Ted Kennedy Jr, a cousin of RFK Jr and a healthcare lawyer, said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about Trump\u2019s choice. \u201cWe can\u2019t put anyone in charge of healthcare who doesn\u2019t understand how doctors and scientists develop best practices and keep us safe, and has no medical background and no knowledge about how health care is organized, delivered and paid for,\u201d he told Stat. But Trump seems determined. He told rightwing figure Tucker Carlson last week that Kennedy was \u201cgoing to work on health and women\u2019s health\u201d. \u201cHe really wants to with the pesticides and the, you know, all the different things. I said, he can do it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe can do anything he wants. He wants to look at the vaccines. He wants \u2013 everything. I think it\u2019s great. I think it\u2019s great.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy. I\u2019ve known him a long time. And all he wants to do \u2013 it\u2019s very simple \u2013 he wants to make people healthy,\u201d Trump told NBC News on Friday. Campaign officials previously told the outlet that Kennedy might spearhead an \u201cOperation Warp Speed for childhood chronic disease\u201d, a reference to the Trump administration\u2019s $20bn Covid vaccine development program. But the discussion over a potential role for Kennedy in a new Trump administration has also raised the topic of the response to the 2020-21 Covid-19 pandemic that has been largely absent from the campaign trail. JD Vance, Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick, expressed scepticism about the Covid vaccine during a sit-down with podcaster Joe Rogan released on Thursday. \u201cI took the vax, and you know, I haven\u2019t been boosted or anything, but the moment where I really started to get red-pilled on the whole vax thing was the sickest that I have been in the last 15 years by far was when I took the vaccine,\u201d the Ohio senator told Rogan. Kennedy, who has also expressed doubts about Covid vaccines, told a rally last week that Trump had promised him \u201ccontrol\u201d of public health agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture. Howard Lutnick, the Trump transition team co-chair, confirmed to CNN this week that he\u2019d spent two-and-a-half hours with Kennedy \u201cand it was the most extraordinary thing\u201d. \u201cI said: \u2018So, tell me. How\u2019s it going to go?\u2019 And he said: \u2018Why don\u2019t you just listen to me explain things,\u2019\u201d Lutnick said. He did not deny that Kennedy was correct to say he would lead public health agencies in a Trump administration. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be pretty cool to give him the data. Let\u2019s see what he comes up with,\u201d Lutnick added. In a statement, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said there were \u201cno formal decisions\u201d about potential Trump administration appointments. But she added that the former president \u201chas said he will work alongside passionate voices like RFK Jr to make America healthy again by providing families with safe food and ending the chronic disease epidemic plaguing our children\u201d, referring to type 2 diabetes.",

      "body": "<p>Anne Michaels, 66, is the author of five collections of poetry and three novels, including her debut, <em>Fugitive Pieces</em>, a post-Holocaust narrative cited as \u201ca novel that goes to the heart of any disaster\u201d when it won the Orange (now Women\u2019s) prize in 1997. Her latest novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/19/held-anne-michaels-review-fugitive-pieces\">Held</a></em>, now out in paperback, is on the shortlist for this year\u2019s Booker prize, whose winner is announced on 12 November. Praised by the <em>New York Times</em> as \u201ca lyrical jigsaw of impressions and observations\u201d, it moves between 1902 and 2025 in the company of a large cast of characters both fictitious and historical. Michaels spoke from Toronto, her birthplace, where she teaches creative writing.</p> <p><strong>How does a novel begin life for you?</strong><br>With an image or a character for whom I feel an immediate compassion \u2013 like love at first sight, you know, when it then takes you 50 years to understand that person! I never imagine it\u2019s going to be a short process.</p> <p><strong>So what was on your mind when you were writing </strong><em><strong>Held</strong></em><strong>?</strong><br>Whether there is any consolation to be found in our mortality. Also: the very significant historical moment when science begins to displace our ancient relationship to what cannot be seen. The book argues there\u2019s a value to that relationship \u2013 a value to what cannot be proven.</p> <p><strong>At what point did you alight on the book\u2019s fragmentary structure?</strong><br>I knew instantly that it was going to be told in various moments \u2013 I didn\u2019t know how they were connected, but I knew that they were, and that it was going to take me a long time to understand how.</p> <p><strong>What led you to the style, both vivid and vague at once?

There\u2019s a different measure for history that has to do with the agency of our inner lives: whether we turn our eyes a micrometre in one direction or another is crucial. And choosing what to be specific about or not to be specific about also has to do with wanting us to be jolted into really feeling an experience. You can use brutal language to describe brutality, but that\u2019s a lie; language can\u2019t represent brutality. It\u2019s exactly the same when I\u2019m trying to get at the most beautiful, profoundly intense experience of intimacy. Those moments may be indescribable but they\u2019re ordinarily perceivable \u2013 we all know what they are. So I\u2019m also trying to write in such a way that the reader has a place on the page.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>A book, for me, takes as long as it takes.

I think you only have one chance at a book and I\u2019d rather write the book that needs to be written \u2013 and write fewer. It sometimes requires patience because I don\u2019t know how to compromise. It\u2019s hard to know there\u2019s no shortcut; you can have your intellect aroused but wait years for connections to emerge. I console myself by saying, well, when you think of the writers you love, how many books do you mention? Two, three, four? So it\u2019s all right to write fewer if I can reach the place I\u2019m hoping to get to \u2013 but as a means to an economy, it\u2019s not exactly something I\u2019d recommend!</p> <p><strong>In a review of </strong><em><strong>Fugitive Pieces</strong></em><strong>, John Berger quoted </strong><strong>Adorno\u2019s famous remark that \u201cto write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric\u201d</strong><strong> before concluding that, because of your novel, \u201cfinally, that statement is untrue\u201d. What did you think when you saw that?</strong><br>We were friends for decades, but at the time he wrote that review, we had not yet met. I was tremendously moved. We understood each other \u2013 deeply \u2013 and it meant a great deal that he said that. My relationship to that phrase of Adorno\u2019s is that one could think of the silence at a funeral. In historical terms, that moment of silence could be years; how long it might be, and the distinction between silence and muteness, is something to think about. Muteness is cessation; silence isn\u2019t. Silence is generative. Something happens in silence.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re currently on the shortlist for </strong><strong>Canada\u2019s Giller prize</strong><strong> and the </strong><strong>Prix Femina \u00c9tranger</strong><strong> in France, as well as the Booker.

Because <em>Fugitive Pieces</em> was my first novel, it was a tremendous testing of that resolve. We cannot speak on behalf of the dead, we cannot forgive on behalf of the dead, so how one writes about certain events carries tremendous responsibility. That responsibility to history, to the dead, to the core of what it means to be alive\u2026 I take it seriously. One never stops asking: from when do you begin to count the dead?</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s Toronto like as a place to write?</strong><br>I\u2019ve lived here a long time and I have watched the literary culture of this city change dramatically. In the late 1940s, there were only 14 Canadian books published in Canada. A federal report in the early 50s said: \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be reporting on the state of our culture \u2013 we don\u2019t have one!\u201d From that moment, remarkably, there was a tremendous birth of culture across the board and an explosion of small presses in the 50s, 60s and 70s. Poets responded with most poignant alacrity, because [the idea that] there could be a community [of poets] across the country was something inconceivable!</p> <p><strong>Tell us about the last book you gave as a gift.</strong><br>I gave to a student a very slender book called <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/06/in-brief-cold-enough-for-snow-the-magician-god-is-dead-reviews\">Cold Enough for Snow</a></em> by Jessica Au, because that\u2019s a book where there\u2019s hardly a breath on the surface of it \u2013 everything is in the depths \u2013 so, for this particular student, it was exactly the right thing.</p> <p><strong>Are you reading the other novels on the Booker shortlist?</strong><br>Absolutely, out of solidarity.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Held </em>is published in paperback by Bloomsbury (\u00a39.99)<em>. </em>To support the <em>Guardian</em> and <em>Observer</em> order your copy at <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/held-9781526659125/\">guardianbookshop.com</a>.

In a review of Fugitive Pieces, John Berger quoted Adorno\u2019s famous remark that \u201cto write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric\u201d before concluding that, because of your novel, \u201cfinally, that statement is untrue\u201d. What did you think when you saw that? We were friends for decades, but at the time he wrote that review, we had not yet met. I was tremendously moved. We understood each other \u2013 deeply \u2013 and it meant a great deal that he said that. My relationship to that phrase of Adorno\u2019s is that one could think of the silence at a funeral. In historical terms, that moment of silence could be years; how long it might be, and the distinction between silence and muteness, is something to think about. Muteness is cessation; silence isn\u2019t. Silence is generative. Something happens in silence. You\u2019re currently on the shortlist for Canada\u2019s Giller prize and the Prix Femina \u00c9tranger in France, as well as the Booker. How does it feel? I never imagine that any of my novels will be understood \u2013 in the sense of being experienced \u2013 so it\u2019s incredibly important to me; because the books take a long time, it\u2019s storing up courage for what\u2019s next. When did you first feel that the stakes of writing were so high? Part of me always had that conviction. Because Fugitive Pieces was my first novel, it was a tremendous testing of that resolve. We cannot speak on behalf of the dead, we cannot forgive on behalf of the dead, so how one writes about certain events carries tremendous responsibility. That responsibility to history, to the dead, to the core of what it means to be alive\u2026 I take it seriously. One never stops asking: from when do you begin to count the dead? What\u2019s Toronto like as a place to write? I\u2019ve lived here a long time and I have watched the literary culture of this city change dramatically. In the late 1940s, there were only 14 Canadian books published in Canada. A federal report in the early 50s said: \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be reporting on the state of our culture \u2013 we don\u2019t have one!\u201d From that moment, remarkably, there was a tremendous birth of culture across the board and an explosion of small presses in the 50s, 60s and 70s. Poets responded with most poignant alacrity, because [the idea that] there could be a community [of poets] across the country was something inconceivable! Tell us about the last book you gave as a gift. I gave to a student a very slender book called Cold Enough for Snow by Jessica Au, because that\u2019s a book where there\u2019s hardly a breath on the surface of it \u2013 everything is in the depths \u2013 so, for this particular student, it was exactly the right thing. Are you reading the other novels on the Booker shortlist? Absolutely, out of solidarity. Held is published in paperback by Bloomsbury (\u00a39.99).

England, too, had good reason for the odd grimace when Smith, lining up a drop goal which would have put his side ahead at the interval, scuffed the chance low and wide.</p>    <p>Was it, therefore, the ideal moment to wheel on England\u2019s winning 2003 World Cup squad for a half-time parade? Comparisons between eras are mostly irrelevant but let\u2019s just say the class of 2003 had a reasonable drop goal practitioner in their midst. In the drum-tight modern game those extra three-pointers are just as vital, if not more so.</p> <p>There was no guarantee that New Zealand, having conceded eight penalties and 13 turnovers in the first half alone, would be so profligate after the break. While it was clearly a blow to have lost their reliable hooker Codie Taylor after just five minutes, the All Blacks still potentially had enough on the bench to swing the contest.</p> <p>But England, with six forwards in reserve, also had aspirations of finding another gear and the game swung back their way within four minutes of the restart. When Smith intercepted Ratima\u2019s pass he was 80 metres away from the All Black line but intelligent support from George Furbank gave Feyi-Waboso enough room to burn off the remaining cover and score his maiden Twickenham try.</p> <p>New Zealand briefly thought they had responded after Caleb Clarke put the omnipresent Beauden Barrett clear. Play, though, was correctly brought back for a Clarke knock-on 60 metres downfield and Smith\u2019s subsequent fifth penalty brought the crowd to their feet.</p> <p>Ben Curry, on for his brother, Tom, did secure one excellent turnover but for the most part England\u2019s replacements could not quite sustain their side\u2019s previous momentum.

      "body": "<p>No one who knows her describes Kemi Badenoch as a politician who is much troubled by self doubt. Yet the manner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/02/kemi-badenoch-wins-tory-leadership-election\">her victory in the Tory leadership contest</a> ought to give a worm of unease to the party\u2019s new standard bearer. When the result came in on Saturday morning, the first reveal was that the membership of the Tory party has shrunk to 131,680, down more than 40,000 since the last contest two years ago. With the turnout also down on last time, she won with the support of just four in 10 of that shrivelled membership. Her lustiest cheerleaders cannot describe this as an emphatic victory. Even the truest of blues were not greatly impressed by the choice on offer for all the effort that she and Robert Jenrick put into trying to pander to their party\u2019s prejudices on the constituency association dinner circuit. Never have so many rubber chickens died in vain.</p> <p>This lack of enthusiasm was also evident during the preliminary rounds when it was Tory MPs doing the voting. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/09/kemi-badenoch-or-robert-jenrick-will-be-tory-leader-after-cleverly-eliminated\">In the final ballot</a> of Conservative parliamentarians, it was virtually a three-way tie between the former business secretary, Mr Jenrick and James Cleverly. The new Tory leader takes charge with a tepid endorsement from her party\u2019s members, two-thirds of her parliamentary colleagues preferring someone else and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm20dv560j2o\">prominent names</a> declaring that they have no desire to serve in her shadow cabinet. This is not so much a coronation as a hospital pass. A brittle mandate means she will be treated as an interim chief on probation with a party that will be impatient for results and is infamous for its factionalism and its disloyalty. The sixth leader of her party in a decade, she\u2019s going to have to play a difficult hand with much more dexterity than she\u2019s previously demonstrated if she\u2019s not to be yet another Tory head whose grip on the job is fleeting.</p> <p>In her acceptance speech, she described the task ahead as \u201ctough\u201d, which is an understatement. The July election was the worst result for the Conservative party, both in terms of vote share and seats won, since 1832 when they were led by the Duke of Wellington. I am not among those who think this means the Tories can never recover. They have been pronounced dead and buried in the past only then to rise from the grave. But they are unlikely to start recovering until \u2013 and unless \u2013 they have an honest reckoning with themselves about their multiple failings in government. This they have not done and Mrs Badenoch is as guilty as the rest of them. In her first speech as leader, she made only a fleeting reference to \u201cmistakes\u201d. She spent the contest tilting at windmills of the culture wars, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/01/some-civil-servants-should-be-in-prison-says-kemi-badenoch\">badmouthing the civil service</a> and being animated by other topics that preoccupy the Tory party much more than they do most of the public. If&nbsp;she is in possession of fresh thinking about solving the housing shortage, rejuvenating public services or addressing any of the other large challenges facing Britain, she did not share them during her policy-light campaign for the leadership. </p> <p>Her core analysis is that her party lost the electorate because it was insufficiently right wing. One of her arguments is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1d59k513qgo\">that the Tories \u201ctalked right, but governed left\u201d</a>. Another is that Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform ate into Tory support because conservatism \u201cmorphed into much vaguer centrism\u201d. What this explanation conspicuously neglects is that the Tories haemorrhaged support not just among rightwing voters, but around all points of the compass. They also lost support and seats to Labour and the Lib Dems while more than a million people who backed the Tories in 2019 stayed at home in 2024. Immigration was a factor that hurt their vote, but they were damaged more by their record on public services and the cost of living and giving the overall impression of being a clown show. Surveys suggest that very few voters think the Conservatives lost the election because they were too left wing while the majority of those with an opinion <a href=\"https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/media/e3in12zd/change-pending.pdf\">put it down to their incompetence</a>. A lurch further to the right may claw back some support from Reform, but will be accompanied by the high risk of alienating more moderate former Conservative voters, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2024/uk/results\">the kind who helped the Lib Dems take 59 seats</a> off the Tories by gutting them in their affluent English heartlands. Could things get more dire for Mrs Badenoch\u2019s party? Quite easily if she fails to reunite the right while succeeding in repulsing even more of middle-ground opinion.</p> <p>One of the biggest challenges for the new leader of the&nbsp;opposition, and especially when the Tory parliamentary presence is so small, will be persuading voters to pay them any heed. The case made for Mrs Badenoch by her promoters is that she is \u201cbox office\u201d with a gift for grabbing attention. What she has often failed to grasp is that there is such a thing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/sep/29/maternity-pay-is-excessive-says-tory-leadership-hopeful-kemi-badenoch\">as the wrong kind of attention</a>. \u201cStill in development\u201d is the assessment of one reasonably sympathetic senior Tory. \u201cKemi is clever. She will learn on the job,\u201d says a Conservative MP who is friendly towards her. \u201cShe will be brilliant or she will be a disaster,\u201d remarks another. It is not hard to find moderate Tory MPs who predict that she will, in the words of one of their number, \u201ccrash and burn very quickly\u201d. If she\u2019s not going to self-destruct in the job, many of her colleagues agree that she is going to have to become a lot more disciplined and a lot less rebarbative with colleagues. </p> <p>When assessing their chances of recovering, a lot of Tories take comfort in the notion that the electorate appears to be more volatile than it used to be. Sir Keir Starmer managed to take Labour from a catastrophic defeat in 2019 to a parliamentary landslide in 2024. Why, Tories can be heard wondering, shouldn\u2019t we be able to do the same? What they don\u2019t ask themselves often enough is how the Labour leader detoxified his party\u2019s reputation. He did so by repeatedly apologising for and drawing lines under its past while relentlessly offering demonstrations of how it had changed under his management. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There has never been a comprehensive repudiation of Boris Johnson for debauching standards in public life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By contrast, the Conservatives have displayed next to no interest in atoning for all the things voters came to loathe about them. There has never been a comprehensive repudiation of Boris Johnson for debauching standards in public life. Nor has there been an expression of suitably abject contrition for Liz Truss\u2019s calamitous experiment with the economy. Nor have senior Tories had the humility to acknowledge that they left a super-massive black hole in the Treasury\u2019s books. When you have fouled up as badly and as repeatedly as the Conservatives did in government, the first step to redemption with the electorate is to own your blunders and express regret for&nbsp;them. </p> <p>Too many Tories are instead beguiled by the idea that all they have to do is savour Labour\u2019s difficulties and wait for power to come back to them. The bellowing Conservative response to the budget is instructive. They are howling that it involves increased taxes and higher borrowing, as if none of this has anything to do with their period in office. When Rishi Sunak replied to the budget in his swansong performance as leader, he tried to create the impression that the Tories bequeathed a golden economic inheritance to Labour. If you believe that, I\u2019ve got a squadron of flying pigs to sell you. In their current state of denial, the Tories also seem oblivious to the trap Rachel Reeves is trying to set for them, even though&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-10-30/debates/11809FC2-3FF8-4B3A-9C78-4A56268F0D5E/FinancialStatementAndBudgetReport\">chancellor was explicit about this in her budget speech</a>. If the Tories don\u2019t like the tax rises, what&nbsp;would they hack out of the budgets of the NHS, schools and other key public services? If Labour has its&nbsp;way, that will be a defining argument of this parliament. Ms Reeves is hoping to make the contest one between \u201cLabour investment versus Tory cuts\u201d, a dividing line that worked very well for her party and extremely badly for the Conservatives during the New&nbsp;Labour years.</p> <p>Even if voters become persistently discontented with Sir Keir\u2019s government, the Tories are delusional if they imagine that this means the public will simply collapse back into their embrace and tell the Conservatives all is forgiven. Not least because so far the Tories have been almost completely incapable of recognising how much forgiveness they will need before they are taken seriously again. If Kemi Badenoch wants to get a hearing from the British people, she is first going to have to say sorry. And she is going to have to say it a lot.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

The sixth leader of her party in a decade, she\u2019s going to have to play a difficult hand with much more dexterity than she\u2019s previously demonstrated if she\u2019s not to be yet another Tory head whose grip on the job is fleeting. In her acceptance speech, she described the task ahead as \u201ctough\u201d, which is an understatement. The July election was the worst result for the Conservative party, both in terms of vote share and seats won, since 1832 when they were led by the Duke of Wellington. I am not among those who think this means the Tories can never recover. They have been pronounced dead and buried in the past only then to rise from the grave. But they are unlikely to start recovering until \u2013 and unless \u2013 they have an honest reckoning with themselves about their multiple failings in government. This they have not done and Mrs Badenoch is as guilty as the rest of them. In her first speech as leader, she made only a fleeting reference to \u201cmistakes\u201d. She spent the contest tilting at windmills of the culture wars, badmouthing the civil service and being animated by other topics that preoccupy the Tory party much more than they do most of the public. If she is in possession of fresh thinking about solving the housing shortage, rejuvenating public services or addressing any of the other large challenges facing Britain, she did not share them during her policy-light campaign for the leadership. Her core analysis is that her party lost the electorate because it was insufficiently right wing. One of her arguments is that the Tories \u201ctalked right, but governed left\u201d. Another is that Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform ate into Tory support because conservatism \u201cmorphed into much vaguer centrism\u201d. What this explanation conspicuously neglects is that the Tories haemorrhaged support not just among rightwing voters, but around all points of the compass. They also lost support and seats to Labour and the Lib Dems while more than a million people who backed the Tories in 2019 stayed at home in 2024. Immigration was a factor that hurt their vote, but they were damaged more by their record on public services and the cost of living and giving the overall impression of being a clown show. Surveys suggest that very few voters think the Conservatives lost the election because they were too left wing while the majority of those with an opinion put it down to their incompetence. A lurch further to the right may claw back some support from Reform, but will be accompanied by the high risk of alienating more moderate former Conservative voters, the kind who helped the Lib Dems take 59 seats off the Tories by gutting them in their affluent English heartlands. Could things get more dire for Mrs Badenoch\u2019s party? Quite easily if she fails to reunite the right while succeeding in repulsing even more of middle-ground opinion. One of the biggest challenges for the new leader of the opposition, and especially when the Tory parliamentary presence is so small, will be persuading voters to pay them any heed. The case made for Mrs Badenoch by her promoters is that she is \u201cbox office\u201d with a gift for grabbing attention. What she has often failed to grasp is that there is such a thing as the wrong kind of attention. \u201cStill in development\u201d is the assessment of one reasonably sympathetic senior Tory. \u201cKemi is clever. She will learn on the job,\u201d says a Conservative MP who is friendly towards her. \u201cShe will be brilliant or she will be a disaster,\u201d remarks another. It is not hard to find moderate Tory MPs who predict that she will, in the words of one of their number, \u201ccrash and burn very quickly\u201d. If she\u2019s not going to self-destruct in the job, many of her colleagues agree that she is going to have to become a lot more disciplined and a lot less rebarbative with colleagues. When assessing their chances of recovering, a lot of Tories take comfort in the notion that the electorate appears to be more volatile than it used to be. Sir Keir Starmer managed to take Labour from a catastrophic defeat in 2019 to a parliamentary landslide in 2024. Why, Tories can be heard wondering, shouldn\u2019t we be able to do the same? What they don\u2019t ask themselves often enough is how the Labour leader detoxified his party\u2019s reputation. He did so by repeatedly apologising for and drawing lines under its past while relentlessly offering demonstrations of how it had changed under his management. By contrast, the Conservatives have displayed next to no interest in atoning for all the things voters came to loathe about them. There has never been a comprehensive repudiation of Boris Johnson for debauching standards in public life. Nor has there been an expression of suitably abject contrition for Liz Truss\u2019s calamitous experiment with the economy. Nor have senior Tories had the humility to acknowledge that they left a super-massive black hole in the Treasury\u2019s books. When you have fouled up as badly and as repeatedly as the Conservatives did in government, the first step to redemption with the electorate is to own your blunders and express regret for them. Too many Tories are instead beguiled by the idea that all they have to do is savour Labour\u2019s difficulties and wait for power to come back to them. The bellowing Conservative response to the budget is instructive. They are howling that it involves increased taxes and higher borrowing, as if none of this has anything to do with their period in office. When Rishi Sunak replied to the budget in his swansong performance as leader, he tried to create the impression that the Tories bequeathed a golden economic inheritance to Labour. If you believe that, I\u2019ve got a squadron of flying pigs to sell you. In their current state of denial, the Tories also seem oblivious to the trap Rachel Reeves is trying to set for them, even though the chancellor was explicit about this in her budget speech. If the Tories don\u2019t like the tax rises, what would they hack out of the budgets of the NHS, schools and other key public services? If Labour has its way, that will be a defining argument of this parliament. Ms Reeves is hoping to make the contest one between \u201cLabour investment versus Tory cuts\u201d, a dividing line that worked very well for her party and extremely badly for the Conservatives during the New Labour years. Even if voters become persistently discontented with Sir Keir\u2019s government, the Tories are delusional if they imagine that this means the public will simply collapse back into their embrace and tell the Conservatives all is forgiven. Not least because so far the Tories have been almost completely incapable of recognising how much forgiveness they will need before they are taken seriously again. If Kemi Badenoch wants to get a hearing from the British people, she is first going to have to say sorry. And she is going to have to say it a lot. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

      "body": "<p>Labour\u2019s first budget in almost 15 years marks a radical departure with past constraints on investment spending. New rules allow long-term planning and introduce safeguards governing how the extra cash is spent. But what are the more immediate implications?</p> <h2><strong>Will the budget kickstart growth?</strong></h2> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which provides the government with independent economic forecasts, said extra spending in the first two years would expand the economy a bit more than Jeremy Hunt\u2019s March budget, but act as a modest drag on the former Conservative chancellor\u2019s plans stretching to 2029.</p> <p>The end result, according to the OBR, is no economic benefit from \u00a370bn of extra annual spending. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) described the budget as a brave investment in the UK\u2019s long-term future, because all the benefit would emerge after the next election.</p> <p>That said, the OBR is only one arbiter of the government\u2019s plans. In a lively post-budget debate, the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) thinktank said the OBR was wrong to judge that Labour\u2019s investment spending would \u201ccrowd out\u201d the private sector. Supported by many other economists, the IPPR said the outcome would be the opposite of a zero-sum game and private sector investment would be \u201ccrowded in\u201d, lifting growth by more than the OBR expects.</p> <h2><strong>Will extra spending boost public services?</strong></h2> <p>The biggest problem faced by Rachel Reeves was not so much the discovery of a supposed \u00a322bn hole in the finances left behind by Hunt \u2013 though the need to find extra cash for public sector workers and asylum seeker accommodation was a blow \u2013 but the huge underspends in education, health, local government and previously unprotected departments such as transport and culture.</p> <p>Merely filling the gaps in current departmental budgets with the \u00a335bn promised in the budget means it will be difficult to improve the level of service. If Labour prevents the catastrophe that was awaiting the country had the Conservatives remained in power, it will be doing well. However, a counterfactual is hard to prove.</p> <p>A more positive view would argue that the two departments receiving the bulk of the money \u2013 health and education \u2013 have the most mature budgeting and cost control systems, giving them the best chance of showing an improvement by the next general election.</p> <h2><strong>Is austerity over?</strong></h2> <p>The Home Office and Department for Transport were big losers in the budget. As was Lisa Nandy\u2019s culture department. Efficiency savings are supposed to conceal the effect of cuts, but it will feel like austerity to the civil servants working in these departments, who are supposed to overhaul the border service, manage the building of new railways and prevent museums from closing.</p> <p>Welfare payments are fixed at painfully low levels and the two-child cap remains in place. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said: \u201cIt\u2019s deeply worrying that we haven\u2019t seen changes to social security.\u201d Its post-budget modelling found \u201cpoverty is set to rise for all family types except pensioners\u201d.</p> <p>Labour says various infrastructure projects are likely to get the green light next spring, and Angela Rayner\u2019s cheap homes plan will get under way. But public libraries and swimming pools shut in the last decade are expected to stay closed.</p> <h2><strong>Did Rachel Reeves have a Liz Truss moment?</strong></h2> <p>The financial markets panicked when former prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/12/revealed-the-30bn-cost-of-liz-trusss-disastrous-mini-budget\">Liz Truss launched a mini-budget</a> loaded with unfunded tax cuts. Traders who buy government bonds have remained wary of the UK ever since.</p> <p>Their eyes widened last week when the scale of Reeves\u2019s budget emerged, alongside the verdict by the OBR that it would be mildly inflationary. The City view was that the budget would reduce the Bank of England\u2019s appetite for cutting interest rates.</p> <p>Twenty four hours after Reeves made her speech the market wobbled and the cost of government borrowing increased. It proved short-lived after several senior bankers, including the boss of HSBC, intervened to ease jitters, rumoured to be after prompting from Treasury officials. On Friday all was calm again as the attention of financial markets switched to the US and the presidential election.</p> <h2><strong>Will the national insurance increase harm businesses and workers?</strong></h2> <p>Care home providers, charities and GPs are among the employers to denounce the rise in the amount employers pay in national insurance. The percentage paid for each employee was raised to 15% and the threshold for when payments begin lowered from \u00a39,100 to \u00a35,000.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/reeves-green-chancellor-budget-climate-environment\">Is Reeves still the green chancellor after her budget? Yes \u2026 and no</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The OBR says 80% of the rise will be passed on to workers in lower wage increases and 20% in higher prices. So workers and consumers lose, while shareholders escape paying. The IFS said two-thirds would be passed on. The academic research is less clear.</p> <p>One paper written by IFS staff examining previous changes to contributions showed employers absorbed almost all of the increase in the short term and were unable to off-load any of the extra cost to staff or consumers. How the extra charge is paid for can also vary by industry and usually plays out over a long period.</p> <p>A fear among businesses that they face all the pain has spurred them to complain.</p> <h2><strong>Will inheritance tax changes hurt the farming community?</strong></h2> <p>Estimates vary, but about 30% to 35% of farms in the UK could be valued at more than \u00a31m, which is a new threshold for charging inheritance tax at 20% \u2013 half the standard rate \u2013 on farm estates. It replaces a regime that excluded farms altogether, allowing the children of farmers to inherit tax-free.</p> <p>As there are about 209,000 farm holdings in the UK, that means between 62,700 and 73,150 could be affected. However, the tax-free threshold is enhanced by a \u00a3325,00 property allowance and can be doubled if the farm owner is married, giving a threshold of \u00a32.65m. Farms are often hugely indebted and carry large bank loans, offsetting the value of the land.</p> <p>Only 462 inherited farms were valued above \u00a31m in 2021-22, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). And Labour says it will be 500 at most next year, when the new rules apply.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s first budget in almost 15 years marks a radical departure with past constraints on investment spending. New rules allow long-term planning and introduce safeguards governing how the extra cash is spent. But what are the more immediate implications? Will the budget kickstart growth? The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which provides the government with independent economic forecasts, said extra spending in the first two years would expand the economy a bit more than Jeremy Hunt\u2019s March budget, but act as a modest drag on the former Conservative chancellor\u2019s plans stretching to 2029. The end result, according to the OBR, is no economic benefit from \u00a370bn of extra annual spending. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) described the budget as a brave investment in the UK\u2019s long-term future, because all the benefit would emerge after the next election. That said, the OBR is only one arbiter of the government\u2019s plans. In a lively post-budget debate, the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) thinktank said the OBR was wrong to judge that Labour\u2019s investment spending would \u201ccrowd out\u201d the private sector. Supported by many other economists, the IPPR said the outcome would be the opposite of a zero-sum game and private sector investment would be \u201ccrowded in\u201d, lifting growth by more than the OBR expects. Will extra spending boost public services? The biggest problem faced by Rachel Reeves was not so much the discovery of a supposed \u00a322bn hole in the finances left behind by Hunt \u2013 though the need to find extra cash for public sector workers and asylum seeker accommodation was a blow \u2013 but the huge underspends in education, health, local government and previously unprotected departments such as transport and culture. Merely filling the gaps in current departmental budgets with the \u00a335bn promised in the budget means it will be difficult to improve the level of service. If Labour prevents the catastrophe that was awaiting the country had the Conservatives remained in power, it will be doing well. However, a counterfactual is hard to prove. A more positive view would argue that the two departments receiving the bulk of the money \u2013 health and education \u2013 have the most mature budgeting and cost control systems, giving them the best chance of showing an improvement by the next general election. Is austerity over? The Home Office and Department for Transport were big losers in the budget. As was Lisa Nandy\u2019s culture department. Efficiency savings are supposed to conceal the effect of cuts, but it will feel like austerity to the civil servants working in these departments, who are supposed to overhaul the border service, manage the building of new railways and prevent museums from closing. Welfare payments are fixed at painfully low levels and the two-child cap remains in place. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said: \u201cIt\u2019s deeply worrying that we haven\u2019t seen changes to social security.\u201d Its post-budget modelling found \u201cpoverty is set to rise for all family types except pensioners\u201d. Labour says various infrastructure projects are likely to get the green light next spring, and Angela Rayner\u2019s cheap homes plan will get under way. But public libraries and swimming pools shut in the last decade are expected to stay closed. Did Rachel Reeves have a Liz Truss moment? The financial markets panicked when former prime minister Liz Truss launched a mini-budget loaded with unfunded tax cuts. Traders who buy government bonds have remained wary of the UK ever since. Their eyes widened last week when the scale of Reeves\u2019s budget emerged, alongside the verdict by the OBR that it would be mildly inflationary. The City view was that the budget would reduce the Bank of England\u2019s appetite for cutting interest rates. Twenty four hours after Reeves made her speech the market wobbled and the cost of government borrowing increased. It proved short-lived after several senior bankers, including the boss of HSBC, intervened to ease jitters, rumoured to be after prompting from Treasury officials. On Friday all was calm again as the attention of financial markets switched to the US and the presidential election. Will the national insurance increase harm businesses and workers? Care home providers, charities and GPs are among the employers to denounce the rise in the amount employers pay in national insurance. The percentage paid for each employee was raised to 15% and the threshold for when payments begin lowered from \u00a39,100 to \u00a35,000. The OBR says 80% of the rise will be passed on to workers in lower wage increases and 20% in higher prices. So workers and consumers lose, while shareholders escape paying. The IFS said two-thirds would be passed on. The academic research is less clear. One paper written by IFS staff examining previous changes to contributions showed employers absorbed almost all of the increase in the short term and were unable to off-load any of the extra cost to staff or consumers. How the extra charge is paid for can also vary by industry and usually plays out over a long period. A fear among businesses that they face all the pain has spurred them to complain. Will inheritance tax changes hurt the farming community? Estimates vary, but about 30% to 35% of farms in the UK could be valued at more than \u00a31m, which is a new threshold for charging inheritance tax at 20% \u2013 half the standard rate \u2013 on farm estates. It replaces a regime that excluded farms altogether, allowing the children of farmers to inherit tax-free. As there are about 209,000 farm holdings in the UK, that means between 62,700 and 73,150 could be affected. However, the tax-free threshold is enhanced by a \u00a3325,00 property allowance and can be doubled if the farm owner is married, giving a threshold of \u00a32.65m. Farms are often hugely indebted and carry large bank loans, offsetting the value of the land. Only 462 inherited farms were valued above \u00a31m in 2021-22, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). And Labour says it will be 500 at most next year, when the new rules apply.",

With arms crossed, Guardiola muddied his black leather brogues as he paced the sidelines.

The last time a point was collected was 1999, in the third tier, Joe Royle the City manager, Shaun Goater their centre-forward.</p> <p>How did it happen? Answer: vigour and proficiency in defence, midfield and attack, plus a fine display from the stand-in goalkeeper, Mark Travers. Kerkez made a last-man block when Bernardo Silva had the goal gaping before Bournemouth saw out the first half with an almost endless sequence of passes. Few teams dominate City in such a fashion.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to suffer, stay compact,\u201d said Iraola. \u201cWe suffered after a good game. We know there are better teams than us but it is not easy to play here.\u201d</p>    <p>The second half saw Bournemouth chase another fast start. Semenyo took down a long ball, and Evanilson forced another Ederson save. Signals of a potential City revival eventually began to sound. Foden drifted an effort wide and tempers frayed when Lewis Cook, Bournemouth\u2019s ratter supreme, took out Erling Haaland with a trailing leg.</p> <p>That Bournemouth retrenched at the hour mark suggested one-way traffic, only for a counter to be triggered in devastating fashion. Semenyo \u2013 again \u2013 blew past Walker and supplied Kerkez, whose low cross found Evanilson, the striker hooking home. \u201cI am working on crosses and improving,\u201d said Kerkez, his recent performances announcing him as a significant prospect.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Walker, closest to his manager, was being given constant, terse sideline advice. He was eventually switched to centre-back. \u201cKyle, 18 days, 19 days without training, one training session with us and today was there,\u201d said Guardiola, afterwards mitigating those Semenyo struggles.</p> <p>Bournemouth\u2019s lead might have increased further when Marcus Tavernier cracked the inside post but could they now hang on? Travers failed to claw away Gvardiol\u2019s header from Ilkay G\u00fcndogan\u2019s cross to set up 10 minutes of tension. J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku\u2019s dribbling was thrown into the mix, the Belgian forcing a fine low save from Travers.</p> <p>Chaos ensued in six minutes added on, Travers saving from Haaland, the ball somehow not crossing the line when Haaland struck the woodwork with his follow-up. Lastly, Foden slapped a shot wide. The champions \u2013 ragged, exhausted, dumbfounded \u2013 could find nothing more. And Bournemouth could celebrate.</p>",

The pressure stayed on, City\u2019s midfield exchanges compressed by the energy of their opponents. With arms crossed, Guardiola muddied his black leather brogues as he paced the sidelines. Alongside him, Andoni Iraola, the Basque coach whose trajectory makes him a leading contender to one day succeed the Catalan, was kicking every ball as his team followed up beating Arsenal by deposing the champions. \u201cI have lost so many times against him,\u201d said Iraola of Guardiola. \u201cYou have to enjoy it as you know it\u2019s not going to happen often.\u201d Victory created history: Bournemouth had never beaten a City team over 21 previous meetings. The last time a point was collected was 1999, in the third tier, Joe Royle the City manager, Shaun Goater their centre-forward. How did it happen? Answer: vigour and proficiency in defence, midfield and attack, plus a fine display from the stand-in goalkeeper, Mark Travers. Kerkez made a last-man block when Bernardo Silva had the goal gaping before Bournemouth saw out the first half with an almost endless sequence of passes. Few teams dominate City in such a fashion. \u201cYou have to suffer, stay compact,\u201d said Iraola. \u201cWe suffered after a good game. We know there are better teams than us but it is not easy to play here.\u201d The second half saw Bournemouth chase another fast start. Semenyo took down a long ball, and Evanilson forced another Ederson save. Signals of a potential City revival eventually began to sound. Foden drifted an effort wide and tempers frayed when Lewis Cook, Bournemouth\u2019s ratter supreme, took out Erling Haaland with a trailing leg. That Bournemouth retrenched at the hour mark suggested one-way traffic, only for a counter to be triggered in devastating fashion. Semenyo \u2013 again \u2013 blew past Walker and supplied Kerkez, whose low cross found Evanilson, the striker hooking home. \u201cI am working on crosses and improving,\u201d said Kerkez, his recent performances announcing him as a significant prospect. Meanwhile, Walker, closest to his manager, was being given constant, terse sideline advice. He was eventually switched to centre-back. \u201cKyle, 18 days, 19 days without training, one training session with us and today was there,\u201d said Guardiola, afterwards mitigating those Semenyo struggles. Bournemouth\u2019s lead might have increased further when Marcus Tavernier cracked the inside post but could they now hang on? Travers failed to claw away Gvardiol\u2019s header from Ilkay G\u00fcndogan\u2019s cross to set up 10 minutes of tension. J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku\u2019s dribbling was thrown into the mix, the Belgian forcing a fine low save from Travers. Chaos ensued in six minutes added on, Travers saving from Haaland, the ball somehow not crossing the line when Haaland struck the woodwork with his follow-up. Lastly, Foden slapped a shot wide. The champions \u2013 ragged, exhausted, dumbfounded \u2013 could find nothing more. And Bournemouth could celebrate.",

      "body": "<p>Is Donald Trump going mad? It depends how you define the word. But since he\u2019s hoping to be elected US president on Tuesday, it would be handy to know. Democrats describe him as \u201cweird\u201d and \u201cunhinged\u201d. His rival, Kamala Harris, raised the \u201cM\u201d question again last week. \u201cThis is someone who is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-speech-ellipse-donald-trump-2024-election/\">unstable, obsessed</a> with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power,\u201d she warned.</p> <p>Harris, to her credit, was being relatively polite, though goodness knows why, given the way he disses and demeans her. So let\u2019s pose the question in more colloquial, idiomatic terms. Has stark raving Trump finally lost his marbles? Are&nbsp;there bats in the belfry? If he\u2019s off his rocker, not playing with a full&nbsp;deck and away with the fairies, the world and the voters have a right&nbsp;to&nbsp;know.</p> <p>Harris\u2019s assessment is obviously not an objective medical diagnosis of mental disorder. It\u2019s a normal person\u2019s reaction to the abnormal things Trump says and does. Crazy-strange campaign speeches by him and his supporters, notably at Madison Square Garden last weekend \u2013 a gathering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/oct/29/stephen-colbert-trump-rally-madison-square-garden\">akin to a Nazi Nuremberg rally</a>&nbsp;\u2013 are reviving the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/16/trumps-unwieldy-speeches-raise-questions-about-his-mental-acuity/\">debate about his sanity</a> that began during his first term.</p> <p>In <em>The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump</em>, published in 2017, a group of&nbsp;27 psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health professionals raised numerous red flags. One contributor suggested he&nbsp;was clearly off his chump: \u201c<a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6145972/\">Trump is now</a> the most powerful head of state in the world, and one of the most impulsive, arrogant, ignorant, disorganised, chaotic, nihilistic, self-contradictory, self-important, and self-serving.\u201d</p> <p>That professional opinion, made seven years ago, still rings true. Yet is the madness of \u201cKing\u201d Trump, like the madness of King George (whose tyrannical rule Trump seeks to emulate), getting worse?</p> <p>By one measure \u2013 his wild, deranged language \u2013 the deterioration is marked. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/trump-profanity.html\">His speeches</a> have grown coarser and coarser,\u201d wrote veteran White House watcher Peter Baker, who dubs him \u201cthe profanity president\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCounting tamer four-letter words like \u2018damn\u2019 and \u2018hell,\u2019 he has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/trump-profanity.html\">cursed in public</a> at least 1,787 times in 2024,\u201d Baker wrote. His analysis shows Trump is using such language 69% more often than when he ran in 2016. It\u2019s shocking, even by today\u2019s tawdry standards. Trump&nbsp;calls Harris a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/20/kamala-harris-campaigns-trump-arnold-palmer\">shit&nbsp;vice-president</a>\u201d who is \u201cmentally impaired\u201d. Doubtless he knows of what he speaks.</p> <p>Vulgarity, however gross, is not proof of madness. But it may be symptomatic. The Merriam-Webster dictionary, America\u2019s oldest, defines a mad person as one \u201c<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mad\">completely unrestrained</a> by reason and judgment; unable to think in a clear or sensible way\u201d. Trump aces this definition every time he opens his mouth. It fits him to a tee. Exhibit&nbsp;A: his oddball musings about golfer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/22/donald-trump-rally-arnold-palmer-penis\">Arnold Palmer\u2019s penis</a>.</p> <p>Bizarre Trump traits, such as compulsive, blatant lying, meet another dictionary definition of madness \u2013 behaviour that is \u201cincapable of being explained or accounted for\u201d.</p> <p>A third definition, rooted in US rather than British usage, suggests that Trump is indisputably bananas, in the sense that he is constantly \u201cintensely angry or displeased\u201d. Always feeling furious, feeling \u201cmad as hell\u201d, must be exhausting. It\u2019s enough to drive anyone round the bend. Older people often get irritable, of course; and screw-loose Trump is 78. So is incipient senility, or cognitive decline, another cause of his exceptional looney-ness?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By publicly projecting\u00a0and displaying mental\u00a0dysfunction daily on a national stage, he is driving America\u00a0nuts, too</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/us/politics/trump-speeches-age-cognitive-decline.html\">Trump stumbles</a>, mispronounces words, forgets where he is and loses his train of thought. Just like Joe Biden, in fact. But Biden is merely old. Trump is nuts.</p> <p>Trump has refused to take credible mental&nbsp;acuity tests or release his medical records. Last month, more than 230 healthcare specialists <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-health-records-doctors-for-harris/\">urged him to be more transparent</a>. \u201cAs we all age, we lose sharpness and revert to base instincts,\u201d they noted. \u201cWe are seeing that from Trump as he uses his rallies\u2026 to crudely lash out.\u201d</p> <p>It may go back to childhood. One theory is that Trump, bullied and bullier, was driven up the wall by maternal love denied. Another theory is that he suffers from \u201cdisinhibition\u201d. This is when people become less restrained, the older they get.</p> <p>But the <em>Atlantic </em>journalist McKay Coppins, who interviewed Trump 10 years ago, says he\u2019s always been this way. His \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/02/trump-buzzfeed-mar-a-lago-speech-coherence/677480/\">depthless vanity</a>, his brittle ego, his tragic craving for elite approval\u201d haven\u2019t changed one bit, Coppins wrote.</p> <p>Narcissism, hedonism, obsession,&nbsp;a need to provoke, scare, shock and scandalise, and chronic, paranoid feelings of victimhood are all indicators of worsening mental imbalance, if not early-onset imbecility. Recent Trump lunacies include claims that flies are buzzing&nbsp;round his head for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/oct/01/seth-meyers-donald-trump\">\u201csuspicious\u201d reasons</a>, North Korea is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-kim-jong-un-is-trying-to-kill-me-water-free-bathrooms?srsltid=AfmBOoq6YOsMcMDQnIaAletFWOXuHrqCksEirXVDClZ_dKMakXamGIRH\">trying to kill him</a>, the 6 January riot was a \u201clovefest\u201d, pet-eating migrants are akin to Hannibal Lecter, and that God saved him in the assassination attempt on his life.</p> <p>If Trump were to go mad on his own time, no problem. Unfortunately, by publicly projecting&nbsp;and displaying mental&nbsp;dysfunction daily on a national stage, he is driving America&nbsp;nuts, too \u2013 fans and foes alike. He brings out the worst in everyone, right and left. It could be termed national&nbsp;derangement syndrome (NDS).</p> <p>The poisonous effect of NDS was on show at Madison Square Garden, where \u201ccomedians\u201d amplified Trump\u2019s sexist, racist, hate-filled messages. This superspreader craziness destroys reasoned debate, splits the country into opposing camps (hence the dead-heat opinion polls) and sends blood pressure soaring. Many Americans <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/election-poll-2024-presidential-trump-harris-5zvlczh0k\">fear civil violence</a>. That\u2019s bonkers.</p> <p>This collective madness, akin to mass hysteria, is all-consuming and universally destructive. Like much that happens in America, it reverberates around the globe. Trump\u2019s fascistic Mad Hatter world is also the world of sicko revanchist dictators like Russia\u2019s Putin, Europe\u2019s far-right ultra-nationalist fruitcases, Iran\u2019s manic mullahs and&nbsp;off-their-heads Israeli <em>g\u00e9nocidaires</em>.</p> <p>It\u2019s a mad, mad, mad, mad world \u2013 to hijack the title of Stanley Kramer\u2019s 1963 comedy classic \u2013 but it\u2019s no laughing matter. It may be about to get madder still.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Tisdall is the Observer\u2019s Foreign Affairs Commentator</p> <p>\u2022 <em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "bodyText": "Is Donald Trump going mad? It depends how you define the word. But since he\u2019s hoping to be elected US president on Tuesday, it would be handy to know. Democrats describe him as \u201cweird\u201d and \u201cunhinged\u201d. His rival, Kamala Harris, raised the \u201cM\u201d question again last week. \u201cThis is someone who is \u201cunstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power,\u201d she warned. Harris, to her credit, was being relatively polite, though goodness knows why, given the way he disses and demeans her. So let\u2019s pose the question in more colloquial, idiomatic terms. Has stark raving Trump finally lost his marbles? Are there bats in the belfry? If he\u2019s off his rocker, not playing with a full deck and away with the fairies, the world and the voters have a right to know. Harris\u2019s assessment is obviously not an objective medical diagnosis of mental disorder. It\u2019s a normal person\u2019s reaction to the abnormal things Trump says and does. Crazy-strange campaign speeches by him and his supporters, notably at Madison Square Garden last weekend \u2013 a gathering akin to a Nazi Nuremberg rally \u2013 are reviving the debate about his sanity that began during his first term. In The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, published in 2017, a group of 27 psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health professionals raised numerous red flags. One contributor suggested he was clearly off his chump: \u201cTrump is now the most powerful head of state in the world, and one of the most impulsive, arrogant, ignorant, disorganised, chaotic, nihilistic, self-contradictory, self-important, and self-serving.\u201d That professional opinion, made seven years ago, still rings true. Yet is the madness of \u201cKing\u201d Trump, like the madness of King George (whose tyrannical rule Trump seeks to emulate), getting worse? By one measure \u2013 his wild, deranged language \u2013 the deterioration is marked. \u201cHis speeches have grown coarser and coarser,\u201d wrote veteran White House watcher Peter Baker, who dubs him \u201cthe profanity president\u201d. \u201cCounting tamer four-letter words like \u2018damn\u2019 and \u2018hell,\u2019 he has cursed in public at least 1,787 times in 2024,\u201d Baker wrote. His analysis shows Trump is using such language 69% more often than when he ran in 2016. It\u2019s shocking, even by today\u2019s tawdry standards. Trump calls Harris a \u201cshit vice-president\u201d who is \u201cmentally impaired\u201d. Doubtless he knows of what he speaks. Vulgarity, however gross, is not proof of madness. But it may be symptomatic. The Merriam-Webster dictionary, America\u2019s oldest, defines a mad person as one \u201ccompletely unrestrained by reason and judgment; unable to think in a clear or sensible way\u201d. Trump aces this definition every time he opens his mouth. It fits him to a tee. Exhibit A: his oddball musings about golfer Arnold Palmer\u2019s penis. Bizarre Trump traits, such as compulsive, blatant lying, meet another dictionary definition of madness \u2013 behaviour that is \u201cincapable of being explained or accounted for\u201d. A third definition, rooted in US rather than British usage, suggests that Trump is indisputably bananas, in the sense that he is constantly \u201cintensely angry or displeased\u201d. Always feeling furious, feeling \u201cmad as hell\u201d, must be exhausting. It\u2019s enough to drive anyone round the bend. Older people often get irritable, of course; and screw-loose Trump is 78. So is incipient senility, or cognitive decline, another cause of his exceptional looney-ness? Trump stumbles, mispronounces words, forgets where he is and loses his train of thought. Just like Joe Biden, in fact. But Biden is merely old. Trump is nuts. Trump has refused to take credible mental acuity tests or release his medical records. Last month, more than 230 healthcare specialists urged him to be more transparent. \u201cAs we all age, we lose sharpness and revert to base instincts,\u201d they noted. \u201cWe are seeing that from Trump as he uses his rallies\u2026 to crudely lash out.\u201d It may go back to childhood. One theory is that Trump, bullied and bullier, was driven up the wall by maternal love denied. Another theory is that he suffers from \u201cdisinhibition\u201d. This is when people become less restrained, the older they get. But the Atlantic journalist McKay Coppins, who interviewed Trump 10 years ago, says he\u2019s always been this way. His \u201cdepthless vanity, his brittle ego, his tragic craving for elite approval\u201d haven\u2019t changed one bit, Coppins wrote. Narcissism, hedonism, obsession, a need to provoke, scare, shock and scandalise, and chronic, paranoid feelings of victimhood are all indicators of worsening mental imbalance, if not early-onset imbecility. Recent Trump lunacies include claims that flies are buzzing round his head for \u201csuspicious\u201d reasons, North Korea is trying to kill him, the 6 January riot was a \u201clovefest\u201d, pet-eating migrants are akin to Hannibal Lecter, and that God saved him in the assassination attempt on his life. If Trump were to go mad on his own time, no problem. Unfortunately, by publicly projecting and displaying mental dysfunction daily on a national stage, he is driving America nuts, too \u2013 fans and foes alike. He brings out the worst in everyone, right and left. It could be termed national derangement syndrome (NDS). The poisonous effect of NDS was on show at Madison Square Garden, where \u201ccomedians\u201d amplified Trump\u2019s sexist, racist, hate-filled messages. This superspreader craziness destroys reasoned debate, splits the country into opposing camps (hence the dead-heat opinion polls) and sends blood pressure soaring. Many Americans fear civil violence. That\u2019s bonkers. This collective madness, akin to mass hysteria, is all-consuming and universally destructive. Like much that happens in America, it reverberates around the globe. Trump\u2019s fascistic Mad Hatter world is also the world of sicko revanchist dictators like Russia\u2019s Putin, Europe\u2019s far-right ultra-nationalist fruitcases, Iran\u2019s manic mullahs and off-their-heads Israeli g\u00e9nocidaires. It\u2019s a mad, mad, mad, mad world \u2013 to hijack the title of Stanley Kramer\u2019s 1963 comedy classic \u2013 but it\u2019s no laughing matter. It may be about to get madder still. \u2022 Simon Tisdall is the Observer\u2019s Foreign Affairs Commentator \u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The giant state \u2013 which stretches from New Jersey in the east to Ohio in the west \u2013 is a part of the \u201crust belt\u201d dominated by former manufacturing cities that is seen as probably the most crucial region in the election.</p> <p>Nearly all the most likely paths to victory for both candidates involve picking up rust belt states with Pennsylvania as the biggest prize.</p> <p>In that state, voters over the age of 65 have cast nearly half of the early ballots and registered Democrats account for about 58% of votes cast by seniors, compared with 35% for Republicans. That is a big lead in a demographic that usually trends towards Trump.</p> <p>At the same time, women have a 10-point gap over men when it comes to the early vote in Pennsylvania, according to analysis by the Politico website, using data from the University of Florida\u2019s United States Election Project. Another analysis, by NBC, showed an even larger gap in favor of women in the state of 13 points.</p> <p>Harris and her team are hoping for a large showing of women in the election as they have made the loss of reproductive rights central to their campaign after the supreme court overturned federal abortion rights. Women have trended strongly Democratic in the election, while men have leaned more Republican and thus any signs of a strong turnout by women is potentially good news for the vice-president.</p> <p>\u201cThe gender gap is a key reason for hope among Democrats and concern among Republicans, especially when many states have abortion rights amendments on their ballots in the 2024 election,\u201d Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-bad-news-pennsylvania-early-voting-harris-1978491\">told Newsweek</a><em>.</em></p> <p>But Republicans too are seeing signs of hope in the early voting trends \u2013 a sign that America\u2019s divisive election is still proving impossible to predict even after almost two years of furious campaigning by both parties.</p> <p>In Arizona, a crucial swing state in the so-called \u201csun belt\u201d on electoral battlegrounds, male voters have been turning out in increased numbers \u2013 a sign that Republican strategies of turning out men who have not voted before might be working. In Arizona last week, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/early-voting-data-shows-new-voters-group-swing-election-rcna178187\">the number of new voters in Arizona was </a>86,000 \u2013 far more than the tiny margin by which Joe Biden beat Trump in the state in 2020 \u2013 and the biggest share of those new voters were male Republicans.</p> <p>Overall, Republicans have traditionally been outnumbered in early voting with more Democrats choosing to go to the polls. In part, that has been because Trump and some of his allies have assailed early voting with baseless claims of fraud and conspiracy, despite Republican professional campaigners exhorting their supporters to get to the polls before election day.</p> <p>In 2024, there are signs that Republicans are indeed heading to the polls early in large numbers.</p> <p>In Georgia \u2013 another key sun belt battleground in the deep south \u2013 there are strong signs of a significant early Republican turnout. More than 700,000 people who voted already in 2024 did not vote at all in 2020, according to <a href=\"https://georgiavotes.com/\">Georgia Votes</a>, and that is seen as a sign that many of them might be Republicans as the campaign has focused on that demographic. At the same time, the top three counties for voter turnout rates in Georgia are <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rural-georgia-counties-outpace-dem-strongholds-peach-state-shatters-early-voting-records\">rural areas</a> won easily by Trump in 2020.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of voters that voted in 2016 but didn\u2019t vote in 2020 \u2026 What makes me believe that they are Trump voters is that most of them are \u2026 from parts of the state that are pretty strong Republican strongholds,\u201d Georgia\u2019s lieutenant governor, Burt Jones, told Fox News.</p> <p>Of course, as voting patterns shift for both sides, it could also be that an advantage in early voting for either Democrats or Republicans is quickly overwhelmed on election day itself when tens of millions of voters go to the polls in person.</p> <p>In the end, the 2024 race remains entirely unpredictable. The Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/02/presidential-polls-latest-donald-trump-kamala-harris-election\">10-day polling average tracker</a> has shown little change over the past week, after a slight erosion in Harris support over October, Harris retains a one-point advantage in national polls of 48% to Trump\u2019s 47%, virtually identical to last week and well with the margin of error of most polls.</p> <p>The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. The candidates are evenly tied at 48% in Pennsylvania while Harris has single-point leads in the two other rust belt states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Trump is marginally ahead in the sun belt, where he is up by 1% in North Carolina, 2% in Georgia and Arizona, and ahead in Nevada by less than a percentage point.</p> <p>But one wildcard for both campaigns is the Muslim vote, angered by US support for Israel in its attacks on Gaza and Lebanon. A poll released on Friday by the Council on American-Islamic Relations showed that 42% of the country\u2019s 2.5 million Muslim voters favor Green party nominee Jill Stein for president while 41% favor Harris. Trump registered 10% support.</p> <p>In theory, those margins of support for Stein, as in 2016, could swing some key swing states, such as Michigan, to Trump if the contest there is very close.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Almost 70 million Americans have already voted in the historic US election which comes to a head on Tuesday, prompting furious arguments over what early voting trends might mean as Donald Trump and Kamala Harris prepare for their final showdown. As both candidates and their top surrogates crisscrossed the country in a furious bout of last-minute campaigning, the race remains in a virtual dead heat \u2013 both in the head-to-head national polls and in the crucial seven battleground states that will actually decide the race for the White House. But as Trump and Harris made their pitches for what must now be a vanishingly small number of still undecided voters, tens of millions of Americans have already cast their ballots in the election through the various processes in the US that allow early voting. With so much at stake in the election, that huge number has triggered intense speculation as to what it might that mean with both Republicans and Democrats attempting to glean information that shows their side might already have the edge as voting day nears. Harris\u2019s campaign is latching on to some key information from the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania. The giant state \u2013 which stretches from New Jersey in the east to Ohio in the west \u2013 is a part of the \u201crust belt\u201d dominated by former manufacturing cities that is seen as probably the most crucial region in the election. Nearly all the most likely paths to victory for both candidates involve picking up rust belt states with Pennsylvania as the biggest prize. In that state, voters over the age of 65 have cast nearly half of the early ballots and registered Democrats account for about 58% of votes cast by seniors, compared with 35% for Republicans. That is a big lead in a demographic that usually trends towards Trump. At the same time, women have a 10-point gap over men when it comes to the early vote in Pennsylvania, according to analysis by the Politico website, using data from the University of Florida\u2019s United States Election Project. Another analysis, by NBC, showed an even larger gap in favor of women in the state of 13 points. Harris and her team are hoping for a large showing of women in the election as they have made the loss of reproductive rights central to their campaign after the supreme court overturned federal abortion rights. Women have trended strongly Democratic in the election, while men have leaned more Republican and thus any signs of a strong turnout by women is potentially good news for the vice-president. \u201cThe gender gap is a key reason for hope among Democrats and concern among Republicans, especially when many states have abortion rights amendments on their ballots in the 2024 election,\u201d Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, told Newsweek. But Republicans too are seeing signs of hope in the early voting trends \u2013 a sign that America\u2019s divisive election is still proving impossible to predict even after almost two years of furious campaigning by both parties. In Arizona, a crucial swing state in the so-called \u201csun belt\u201d on electoral battlegrounds, male voters have been turning out in increased numbers \u2013 a sign that Republican strategies of turning out men who have not voted before might be working. In Arizona last week, the number of new voters in Arizona was 86,000 \u2013 far more than the tiny margin by which Joe Biden beat Trump in the state in 2020 \u2013 and the biggest share of those new voters were male Republicans. Overall, Republicans have traditionally been outnumbered in early voting with more Democrats choosing to go to the polls. In part, that has been because Trump and some of his allies have assailed early voting with baseless claims of fraud and conspiracy, despite Republican professional campaigners exhorting their supporters to get to the polls before election day. In 2024, there are signs that Republicans are indeed heading to the polls early in large numbers. In Georgia \u2013 another key sun belt battleground in the deep south \u2013 there are strong signs of a significant early Republican turnout. More than 700,000 people who voted already in 2024 did not vote at all in 2020, according to Georgia Votes, and that is seen as a sign that many of them might be Republicans as the campaign has focused on that demographic. At the same time, the top three counties for voter turnout rates in Georgia are rural areas won easily by Trump in 2020. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of voters that voted in 2016 but didn\u2019t vote in 2020 \u2026 What makes me believe that they are Trump voters is that most of them are \u2026 from parts of the state that are pretty strong Republican strongholds,\u201d Georgia\u2019s lieutenant governor, Burt Jones, told Fox News. Of course, as voting patterns shift for both sides, it could also be that an advantage in early voting for either Democrats or Republicans is quickly overwhelmed on election day itself when tens of millions of voters go to the polls in person. In the end, the 2024 race remains entirely unpredictable. The Guardian\u2019s 10-day polling average tracker has shown little change over the past week, after a slight erosion in Harris support over October, Harris retains a one-point advantage in national polls of 48% to Trump\u2019s 47%, virtually identical to last week and well with the margin of error of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. The candidates are evenly tied at 48% in Pennsylvania while Harris has single-point leads in the two other rust belt states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Trump is marginally ahead in the sun belt, where he is up by 1% in North Carolina, 2% in Georgia and Arizona, and ahead in Nevada by less than a percentage point. But one wildcard for both campaigns is the Muslim vote, angered by US support for Israel in its attacks on Gaza and Lebanon. A poll released on Friday by the Council on American-Islamic Relations showed that 42% of the country\u2019s 2.5 million Muslim voters favor Green party nominee Jill Stein for president while 41% favor Harris. Trump registered 10% support. In theory, those margins of support for Stein, as in 2016, could swing some key swing states, such as Michigan, to Trump if the contest there is very close.",

      "bodyText": "Israel has tightened its siege of northern Gaza in the face of warnings from the UN and other aid agencies that hundreds of thousands of Palestinian lives at are risk, raising questions over whether the Netanyahu government\u2019s ultimate war aims include territorial expansion. The IDF says it is hunting Hamas militants but suspicions are growing that Israel is putting into practice a blueprint it had officially distanced itself from, known as the \u201cgenerals\u2019 plan\u201d. The plan, named after the retired senior officers promoting it, was intended to depopulate northern Gaza by giving the Palestinians trapped there an opportunity to evacuate and then treating those that stayed as combatants, laying total siege. The government insisted the plan had not been adopted, but some IDF soldiers in Gaza, as well as Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups, say it is being implemented on a daily basis, but with a major difference: the Palestinians in northern Gaza were not given a realistic chance to evacuate. They are trapped. \u201cIt is impossible for me to leave my house because I do not want to die out there. There are many people who lost their lives away from their homes, even in the south. Death is everywhere,\u201d said Ramadan, a 19-year-old in Beit Lahiya whose family has been displaced seven times over the course of the 13-month war. \u201cThere is a lot of shooting and all kinds of bombing. Gatherings are being bombed, shelters are being bombed, and schools are being bombed. The area is overcrowded, so that even a small bomb kills and injures a lot of people.\u201d \u201cEven if there are people who want to go south, they can\u2019t because there is no safe road,\u201d Ramadan said. Israeli ground troops have laid siege to three areas \u2013 Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and the Jabalia refugee camp \u2013 in the northern Gaza governorate, where there are estimated to be about 75,000 people. But the reality for almost all the 400,000 trapped across the northern half of Gaza is that there is no escape. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN relief agency Unrwa, made an emergency appeal on 22 October, calling for \u201can immediate truce, even for a few hours, to enable safe humanitarian passage for families who wish to leave the area and reach safer places\u201d. There was no response from the Israeli authorities, whose official position is not to deal with Unrwa, by far the biggest aid agency in Gaza. \u201cNothing happened when we sent that SOS out,\u201d said Unrwa spokesperson Juliette Touma. On Monday, the Knesset voted to ban Unrwa altogether within the next 90 days. The amount of aid reaching north Gaza has been heavily restricted since the start of the war on 7 October last year. Now the quantities of relief supplies entering the whole strip have hit a new low, and barely anything is reaching the north. The UN humanitarian affairs coordination agency, OCHA, reported that, as of Thursday, \u201cno bakeries or public kitchens in north Gaza are operational, and only two of 20 health service points and two hospitals remain operational, albeit partially\u201d. \u201cWith no electricity or fuel allowed since 1 October, only two of eight water wells in Jabalia refugee camp remain functional, both of them partially,\u201d OCHA said. In an emergency statement on Friday, the heads of OCHA and 14 other UN and independent aid agencies raised the alarm that the area was at the brink of an abyss. \u201cThe situation unfolding in north Gaza is apocalyptic,\u201d the appeal said. \u201cThe entire Palestinian population in north Gaza is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence.\u201d The residual health facilities inside the besieged zone, the Kamal Adwan, al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals, have been targeted. The third wave of a polio vaccination campaign got under way on Saturday, but not for children trapped in that zone. In the past week, Kamal Adwan was raided by the IDF, its medics detained, and then, after the soldiers withdrew, the hospital was bombed, destroying supplies recently delivered by the World Health Organization (WHO). \u201cKamal Adwan hospital has been reduced from a hospital helping hundreds of patients, with dozens of health workers, to a shell of itself,\u201d said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general. The situation is hardly any better at al-Awda hospital. Mohammad Salha, its acting director, said: \u201cThere is a shortage of fuel, of medication, medical supplies and food. There is no healthy water in the north.\u201d Salha added: \u201cThere are no ambulances,. The people are bringing the injured from the field on donkeys and on their shoulders. Some are dying in the streets because no one can take care of them, or they are carrying them the wrong way.\u201d The beds in the inpatient, maternity and other wards are all full of patients injured by bombing, and there is just a single surgeon left. Al-Awda has no O-positive, O-negative, B-positive or B-negative blood units left, Salha said, \u201cso if any cases come in and need these blood groups, they will die\u201d. \u201cWe are making a lot of appeals to the WHO, and we have a promise [of deliveries], but the Israelis refuse to allow a mission through to the hospital,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to deal with this situation.\u201d The \u201cgenerals\u2019 plan\u201d was presented as a means of using siege warfare to put pressure on Hamas to release its Israeli hostages. Defending it in an article in Haaretz on Friday, its principal author, the retired major general Giora Eiland, argued that siege was not a war crime if civilians were evacuated first, and that the occupation would be temporary, as a way of putting real pressure on Hamas. \u201cHad Hamas understood that not returning hostages means losing 35% of the strip\u2019s territory, it would have compromised long ago,\u201d Eiland wrote. Other analysts argued that the plan made little military sense, as Hamas could reconstitute anywhere and return later. For those under fire in northern Gaza, it does not seem like a counter-insurgency measure. \u201cThey kill all people without separating a civilian or a fighter,\u201d said Ahlam al-Tlouli, a 33-year-old from Jabalia camp. He said his father, stepmother and sister were killed by snipers and his brother had been missing since Ramadan. \u201cWe had opportunities to head south but refused because we know that the bombing is everywhere and there is no safe place.\u201d The ferocity of what is happening in northern Gaza has added to suspicions that there are more wide-reaching objectives at play.

And Isak was unchallenged, wandering into the surprisingly large gap between Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es and William Saliba. A fine goal, yes, but enabled by three moments of laxity.

The season before last Arsenal\u2019s title challenge ran out of steam as \u00d8degaard wearied; the need to provide back-up was obvious. There was a thought Kai Havertz might do that, but he is now apparently a confirmed forward. Mikel Merino is not the same sort of midfielder. F\u00e1bio Vieira, who cost \u00a335m in 2022, started five league games and is on loan at Porto. Emile Smith Rowe is at Fulham.

      "body": "<p>Artists and theatre companies who staged work at the major Edinburgh fringe venue Summerhall this year are missing thousands of pounds because the company that runs the venue is locked in dispute with HMRC.</p> <p>The artists, who have not received their box office takings from the summer\u2019s festival, are waiting for payouts of up to \u00a315,000 each. The company that runs Summerhall is accused by HMRC of failing to pay \u00a3500,000 in corporation tax, which it denies.</p> <p>Summerhall featured a programme of 108 shows at the 2024 fringe, most involving multiple collaborators. Artists received a statement from Robert McDowell, director of Summerhall Management Ltd, at the start of October saying Summerhall\u2019s accounts had been frozen and \u201cwe will not be able to pay you the sums belonging to you\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m going through a divorce while I\u2019m paying off the wedding,\u201d said Laura Horton, who staged her play <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/aug/18/lynn-faces-review-alan-partridge-lynn-benfield-summerhall-edinburgh\">Lynn Faces</a></em> in Summerhall\u2019s main hall in August and is owed about \u00a315,000.</p> <p>\u201cOur future activity has been really stunted,\u201d said Nick Cassenbaum, one of the artists behind <em>Revenge: After the Levoyah</em>, which won the Fringe First award. He is owed about \u00a312,500. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all these opportunities, people wanting us to tour the show, and we can\u2019t afford to do any of it.

      "bodyText": "Artists and theatre companies who staged work at the major Edinburgh fringe venue Summerhall this year are missing thousands of pounds because the company that runs the venue is locked in dispute with HMRC. The artists, who have not received their box office takings from the summer\u2019s festival, are waiting for payouts of up to \u00a315,000 each. The company that runs Summerhall is accused by HMRC of failing to pay \u00a3500,000 in corporation tax, which it denies. Summerhall featured a programme of 108 shows at the 2024 fringe, most involving multiple collaborators. Artists received a statement from Robert McDowell, director of Summerhall Management Ltd, at the start of October saying Summerhall\u2019s accounts had been frozen and \u201cwe will not be able to pay you the sums belonging to you\u201d. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m going through a divorce while I\u2019m paying off the wedding,\u201d said Laura Horton, who staged her play Lynn Faces in Summerhall\u2019s main hall in August and is owed about \u00a315,000. \u201cOur future activity has been really stunted,\u201d said Nick Cassenbaum, one of the artists behind Revenge: After the Levoyah, which won the Fringe First award. He is owed about \u00a312,500. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all these opportunities, people wanting us to tour the show, and we can\u2019t afford to do any of it. The ramifications are not just for us as producers, it\u2019s for actors and artists we employ: it\u2019s a whole ecosystem that has had the rug pulled.\u201d The uncertainty is causing distress for artists, who rely on box office takings to fund future tours or, often, replace personal savings invested in taking a show to Edinburgh. Writer-performer Anna Morris and her producers the Thelmas are in the same position \u2013 they are owed around \u00a311,000. \u201cDespite having a hit show at Edinburgh this year, our future plans for a London run and tour are now very much at risk because of the financial uncertainty,\u201d said producer Madelaine Moore.

      "body": "<p>In 2001 I interviewed the late <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore\">Gordon Moore</a>, the co-founder of Intel. He was in Cambridge to attend the opening of a new library that he and his wife, Betty, had endowed. We met in the university library \u2013 the central library of the university \u2013 and had an agreeable chat about the history of the tech industry and the role that he had played in it. As ever, he was wearing a tacky digital watch that served as a cue for a party trick he used to play on people. He would ask them what they thought it had cost, and most people would suggest a trivial sum \u2013 $10, say. Nope, he\u2019d reply. The actual cost was $15m: because that was what it had <a href=\"https://grail-watch.com/2023/03/26/gordon-moores-15-million-watch-the-story-of-intel-and-microma/\">cost Intel</a> to get into \u2013 and out of \u2013 the market for digital watches. And one of the lessons he learned from that was that his company should stay away from selling consumer goods.</p> <p>Moore was world famous because of an observation he had made in the early days of the semiconductor industry that Intel once dominated. He had noticed that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit (or chip) had been doubling every two years since 1965, and this was likely to continue for several decades. Inevitably, this became known as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/11/we-are-approaching-the-limits-of-computer-power-we-need-new-programmers-n-ow\">Moore\u2019s law</a>\u201d, as if it were a law of physics rather than just an empirical observation and an extrapolation into the future.</p> <p>Even so, it turned out to be an accurate prediction of how the business of making silicon chips would evolve. Since transistor density is correlated with processing power, what it meant was that computing power doubled every year until about 2010, after which it began to level off somewhat, largely because of the physical limits on the density of transistors that could be fitted on to a tiny rectangle. (Although it hasn\u2019t prevented Apple from getting <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/apple-a17-pro-3nm-iphone-15-pro\">19bn of them</a> on the A17 chip inside my iPhone.)</p> <p>But although Moore\u2019s \u201claw\u201d was bound to run out of steam eventually, it shaped an entire industry and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 changed the way we thought about computing.

It was <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/conceptionandfertilityrates/articles/howisthefertilityratechanginginenglandandwales/2024-10-28\">instead a statistic</a> released by the Office for National Statistics: the average fertility rate is now 1.44 children per woman \u2013 the lowest figure since records began.</p> <p>For Paul Morland, author of <em>No One Left: Why the World Needs More Children</em>, it\u2019s just the latest milestone in a long term and worrying trend. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a below replacement level fertility rate now for 50 years,\u201d he says. \u201cWe now have more deaths than births, and we are not alone.\u201d</p> <p>Most countries in the world have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/fertility-crisis\">below replacement fertility</a> \u2013 which in the UK is about 2.1 children per woman, and slightly higher in countries where infant mortality is a greater threat. The exception is sub-Saharan Africa, where high fertility rates are still common, though dropping.</p> <p>The pattern is well established. As societies grow wealthier and more secular, and woman gain greater agency, birthrates come down.</p> <p>Morland believes the world is teetering on the edge of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/population\">population</a> collapse. But to those concerned about overpopulation, increasing human consumption and climate change, pro-natalism is alarmist, nostalgic for women\u2019s domestication, and indifferent to the effect ever-expanding humanity has wrought on the planet.</p> <p>\u201cThe World Wildlife Fund says that we\u2019ve lost 73% of our wildlife population in the last 50 years,\u201d says Amy Jankiewicz, chief executive of<a href=\"https://populationmatters.org/\"> Population Matters</a>, a campaign group in favour of sustainable human population. The plunging fertility rate, she says, is \u201ccause for celebration\u201d. As she points out, the current UK population is about 68.3 million and is expected to reach 78 million by 2050. \u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But behind those headline figures, another picture emerges. The demographic makeup of the UK and the rest of Europe, not to mention North America and most of Asia, is radically changing. And it\u2019s this factor that is central to matters of fiscal revenue and public expenditure. Not only is the fertility rate going down, but longevity is going up. We are getting older as a nation and a global society.</p> <p>This ageing can be seen in what is known as the old age dependency ratio (OADR), which is the number of people of retirement age versus the number of people of working age. Or to put it another way, the number of people paying tax versus the number of people receiving pension support, as well as a disproportionate amount of NHS and care services.</p> <p>In the UK the OADR was below 20% in the 1950s \u2013 there were more than five workers for every retiree \u2013 whereas it is more than 30% today (or just three workers for every retiree). Morland notes that by the end of the century it \u201cwill be approaching 60%\u201d, which would be 1.7 workers for every retiree. That, too, is likely to be unsustainable.</p>    <p>Just look at the NHS. When it was established, writes Morland, there were around a quarter of a million people in Britain in their late 80s or older. Members of this cohort require six to seven times as much health spending as those in the prime of their lives. Today, he says, there aremore than 1.5 million in that age group and by the end of the century the figure is predicted to be almost 6 million. Here\u2019s another statistic to conjure with: in Italy in 1950 there were 17 under-10s for every one person over the age of 80. Today, writes Morland, \u201cthe two groups are matched roughly one-to-one\u201d. It\u2019s no coincidence, he says, that the countries with the most ageing populations, such as Greece, Italy and Japan, have the worst levels of government debt to GDP.</p> <p>Europe\u2019s solution to this growing shortfall in the labour force is immigration. The UK\u2019s population would now be in decline if it wasn\u2019t for the massive number of immigrants that keep service, health and care industries going. But to sustain this policy, argues Morland, almost half the population of the UK would have to be foreign-born by the end of the 21st century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2024-11-02-05:04:39/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Old age dependency ratio chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2024-11-02-05:04:39/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Jankiewicz counters that the good thing about immigrants is that they don\u2019t add to the world\u2019s population, but merely shift its distribution. Large-scale immigration, however, has been cited for the rise of right-wing parties in Europe, Brexit in the UK, and the popularity of Donald Trump in the US.</p> <p>Moreover, says Morland, the developed world routinely strips the developing world of its brightest and most dynamic people in what amounts to a post-colonial raid on those economies. In any case, it won\u2019t be long before sub-Saharan Africa moves, like India and China, to similarly low fertility rates, adds Morland.</p> <p>So what\u2019s the answer? There is no doubting the effects of the Anthropocene epoch, and it stands to reason that the world\u2019s population can\u2019t keep growing indefinitely. But unlike with almost every other vital aspect of the economy, democratic governments have almost no involvement in the fertility rate, either in its move up or down.</p> <p>The decision to have a child is rightly a private one, usually made between two people. It\u2019s extremely doubtful that any couple has ever set about trying to have a baby to solve a future labour shortage \u2013 that really would be a passion killer. Thus any governmental attempt to influence the parenthood decision could appear intrusive, and has in the past been draconian.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women in the UK and the US have about three-quarters of a child less than they say they want</p> <footer> <cite>Paul Morland, demographer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>China famously implemented a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china-s-one-child-policy\">one child policy</a> between 1979 and 2015 to halt the country\u2019s population growth.

But no one knows for sure because the 1922 Committee don\u2019t publish their rules and, as Brady explains in his book, they can change them whenever they want anyway. Referring to the executive committee of the 1922 Committee, and how it in effect makes up the rules as it goes along, he says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This decision-making body has no constitution to tie it in procedural knots.

He was fundamentally dishonest about illegal immigration, taxes, growth and inflation.</p> \n   <p>Yet it needs to be acknowledged that this dishonesty was not limited to him. It was also reflected in the bulk of the parliamentary party.

Conservative party members have chosen a new leader and the winner will be announced shortly after 11am at an event in London. This has only happened four times before since William Hague changed the rules a quarter of century ago to ensure members, not MPs, take the final decision about who should be leader. The process has not always worked very well \u2013 there\u2019s been a failure rate of at least 50%, conventional wisdom would say \u2013 which is one reason why Hague thinks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/21/william-hague-urges-tories-to-reject-plan-to-change-leadership-contest-rules\">his rule change has been a mistake.</a></p> \n  <p>The two obvious failures were Iain Duncan Smith, who was elected leader in 2001 but replaced after two years after MPs concluded he was not up to the job, and Liz Truss, who only lasted two months. The members\u2019 decision to elect David Cameron in 2005 is generally seen as a good one, because he led his party back into power and won a second, surprise election victory. Members also voted for Boris Johnson in 2019; like Cameron, he also turned out to be an election-winner, but his record as PM was so dire, and caused such lasting reputational damage to the party, that it is arguable that this was a bad choice too.</p> \n  <p>This time members have had to choose between Kemi Badenoch, the former business secretary, and Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister. It is often assumed that the most rightwing candidate will always win in a Conservative leadership contest, and that helps to explain what happened with Duncan Smith and Truss; members chose the rightwinger when polling evidence said a more \u201ccentrist\u201d rival would have been more popular with floating voters and the public at large. But this contest has been unusual in that both candidates on the final ballot were running as rightwingers. James Cleverly, the former foreign secretary and former home secretary, who was the leading \u201cmoderate\u201d in the contest and who was the clear winner of the Conservative conference leadership \u201cbeauty contest\u201d, was unexpectedly knocked out in the final ballot of MPs.</p> \n  <p>Badenoch is expected to win. There have not been any recent polls of members (polling is expensive, and media interest in the outcome of the contest is not exactly enormous) but the <strong>ConservativeHome</strong> website carries out surveys of party members which have always reliably predicted the winner in leadership contests and <a href=\"https://conservativehome.com/2024/10/25/badenoch-maintains-her-lead-in-our-final-leadership-survey/\">its last one</a>, published on 25 October, said Badenoch was comfortably ahead. It had her on 55%, Jenrick on 31% and don\u2019t knows on 14%.</p> \n  <p>My colleague <strong>Esther Addley</strong> has written profiles of the two candidates which are here.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/01/the-culture-warrior-and-the-populist-badenoch-and-jenrick-in-profile\">The culture warrior and the populist: Badenoch and Jenrick in profile</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Today I will be focusing almost entirely on the Tory leadership contest, although I may cover some other UK politics as well. The results are being announced at an event in London where Richard Fuller, the party chair, will say a few words, and Bob Blackman, chair of the 1922 Committee, will unveil the winner. The new leader will then deliver a short speech.</p> \n  <p>At some point the new leader will have to appoint a shadow cabinet, but it is not clear yet when that will happen. One person, however, won\u2019t be available; <strong>Cleverly</strong> has said he wants to stay on the backbenches. The revelation came in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a71ea574-1cab-404f-92ff-2203fb47f1e8\">an article</a> by <strong>Lucy Fisher</strong>, who interviewed him for her paper\u2019s \u201cLunch with the Financial Times\u201d feature slot. She writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Cleverly] has voted in the leadership contest, but will not confirm whether he backed Badenoch or Jenrick. He resolutely refuses to critique \u2014 let alone criticise \u2014 either candidate, conceding only that he does not \u201calways agree\u201d with them.</p> \n   <p>All three indicated they envisaged a smaller state and lower taxes. But Cleverly did not share Badenoch\u2019s crusade against \u201cwoke\u201d ideology, while he diverged from Jenrick over his vows to quit the European Convention on Human Rights and to radically reduce net inward migration to \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of people annually.</p> \n   <p>While he insists he will do everything he can to ensure the victor is a \u201croaring success\u201d, he reveals he will do so from the backbenches for now \u2014 he is not planning to serve in the next leader\u2019s team as a shadow minister.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line (we hope to open comments a bit later) or message me on social media.

      "bodyText": "Kemi Badenoch is the new Conservative party leader after defeating Robert Jenrick in a members\u2019 vote, becoming the first Black leader of a major UK party and the fourth woman to lead the Tories. As Peter Walker reports, Badenoch took just over 56% of the 95,000 votes, in a poll that had a 73% turnout of eligible members. This amounts to the narrowest win of the four since the party changed its rules to allow party members the final say in contested leadership elections. Speaking after the announcement in central London, Badenoch, an MP since 2017, who was shadow housing secretary, said the Conservatives needed to face up to hard truths if they wanted to win back the support of voters after July\u2019s catastrophic election result which cut their number of MPs to 121. \u201cOur party is critical to the success of our country, but to be heard, we have to be honest,\u201d she said. \u201cHonest about the fact that we made mistakes, honest about the fact that we let standards slip. The time has come to tell the truth.\u201d Here is Peter\u2019s story. Opinion polls suggest that the Conservatives would have been better off choosing someone like James Cleverly as leader rather than Badenoch, who is not popular with the public at large. (See 9.38am.) She is also someone whose main campaign theme was that the state should be doing less, but who has become leader at a time when the public want more and better services from the state, not fewer. The Tories are ruthless at getting rid of leaders who underperform and there are many at Westminster who think this won\u2019t be the last Conservative leadership contest before the election. But Badenoch has spark and courage, and her supporters are hoping she can turn things around. Three of the five Conservative leaders who served as PM in the last parliament have posted messages on X congratulating Kemi Badenoch. Rishi Sunak says: Congratulations to @KemiBadenoch on being elected @Conservatives party leader. I know that she will be a superb leader of our great party. She will renew our party, stand up for Conservative values, and take the fight to Labour. Let\u2019s unite behind her. Boris Johnson says: Congratulations to Kemi on her outstanding victory She brings a much needed zing and zap to the Conservative Party This sleaze-ridden Labour government has no ideas or agenda beyond the old tax and spend socialism They are far more vulnerable than the parliamentary maths might suggest Kemi has exactly the right courage and clarity to expose Starmer\u2019s failings She is now ideally placed to flip them over and take the Tories to victory at the next election I will be giving her my full support and call on all Conservatives to do the same And David Cameron says: Many congratulations @KemiBadenoch on being elected Leader of the @Conservatives. As the last Conservative Leader of the Opposition, I know all too well that it can be one of the toughest jobs in British politics. It is now time for the Party to renew and prove ourselves to the British people. Kemi will have my full support as she starts that crucial work. I also pay tribute to @RishiSunak and thank him for his service - to the Party and to the country. He has been an exemplary leader in challenging times. I wish him well with all he goes on to do in the future. Theresa May, who does not tweet much, has not posted anything. And Liz Truss has not posted anything about Kemi Badenoch either. But just before the result was announced, she did tweet a link to the book extracts where she blames not just Rishi Sunak, but all the MPs who backed him (including Badenoch presumably) for the election defeat. (See 10.12am.) My colleague Peter Walker has written an article with five things you might not know about Kemi Badenoch. He starts by saying that, although she constantly describes herself as an engineer, that does not necessarily mean she would be the best person to build a bridge or to take apart an engineer. She is a computing expert, a systems engineer. In the 2006 Observer interview mentioned earlier (see 1.19pm) she is described as a systems analyst. Leadership contests are about the only time when the Conservative party discloses membership figures. Robert Colvile, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, a Tory thinktank, says Kemi Badenoch should be worried about the figures out today. To understand why @KemiBadenoch needs to prioritise rebuilding the Tory membership/movement, just look at the number of votes cast: 2001 - 256,857 (IDS v Ken) 2005 - 198,840 (Dave v DD) 2019 - 138,809 (Boris v Hunt) 2022 - 141,725 (Liz v Rishi) 2024 - 95,849 (Kemi v Jenrick) Yes, there\u2019s lower turnout this time - disgruntled centrists, or people caring less about not electing a PM. But pool of voters has shrunk from 172,414 to 131,660 in just two years - 40k down! The Green party has urged the new Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, to abandon some of the \u201cdivisive\u201d views she has previously expressed. In a statement on her election, Adrian Ramsay, the Green party\u2019s co-leader, said: It matters who leads opposition parties and how they play their part in holding the government to account - that\u2019s a critical part of our democracy. Badenoch\u2019s track record doesn\u2019t fill me with confidence she will do this in a way that benefits the majority in this country, rather than just the super-rich. Hinting at scrapping the NHS, stating current maternity pay is \u2018excessive\u2019, not believing in net zero - none of these are great places to start. I would urge her to use this new found influence to support the Conservatives in moving towards a less divisive style of politics. A reader asks: How long is it before letters of no confidence from Tory MP\u2019s can go in? In theory, they could start arriving this afternoon. Graham Brady has just published Kingmaker, a book about his time as chair of the 1922 Committee during the last parliament which is a lot more revealing than the average political memoir and full of good material about the 1922 no confidence vote process. He says that after Boris Johnson became leader the first two letters calling for a no confidence vote arrived \u201cvery early\u201d. In practice, there is no precedent for a no confidence vote taking place less than a year after a leadership contest. Under the rules, if a leader wins a no confidence vote, another one is not meant to be allowed for at least another 12 months, and so arguably an early one would be a breach of this rule. But no one knows for sure because the 1922 Committee don\u2019t publish their rules and, as Brady explains in his book, they can change them whenever they want anyway. Referring to the executive committee of the 1922 Committee, and how it in effect makes up the rules as it goes along, he says: This decision-making body has no constitution to tie it in procedural knots. Instead, it is bound only by convention and what the members will accept. This being the Conservative party, some of them are, of course, thinking about the next leadership election. In an interview with Sky News John Hayes, a leading Robert Jenrick supporter, would only say that Jenrick should give up his leadership ambitions \u201cfor the time being\u201d when asked if his hopes of leading the party were over. When pressed, Hayes indicated that of course he wanted the party to unite, but that he was just making a point about the future always being uncertain. Robert Jenrick has urged the Conservative party to unite behind Kemi Badenoch. He posted this on social media. Congratulations to @KemiBadenoch. Thank you to everyone who supported my vision for a Conservative Party rooted in the common ground of British politics. It\u2019s now time for the @conservatives to unite behind Kemi and take the fight to this disastrous Labour Government. There will be full coverage of Kemi Badenoch\u2019s victory in the Observer tomorrow. In a post on Bluesky, Sunder Katwala, head of British Future, a thinktank focusing on race and identity issues, says Badenoch\u2019s first published interview in a national paper may have been one in the Observer in 2006. She was one of several young Tories the paper spoke to about why the party was becoming cool again under David Cameron. In it she spoke about her support for civil liberties and said she was \u201cnot one of those Conservatives who thinks every problem in the country is down to Blair and the Labour party\u201d. Katwala also says this YouTube video of a speech Badenoch gave at TedX Euston in 2011 gives a good insight into what drew her into politics. In a post on social media this morning Steve Barclay, who held a series of cabinet posts and who is now shadow environment secretary, said he would not take a shadow cabinet post under the new leader, whether it was Kemi Badenoch or Robert Jenrick. I want to congratulate Kemi and Rob on their excellent campaigns over recent months. After 9 years on the front bench, including the last 6 in the Cabinet, I have decided to return to the backbenches away from the constraints of front bench life and to have more time as a dad. Jeremy Hunt, the shadow chancellor, and James Cleverly, the shadow home secretary (see 8.24am), have both also said they are stepping down. Kemi Badenoch faces a challenge uniting her party, my colleague Pippa Crerar says. Kemi Badenoch takes 53,806 votes to Robert Jenrick\u2019s 41,318 on a turn out of 72.8%. It means she becomes Tory leader with backing of just 41% of party members and 1/3rd of Tory MPs. It\u2019s clear her first task will be uniting her fractured party. And here is some more reaction to Kemi Badenoch\u2019s victory from other parties. From Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster Wales wasn\u2019t factored into Kemi Badenoch\u2019s leadership campaign. She offered us nothing \u2013 no policies, no interest, and no recognition of her party\u2019s collapse here. Instead, her campaign was riddled with blunders: she claimed maternity pay had gone too far, stigmatised autism, and even suggested civil servants should be locked up. It\u2019s clear that the Conservatives\u2019 problems in Wales are far beyond her reach. From Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader I congratulate Kemi Badenoch on her historic achievement as the first Black female leader of the Conservative party. The first thing any new Tory leader should do is apologise to Scots for gambling with families\u2019 savings, crashing the economy and sending bills soaring while putting party before country. Yet with Badenoch already talking about cutting the maternity pay that is vital to young working families, it seems unlikely that the Tories have learned their lesson. While Keir Starmer congratulated Kemi Badenoch on her victory (see 11.44am), the Labour party issued a more critical response on a statement from Ellie Reeves, the party chair. Reeves said: Congratulations to Kemi Badenoch on being elected leader of the Conservative party. It\u2019s been a long leadership election but sadly one thing is clear \u2013 the Conservatives have learned nothing since the British people resoundingly rejected them in July. It\u2019s been a summer of yet more Conservative chaos and division. They could have spent the past four months listening to the public, taking responsibility for the mess they made and changing their party. Instead, Kemi Badenoch\u2019s election as leader shows they\u2019re incapable of change. The SNP has said the election of Kemi Badenoch as Tory leader shows the party has embraced the far right. Keith Brown, the SNP\u2019s deputy leader, said: The election of Kemi Badenoch as leader has finalised the Tories\u2019 lurch to the far right. Whether it\u2019s rolling back maternity pay or targetting the rights of minorities, Badenoch\u2019s win demonstrates how out of touch the Tories are with people across Scotland. The Tory party is now firmly dancing to the dangerous tune of Nigel Farage - it is essential that in Scotland Russell Findlay doesn\u2019t dance along and instead stands up for Scotland\u2019s inclusive and progressive values. This is probably unfair. While Badenoch is certainly very rightwing, there is little in what she has said that would fully fit an academic definition of \u201cfar right\u201d, such as Cas Mudde\u2019s claim it is about, at the very least, opposing \u201cfundamental elements of liberal democracy, most notably minority rights, rule of law and separation of powers\u201d. We have already quoted Keir Starmer\u2019s response to Kemi Badenoch\u2019s election as Conservative leader. (See 11.44am.) The Conservatives will only win back power by regaining votes from the Liberal Democrats and from Reform UK, but the leaders of those two parties have put out quite different statements about Badenoch\u2019s victory. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, congratulated her. He said: I\u2019d like to congratulate Kemi Badenoch on being elected leader of the Conservative party. The election of the first Black leader of a major UK political party is a historic moment for the country. Voters across the country believe her party is too divided, out-of-touch and unable to accept Conservative failures over the past years. The Liberal Democrats will continue to offer the best opposition to the government and fight for a fair deal for Britain. But Richard Tice, the Reform UK deputy leader, said: Kemi Badenoch is another in a long line of Tory politicians who say one thing and do another. Kemi Badenoch was front and centre of a government that failed Britain. She said nothing while Rishi Sunak hit hard-working people with record immigration, the small boats crisis, the highest taxes for 60 years, record NHS waiting lists and sky-high crime. Instead of standing up for Britain whilst in government, she stood up for her own career prospects and chauffeur-driven cars. She has failed the British public before and she will fail them again as leader of the Conservative party. Kemi Badenoch wants to have a new shadow cabinet in place before Tuesday, when the first shadow cabinet meeting under her leadership is due to take place, her team say. But they say she is not planning to announce any appointments today. The Conservative 1922 Committee has changed the rules to make it harder for MPs to trigger a no confidence vote in the new leader. It used to be the case that, if 15% of MPs wrote in private to the 1922 Committee chair asking for a no confidence ballot, they had to hold one. That threshold has gone up to 33%, meaning 40 MPs would have to be fed up with Kemi Badenoch for a ballot to take place. Bob Blackman, the 1922 Committee chair, said last month the threshold would be raised to at least 30%. In an interview with Christopher Hope from GB News, he has announced that the executive of the 1922 Committee settled on 33%. Hope says; The Tories have made it harder to remove new leader Kemi Badenoch. Sir Bob Blackman, the chairman of the 1922 committee tells me for @GBNEWS that the threshold to trigger a vote of no confidence has been secretly increased from 15pc to 33 pc of the Parliamentary party. This means that 40 MPs will be needed to trigger a vote of no confidence in Badenoch, rather than 18 MPs under the old 15pc rule. The change was made at a private meeting of the 1922\u2019s executive last Wednesday. For the record, here is the extract from Kemi Badenoch\u2019s victory speech with her message for her party. The task that stands before us is tough, but simple. Our first responsibility, as His Majesty\u2019s loyal opposition, is to hold this Labour government to account. Our second is no less important. It is to prepare over the course of the next few years for government, to ensure that by the time of the next election, we have not just a clear set of Conservative pledges that appeal to the British people, but a clear plan for how to implement them. A clear plan to change this country by changing the way that government works. The prime minister is discovering all too late the perils of not having such a plan. That huge job begins today. It will seek to involve all of our colleagues in parliament, in the Scottish parliament, the Senedd, our friends in Northern Ireland, as well as councillors and party members. But this is not just about the Conservative party. It is about the people we want to bring back to the Conservative party. It is about the people we need to bring into the Conservative party. It is about what the Conservative party needs to be over the next five, ten and twenty years. Our party is critical to the success of our country. But to be heard, we have to be honest. Honest about the fact that we made mistakes. Honest about the fact that we let standards slip. The time has come to tell the truth. The time has come to tell the truth, to stand up for our principles, to plan for our future, to reset our politics and our thinking, and to give our party and our country the new start that they deserve. It is time to get down to business. It is time to renew. Badenoch used language like this throughout the leadership contest but, like all the other candidates, she was reluctant to spell out in much detail what the \u201cmistakes\u201d made by the last government actually were, and who was at fault. The obvious culprits are Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, but they both remain quite popular with some Tory members and there was very little explicit criticism of what they did in office from anyone during the campaign. What we don\u2019t know yet is whether Badenoch will be minded to turn on her predecessors more bluntly now that she has won the leadership. Keir Starmer has congratulated Kemi Badenoch on her election victory, saying the fact that she has become the first black leader of a Westminster party is \u201ca proud moment for our country\u201d. He posted this on social media. Congratulations, @KemiBadenoch, on becoming the Conservative Party\u2019s new leader. The first Black leader of a Westminster party is a proud moment for our country. I look forward to working with you and your party in the interests of the British people. This is a version of what he said, in slightly more uplifting language, at PMQs on Wednesday when he said that having Rishi Sunak and his family light the diyas outside No 10 last year was \u201ca significant moment in our national story\u201d because he was the first British Asian PM and it showed Britain was a country \u201cwhere people of every background can fulfil their dreams\u201d. Badenoch herself is unlikely to talk so much about being the first black leader of a major UK party. Although she was equalities minister, she thinks leftwingers exaggerate the extent to which black people are disadvantaged by structural inequalities in Britain. Kemi Badenoch won with 57% of the vote. That is a less decisive victory than David Cameron\u2019s, (68%), Boris Johnson\u2019s (66%) and Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s (61%), and similar to Liz Truss\u2019s (also 57%). UPDATE: Taking into account rejected ballots, Badenoch had 56% of the vote. That is a lower share than Truss (who had 57.4% of the vote not taking into account rejected ballot papers, and 57.1% if they are included.) Badenoch said she would want to all colleagues to contribute to the job of renewing the party, including Conservatives in the Scottish parliament, in the Senedd, from Northern Ireland, as well as councillors and party members. The Conservative party was \u201ccritical to the success of our country\u201d, she said. But she said they had to admit where they made mistakes. Our party is critical to the success of our country, but to be heard, we have to be honest, honest about the fact that we\u2019ve made mistakes \u2026 The time has come to tell the truth, to stand up for our principles, to plan for our future, to reset our politics and our thinking, and to give our party and our country the new start that they deserve. It is time to get down to business. It\u2019s time to renew. And that was it. It was a very short speech from Badenoch, that was little more than a rehash of her stump speech. Badenoch says the Conservative party have a tough but simple job. They have to hold the government to account, and to prepare for government, she says. They need, not just clear \u201cConservative pledges that appeal to the British people\u201d, but also, \u201ca clear plan to change this country by changing the way that government works.\u201d. She claims Keir Starmer is discovering the perils of not having such a plan. Kemi Badenoch is speaking now. She thanks Richard Fuller, the party chair, and party members. She goes on: It is the most enormous honour to be elected to this role, to lead a party that I love, the party that has given me so much. I hope that I will be able to repay that debt. She thanks her husband, Hamish Badenoch, and Rishi Sunak. And she pays tribute to her rival, Robert Jenrick. She says: I\u2019d also like to pay a special tribute to Robert Jenrick, who has fought a great campaign. Rob, we have all been impressed by your energy and your determination. You and I know that we don\u2019t actually disagree on very much. And I have no doubt that you have a key role to play in our party for many years to come. Thank you. Here are the full figures from CCHQ. There were 131,680 eligible electors. Turnout was 72.8%. Kemi Badenoch received 53,806 votes Robert Jenrick received 41,388 votes There were 655 rejected ballots. 66,288 electors voted online and 29,621 electors voted by post. Blackman does not give us the full result for Robert Jenrick \u2013 at least not so we can hear at the back. He welcomes Badenoch to the state, and says it is wonderful to have the first black leader of the party. Blackman is now reading out the results. Kemi Badenoch: 53,806 Robert Jenrick: 41 \u2013 we can\u2019t hear the rest because of the cheering Number of members eligible to vote: 131,680 Turnout: 72.8% Spoilt ballot papers: 655 (610 unmarked or void, and 45 rejected because they voted for more than one candidate) Bob Blackman, chair of the 1922 Committee, is now speaking. He starts by thanking Richard Fuller for his work as party chairman. He says, when he became chair of the 1922 Committee, he wanted to ensure the party had a chance to rebuild, with a broad swathe of candidates. They reached compromise between those who wanted a very short contest, and those who wanted it to go into next year. Blackman also says he wanted to ensure Rishi Sunak had the chance to respond to the budget. Suank \u201ceviscerated\u201d the budget, he says. Fuller says whoever wins needs the party\u2019s full support. And he welcomes Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick into the room. They get a standing ovation. Richard Fuller welcomes those who are here. And he thanks members for making the contest so \u201cengaging\u201d. He names all six candidates, and thanks them for putting themselves forward. It\u2019s starting. Richard Fuller, the Conservative chair, is taking the stage. From Christopher Hope from GB News Back in the room, we\u2019re only about five minutes away from the star of proceedings. All the seats are taken and they have started playing stirring music (but not Taylor Swift \u2013 Kemi Badenoch\u2019s current favourite). Here are the results from previous Conservative leadership contests, and from the final MPs\u2019 ballot of this contest, that will help put today\u2019s results in context. 2024 contest MPs\u2019 final ballot Kemi Badenoch \u2013 42 (35%) Robert Jenrick \u2013 41 (34%) James Cleverly \u2013 37 (31%) 2022 contest MPs\u2019 final ballot Rishi Sunak \u2013 137 (39%) Liz Truss Truss \u2013 113 (32%) Penny Mordaunt \u2013 105 (30%) Members\u2019 ballot Truss \u2013 57.4% (81,326 votes) Sunak \u2013 42.6% (60,399 votes) Turnout \u2013 82.6% (142,379 out of 172,437 eligible voters) 2019 contest MPs\u2019 final ballot Boris Johnson \u2013 160 (52%) Jeremy Hunt \u2013 77 (25%) Michael Gove \u2013 75 (24%) Members\u2019 ballot Johnson \u2013 66.4% (92,153 votes) Hunt \u2013 33.6% (46,656 votes) Turnout \u2013 87.4% (138,809 out of 159,320 eligible voters) 2005 contest MPs\u2019 final ballot David Cameron \u2013 60 (36%) David Davis \u2013 57 (34%) Liam Fox \u2013 51 (30%) Members\u2019 ballot Cameron \u2013 67.6% (134,446 votes) Davis \u2013 32.3% (64,398 votes) Turnout \u2013 78.4% (198,844 out of 253,689 eligible voters) 2001 contest MPs\u2019 final ballot Ken Clarke \u2013 59 (36%) Iain Duncan Smith \u2013 54 (33%) Michael Portillo \u2013 53 (32%) Members\u2019 ballot Duncan Smith \u2013 60.7% (155,933 votes) Clarke \u2013 39.3% (100,864 votes) Turnout \u2013 78.3% (256,797 out of 328,000 eligible voters) The figures are from this House of Commons briefing paper on Conservative leadership contests. Labour says, whoever wins, the Tories have learned nothing. A party spokesperson told the BBC: The choice is between two people who each played their part in 14 years of Conservative chaos and decline, and who have refused to apologise it. Whoever wins, they have learnt nothing. The Conservative party leadership announcement is taking place at a hotel in central London. I\u2019m here, and we\u2019ve all been ushered into a large reception room in a basement. There is seating for about 250 people and it\u2019s about half full at the moment \u2013 with quite a few MPs, but more activists/supporters/staffers. And of course journalists too. It\u2019s all quite jovial; you would not describe the atmosphere as tense. David Williamson from the Sunday Express has posted a picture on social media. Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick both say they want to unite the Conservative party if they become leader. But this morning, in the Daily Mail, there is a good illustration of why this will be so hard. As James Heale from the Spectator points out, the Mail is running extracts from the new paperback edition of Liz Truss\u2019s memoirs in which the former PM strongly attacks her successor, Rishi Sunak. Ahead of her paperback release, Liz Truss issues a scathing attack on Rishi Sunak in the Mail Claims he was \u201ccomplicit in amplifying Labour\u2019s lies and spreading smears about me and my premiership\u201d Dubs him \u201ca creature of the Whitehall machine\u201d and says he skipped key meetings Says Sunak was \u201cfundamentally dishonest about illegal immigration, taxes, growth and inflation\u201d Tory MPs didn\u2019t remove him as \u201cmost.. shared his belief in the establishment narrative\u201d Adds of remaining MPs: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much survival of the fittest as survival of the wettest\u201d In the extract Truss says the \u201cbulk\u201d of Conservative MPs were also party responsible for the party\u2019s election defeat. She says: When I left office and Rishi became leader in October 2022, Reform\u2019s poll rating had been around the 3 per cent mark. By the time he called the election, they were consistently in double figures on around 12 per cent and were exceeding 14 per cent by polling day. The blame for that lies entirely on Rishi\u2019s shoulders. Instead of acknowledging the truth about the difficult state the country was in, he tried to press release his way to success. He was fundamentally dishonest about illegal immigration, taxes, growth and inflation. Yet it needs to be acknowledged that this dishonesty was not limited to him. It was also reflected in the bulk of the parliamentary party. The reason Rishi was not removed by MPs when he was leading us to consistently disastrous poll ratings and a dire performance against his own targets is that most of them shared his belief in the establishment narrative. They fundamentally misunderstand Britain. It is also why he has not been properly taken to task for the worst Conservative defeat in 200 years. The Conservative parliamentary party did not want to acknowledge their complicity in backing the status quo over the real change the country needed \u2013 and still needs. Gavin Barwell, who was chief of staff to Theresa May when she was PM, has posted this on social media about James Cleverly\u2019s decision not to take a job in the shadow cabinet. (See 8.24am.) Whilst entirely understandable on a human level, whoever is elected leader today only has a small Parliamentary Party to choose from. If other former Ministers refuse to serve, they are going to struggle to fill the frontbench But there is other polling around that should be much more sobering for the next Conservative leader \u2013 whether it is Kemi Badenoch or Robert Jenrick. YouGov has released polling figures about the two candidates, and it suggests the public at large don\u2019t like either of them very much. Here are the key findings. Many voters have not formed a view about Badenoch and Jenrick \u2013 but those who have are more likely to dislike them than like them, and as the leadership contest has been running this summer, the two candidates have become more unpopular, not less. In its write-up YouGov says: At present, only one in eight Britons (12-13%) have a favourable opinion of either Badenoch or Jenrick. In large part, this because relative few Britons have any opinion of the two leadership contenders, with 43% of Britons saying they \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 how they feel about Badenoch and 47% saying so of Jenrick. The new leader will pin their hopes on converting these many \u2018unsure\u2019 Britons, but that can\u2019t be taken for granted. Where public opinion on the candidates has shifted in the last few months, it has largely been in the negative direction. Compared to the end of July, the proportion of Britons with an unfavourable opinion of Badenoch has risen from 37% to 45%, while those with a negative view of Jenrick has increased from 27% to 40%. By comparison, the number with a favourable opinion of Jenrick has increased from 8% to 13%, while the figure for Badenoch has remained effectively level (11% vs 12%). Badenoch and Jenrick are both unpopular with at least a quarter of those who voted Tory at the last election, the polling suggests. In its analysis, YouGov says: A significant proportion of Conservative voters already have negative opinions of both leadership contenders. While 35% of those who backed the Tories in July have a favourable view of both Jenrick and Badenoch, one in four (26%) have an unfavourable opinion of the former and three in ten (29%) of the latter. Voters generally don\u2019t see either Badenoch or Jenrick as likely to make a good leader \u2013 but Jenrick is much more popular with Reform UK supporters, the poll suggests. As YouGov says: One in six Britons (16%) think Kemi Badenoch would make a good leader of the Conservatives, against 35% who believe she would be a bad leader. For Robert Jenrick, one in six Britons (17%) think he would make a good leader, versus three in ten (31%) who think he would be a bad leader. Like the wider public, Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem voters see both candidates in about the same terms, but Reform UK voters prove an exception. While they split evenly (28% to 29%) on whether Badenoch would make a good leader, they are roughly twice as likely to say that Jenrick would make a good leader (37%) as a bad leader (19%). This is because Jenrick is committed to leaving the European convention on human rights, a policy which is very popular with Reform UK supporters. Badenoch has not ruled the idea out, but she says it would be a mistake to commit to that now, and she argues that it would be wrong to see ECHR withdrawal as an easy solution to the problem of irregular migration. Voters at large are more likely to see Badenoch as strong and decisive than Jenrick \u2013 but also more likely to see her as dislikeable. Here are the figures. Voters think Keir Starmer makes a better PM than either Badenoch or Jenrick would, the poll suggests. Here are the figures. The national newspapers are ignoring the Conservative leadership contest on their front pages this morning. But the i has polling which should come as good news to the new Tory leader. In his story, Hugo Gye says the Conservatives are ahead of Labour in a voting intention poll. He says: The Conservatives have regained a polling lead over Labour for the first time in three years in the wake of the Budget, a new survey suggests. A BMG Research poll for i shows that just a quarter of the public feel positive about the government\u2019s first budget this week, with 40 per cent disapproving of the package set out by Rachel Reeves. Voters are much more likely to say that the measures announced by the chancellor will leave them worse off than that they will benefit from the higher spending funded by tax rises and borrowing. More funding for the NHS, schools and potholes are all overwhelmingly popular, according to the survey, but voters are split on the \u00a325bn tax hike for businesses and opposed to the idea of increasing the cap on bus fares from \u00a32 to \u00a33. This is what my colleague Eleni Courea posted on social media last night about what she has heard about the results of the contest. NEW - I hear the turnout in the Tory leadership contest was above 70% and that the winner has a decent margin of victory... Good morning. Conservative party members have chosen a new leader and the winner will be announced shortly after 11am at an event in London. This has only happened four times before since William Hague changed the rules a quarter of century ago to ensure members, not MPs, take the final decision about who should be leader. The process has not always worked very well \u2013 there\u2019s been a failure rate of at least 50%, conventional wisdom would say \u2013 which is one reason why Hague thinks his rule change has been a mistake. The two obvious failures were Iain Duncan Smith, who was elected leader in 2001 but replaced after two years after MPs concluded he was not up to the job, and Liz Truss, who only lasted two months. The members\u2019 decision to elect David Cameron in 2005 is generally seen as a good one, because he led his party back into power and won a second, surprise election victory. Members also voted for Boris Johnson in 2019; like Cameron, he also turned out to be an election-winner, but his record as PM was so dire, and caused such lasting reputational damage to the party, that it is arguable that this was a bad choice too. This time members have had to choose between Kemi Badenoch, the former business secretary, and Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister. It is often assumed that the most rightwing candidate will always win in a Conservative leadership contest, and that helps to explain what happened with Duncan Smith and Truss; members chose the rightwinger when polling evidence said a more \u201ccentrist\u201d rival would have been more popular with floating voters and the public at large. But this contest has been unusual in that both candidates on the final ballot were running as rightwingers. James Cleverly, the former foreign secretary and former home secretary, who was the leading \u201cmoderate\u201d in the contest and who was the clear winner of the Conservative conference leadership \u201cbeauty contest\u201d, was unexpectedly knocked out in the final ballot of MPs. Badenoch is expected to win. There have not been any recent polls of members (polling is expensive, and media interest in the outcome of the contest is not exactly enormous) but the ConservativeHome website carries out surveys of party members which have always reliably predicted the winner in leadership contests and its last one, published on 25 October, said Badenoch was comfortably ahead. It had her on 55%, Jenrick on 31% and don\u2019t knows on 14%. My colleague Esther Addley has written profiles of the two candidates which are here. Today I will be focusing almost entirely on the Tory leadership contest, although I may cover some other UK politics as well. The results are being announced at an event in London where Richard Fuller, the party chair, will say a few words, and Bob Blackman, chair of the 1922 Committee, will unveil the winner. The new leader will then deliver a short speech. At some point the new leader will have to appoint a shadow cabinet, but it is not clear yet when that will happen. One person, however, won\u2019t be available; Cleverly has said he wants to stay on the backbenches. The revelation came in an article by Lucy Fisher, who interviewed him for her paper\u2019s \u201cLunch with the Financial Times\u201d feature slot. She writes: [Cleverly] has voted in the leadership contest, but will not confirm whether he backed Badenoch or Jenrick. He resolutely refuses to critique \u2014 let alone criticise \u2014 either candidate, conceding only that he does not \u201calways agree\u201d with them. All three indicated they envisaged a smaller state and lower taxes. But Cleverly did not share Badenoch\u2019s crusade against \u201cwoke\u201d ideology, while he diverged from Jenrick over his vows to quit the European Convention on Human Rights and to radically reduce net inward migration to \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of people annually. While he insists he will do everything he can to ensure the victor is a \u201croaring success\u201d, he reveals he will do so from the backbenches for now \u2014 he is not planning to serve in the next leader\u2019s team as a shadow minister.

      "bodyText": "A piece of the radioactive fuel left from the meltdown of Japan\u2019s tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has been retrieved from the site using a remote-controlled robot. Investigators used the robot\u2019s fishing-rod-like arm to clip and collect a tiny piece of radioactive material from one of the plant\u2019s three damaged reactors \u2013 the first time such a feat has been achieved. Should it prove suitable for testing, scientists hope the sample will yield information that will help determine how to decommission the plant. The plant\u2019s manager, Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (Tepco), has said the sample was collected from the surface of a mound of molten debris that sits at the bottom of the Unit 2 reactor\u2019s primary containment vessel. The \u201ctelesco\u201d robot, with its frontal tongs still holding the sample, returned to its enclosed container for safe storage after workers in full hazmat gear pulled it out of the containment vessel on Saturday. But the mission is not over until it is certain the sample\u2019s radioactivity is below a set standard and it is safely contained. If the radioactivity exceeds the safety limit then the robot must return to find another piece, but Tepco officials have said they expect the sample will prove to be small enough. The mission started in September and was supposed to last two weeks, but had to be suspended twice. A procedural mistake held up work for nearly three weeks. Then the robot\u2019s two cameras, designed to transmit views of the target areas for its operators in the remote control room, failed. That required the robot to be pulled out entirely for replacement before the mission resumed on Monday. Fukushima Daiichi lost its cooling systems during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in three of its reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fuel remains in them, and Tepco has carried out several robotic operations. Tepco said that on Wednesday the robot successfully clipped a piece estimated to weigh about 3 grams from the area underneath the Unit 2 reactor core, from which large amounts of melted fuel fell during the meltdown 13 years ago. The plant\u2019s chief, Akira Ono, said only the tiny sample can provide crucial data to help plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and retroactively establish exactly how the accident had developed. The Japanese government and Tepco have set a target of between 30 and 40 years for the cleanup, which experts say is optimistic.

      "body": "<p>Is it any surprise that \u201cphoto op\u201d is a phrase imported into British English from the United States? Of course it came from there, the land where the visual image sits right at the centre of the culture, with politics no exception. It was the Nixon White House that came up with it, specifically a press aide by the name of Bruce Whelihan. According to Washington legend, whenever the president was meeting a visiting dignitary, Richard Nixon\u2019s hardball press secretary, Ron Ziegler, would turn to his underling with an order to summon the snappers. \u201cGet \u2019em in for a picture,\u201d Ziegler would say. Too polite to put it that way himself, Whelihan would clear his throat and announce to the ladies and gentlemen of the Washington press corps: \u201cThere will be a photo opportunity in the Oval Office.\u201d The photo op was born.</p> <p>But if the term was new, the thing itself had been a part of US politics almost from the start. Just as Roman emperors sought to cast themselves in stone and Tudor kings commissioned the finest artists to capture their likeness, so American presidents moved fast to harness the new technology of the age, in order that the nation might see the men who governed them. The selection of photographs assembled here is made up of a series of striking images, but a couple are extraordinary less for what they show than for the fact that they exist at all.</p> <p>Behold a portrait of John Quincy Adams, sixth US president and the son of its second. A daguerreotype, it dates to March 1843, when Adams had been out of office for well over a decade, but still: it is the earliest known photograph of a US president, its subject a man born in 1767 and whose father was the successor to George Washington himself. Seeing the face of Abraham Lincoln induces a similar feeling of historical vertigo. If there\u2019s a tendency to divide human events into two broad categories \u2013 our own, modern era and everything that went before \u2013 then the invention of the photograph can often be the instinctive dividing line between the two. But here are Adams and Lincoln, jumping over the barrier and barging their way into our own times.</p> <p>As for Nixon himself, he appears in this collection twice. That\u2019s fitting, and not only because of the origin story of the photo op. Nixon learned the hard way that in modern American politics, image is everything. Washington legend holds that in their 1960 presidential debate, Nixon comfortably beat the young Massachusetts senator John F Kennedy among voters who followed the contest on the radio \u2013 but, his face darkened by five o\u2019clock shadow, he lost among those who watched on TV. After that, Nixon was ready to put himself in the hands of the image-makers.</p> <p>One result is the intriguing photograph of the president and the king, Nixon and Elvis, standing improbably together in the White House in 1970. Showing two men both then at the height of their powers, both to fall just a few years later, the picture was long the most requested of all those held by the US National Archives. It fascinates partly because the pair represent polar opposites \u2013 a rock legend and a man so uncool he wore a suit on the beach \u2013 and partly because it invites you to guess at the men\u2019s motives: Nixon surely wanted some of Presley\u2019s stardust to land on him, while Elvis was in search of a federal agent\u2019s badge and, it seems, a sense of purpose.</p> <p>The other Nixon shot is the one that etched his downfall into the public imagination. It shows his parting gesture \u2013 an oddly celebratory, double V-for-victory salute \u2013 from the presidential helicopter as he made his disgraced exit following the Watergate scandal. Nixon flew off to California and into the history books as the first US president ever to quit.</p> <p>Between them, Elvis and Watergate, those pictures represent the two categories of presidential photograph: the ones they wanted \u2013 the photo ops \u2013 and the ones they most emphatically did not. The first category brims with examples and they follow a pattern. They show the occupant of the White House as a heroic, even mythic figure. The exemplar is Teddy Roosevelt on horseback, a hunter and adventurer who engaged in photogenic displays of muscularity and machismo so overt, they\u2019d make Vladimir Putin blush. But that tradition has endured. Indeed, it has turned into an expectation that a US president must not only be competent and wise, but also fit, strong and marked by conspicuous physical courage.</p> <p>Meeting that demand has been easy for some occupants of America\u2019s highest office. Dwight Eisenhower didn\u2019t have to pretend to be a warrior: he had been the supreme allied commander during the second world war. When he first campaigned for the presidency in 1952, there was no need to stage a photo op: there were images aplenty of him directing the D-day mission that had turned the war around just eight years earlier. No wonder he won.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>No matter how sweeping the range of these images, there is something missing. There are old presidents and young presidents. But there is no female president</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But for others, producing images of strength and command has taken some doing. The group portrait of Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin at Yalta ) had to have the so-called the Big Three seated because Roosevelt was paralysed from the waist down and required either a wheelchair or leg braces to get around. He and his aides went to great lengths to keep that fact from the US public and they mostly succeeded, thanks to a compliant press pack who obediently put away their cameras once the chosen image had been secured.</p> <p>That remained the custom for a while, the snappers keeping a discreet distance even after Eisenhower had both a heart attack and stroke in office, and as Kennedy battled crippling back pain. The images told a different story, including the silhouetted portrait of JFK standing alone at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, head bowed, a study in the loneliness of ultimate political authority. That photograph may lack the glamour or sparkle of other Camelot-era pictures, but it contributed to the Kennedy mystique \u2013 and the mythology of the presidency itself \u2013 every bit as much. This was the era of the cold war, of a nuclear standoff between the US and the USSR, and that desk was where the buck stopped. Here was where the button would be pressed \u2013 and here was the man who would press it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/sep/28/elton-john-stormzy-madonna-britney-41-era-defining-music-photos\">From Elton John at the piano to Stormzy at Glastonbury and Madonna snogging Britney: 41 era-defining music photos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Naturally, this iconography of president-as-hero takes different forms, depending on who\u2019s in the job. The image Jimmy Carter treasured from his single term in office cast him as successful peacemaker, bringing together Menachem Begin of Israel and Anwar Sadat of Egypt in the Camp David peace accords. For supporters of Donald Trump, the picture that renders him a hero is the one taken a second after a would-be assassin\u2019s bullet had brushed his ear, when he raised his fistand, with bloodied face, urged them to \u201cFight, fight, fight!\u201d.</p> <p>Sometimes, though, the man at the top has struggled to meet that deep public need for an alpha figure in the White House. Carter\u2019s political prospects took a hit when he was photographed \u201cwobbling, moaning and pale with exhaustion\u201d during a six-mile run in 1979. But the most recent, and serious, example is Joe Biden, whose visible frailty drove him from this year\u2019s presidential race. The pictures showing him apparently slack-jawed during a June TV debate with Trump were enough to persuade Democrats that he had to go.</p> <p>Which brings us to the images no leader ever wanted to be seen. Some were photo ops whose aim was to offer a heroic, presidential figure, which went badly wrong. Michael Dukakis\u2019s handlers wanted to project him as a potential commander-in-chief when they put him in a tank during the 1988 campaign; instead he looked like a hopeless dweeb. George W Bush\u2019s team doubtless thought a Mission Accomplished banner on an aircraft carrier conveyed victorious strength following the invasion of Iraq; instead it came to haunt him as an emblem of hubris and myopia.</p> <p>But other unwanted images from this collection capture not mistaken bits of stage management, but rather tragedy and disaster. George W Bush reading My Pet Goat to a group of Florida schoolkids as he gets word of the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 distils the shock of 9/11, even now. The lifeless body of Robert F Kennedy evokes the turbulence and violence of 1968, a time when the US seemed about to tear itself apart.</p> <p>It\u2019s all here: moments of hope \u2013 Barack Obama inspiring a young boy as America\u2019s first Black president \u2013 and moments of despair \u2013 Lyndon Johnson taking the oath following JFK\u2019s assassination while Jackie Kennedy, in blood-stained clothes, looks on. And yet, no matter how sweeping the range of these photographs, there is something missing from this selection. It would be lacking in any assembly of presidential pictures. Yes, there are Democratic presidents and Republican presidents. Yes, there are old presidents and young presidents. But there is no female president. We see Hillary Clinton, who got close. We see Shirley Chisholm, who was the first Black woman to try but never got near. Otherwise, there is an absence. On 5 November, Americans have a chance to fill that space \u2013 and to give the world a picture no one has ever seen before. </p> <p><em>Picture captions by Felix Bazalgette and Gabrielle Schwarz</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Jimmy Carter collapses, 1979</h2> <p><strong>By Phil Stewart</strong></p>    <p>\u201cHis face was ashen and his mouth hung open,\u201d is&nbsp;how <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/16/archives/carter-exhausted-and-pale-drops-out-of-6mile-race-still-an.html\">one reporter</a> described Jimmy Carter in September 1979, when the president dropped out of a six-mile race four miles in. Though he swiftly recovered, this image \u2013 two months after his speech blaming US problems on a \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d \u2013 was seen as evidence of weakness. He lost to Ronald Reagan the following year. <em>GS</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Richard Nixon bids goodbye,&nbsp;1974</h2> <p><strong>Photographer unknown</strong></p>    <p>\u201cOnce more, there was not a spark of contrition in the man,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1974/aug/10/usa\">commented the Guardian at the time</a>. On 8 August 1974, Richard Nixon earned the dubious honour of being the first (and, to this day, only) president to resign from office.</p> <p>Two years earlier, five men were caught trying to burgle and bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate complex in Washington DC. The subsequent investigation implicated Nixon, who faced impeachment for his role in covering up the break-in. Yet \u2013 as seen in this image of him leaving the White House for the last time \u2013 he was never really repentant. As he told David Frost in 1977, \u201cWhen the president does it, that means it is not illegal.\u201d One month after he resigned, his chosen successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him. <em>GS</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>FDR at Yalta, 1945</h2> <p><strong>Photographer unknown</strong></p>    <p>For eight days in February 1945, the \u201cBig Three\u201d \u2013 Franklin D Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin \u2013 met in the Crimean city of Yalta to discuss allied strategy. </p> <p>\u201cFDR\u2019s position between the other leaders is significant,\u201d says Diana Preston, historian and author of Eight Days at Yalta. \u201cIt was appropriate for a man who hoped to reconcile conflicting interests and build a future peace.\u201d The conference was at first deemed a success, but the Soviet leader soon broke his promises to allow free elections in&nbsp;eastern Europe, and the cold war began. <em>GS</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Texts from Hillary Clinton, 2011</h2> <p><strong>By </strong><strong>Kevin Lamarque</strong></p>    <p>It was the photograph that launched a&nbsp;thousand memes before becoming a&nbsp;liability at election time. The image of Hillary Clinton texting in sunglasses aboard a&nbsp;military plane to Libya went viral, inspiring a popular blog called \u201cTexts from Hillary\u201d. CBS reported at the time: \u201cHillary Clinton brings the LOLZ\u201d and Clinton even name-checked the authors of the blog in her&nbsp;first ever tweet, proudly setting the image as her avatar.</p> <p>By 2015, however, she would distance herself from it, dropping it from her Twitter profile when the FBI announced an investigation into her use of a private email address for government business. As the image became used in articles about the investigation, its meaning began to shift. Many people started to wonder what Clinton might have been writing on that Blackberry. The scandal&nbsp;came to a catastrophic peak just 11 days before the 2016 election, when FBI director James Comey announced that he was reopening the investigation after&nbsp;having closed it in&nbsp;July. <em>FB</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Theodore Roosevelt, 1898</h2> <p><strong>Photographer unknown</strong></p>    <p>This image of Roosevelt on a horse encapsulates the rugged masculinity the 26th president \u2013 in fact born into an aristocratic family in New York \u2013 strove to embody. Once a sickly child, he credited his recovery to exertion and hardship, and argued this approach would lead to triumph for both man and nation. Here he is in Cuba during the Spanish-American war, leading volunteer regiment the Rough Riders. Returning a war hero, he re-entered politics and became president after William McKinley\u2019s assassination in 1901. <em>GS</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Hair Like Mine, 2009</h2> <p><strong>By Pete Souza</strong></p>    <p>The symbolic power of the first African American president was cemented in this image of Barack Obama leaning forward so a five-year-old boy could feel his hair. On 8 May 2009, Jacob\u2019s dad, departing national security council staffer Carlton Philadelphia, took his family to the Oval Office for a farewell photo. This snap, by the then chief White House photographer Pete Souza, captures the moment Jacob asked, \u201cIs your hair like mine?\u201d Obama suggested he touch it and see. A framed print of the photo was hung in the White House for the rest of his presidency.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole thing happened so fast, I&nbsp;literally have this one picture,\u201d Souza recalls. \u201cMy composition was not perfect, but I think it adds to the spontaneity of the moment.\u201d </p> <p>Two years ago, Obama called Jacob to congratulate him on his high-school graduation. \u201cFolks who maybe didn\u2019t feel they belonged,\u201d he said of the image, \u201cthey\u2019d look at themselves differently \u2013 to see a&nbsp;person who looked like them in the Oval Office.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was a highlight of my life,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cIf I get to see another Black man at the top, I want to follow that lead.\u201d <em>GS</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Assassination attempt on Donald Trump, 2024</h2> <p><strong>By Evan Vucci</strong></p>    <p>This photograph will be remembered as a&nbsp;pivotal moment in this year\u2019s election. On 13 July, a&nbsp;gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler County in Pennsylvania. The former president was only lightly wounded when a bullet grazed his right ear but one crowd member was killed and another two critically injured before the shooter was taken down by a&nbsp;Secret&nbsp;Service&nbsp;sniper. This remarkable image of Trump \u2013 his ear and face bloodied, and fist defiantly raised in the air as he is hurried off the stage, an American flag raised behind him \u2013 instantly went viral. In&nbsp;an interview soon after, AP photojournalist&nbsp;Evan Vucci recalled his thoughts as he was capturing the scene: \u201cIn my head, I just kept saying to myself, slow down, slow down. Compose, compose.\u201d <em>GS</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, 1863</h2> <p><strong>By Mathew B Brady</strong></p>    <p>For almost a century, it was thought that no photographs existed of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg on 19 November, the day he delivered his endlessly quoted address at the dedication of the Soldiers\u2019 National Cemetery. That is, until archivist Josephine Cobb undertook some detective work in 1952. Cobb, the first woman to be employed by the National Archives, picked through the work of the 19th-century photographer Mathew Brady, famous for his portraits of the great and good. She came upon a&nbsp;broken glass negative that showed a vast crowd at Gettysburg \u2013 she estimated the time to be about noon, a few hours before Lincoln would speak. After repeatedly enlarging, expanding and reprinting the image, she found his unmistakable face in the crowd (bare-headed, left&nbsp;of centre). <em>FB</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Ronald and Nancy Reagan kissing in Vanity Fair, 1985</h2> <p><strong> </strong><strong>By Harry Benson </strong></p>    <p>\u201cThere is in the West,\u201d wrote William F Buckley in 1985, \u201ca tradition against chiefs of state engaging in visible, let alone ostentatious, shows of biological informality.\u201d Ronald and Nancy Reagan, both successful actors before going into politics, bucked tradition by using the White House as a setting for their love story. The media was happy to indulge them, with Buckley writing a fawning ode to the couple in Vanity Fair, to accompany a series of images by Harry Benson of them dancing to Sinatra and locking lips.</p> <p>Reagan, a year into his final term, could risk a little biological informality \u2013 the images were probably more consequential for Vanity Fair. Benson later said that the loss-making publication was facing closure until this issue. The editor Tina Brown, he said, convinced the owner to \u201cwait until the June 1985 cover of the Reagans appeared. The magazine sold off the stands and the magazine was saved.\u201d <em>FB</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Richard Nixon with Elvis Presley, 1970</h2> <p><strong>By Oliver F Atkins</strong></p>    <p>One December morning in 1970, Elvis showed up at the White House with a handwritten letter for the president. He wanted to give him a gift (a Colt pistol with silver bullets) and discuss becoming a \u201cfederal agent at large\u201d: \u201cI have done an in-depth study of drug abuse and communist brainwashing and I am right in the middle of the whole thing where I can do the most good,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Nixon gave Presley a federal narcotics badge, but not an official role. The bizarre encounter was captured by White House photographer Oliver F Atkins, but the images weren\u2019t made public until the 1980s, after Nixon\u2019s resignation and Presley\u2019s death. <em>GS</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>John F Kennedy: the loneliest job, 1961</h2> <p><strong>By</strong><strong> George Tames</strong></p>    <p>A few weeks into his presidency, JFK stood at his desk before meeting the French ambassador, reading an official paper.

But when news of the affair between the president and the former White House intern broke in 1998, photojournalist Dirck Halstead, then senior White House photographer at Time magazine, recognised her face. After searching through his archives, he located this image in a box of transparencies.

The Chicago Daily Tribune, forced to go to press early due to a&nbsp;printers\u2019 strike, issued 150,000 copies of this 3 November edition \u2013 held up by a gleeful Truman en route to Washington \u2013 before it became clear its editors had backed the wrong horse. <em>GS</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Dwight D Eisenhower, 1944</h2> <p><strong>Photographer unknown</strong></p>    <p>This image of General Dwight D Eisenhower addressing paratroopers at Greenham Common airfield on 5 June 1944, the day before they would parachute into France, became one of the most widely circulated of the war, durably linking him with D-day\u2019s success and the eventual American victory. Despite the general\u2019s authoritative pose, the soldier closest to him, Lieutenant Wallace Strobel, recalled a lighter conversation. \u201cHe asked my name and which state I was from \u2026 He then said, \u2018Oh yes, Michigan, great fishing there. Been there several times and like it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After the war \u201cIke\u201d, as he was popularly known, regularly topped polls as America\u2019s most admired man.

This photograph, considered risque at the time, made headlines all around the world and helped to establish his public image \u2013 even if they irritated his inner circle, including his wife, Bess. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should play piano in public again,\u201d she said, according to Truman\u2019s grandson. The New York Times recently dubbed it a viral image before its time \u2013 it inspired so many other women to climb up on the piano that it eventually broke. <em>FB</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Shirley Chisholm\u2019s presidential bid, 1972</h2> <p><strong>By Don Hogan Charles</strong></p>    <p>This is Shirley Chisholm \u2013 who four years earlier had become the first Black woman elected to Congress \u2013 announcing her presidential bid at the Concord Baptist Church, Brooklyn. She knew that, with its \u201cUnbought and Unbossed\u201d slogan, the campaign was a long shot \u2013 she was also the first woman of colour from either major party to run for president. So it was a feat that, despite racism and sexism from her own party as well as the opposition, she made it to the Democratic national convention with the support of 152 delegates \u2013 and came fourth. When Kamala Harris launched her first presidential bid in 2020, she paid tribute with campaign colours based on the red and yellow pins Chisholm\u2019s supporters wore. <em>GS</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>George W Bush\u2019s Mission Accomplished moment, 2003</h2> <p><strong>By Stephen Jaffe</strong></p>    <p>Dan Bartlett, George Bush\u2019s communications director at the time, would later call this photo op \u201cone of the big regrets of my life\u201d. \u201cIt did seem premature,\u201d remembers Stephen Jaffe, the press corp photographer covering Bush\u2019s speech on the aircraft carrier that day. \u201cThe administration tried to stage everything perfectly \u2013 unfortunately it\u2019s not a perfect world.\u201d</p> <p>As the eight-year occupation of Iraq spiralled and weapons of mass destruction failed to appear, the image of Bush in front of a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner, just six weeks into an invasion that would kill more than a quarter of a million Iraqi civilians, became a symbol of hubris.</p> <p>While Bartlett says the banner referred to the mission of the USS Abraham Lincoln, returning from its tour in the Gulf \u2013 the ship\u2019s crew requested it, and he \u201cdidn\u2019t think twice\u201d</p> <p>\u2013 Jaffe is sceptical and thinks the intended meaning was plain to all on the day. \u201cThere was a&nbsp;lot of spin afterwards,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the mission had been accomplished, they would have taken credit for it.\u201d<em> FB</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>George W Bush learns of 9/11, 2001</h2> <p><strong>By Win McNamee</strong></p>    <p>This captures the moment on the morning of 11 September 2001 when George Bush, taking part in a reading session at a primary school in Florida, learned that a second plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. (He\u2019d been informed of the first plane, at the time thought to be an accident, before he entered the classroom.) When his chief of staff, Andy Card, whispered in his ear, \u201cAmerica is under attack,\u201d he decided not to interrupt the reading, instead waiting around seven minutes before leaving.</p> <p>It would become one of the most scrutinised events of his presidency. In his scathing 2004 film Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore said, \u201cNot knowing what to do, with no one telling him what to do, and no Secret Service rushing in to take him to safety, Mr Bush just sat there.\u201d But several people there that day have since spoken out in his defence. \u201cIt was nice he understood we were young kids and would probably have gone crazy if he had told us what had happened,\u201d former student <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/04/september-11-schoolchildren-george-bush\">La\u2019Damien Smith told an interviewer</a> in 2011. <em>GS</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Situation Room, 2011</h2> <p><strong>By Pete Souza</strong></p>    <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a picture I have hanging on my wall,\u201d Pete Souza says. \u201cIt\u2019s not artistic \u2013 the lighting in that room sucked.\u201d On 1&nbsp;May 2011, the chief White House photographer was called to the situation room, a network of rooms below the White House. The atmosphere immediately felt unusual. \u201cI had been there many, many times before to cover discussions about sensitive policy decisions,\u201d Souza says. On this day, however, the decision had already been made: Souza was there to document Barack Obama and his senior team as they watched the operation to kill or capture Osama&nbsp;bin Laden play out in real time.</p> <p>As everyone packed into a side room to watch a live feed from a drone, Souza squeezed himself in the corner. (Seated, from left to right, is then vice-president Biden, Obama, joint operations command Marshall B Webb, deputy national security adviser Denis McDonough, secretary of state Hillary Clinton and secretary of defense Robert Gates.) While the raid unfolded in Abbottabad, Pakistan, Souza took about 100 images. \u201cIt was as tense and anxious a situation as I had ever seen that whole team in,\u201d he recalls. \u201cYou could see it on their faces.\u201d He tried to focus on his composition, getting everyone in frame, and on timing his shutter clicks so as not to distract them. Later it was announced that Navy Seals had killed Bin Laden, along with his son, a courier and two of the courier\u2019s relatives.</p> <p>Of nine pictures released that day, it was this one that went viral, exhaustively analysed and relentlessly memed. Souza, looking back today, believes this was because it occupied some part of the national psyche: \u201cWe had this guy that attacked our country, and it took us 10 years to find him, but we found him. It closed the chapter.\u201d <em>FB</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>John Quincy Adams,&nbsp;1843</h2> <p><strong>By </strong><strong>Philip Haas</strong></p>    <p>Though Adams was not the first president to be photographed (an 1841 picture of William Henry Harrison is now lost), this is the oldest surviving portrait of a US president. Adams had a familiarly vexed relationship with the medium. \u201cAll hideous,\u201d he wrote in his diary, after posing for daguerreotypes in the early 1840s. \u201cToo true to the original.\u201d This image of Adams \u2013 who served as president in the 1820s \u2013 surfaced in 2017, found by the great-great-grandson of a congressman who had received it as a gift from Adams.<em> FB</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Michael Dukakis and the tank, 1988</h2> <p><strong>By Michael E Samojeden</strong></p>    <p>Meant to project strength, this unfortunate photo-call crystallised, for critics and voters, something mediocre and uncertain about the Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Dukakis. The Republicans used it relentlessly in attack ads.</p> <p>Politicians are drawn to tanks: Churchill, Putin, Blair, Hugo Chavez, Liz Truss and Nigel Farage have all been snapped on or in one. Dukakis\u2019s efforts came only a&nbsp;couple of years after Thatcher\u2019s influential contribution to the genre; while she loomed out of the turret with uncanny poise, dressed in her own clothes, he seemed shrunken and overwhelmed, in a&nbsp;helmet that didn\u2019t belong to him.</p> <p>Widely recognised as one of the most disastrous campaign photos in history, the image would haunt future presidencies. \u201cI&nbsp;sat in countless meetings in which some smartass warned that a&nbsp;stop on the president\u2019s schedule had the makings of a \u2018Dukakis in the tank moment,\u2019\u201d recalled former Clinton aide John King to Politico. In 2013, after being handed a naval football helmet, Obama declined to try it on. \u201cYou do not put stuff on your head if you\u2019re president,\u201d he joked. <em>FB</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>JFK in the motorcade, 1963</h2> <p><strong>Photographer unknown</strong></p>    <p>\u201cIt was a watershed moment that changed America,\u201d says Fredrik Logevall, historian and biographer of John F Kennedy. \u201cI think there\u2019s something to the notion that America lost its innocence after 22 November 1963.\u201d</p> <p>More than other images from Kennedy\u2019s assassination \u2013 grainy TV coverage of the immediate aftermath, or Lyndon B Johnson being sworn in \u2013 this long lens shot of Kennedy smiling just moments before his assassination has come to signify what was lost that day. \u201cIn this photograph he\u2019s for ever frozen in our minds,\u201d Logevall says, \u201cthe picture of youthful vitality and glamour.\u201d</p> <p>For Logevall, it captures an era not only less haunted by political violence \u2013 open-top motorcades, beloved by Kennedy because he could get \u201ccloser to the people\u201d, are a thing of the past \u2013 but also less riven by polarisation. \u201cThis was a conservative city,\u201d he notes, and yet \u201chundreds of thousands of people turned up to cheer him on\u201d.</p> <p>Kennedy was on his way to deliver a speech on political extremism, with lines Logevall believes to be prescient. \u201cAmerica\u2019s leadership must be guided by learning and reason, or else those who confuse rhetoric with reality and the plausible with the possible will gain popular ascendancy, with their seemingly swift and simple solutions to every world problem.\u201d <em>FB</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>LBJ being sworn in,&nbsp;1963</h2> <p><strong>By Cecil W Stoughton</strong></p>    <p>On 22 November 1963, shortly after the assassination of John F Kennedy, vice-president Lyndon B Johnson took the oath to become the 36th president of the US, inside a cramped compartment aboard Air Force One, on the runway of Dallas airport. Kennedy\u2019s body had been loaded on to the plane 15 minutes before, and as the compartment filled with people, White House photographer Cecil Stoughton stood on top of a sofa, crammed himself against the curved ceiling and asked everyone to step back.</p> <p>When Jackie Kennedy arrived, still in her blood- stained suit,<strong> </strong>she was positioned to LBJ\u2019s left \u2013 her haunting, dazed expression lends the image its emotional force. In less than a minute, as Stoughton snapped eight pictures, the ceremony was over. As Air Force One continued on to Washington, Stoughton left the plane to ensure his film was swiftly developed and transmitted to the world\u2019s press, to authenticate the transfer&nbsp;of power to a&nbsp;new president. <em>FB</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Donald Trump mugshot, 2023</h2> <p><strong>By </strong><strong>Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office</strong></p>    <p>Even before Trump arrived at the Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Atlanta, Georgia, last August, people were anticipating the release of his mugshot, with fakes spreading around the internet. It was his fourth arrest that year, but the first time he had had a picture taken.</p> <p>Mugshots are often used to shame public figures who have run-ins with the law. But for Trump, ever the self-publicist, the image became a golden opportunity, adorning mugs, T-shirts and stickers, with the mottos \u201cNever Surrender\u201d or \u201cNot Guilty\u201d. Trump, not long reinstated on X by Elon Musk, tweeted the image himself, raising more than $7m in just a&nbsp;few days. <em>FB</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Jimmy Carter at Camp David, 1978</h2> <p><strong>By Karl Schumacher</strong></p>    <p>In September 1978, Jimmy Carter convened a secret 12-day summit with Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian president Anwar Sadat at Camp David. The main focus was a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel after 30 years of intermittent war. The resulting accords led to Israel agreeing to withdraw from the Sinai in exchange for its first official recognition by an Arab state and an end to the state of war. A plan was also laid out for Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza, but it was never implemented.</p> <p>Here Begin and Sadat are shown smiling and shaking hands at the presidential retreat in Maryland, as Carter looks on. \u201cThe picture makes it look as if the three leaders all got along very well at the summit. That was not at all the case,\u201d recalls William B Quandt, a former national security council staffer who was involved in the negotiations. \u201cThe adversaries were very hostile, and on the third day Carter decided not to have any more three-way meetings. We were not at all sure we would get an agreement until the last day.\u201d</p> <p>Begin and Sadat won the Nobel Peace prize that year, while Carter was awarded it in 2002 for \u201chis decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts\u201d. While the Camp David accords are recognised as his greatest presidential achievement, they left crucial issues unresolved and, some argue, helped prevent Palestianian statehood. <em>GS</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>George HW Bush in bed, 1987</h2> <p><strong>By David Valdez</strong></p>    <p>This photograph, taken in 1987 for Life \u00admagazine, captured the then vice- president with his \u00adfamily on holiday in Maine.

This level of access was remarkable: Yoichi Okamoto was the first civilian to be appointed chief photographer for the White House.</p> <p>Here we can also see a turning point in LBJ\u2019s presidency. Since taking over in 1963, he had sent more than 500,000 troops to what the public increasingly saw as an unjustifiable, unwinnable war. \u201cI know we oughtn\u2019t to be there,\u201d Johnson admitted to a colleague in 1966, \u201cbut I can\u2019t get out.\u201d He withdrew from the 1968 election, and Nixon won. <em>GS</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Calvin Coolidge as a cowboy, 1927</h2> <p><strong>Photographer unknown</strong></p>    <p>During his tenure in the 1920s, Calvin Coolidge held the greatest number of press conferences of any president (521 over six years), delivered the first State of the Union address on the radio and was the first to appear in a sound film. The media-savvy president appeared in photos dressed up in workers\u2019 overalls, pitching hay and \u2013 as here \u2013 wearing a cowboy\u2019s chaps and hat, on a trip to South Dakota. This image caused a&nbsp;stir: while the New York Times claimed \u201cCoolidge as Cowboy Wins West\u2019s Heart\u201d, others called him \u201ca pitiful puppet of publicity\u201d, the first president to make himself a laughing stock. He would not be the last. <em>FB</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Bill Clinton on Arsenio Hall, 1992</h2> <p><strong>By Reed Saxon</strong></p>    <p>This may well be what clinched the 1992 election for Bill Clinton. In June, weeks before accepting the Democratic presidential nomination, he appeared on Arsenio Hall\u2019s late-night talkshow and played Heartbreak Hotel on the saxophone. It was a bold move at the time and the image of a cool, confident Clinton on stage with his sax and dark shades is credited with helping him secure the youth vote especially. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see a Democrat blow something besides the election,\u201d Hall quipped on the show. The success of the appearance, the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-aug-15-et-cause15-story.html\">Los Angeles Times wrote</a>, \u201cchanged presidential politics \u2013 turning pop culture\u2019s hippest TV shows into the contemporary equivalent of campaign whistle-stops\u201d. <em>GS</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Lyndon B Johnson with Martin Luther King Jr, 1965</h2> <p><strong>Photographer unknown </strong></p>    <p>\u201cI want to tell you how grateful I am,\u201d Johnson told King on the phone, after becoming president in 1963, \u201cand how worthy I\u2019m going to try to be of all your hopes.\u201d The cautious collaboration between the two reached its peak on 6&nbsp;August 1965, with the signing of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibited racial discrimination in voting. Johnson is pictured that day, reaching out to pass a smiling King the pen used to sign the act, as Rosa Parks looks on.</p> <p>How strong this much mythologised moment of unity really was has remained the subject of fierce debate. Mutual distrust haunted their interactions and King faced relentless pressure from J Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI, with Johnson\u2019s knowledge. King split with the government over Vietnam, and today, voting rights have been rolled back. <em>FB</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Ronald Reagan at the Berlin Wall, 1987</h2> <p><strong>By Dirck Halstead</strong></p>    <p>On 12 June 1987, Ronald Reagan delivered probably the most famous sentence of his presidency: \u201cMr Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\u201d He was standing in front of the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate, 24 years after JFK gave his famous speech in the city. It was a risky move: the previous day, thousands had gathered to protest against his visit. Even his own advisers had been unsure whether the public address to the Soviet leader was too provocative. But the fall of the Wall two years later, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, seemed to vindicate the decision \u2013 though there is debate over whether its importance has been overplayed. Over time, Gorbachev and Reagan, both keen to end the cold war, formed a&nbsp;productive alliance. <em>GS</em></p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>Joe Biden at the debate, 2024</h2> <p><strong>By Justin Sullivan</strong></p>    <p>\u201cI\u2019ve done 31 debates since I\u2019ve been at Getty,\u201d says photographer Justin Sullivan, \u201cand I\u2019ve never seen anything like that.\u201d The Biden-Trump debate of June 2024 had felt unusual even before it started: press were allowed in only moments before it began and the room was eerily empty. As a \u201cpale and very unstable\u201d Biden gave \u201cincoherent\u201d answers, Sullivan focused on the \u201cstrange facial expressions\u201d that damned him as much as his nonsensical responses did.

      "bodyText": "Is it any surprise that \u201cphoto op\u201d is a phrase imported into British English from the United States? Of course it came from there, the land where the visual image sits right at the centre of the culture, with politics no exception. It was the Nixon White House that came up with it, specifically a press aide by the name of Bruce Whelihan. According to Washington legend, whenever the president was meeting a visiting dignitary, Richard Nixon\u2019s hardball press secretary, Ron Ziegler, would turn to his underling with an order to summon the snappers. \u201cGet \u2019em in for a picture,\u201d Ziegler would say. Too polite to put it that way himself, Whelihan would clear his throat and announce to the ladies and gentlemen of the Washington press corps: \u201cThere will be a photo opportunity in the Oval Office.\u201d The photo op was born. But if the term was new, the thing itself had been a part of US politics almost from the start. Just as Roman emperors sought to cast themselves in stone and Tudor kings commissioned the finest artists to capture their likeness, so American presidents moved fast to harness the new technology of the age, in order that the nation might see the men who governed them. The selection of photographs assembled here is made up of a series of striking images, but a couple are extraordinary less for what they show than for the fact that they exist at all. Behold a portrait of John Quincy Adams, sixth US president and the son of its second. A daguerreotype, it dates to March 1843, when Adams had been out of office for well over a decade, but still: it is the earliest known photograph of a US president, its subject a man born in 1767 and whose father was the successor to George Washington himself. Seeing the face of Abraham Lincoln induces a similar feeling of historical vertigo. If there\u2019s a tendency to divide human events into two broad categories \u2013 our own, modern era and everything that went before \u2013 then the invention of the photograph can often be the instinctive dividing line between the two. But here are Adams and Lincoln, jumping over the barrier and barging their way into our own times. As for Nixon himself, he appears in this collection twice. That\u2019s fitting, and not only because of the origin story of the photo op. Nixon learned the hard way that in modern American politics, image is everything. Washington legend holds that in their 1960 presidential debate, Nixon comfortably beat the young Massachusetts senator John F Kennedy among voters who followed the contest on the radio \u2013 but, his face darkened by five o\u2019clock shadow, he lost among those who watched on TV. After that, Nixon was ready to put himself in the hands of the image-makers. One result is the intriguing photograph of the president and the king, Nixon and Elvis, standing improbably together in the White House in 1970. Showing two men both then at the height of their powers, both to fall just a few years later, the picture was long the most requested of all those held by the US National Archives. It fascinates partly because the pair represent polar opposites \u2013 a rock legend and a man so uncool he wore a suit on the beach \u2013 and partly because it invites you to guess at the men\u2019s motives: Nixon surely wanted some of Presley\u2019s stardust to land on him, while Elvis was in search of a federal agent\u2019s badge and, it seems, a sense of purpose. The other Nixon shot is the one that etched his downfall into the public imagination. It shows his parting gesture \u2013 an oddly celebratory, double V-for-victory salute \u2013 from the presidential helicopter as he made his disgraced exit following the Watergate scandal. Nixon flew off to California and into the history books as the first US president ever to quit. Between them, Elvis and Watergate, those pictures represent the two categories of presidential photograph: the ones they wanted \u2013 the photo ops \u2013 and the ones they most emphatically did not. The first category brims with examples and they follow a pattern. They show the occupant of the White House as a heroic, even mythic figure. The exemplar is Teddy Roosevelt on horseback, a hunter and adventurer who engaged in photogenic displays of muscularity and machismo so overt, they\u2019d make Vladimir Putin blush. But that tradition has endured. Indeed, it has turned into an expectation that a US president must not only be competent and wise, but also fit, strong and marked by conspicuous physical courage. Meeting that demand has been easy for some occupants of America\u2019s highest office. Dwight Eisenhower didn\u2019t have to pretend to be a warrior: he had been the supreme allied commander during the second world war. When he first campaigned for the presidency in 1952, there was no need to stage a photo op: there were images aplenty of him directing the D-day mission that had turned the war around just eight years earlier. No wonder he won. But for others, producing images of strength and command has taken some doing. The group portrait of Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin at Yalta ) had to have the so-called the Big Three seated because Roosevelt was paralysed from the waist down and required either a wheelchair or leg braces to get around. He and his aides went to great lengths to keep that fact from the US public and they mostly succeeded, thanks to a compliant press pack who obediently put away their cameras once the chosen image had been secured. That remained the custom for a while, the snappers keeping a discreet distance even after Eisenhower had both a heart attack and stroke in office, and as Kennedy battled crippling back pain. The images told a different story, including the silhouetted portrait of JFK standing alone at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, head bowed, a study in the loneliness of ultimate political authority. That photograph may lack the glamour or sparkle of other Camelot-era pictures, but it contributed to the Kennedy mystique \u2013 and the mythology of the presidency itself \u2013 every bit as much. This was the era of the cold war, of a nuclear standoff between the US and the USSR, and that desk was where the buck stopped. Here was where the button would be pressed \u2013 and here was the man who would press it. Naturally, this iconography of president-as-hero takes different forms, depending on who\u2019s in the job. The image Jimmy Carter treasured from his single term in office cast him as successful peacemaker, bringing together Menachem Begin of Israel and Anwar Sadat of Egypt in the Camp David peace accords. For supporters of Donald Trump, the picture that renders him a hero is the one taken a second after a would-be assassin\u2019s bullet had brushed his ear, when he raised his fistand, with bloodied face, urged them to \u201cFight, fight, fight!\u201d. Sometimes, though, the man at the top has struggled to meet that deep public need for an alpha figure in the White House. Carter\u2019s political prospects took a hit when he was photographed \u201cwobbling, moaning and pale with exhaustion\u201d during a six-mile run in 1979. But the most recent, and serious, example is Joe Biden, whose visible frailty drove him from this year\u2019s presidential race. The pictures showing him apparently slack-jawed during a June TV debate with Trump were enough to persuade Democrats that he had to go. Which brings us to the images no leader ever wanted to be seen. Some were photo ops whose aim was to offer a heroic, presidential figure, which went badly wrong. Michael Dukakis\u2019s handlers wanted to project him as a potential commander-in-chief when they put him in a tank during the 1988 campaign; instead he looked like a hopeless dweeb. George W Bush\u2019s team doubtless thought a Mission Accomplished banner on an aircraft carrier conveyed victorious strength following the invasion of Iraq; instead it came to haunt him as an emblem of hubris and myopia. But other unwanted images from this collection capture not mistaken bits of stage management, but rather tragedy and disaster. George W Bush reading My Pet Goat to a group of Florida schoolkids as he gets word of the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 distils the shock of 9/11, even now. The lifeless body of Robert F Kennedy evokes the turbulence and violence of 1968, a time when the US seemed about to tear itself apart. It\u2019s all here: moments of hope \u2013 Barack Obama inspiring a young boy as America\u2019s first Black president \u2013 and moments of despair \u2013 Lyndon Johnson taking the oath following JFK\u2019s assassination while Jackie Kennedy, in blood-stained clothes, looks on. And yet, no matter how sweeping the range of these photographs, there is something missing from this selection. It would be lacking in any assembly of presidential pictures. Yes, there are Democratic presidents and Republican presidents. Yes, there are old presidents and young presidents. But there is no female president. We see Hillary Clinton, who got close. We see Shirley Chisholm, who was the first Black woman to try but never got near. Otherwise, there is an absence. On 5 November, Americans have a chance to fill that space \u2013 and to give the world a picture no one has ever seen before. Picture captions by Felix Bazalgette and Gabrielle Schwarz * * * Jimmy Carter collapses, 1979 By Phil Stewart \u201cHis face was ashen and his mouth hung open,\u201d is how one reporter described Jimmy Carter in September 1979, when the president dropped out of a six-mile race four miles in. Though he swiftly recovered, this image \u2013 two months after his speech blaming US problems on a \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d \u2013 was seen as evidence of weakness. He lost to Ronald Reagan the following year. GS * * * Richard Nixon bids goodbye, 1974 Photographer unknown \u201cOnce more, there was not a spark of contrition in the man,\u201d commented the Guardian at the time. On 8 August 1974, Richard Nixon earned the dubious honour of being the first (and, to this day, only) president to resign from office. Two years earlier, five men were caught trying to burgle and bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate complex in Washington DC. The subsequent investigation implicated Nixon, who faced impeachment for his role in covering up the break-in. Yet \u2013 as seen in this image of him leaving the White House for the last time \u2013 he was never really repentant. As he told David Frost in 1977, \u201cWhen the president does it, that means it is not illegal.\u201d One month after he resigned, his chosen successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him. GS * * * FDR at Yalta, 1945 Photographer unknown For eight days in February 1945, the \u201cBig Three\u201d \u2013 Franklin D Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin \u2013 met in the Crimean city of Yalta to discuss allied strategy. \u201cFDR\u2019s position between the other leaders is significant,\u201d says Diana Preston, historian and author of Eight Days at Yalta. \u201cIt was appropriate for a man who hoped to reconcile conflicting interests and build a future peace.\u201d The conference was at first deemed a success, but the Soviet leader soon broke his promises to allow free elections in eastern Europe, and the cold war began. GS * * * Texts from Hillary Clinton, 2011 By Kevin Lamarque It was the photograph that launched a thousand memes before becoming a liability at election time. The image of Hillary Clinton texting in sunglasses aboard a military plane to Libya went viral, inspiring a popular blog called \u201cTexts from Hillary\u201d. CBS reported at the time: \u201cHillary Clinton brings the LOLZ\u201d and Clinton even name-checked the authors of the blog in her first ever tweet, proudly setting the image as her avatar. By 2015, however, she would distance herself from it, dropping it from her Twitter profile when the FBI announced an investigation into her use of a private email address for government business. As the image became used in articles about the investigation, its meaning began to shift. Many people started to wonder what Clinton might have been writing on that Blackberry. The scandal came to a catastrophic peak just 11 days before the 2016 election, when FBI director James Comey announced that he was reopening the investigation after having closed it in July. FB * * * Theodore Roosevelt, 1898 Photographer unknown This image of Roosevelt on a horse encapsulates the rugged masculinity the 26th president \u2013 in fact born into an aristocratic family in New York \u2013 strove to embody. Once a sickly child, he credited his recovery to exertion and hardship, and argued this approach would lead to triumph for both man and nation. Here he is in Cuba during the Spanish-American war, leading volunteer regiment the Rough Riders. Returning a war hero, he re-entered politics and became president after William McKinley\u2019s assassination in 1901. GS * * * Hair Like Mine, 2009 By Pete Souza The symbolic power of the first African American president was cemented in this image of Barack Obama leaning forward so a five-year-old boy could feel his hair. On 8 May 2009, Jacob\u2019s dad, departing national security council staffer Carlton Philadelphia, took his family to the Oval Office for a farewell photo. This snap, by the then chief White House photographer Pete Souza, captures the moment Jacob asked, \u201cIs your hair like mine?\u201d Obama suggested he touch it and see. A framed print of the photo was hung in the White House for the rest of his presidency. \u201cThe whole thing happened so fast, I literally have this one picture,\u201d Souza recalls. \u201cMy composition was not perfect, but I think it adds to the spontaneity of the moment.\u201d Two years ago, Obama called Jacob to congratulate him on his high-school graduation. \u201cFolks who maybe didn\u2019t feel they belonged,\u201d he said of the image, \u201cthey\u2019d look at themselves differently \u2013 to see a person who looked like them in the Oval Office.\u201d \u201cThat was a highlight of my life,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cIf I get to see another Black man at the top, I want to follow that lead.\u201d GS * * * Assassination attempt on Donald Trump, 2024 By Evan Vucci This photograph will be remembered as a pivotal moment in this year\u2019s election. On 13 July, a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler County in Pennsylvania. The former president was only lightly wounded when a bullet grazed his right ear but one crowd member was killed and another two critically injured before the shooter was taken down by a Secret Service sniper. This remarkable image of Trump \u2013 his ear and face bloodied, and fist defiantly raised in the air as he is hurried off the stage, an American flag raised behind him \u2013 instantly went viral. In an interview soon after, AP photojournalist Evan Vucci recalled his thoughts as he was capturing the scene: \u201cIn my head, I just kept saying to myself, slow down, slow down. Compose, compose.\u201d GS * * * Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, 1863 By Mathew B Brady For almost a century, it was thought that no photographs existed of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg on 19 November, the day he delivered his endlessly quoted address at the dedication of the Soldiers\u2019 National Cemetery. That is, until archivist Josephine Cobb undertook some detective work in 1952. Cobb, the first woman to be employed by the National Archives, picked through the work of the 19th-century photographer Mathew Brady, famous for his portraits of the great and good. She came upon a broken glass negative that showed a vast crowd at Gettysburg \u2013 she estimated the time to be about noon, a few hours before Lincoln would speak. After repeatedly enlarging, expanding and reprinting the image, she found his unmistakable face in the crowd (bare-headed, left of centre). FB * * * Ronald and Nancy Reagan kissing in Vanity Fair, 1985 By Harry Benson \u201cThere is in the West,\u201d wrote William F Buckley in 1985, \u201ca tradition against chiefs of state engaging in visible, let alone ostentatious, shows of biological informality.\u201d Ronald and Nancy Reagan, both successful actors before going into politics, bucked tradition by using the White House as a setting for their love story. The media was happy to indulge them, with Buckley writing a fawning ode to the couple in Vanity Fair, to accompany a series of images by Harry Benson of them dancing to Sinatra and locking lips. Reagan, a year into his final term, could risk a little biological informality \u2013 the images were probably more consequential for Vanity Fair. Benson later said that the loss-making publication was facing closure until this issue. The editor Tina Brown, he said, convinced the owner to \u201cwait until the June 1985 cover of the Reagans appeared. The magazine sold off the stands and the magazine was saved.\u201d FB * * * Richard Nixon with Elvis Presley, 1970 By Oliver F Atkins One December morning in 1970, Elvis showed up at the White House with a handwritten letter for the president. He wanted to give him a gift (a Colt pistol with silver bullets) and discuss becoming a \u201cfederal agent at large\u201d: \u201cI have done an in-depth study of drug abuse and communist brainwashing and I am right in the middle of the whole thing where I can do the most good,\u201d he wrote. Nixon gave Presley a federal narcotics badge, but not an official role. The bizarre encounter was captured by White House photographer Oliver F Atkins, but the images weren\u2019t made public until the 1980s, after Nixon\u2019s resignation and Presley\u2019s death. GS * * * John F Kennedy: the loneliest job, 1961 By George Tames A few weeks into his presidency, JFK stood at his desk before meeting the French ambassador, reading an official paper. Photographer George Tames, shadowing him for the New York Times, took this photograph, which became famous for its intimate portrayal of the pressures of holding office. It was later reproduced in the opening title of US political drama The West Wing. FB * * * Bill Clinton hugs Monica Lewinsky, 1996 By Dirck Halstead It was a moment captured by chance: a hug between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky in the crowd at a Democratic fundraiser in Washington in October 1996. But when news of the affair between the president and the former White House intern broke in 1998, photojournalist Dirck Halstead, then senior White House photographer at Time magazine, recognised her face. After searching through his archives, he located this image in a box of transparencies. The photo ran on Time\u2019s cover that August, when Lewinsky agreed to testify before a grand jury investigating Clinton\u2019s denials of the affair. Four months later, Clinton was impeached on charges of obstruction of justice and perjury, but he was eventually acquitted and left office after two terms in 2001 with the highest approval rating of any departing postwar president. Lewinsky, meanwhile, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, \u201cmainly from the ordeal of having been publicly outed and ostracised back then\u201d, the anti-bullying campaigner wrote in Vanity Fair in 2018. \u201cThere has been at least one significant reference in the press to that unfortunate spell in our history every day for the past 20 years.\u201d GS * * * \u2018Dewey defeats Truman\u2019, 1948 Photographer unknown With Harry Truman\u2019s popularity waning, a win for his Republican opponent, Thomas E Dewey, in the 1948 election seemed certain. The Chicago Daily Tribune, forced to go to press early due to a printers\u2019 strike, issued 150,000 copies of this 3 November edition \u2013 held up by a gleeful Truman en route to Washington \u2013 before it became clear its editors had backed the wrong horse. GS * * * Dwight D Eisenhower, 1944 Photographer unknown This image of General Dwight D Eisenhower addressing paratroopers at Greenham Common airfield on 5 June 1944, the day before they would parachute into France, became one of the most widely circulated of the war, durably linking him with D-day\u2019s success and the eventual American victory. Despite the general\u2019s authoritative pose, the soldier closest to him, Lieutenant Wallace Strobel, recalled a lighter conversation. \u201cHe asked my name and which state I was from \u2026 He then said, \u2018Oh yes, Michigan, great fishing there. Been there several times and like it.\u2019\u201d After the war \u201cIke\u201d, as he was popularly known, regularly topped polls as America\u2019s most admired man. After years of claiming that it would be inappropriate for a military leader to run for president, he finally went for it in 1952, winning 55% of the popular vote for the Republicans. FB * * * Harry S Truman and Lauren Bacall on the piano, 1945 Photographer unknown While playing piano for photographers during a wartime variety show in 1945, vice-president Truman was joined by 20-year-old Lauren Bacall, with the famous actor perched awkwardly above him. \u201cI was just a kid,\u201d shrugged Bacall years later. \u201cMy press agent made me do it.\u201d Truman had only been vice-president for a few weeks, plucked from relative obscurity by Franklin D Roosevelt. This photograph, considered risque at the time, made headlines all around the world and helped to establish his public image \u2013 even if they irritated his inner circle, including his wife, Bess. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should play piano in public again,\u201d she said, according to Truman\u2019s grandson. The New York Times recently dubbed it a viral image before its time \u2013 it inspired so many other women to climb up on the piano that it eventually broke. FB * * * Shirley Chisholm\u2019s presidential bid, 1972 By Don Hogan Charles This is Shirley Chisholm \u2013 who four years earlier had become the first Black woman elected to Congress \u2013 announcing her presidential bid at the Concord Baptist Church, Brooklyn. She knew that, with its \u201cUnbought and Unbossed\u201d slogan, the campaign was a long shot \u2013 she was also the first woman of colour from either major party to run for president. So it was a feat that, despite racism and sexism from her own party as well as the opposition, she made it to the Democratic national convention with the support of 152 delegates \u2013 and came fourth. When Kamala Harris launched her first presidential bid in 2020, she paid tribute with campaign colours based on the red and yellow pins Chisholm\u2019s supporters wore. GS * * * George W Bush\u2019s Mission Accomplished moment, 2003 By Stephen Jaffe Dan Bartlett, George Bush\u2019s communications director at the time, would later call this photo op \u201cone of the big regrets of my life\u201d. \u201cIt did seem premature,\u201d remembers Stephen Jaffe, the press corp photographer covering Bush\u2019s speech on the aircraft carrier that day. \u201cThe administration tried to stage everything perfectly \u2013 unfortunately it\u2019s not a perfect world.\u201d As the eight-year occupation of Iraq spiralled and weapons of mass destruction failed to appear, the image of Bush in front of a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner, just six weeks into an invasion that would kill more than a quarter of a million Iraqi civilians, became a symbol of hubris. While Bartlett says the banner referred to the mission of the USS Abraham Lincoln, returning from its tour in the Gulf \u2013 the ship\u2019s crew requested it, and he \u201cdidn\u2019t think twice\u201d \u2013 Jaffe is sceptical and thinks the intended meaning was plain to all on the day. \u201cThere was a lot of spin afterwards,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the mission had been accomplished, they would have taken credit for it.\u201d FB * * * George W Bush learns of 9/11, 2001 By Win McNamee This captures the moment on the morning of 11 September 2001 when George Bush, taking part in a reading session at a primary school in Florida, learned that a second plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. (He\u2019d been informed of the first plane, at the time thought to be an accident, before he entered the classroom.) When his chief of staff, Andy Card, whispered in his ear, \u201cAmerica is under attack,\u201d he decided not to interrupt the reading, instead waiting around seven minutes before leaving. It would become one of the most scrutinised events of his presidency. In his scathing 2004 film Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore said, \u201cNot knowing what to do, with no one telling him what to do, and no Secret Service rushing in to take him to safety, Mr Bush just sat there.\u201d But several people there that day have since spoken out in his defence. \u201cIt was nice he understood we were young kids and would probably have gone crazy if he had told us what had happened,\u201d former student La\u2019Damien Smith told an interviewer in 2011. GS * * * Situation Room, 2011 By Pete Souza \u201cIt\u2019s not a picture I have hanging on my wall,\u201d Pete Souza says. \u201cIt\u2019s not artistic \u2013 the lighting in that room sucked.\u201d On 1 May 2011, the chief White House photographer was called to the situation room, a network of rooms below the White House. The atmosphere immediately felt unusual. \u201cI had been there many, many times before to cover discussions about sensitive policy decisions,\u201d Souza says. On this day, however, the decision had already been made: Souza was there to document Barack Obama and his senior team as they watched the operation to kill or capture Osama bin Laden play out in real time. As everyone packed into a side room to watch a live feed from a drone, Souza squeezed himself in the corner. (Seated, from left to right, is then vice-president Biden, Obama, joint operations command Marshall B Webb, deputy national security adviser Denis McDonough, secretary of state Hillary Clinton and secretary of defense Robert Gates.) While the raid unfolded in Abbottabad, Pakistan, Souza took about 100 images. \u201cIt was as tense and anxious a situation as I had ever seen that whole team in,\u201d he recalls. \u201cYou could see it on their faces.\u201d He tried to focus on his composition, getting everyone in frame, and on timing his shutter clicks so as not to distract them. Later it was announced that Navy Seals had killed Bin Laden, along with his son, a courier and two of the courier\u2019s relatives. Of nine pictures released that day, it was this one that went viral, exhaustively analysed and relentlessly memed. Souza, looking back today, believes this was because it occupied some part of the national psyche: \u201cWe had this guy that attacked our country, and it took us 10 years to find him, but we found him. It closed the chapter.\u201d FB * * * John Quincy Adams, 1843 By Philip Haas Though Adams was not the first president to be photographed (an 1841 picture of William Henry Harrison is now lost), this is the oldest surviving portrait of a US president. Adams had a familiarly vexed relationship with the medium. \u201cAll hideous,\u201d he wrote in his diary, after posing for daguerreotypes in the early 1840s. \u201cToo true to the original.\u201d This image of Adams \u2013 who served as president in the 1820s \u2013 surfaced in 2017, found by the great-great-grandson of a congressman who had received it as a gift from Adams. FB * * * Michael Dukakis and the tank, 1988 By Michael E Samojeden Meant to project strength, this unfortunate photo-call crystallised, for critics and voters, something mediocre and uncertain about the Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Dukakis. The Republicans used it relentlessly in attack ads. Politicians are drawn to tanks: Churchill, Putin, Blair, Hugo Chavez, Liz Truss and Nigel Farage have all been snapped on or in one. Dukakis\u2019s efforts came only a couple of years after Thatcher\u2019s influential contribution to the genre; while she loomed out of the turret with uncanny poise, dressed in her own clothes, he seemed shrunken and overwhelmed, in a helmet that didn\u2019t belong to him. Widely recognised as one of the most disastrous campaign photos in history, the image would haunt future presidencies. \u201cI sat in countless meetings in which some smartass warned that a stop on the president\u2019s schedule had the makings of a \u2018Dukakis in the tank moment,\u2019\u201d recalled former Clinton aide John King to Politico. In 2013, after being handed a naval football helmet, Obama declined to try it on. \u201cYou do not put stuff on your head if you\u2019re president,\u201d he joked. FB * * * JFK in the motorcade, 1963 Photographer unknown \u201cIt was a watershed moment that changed America,\u201d says Fredrik Logevall, historian and biographer of John F Kennedy. \u201cI think there\u2019s something to the notion that America lost its innocence after 22 November 1963.\u201d More than other images from Kennedy\u2019s assassination \u2013 grainy TV coverage of the immediate aftermath, or Lyndon B Johnson being sworn in \u2013 this long lens shot of Kennedy smiling just moments before his assassination has come to signify what was lost that day. \u201cIn this photograph he\u2019s for ever frozen in our minds,\u201d Logevall says, \u201cthe picture of youthful vitality and glamour.\u201d For Logevall, it captures an era not only less haunted by political violence \u2013 open-top motorcades, beloved by Kennedy because he could get \u201ccloser to the people\u201d, are a thing of the past \u2013 but also less riven by polarisation. \u201cThis was a conservative city,\u201d he notes, and yet \u201chundreds of thousands of people turned up to cheer him on\u201d. Kennedy was on his way to deliver a speech on political extremism, with lines Logevall believes to be prescient. \u201cAmerica\u2019s leadership must be guided by learning and reason, or else those who confuse rhetoric with reality and the plausible with the possible will gain popular ascendancy, with their seemingly swift and simple solutions to every world problem.\u201d FB * * * LBJ being sworn in, 1963 By Cecil W Stoughton On 22 November 1963, shortly after the assassination of John F Kennedy, vice-president Lyndon B Johnson took the oath to become the 36th president of the US, inside a cramped compartment aboard Air Force One, on the runway of Dallas airport. Kennedy\u2019s body had been loaded on to the plane 15 minutes before, and as the compartment filled with people, White House photographer Cecil Stoughton stood on top of a sofa, crammed himself against the curved ceiling and asked everyone to step back. When Jackie Kennedy arrived, still in her blood- stained suit, she was positioned to LBJ\u2019s left \u2013 her haunting, dazed expression lends the image its emotional force. In less than a minute, as Stoughton snapped eight pictures, the ceremony was over. As Air Force One continued on to Washington, Stoughton left the plane to ensure his film was swiftly developed and transmitted to the world\u2019s press, to authenticate the transfer of power to a new president. FB * * * Donald Trump mugshot, 2023 By Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office Even before Trump arrived at the Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Atlanta, Georgia, last August, people were anticipating the release of his mugshot, with fakes spreading around the internet. It was his fourth arrest that year, but the first time he had had a picture taken. Mugshots are often used to shame public figures who have run-ins with the law. But for Trump, ever the self-publicist, the image became a golden opportunity, adorning mugs, T-shirts and stickers, with the mottos \u201cNever Surrender\u201d or \u201cNot Guilty\u201d. Trump, not long reinstated on X by Elon Musk, tweeted the image himself, raising more than $7m in just a few days. FB * * * Jimmy Carter at Camp David, 1978 By Karl Schumacher In September 1978, Jimmy Carter convened a secret 12-day summit with Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian president Anwar Sadat at Camp David. The main focus was a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel after 30 years of intermittent war. The resulting accords led to Israel agreeing to withdraw from the Sinai in exchange for its first official recognition by an Arab state and an end to the state of war. A plan was also laid out for Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza, but it was never implemented. Here Begin and Sadat are shown smiling and shaking hands at the presidential retreat in Maryland, as Carter looks on. \u201cThe picture makes it look as if the three leaders all got along very well at the summit. That was not at all the case,\u201d recalls William B Quandt, a former national security council staffer who was involved in the negotiations. \u201cThe adversaries were very hostile, and on the third day Carter decided not to have any more three-way meetings. We were not at all sure we would get an agreement until the last day.\u201d Begin and Sadat won the Nobel Peace prize that year, while Carter was awarded it in 2002 for \u201chis decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts\u201d. While the Camp David accords are recognised as his greatest presidential achievement, they left crucial issues unresolved and, some argue, helped prevent Palestianian statehood. GS * * * George HW Bush in bed, 1987 By David Valdez This photograph, taken in 1987 for Life magazine, captured the then vice- president with his family on holiday in Maine. David Valdez \u2013 personal photographer to Bush at the time \u2013 was invited by Barbara Bush to come by the house at 6am. \u201cI poked my head in the bedroom door and there were George and Barbara Bush in bed,\u201d he later told NPR. \u201cThen the grandchildren started coming in and I took that snap, and that wound up running two full pages, and it\u2019s taken on a life of its own.\u201d The Washington Post credited the image with launching Bush\u2019s successful campaign for the presidency; Valdez became his official White House photographer. FB * * * Lyndon B Johnson watches war protests, 1968 By Yoichi Okamoto This strikingly intimate shot shows LBJ and his family at his ranch in Texas, watching TV coverage of Vietnam war protests outside the 1968 Democratic national convention in Chicago. This level of access was remarkable: Yoichi Okamoto was the first civilian to be appointed chief photographer for the White House. Here we can also see a turning point in LBJ\u2019s presidency. Since taking over in 1963, he had sent more than 500,000 troops to what the public increasingly saw as an unjustifiable, unwinnable war. \u201cI know we oughtn\u2019t to be there,\u201d Johnson admitted to a colleague in 1966, \u201cbut I can\u2019t get out.\u201d He withdrew from the 1968 election, and Nixon won. GS * * * Calvin Coolidge as a cowboy, 1927 Photographer unknown During his tenure in the 1920s, Calvin Coolidge held the greatest number of press conferences of any president (521 over six years), delivered the first State of the Union address on the radio and was the first to appear in a sound film. The media-savvy president appeared in photos dressed up in workers\u2019 overalls, pitching hay and \u2013 as here \u2013 wearing a cowboy\u2019s chaps and hat, on a trip to South Dakota. This image caused a stir: while the New York Times claimed \u201cCoolidge as Cowboy Wins West\u2019s Heart\u201d, others called him \u201ca pitiful puppet of publicity\u201d, the first president to make himself a laughing stock. He would not be the last. FB * * * Bill Clinton on Arsenio Hall, 1992 By Reed Saxon This may well be what clinched the 1992 election for Bill Clinton. In June, weeks before accepting the Democratic presidential nomination, he appeared on Arsenio Hall\u2019s late-night talkshow and played Heartbreak Hotel on the saxophone. It was a bold move at the time and the image of a cool, confident Clinton on stage with his sax and dark shades is credited with helping him secure the youth vote especially. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see a Democrat blow something besides the election,\u201d Hall quipped on the show. The success of the appearance, the Los Angeles Times wrote, \u201cchanged presidential politics \u2013 turning pop culture\u2019s hippest TV shows into the contemporary equivalent of campaign whistle-stops\u201d. GS * * * Lyndon B Johnson with Martin Luther King Jr, 1965 Photographer unknown \u201cI want to tell you how grateful I am,\u201d Johnson told King on the phone, after becoming president in 1963, \u201cand how worthy I\u2019m going to try to be of all your hopes.\u201d The cautious collaboration between the two reached its peak on 6 August 1965, with the signing of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibited racial discrimination in voting. Johnson is pictured that day, reaching out to pass a smiling King the pen used to sign the act, as Rosa Parks looks on. How strong this much mythologised moment of unity really was has remained the subject of fierce debate. Mutual distrust haunted their interactions and King faced relentless pressure from J Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI, with Johnson\u2019s knowledge. King split with the government over Vietnam, and today, voting rights have been rolled back. FB * * * Ronald Reagan at the Berlin Wall, 1987 By Dirck Halstead On 12 June 1987, Ronald Reagan delivered probably the most famous sentence of his presidency: \u201cMr Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\u201d He was standing in front of the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate, 24 years after JFK gave his famous speech in the city. It was a risky move: the previous day, thousands had gathered to protest against his visit. Even his own advisers had been unsure whether the public address to the Soviet leader was too provocative. But the fall of the Wall two years later, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, seemed to vindicate the decision \u2013 though there is debate over whether its importance has been overplayed. Over time, Gorbachev and Reagan, both keen to end the cold war, formed a productive alliance. GS * * * Joe Biden at the debate, 2024 By Justin Sullivan \u201cI\u2019ve done 31 debates since I\u2019ve been at Getty,\u201d says photographer Justin Sullivan, \u201cand I\u2019ve never seen anything like that.\u201d The Biden-Trump debate of June 2024 had felt unusual even before it started: press were allowed in only moments before it began and the room was eerily empty. As a \u201cpale and very unstable\u201d Biden gave \u201cincoherent\u201d answers, Sullivan focused on the \u201cstrange facial expressions\u201d that damned him as much as his nonsensical responses did. Within weeks, he\u2019d dropped out of the race. \u201cIt was a sad ending to a strong presidency that history will look upon more favourably,\u201d says David Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Washington bureau chief. \u201cHe inherited four major crises \u2013 the pandemic, the economy, racial justice and climate \u2013 and made significant progress on all of them.\u201d FB * * * Robert F Kennedy\u2019s assassination, 1968 By Bill Eppridge On 5 June 1968, Robert F Kennedy was in the ballroom of the Ambassador hotel in Los Angeles, giving a victory speech after winning the Democratic California presidential primary \u2013 he was shaping up to be the nominee to run against Richard Nixon in the general election. As he exited through the hotel kitchen after midnight, shaking hands with staff, shots rang out. In this photograph by Life magazine photographer Bill Eppridge, Kennedy lies on the floor while a busboy, Juan Romero, crouches down to comfort him. Kennedy died the next day. The gunman was Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian-Jordanian man who said he felt betrayed by Kennedy\u2019s support for Israel in the six-day war. Letters addressed to \u201cthe busboy\u201d soon arrived at the hotel. \u201cOne even went so far as to say that if he hadn\u2019t stopped to shake my hand, the senator would be alive, so I should be ashamed of myself for being so selfish,\u201d Romero told NPR in 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long 50 years.\u201d He visited Kennedy\u2019s grave in 2010, buying his first suit for the occasion. Alternative accounts of the assassination have since emerged. His son, Robert F Kennedy Jr \u2013 a conspiracy theorist who recently suspended his own presidential campaign \u2013 is among those who believe there was a second gunman.

Email saturday@theguardian.com \u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2024. An earlier version said Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1987 speech in front of the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate was on the same spot where JFK had made his \u201cIch bin ein Berliner\u201d speech; in fact Kennedy spoke in front of Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg.",

The victory ends a five-game sequence without a Premier League win, and they rise to eighth in the table, where they\u2019ll stay tonight unless Bournemouth pull a surprise against Manchester City. Arsenal will certainly hope the Cherries can do something sensational later this afternoon, because another blunt display has seen them lose further ground on the leaders, and that\u2019s now just one point from the last nine available. They were creatively lacking today, with Declan Rice\u2019s late miss their only real gilt-edged chance of the entire match.

Eddie Howe\u2019s turn on TNT. \u201cI\u2019m tired, actually \u2026 I need a lie down \u2026 it was intense \u2026 maybe not for the neutral an entertaining game, but fascinating if you were involved in it \u2026 a lack of goalmouth action but that\u2019s down to the tactical set-up of both sides \u2026 a massive win against a really good team \u2026 once we scored, Arsenal played well \u2026 we were then content to defend well \u2026 we had to \u2026 they have threats all over the pitch \u2026 I\u2019m really pleased with our defensive performance \u2026 heroic blocking \u2026 if you can\u2019t play brilliant attacking football every week, you need to find different ways to win \u2026 to beat Arsenal shows our qualities.\u201d Mikel Arteta speaks to TNT. \u201cWe started really well \u2026 dominant \u2026 we don\u2019t defend the box well enough \u2026 credit to them, they put an unbelievable header and delivery into the box \u2026 from there the game changes \u2026 from the moment they go ahead, you have to play a different game \u2026 adapt to that \u2026 we didn\u2019t well enough \u2026 we didn\u2019t find enough answers \u2026 at the end, I am very frustrated \u2026 we got dragged into a game they were looking for constantly \u2026 we did not have enough consistency to get out of that \u2026 credit to them \u2026 it is time to do it on the pitch \u2026 we are not going to find the right words today \u2026 we have to be at our best in every department.\u201d Player of the match Alan Bennett Lewis Hall speaks to TNT Sports. \u201cIt was a really really good performance from us \u2026 working hard together \u2026 Bukayo is an amazing player \u2026 if I kept him as quiet as possible, I think I did my job well \u2026 every block, tackle and throw-in we win get the crowd going \u2026 I absolutely love my time at Newcastle \u2026 I\u2019m just proud I can wear the shirt \u2026 there are not many left-backs in the England squad, so I\u2019d be lying if I said I hadn\u2019t noticed that \u2026 but I\u2019m just concentrating on playing for Newcastle \u2026 I can\u2019t thank Eddie Howe enough for what he\u2019s done for me so far \u2026 we\u2019re playing good football and getting results and it\u2019s something we can build on.\u201d Post-match mailbag. \u201cExcellent victory, iconic goal and while Russell E was getting the excuses ready, I\u2019d already jinxed Mikel Merino\u2019s performance in pre-match mailbag. My work here is done. Can\u2019t wait to buy myself a retro jacket from the club store to celebrate (RRP \u00a3199)\u201d \u2013 Chris Paraskevas \u201cNick Pope did exactly what Louise Taylor predicted\u201d \u2013 Matthew Lysaght \u201cThis whole season and parts of last season as well, Arsenal have used every dark art found in the Mourinho playbook. So I\u2019m not sure whether Arsenal are complaining about Newcastle\u2019s antics due to unacceptable Newcastle play or deflecting away from their own team\u2019s dull performance. We need Emo Arteta from Squires for confirmation\u201d \u2013 Yash Gupta \u201cThe MBMer\u2019s curse at minute 49 held firm. Well done!\u201d \u2013 Joe Pearson Newcastle\u2019s goalscoring hero Alexander Isak speaks to TNT. \u201cThat was massive \u2026 a big game against a big team \u2026 it means a lot \u2026 a bit of a statement \u2026 heading is not my strongest quality so it feels good to score \u2026 it\u2019s special \u2026 our fans are amazing, every game, win or lose \u2026 it gives you an extra boost \u2026 I\u2019ve been successful here and hopefully I can keep going \u2026 that cross was amazing \u2026 it felt like I just had to jump and put my head on the ball, and the rest would fix itself \u2026 credit to [Anthony Gordon] as well \u2026 Arsenal have a strong defence \u2026 it was a difficult task \u2026 I am happy we could score and keep a clean sheet \u2026 we\u2019ve had a bad spell but hopefully this win will be an ice-breaker for us \u2026 one game at a time.\u201d That\u2019s a huge win for Newcastle. They scored a world-class goal, Alexander Isak elegantly converting Anthony Gordon\u2019s on-a-plate cross, and defended resolutely afterwards. St James\u2019 Park erupts in celebration, and the home team receives the ovation their efforts deserve. The victory ends a five-game sequence without a Premier League win, and they rise to eighth in the table, where they\u2019ll stay tonight unless Bournemouth pull a surprise against Manchester City. Arsenal will certainly hope the Cherries can do something sensational later this afternoon, because another blunt display has seen them lose further ground on the leaders, and that\u2019s now just one point from the last nine available. They were creatively lacking today, with Declan Rice\u2019s late miss their only real gilt-edged chance of the entire match. Martin Odegaard can\u2019t return quickly enough for the title-chasing Gunners. Isak\u2019s unstoppable early header is enough for a win that snaps Newcastle\u2019s barren Premier League run! 90 min +7: A yellow card for Havertz, who contests a desperate long ball too enthusiastically. 90 min +6: It\u2019s cheers for Pope now, as he first punches a cross clear, then claims another. 90 min +5: Pope is booked for taking too long over the resulting goal kick, then Guimaraes is replaced by Kelly. 90 min +4: \u2026 so having said that, Saka skins Hall down the right and crosses deep. Rice, six yards out at the far post, somehow heads wide left when it was surely easier to score. What a chance for Arsenal to salvage a point! 90 min +3: On TNT, Lucy Ward names Lewis Hall as her player of the match for his work in keeping Bukayo Saka quiet. Speaking of Hall \u2026 \u201cSurely David Hockney?\u201d wonders Simon Reeves. 90 min +2: Rice comes through the back of Tonali, and it\u2019s another excuse for Newcastle to run some clock down. Daft from Rice, who shakes his head with annoyance. 90 min +1: Nwaneri, who has been quiet since coming into the game and being immediately whacked, has a go from distance. It\u2019s a wild effort that easily clears the bar, and flies wide too. Pope takes his sweet time over the restart. 90 min: Hall thumps clear with White threatening down the inside-right channel. There will be five additional minutes. Nerves a-clanking for both teams. 88 min: Jorginho is booked for a clumsy clank into the back of Guimaraes. 87 min: Barnes crosses from the right. Joelinton wins a header, but not powerfully, and it\u2019s an easy pluck for Raya. The tension around St James\u2019 Park palpable. 86 min: That\u2019s Gordon\u2019s final contribution. He\u2019s replaced by Barnes, while Arsenal swap Partey for Jorginho. 85 min: Zinchenko crosses deep from the right. Jesus takes it down on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box, and prepares to shoot \u2026 only for Gordon to arrive on the scene and nick the ball away. That had to be timed perfectly, for it would have otherwise been a penalty. 84 min: That stoppage for Newcastle\u2019s keeper, then. Here\u2019s Russell E again: \u201cThe Guardian\u2019s very own Louise Taylor said yesterday: \u2018Players are sometimes awarded mini-rests when Newcastle indulge in the dark arts, principally time-wasting tactics to protect leads. Watch out for Nick Pope going down, apparently injured.\u2019 And here we are.\u201d 83 min: Guimaraes buys a cheap free kick from a clumsy Partey and the pressure on Newcastle is momentarily relieved. 81 min: Another Arsenal free kick comes to nought, as Rice\u2019s delivery from the right is no good. Newcastle attempt to counter, and Gordon, dribbling down the right has options in the middle, but he dillies and dallies and eventually Gabriel arrives from behind to whip the ball off his toe. 79 min: Arsenal are hogging the ball and Newcastle can\u2019t get out. But there\u2019s no final ball. The hosts relatively comfortable as a result. 77 min: After a dousing down with the magic sponge, Pope is good to continue. \u201cNo vital insight on the action, but is it just me or does Lewis Hall - if you imagine him with glasses on - bear an uncanny resemblance to a young Alan Bennett?\u201d asks Rob Knap. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve seen it, etc. (Admittedly this might be one for a fairly small segment of your audience.)\u201d 75 min: \u2026 and now it\u2019s Newcastle\u2019s turn to worry as Pope goes down with nobody around him. On comes the physio. 74 min: Saka goes down in pain having been accidentally clipped on the heel by Hall. A lot of screaming, though he thankfully gets up quickly enough and is back up and running. Arsenal hearts in mouths for a split second there. 72 min: Another Arsenal double swap, and Timber and Trossard make way for Jesus and White. 71 min: Tonali is booked for bringing down an in-flight Havertz. 70 min: Newcastle go up the other end and win a corner down the right. Tonali swings in. It\u2019s another particularly poor delivery, but Arsenal only half clear, and Tonali is able to try again. This time Arsenal deal with the situation. This is getting pretty scrappy. 68 min: Another Arsenal corner comes to nothing. The visitors getting a bit frustrated now. 66 min: This is turning into a basketball match, and Tonali is upended by Timber as Newcastle go up the other end. Timber goes into the book, and nothing comes of the resulting free kick. Speaking of basketball, here\u2019s Russell E again, thankfully not taking Chris\u2019s bait: \u201cTo be fair, Arsenal look more like the Bad News Bears than the Chicago Bulls at this point.\u201d 65 min: Before the corner, Tonali comes on for the recently booked Willock. Then Pope clears the set piece. 64 min: Some luck for Arsenal there, and now Newcastle get theirs up the other end. Rice dribbles down the inside-left channel with purpose and into the box. He shoots low, and his effort is deflected, nearly nestling into the bottom right. Inches wide of the post, with Pope\u2019s feet planted, the keeper totally beaten. Just a corner. Saka to take. 63 min: A bit of space opens up for Isak, who shoots from distance. Raya parries with a strong hand, and the rebound somehow evades Gordon. 62 min: Welcome to Newcastle, Ethan Nwaneri! He\u2019s on the end of an instant reducer from Willock, who goes into the book as a result. Willock can have no complaints after that no-nonsense nonsense. 61 min: \u2026 and here it is. Martinelli and Merino make way for Zinchenko and the exciting 17-year-old prospect Nwaneri. 60 min: Arsenal are preparing a double change. Mikel Arteta not a happy man. 58 min: Willock drives at Saliba down the inside-left channel. He makes just enough space to shoot from just inside the box, but leans back and blazes over. The defender\u2019s positioning doing just enough. \u201cIt\u2019s quite ironic seeing Arsenal fans complain about simulating fouls when their team would go to ground under a stiff breeze,\u201d argues Chris in response to Russell E. Play nicely, now, everyone. 56 min: \u2026 so having said that, Merino goes into the book for a frustrated lunge from behind on Guimaraes. 54 min: Trossard tap-tackles Willock from behind and is fairly fortunate the referee is in a laissez-faire mood this afternoon. 53 min: Isak sprays a pass wide right, where Gordon, Livramento and Longstaff combine to win a corner. Gordon takes the set piece. Not particularly well, it has to be said, and Arsenal clear their lines easily enough. The set-piece deliveries have been hopeless so far today. Just as well for Gordon he\u2019s in plenty of moral credit for that sensational assist. 52 min: Martinelli dinks a ball infield from the left, encouraging Trossard to burst into the box down the channel. Burn extends a long leg to turn the ball out for a corner, which Rice hits long \u2026 but neither Merino nor Saliba can connect at the far stick. 50 min: Arsenal stroke it around the back, moves to encourage the St James\u2019 atmosphere to simmer down. The gambit works. 49 min: Timber crosses from a deep position on the left. Schar heads away powerfully and then the flag goes up for offside. This doesn\u2019t feel like a match that\u2019s going to end 1-0 \u2026 but good luck correctly calling the team who changes that scoreline. 47 min: It\u2019s Gordon to Willock again, a cross from the right this time that his team-mate can\u2019t guide goalwards Isak-style. The early signs suggest Arsenal aren\u2019t the only team to have been given some trenchant half-time encouragement. 45 min 30 sec: Raya keeps Arsenal in the game after Newcastle start the half fast. Gordon advances down the right and feeds Willock, whose shot towards the top right is snaffled well by the keeper. Arsenal get the second half underway. No changes. Half-time postbag. \u201cOn the TV, the commentators are running through the litany all too familiar now from recent Arsenal performances: they\u2019re missing Martin \u00d8degard; Trossard isn\u2019t doing enough; Martinelli below his best; Arteta will have a lot to do it half time, and shouldn\u2019t Nwaneri come on? To each one the Arsenal fan will be nodding sagely. Also, seething at the kicking that Saka is getting, as a bonus. What a way to spend a Saturday lunchtime\u201d \u2013 Charles Antaki \u201cI know absence makes the heart grow fonder and a footballer better, but it really feels like the Arsenal attack doesn\u2019t function properly without \u00d8degaard. Saka and Martinelli are tricky dribblers, Havertz a languid killer, and Trossard a buzzing marksman. But all of them lack the eye for the unexpected. The Norwegian makes passes no one else on that team sees\u201d \u2013 K\u00e1ri Tulinius \u201cWhy is it that when Newcastle simulates fouls, wastes time, and plays in an overly physical manner they\u2019re hailed as playing football the proper way? It reminds me of watching the Bad Boy Detroit Pistons against the Chicago Bulls* in the late 80s. It\u2019s so obviously cynical, and is about as compelling as watching JD Vance try to tell a joke. (I was a Bulls fan when Michael Jordan was in his prime)\u201d \u2013 Russell E \u201cDespite Arsenal\u2019s Merino, it was Newcastle\u2019s jumper that\u2019s proved to be the difference in a lively first half\u201d \u2013 Grant Tennille (who is here all week, ladies and gentlemen, try the tomato plate) Half-time reading. This is not Arsenal\u2019s only big 12.30pm kick-off of the weekend. Tom Garry reports on tomorrow lunchtime\u2019s showdown with Manchester United. Anthony Gordon\u2019s delicious cross and Alexander Isak\u2019s unstoppable header the difference. A goal worthy of winning any game. Can Arsenal do something about that? They\u2019ll have some puzzles to solve during the break, because they\u2019ve been comfortably held at arm\u2019s length up front. 45 min +2: Martinelli crosses from the left. Pope, who otherwise hasn\u2019t had too much to do so far, punches clear. Then the keeper\u2019s in action again, claiming Merino\u2019s floated left-wing cross with ease. On the touchline, Mikel Arteta folds his arms tightly and frowns. 45 min +1: Partey is being booed on his every touch. Panto season soon! 45 min: There will be three additional first-half minutes. 43 min: Partey up the other end now, checking Willock out on the Newcastle left. The referee gives him a talking-to, ushering him into the last-chance saloon. The resulting free kick is clanked into the nearest defender by Gordon. What a waste, with the Arsenal box full of players. 42 min: Partey whips deep from the left. At the far post, Joelinton holds his ground to usher the ball out for a goal kick, then celebrates the defensive action in the Guimarares/Arsenal style. 40 min: Longstaff is booked for a fairly obvious grab at Trossard from behind \u2026 eh, scrub that. The midfielder surely should have gone into the referee\u2019s notebook, but in fact it\u2019s Schar who has been shown the yellow, for kicking the ball away after the foul was awarded. That doesn\u2019t make a great deal of sense, but should please Arsenal\u2019s fans, if nothing else, in the wake of recent similar decisions against Rice and Trossard. 39 min: Despite the scoreline, it\u2019s the Arsenal fans making the most noise right now. Their team still doing the lion\u2019s share of attacking. 37 min: Trossard tries to release Saka down the inside-right channel but the pass is overcooked. Goal kick. Out on the left, Martinelli, still running hot, spins around in disgust at not receiving a pass. The Brazilian looks like a booking waiting to happen \u2026 so to be fair, he then does well not to respond when Newcastle are awarded a goal kick after a ricochet between him and Livramento. A bite of the lip and he quietly moves away. 35 min: Guimaraes goes down and requires some treatment, having been caught late \u2013 albeit accidentally \u2013 by Merino. Thankfully for Newcastle, their man soon pops back up again. 33 min: Martinelli isn\u2019t happy with the award of a throw to Newcastle, and tells it as he sees it to anyone around to listen. The referee returns the volley with a lecture of his own, and informs his captain Saka that any more hot chat will lead to trouble. 32 min: Another corner for Arsenal, from the left. Rice hits long. Saliba can\u2019t guide anything goalwards at the far stick. The home crowd getting anxious now. St James\u2019 not quite as noisy as it was a few minutes ago. 31 min: Arsenal are snapping into their press, and Newcastle are currently uncomfortably skittish. A couple of hurried clearances and shanks into the crowd. But they\u2019re holding onto their lead, so it\u2019s swings and roundabouts. 29 min: A free kick for Newcastle this time, out on the right. Hall launches it diagonally from deep. Willock crosses from the left, but Havertz, who does his fair share of defensive work for Arsenal, heads it clear. 27 min: Rice\u2019s set-piece work is better here, Saliba winning a header from his delivery into the six-yard box. Merino meets the dropping ball and blooters it goalwards, only for Hall to bravely block. Newcastle clear their lines. On another day, that shot would have pinballed its way into the net. Arsenal getting closer. 26 min: Saka embarks on an electric dribble down the right. He\u2019s got Hall on toast. He whistles a low cross into the mixer. Any touch from an Arsenal player and it\u2019s an equaliser. Saka is livid that Schar gets to it before Martinelli and Havertz, shovelling the ball over the bar from close range. That could easily have been an own goal. 25 min: Gordon recovers and twists Timber\u2019s blood down the right flank, before flashing a shot across the face of the Arsenal goal. There\u2019s nobody there to turn home, but Newcastle get a corner from it nonetheless. Schar makes a nuisance of himself in the six-yard box, but Raya eventually claims. It\u2019s a good game, this. 23 min: Arsenal don\u2019t look fazed at trailing, to their credit. Now Merino advances down the left touchline and draws a foul. Another set piece, another chance to do their thing. But again, Rice\u2019s delivery is appalling, slapping the nearby Gordon straight in his startled face. Brave defending, because that will have hurt. Rice\u2019s dead-ball work uncharacteristically dreadful so far. 21 min: Gordon whips in again from the right. The ball evades Joelinton at the far post \u2026 but then, just as it looks like going out for a goal kick or throw, clanks into the corner flag and stays in! Joelinton is first to respond, but can\u2019t take advantage of the lucky break. A shame, if only because Mikel Arteta\u2019s face would have been a picture had a goal resulted from that. Now we\u2019ll never see it. 19 min: Martinelli advances again down the left, his cross dangerous but intercepted by Guimaraes, who chests down and blooters clear, then celebrates his work like he would a goal. A leaf out of Arsenal\u2019s book in that respect. Their defenders enjoy a bit of that. And why not? 18 min: Arsenal have responded well to falling behind, in so much as they\u2019ve re-established their dominance of possession. Martinelli and Havertz combine nicely down the left, the latter standing one up for Saka at the far stick. Saka beats Hall in the jump, but can only waft a header wide right. \u201cWhat a buildup,\u201d writes Mary Waltz. \u201cGordon\u2019s cross so lovely, Isak\u2019s header a thunderbolt. A textbook example of attacking football. Brilliant!\u201d 16 min: A worrying stat for Arsenal flashed up by TNT Sports: Newcastle are one of only three Premier League teams yet to drop a point from a winning position this season. Liverpool and Manchester United are the other two. 15 min: Nope. Rice\u2019s delivery, towards a crowded Toon box, fails to beat the first man. The hosts clear their lines. 14 min: That was a proper old-school cross and header. Perfectly executed. Arsenal had been the better side in the early exchanges as well. Can Arsenal respond immediately, having won a free kick out on the right? Newcastle have done nothing in attack \u2026 until now, and this goal is an absolute peach! A bit of space for Gordon down the right. He sends an out-swinger into the box, perfectly onto Isak\u2019s head, ten yards out. Isak rises gracefully before planting an unstoppable header across Raya and into the top-left corner. That was glorious. So simple, but glorious. 11 min: Arsenal are on top. A simple long pass down the middle finds Timber on the edge of the Newcastle box. He feeds Saka to his right. Saka steps away from Hall before flashing a low drive inches wide of the right-hand post. Had it been on target, Pope might not have been set to respond to that. The keeper looked on his heels. 9 min: Now it\u2019s Arsenal\u2019s turn for a corner, Trossard\u2019s presence forcing Longstaff into its concession down the left. Rice curls it viciously into the six-yard box, a magnificently dangerous delivery that Pope does extremely well to claw off his line and away from danger. 7 min: The crowd descend into, to borrow a phrase from Brass Eye, a low miff. That\u2019s because Raya and Arsenal take their sweet time over a kick upfield. 5 min: \u2026 so having said that, Newcastle suddenly spring into life. Joelinton, Longstaff and Willock combine smoothly down the left to win the first corner of the game. Gordon swings it in. Havertz heads clear, but that\u2019s got the crowd going, just as Eddie Howe requested. 4 min: By contrast it\u2019s a quiet start for the hosts. They\u2019ve barely had a touch yet. 2 min: Arsenal don\u2019t waste time in pushing forward. A bit of early probing on the edge of the Newcastle box, Partey and Saka heavily involved. Then finally a shot, Trossard dragging a low diagonal effort yards wide right. Newcastle get the ball rolling. They\u2019re playing towards the Gallowgate End in this first half. \u2026 but not before a rendition of the Last Post, with Remembrance Sunday upcoming. RIP the fallen. All perfectly observed, applause ripping through the silence at the end. The teams are out! Newcastle in black and white, Arsenal in red and white. They always look good, these two. John Lennon\u2019s artist\u2019s eye rarely let him down. On that subject, the coda of one his old combo\u2019s toppermost-of-poppermost hits pours out of the St James\u2019 Park speakers. Then Mark Knopfler\u2019s paean to Pennan. Choice tracks and a rare old atmosphere. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. Eddie Howe\u2019s turn to chat with TNT. \u201cYour intent and attitude has to be spot on in ever game \u2026 our first few actions against Chelsea [in the League Cup] were really good, it set the tone and got the crowd in the match \u2026 we\u2019re going to need the same again today \u2026 I\u2019m trying to manage everyone\u2019s game-load \u2026 Sandro misses out from the start but will be important from the bench \u2026 it will be competitive \u2026 last year we were strong, resolute, resilient \u2026 we\u2019ll need those qualities against an outstanding team.\u201d Pre-match postbag. \u201cI had big hopes for Mikel Merino during his short time at Newcastle, but it never quite worked out for whatever reason. He\u2019s such an easy player to watch, got that smoothness you associate with Spanish midfielders, to go with a bit of bite. I like what Eddie Howe has done with the lineup and despite the literal cries for Tonali to always play, Longstaff allows the two Brazilians more confidence to roam. Anyway, both of these clubs have the most cringeworthy \u2018Adidas: Originals Reboot\u2019 training and casual range for sale. You can get the original versions on Ebay and they smell more like the 90s\u201d \u2013 Chris Paraskevas \u201cThe star attraction of an Arsenal game these days is betting on (in non-monetary friendly banter) if Arteta will receive a yellow or a red. Arteta would benefit by taking lessons from one Don Carlo Ancelotti\u201d \u2013 Krishnamoorthy V (who may or may not have missed Ancelotti all hot-faced last weekend, pompously wagging a finger in Hansi Flick\u2019s face when Barcelona\u2019s bench reacted to goal number four) Mikel Arteta is asked about Arsenal\u2019s upcoming Newcastle-Inter-Chelsea run by TNT Sports. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it, to play these big matches in beautiful stadiums against great opponents \u2026 that\u2019s what we want \u2026 Gabi trained yesterday so is fit \u2026 Ben [White] didn\u2019t make it, he only had half a session yesterday, we have to protect him \u2026 to play with 11 players is critical \u2026 the games are decided by fine margins \u2026 the team can adapt to any scenario \u2026 we lost momentum [against Liverpool] \u2026 the belief is 100 percent \u2026 today is a really good scenario for us.\u201d Arteta also thanks both the Premier League and Newcastle for allowing and supporting the wearing of black armbands today, in the wake of the Spain floods disaster. \u201cIt is terrible what has happened \u2026 a big mess \u2026 the message we can send is something very positive and I am very grateful for that.\u201d Both sides could do with the three points this lunchtime, to rediscover some form if nothing else. Newcastle were buoyed by their League Cup victory over Chelsea during the week, but they\u2019re five without a win in the Premier League. Arsenal also enjoyed some Carabou-infused fun midweek, swanning past Preston, but otherwise haven\u2019t been their usual imperious selves of late: they\u2019re two without a win in the Premier League, while recent victories over Leicester, Southampton and Shakhtar Donetsk caused more stress along the way than was perhaps necessary. Here\u2019s where everyone stands in the big picture. Newcastle make three changes to the team that started the 2-1 defeat at Chelsea last weekend. Anthony Gordon, Joe Willock and Sean Longstaff come in for Sandro Tonali, Harvey Barnes and Miguel Almir\u00f3n, all of whom drop to the bench. Injury worry Alexander Isak makes it. Arsenal make one change to their XI after the 2-2 draw with Liverpool. William Saliba is back from the suspension he picked up at Bournemouth, so Ben White makes way by dropping to the bench. Gabriel and Jurri\u00ebn Timber have both shrugged off injury issues to start. Newcastle United: Pope, Livramento, Schar, Burn, Hall, Longstaff, Guimaraes, Willock, Gordon, Isak, Joelinton. Subs: Dubravka, Tonali, Barnes, Krafth, Osula, Almiron, Kelly, Alex Murphy, Miley. Arsenal: Raya, Partey, Saliba, Gabriel, Timber, Saka, Merino, Rice, Martinelli, Havertz, Trossard. Subs: Neto, White, Gabriel Jesus, Kiwior, Zinchenko, Jorginho, Sterling, Lewis-Skelly, Nwaneri. Referee: John Brooks (Leicestershire). It\u2019s the Walls and Bridges derby! Whatever gets you through lunchtime, s\u2019alright. A lot has happened between Newcastle and Arsenal since young Winston O\u2019Boogie illustrated that FA Cup final. George Eastham, Marc Overmars and Nicolas Anelka, Cheik Tiot\u00e9, all that. So let\u2019s just fast forward to last November, when this blew up in everyone\u2019s startled coupon \u2026 \u2026 and we never heard the end of it for aeons. That was a rare victory for Toon against the Gunners, who went on to avenge their loss with a 4-1 rout at the Emirates three months later; Arsenal have therefore won nine of the last 12 Premier League matches against Newcastle. So depending which way you slice it, recent history either favours the hosts or visitors. No need to thank us, we\u2019re here to help, but suffice to say it\u2019s set up nicely: Newcastle need to haul themselves back into the race for Europe, while Arsenal are desperate to keep on Manchester City and Liverpool\u2019s tail. Kick-off is at 12.30pm GMT. It\u2019s on!",

      "body": "<p>The 10-year wait is almost over. <em>Wolf Hall</em>, the hit television series based on Hilary Mantel\u2019s trio of historical novels, will be back on the BBC next Sunday, leading viewers through the dangerous, maze-like political court of Henry VIII. This time, however, the path was darker and lonelier for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peter-kosminsky\">director Peter Kosminsky</a>, who had to proceed without his guide, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/hilary-mantel\">book\u2019s late author</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been much harder, because Hilary is gone,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em> ahead of the show\u2019s return.</p> <p>\u201cWhen she died, two years ago, I lost my collaborator and a good friend. Throughout making the first series, her attitude was always, \u2018Call me, night or day\u2019. She was never protective or defensive, and I was looking forward to an even deeper relationship this time, since I had known the last book from its inception.\u201d</p> <p>Kosminsky, who directed the acclaimed first series broadcast by the BBC in January 2015, grew close to the Booker prize-winning novelist as they worked to bring the content of the first books, <em>Wolf Hall</em> and <em>Bring Up the Bodies</em>, to television screens. As Mantel wrote the final book in the trilogy, she sent her friend 100-word instalments, eager for feedback.</p>    <p>\u201cThis was terrifying and bizarre,\u201d he recalls, \u201cShe was a double Booker prize-winner, so I had to be careful responding because I didn\u2019t want to bugger things up.\u201d Mantel\u2019s sudden death at the age of 70 then deprived him not only of \u201cthe person I respected almost more than anyone\u201d, but left him, Kosminsky says, with a heavy sense of responsibility and no opportunity to compare notes with \u201cthe best living writer in the English language\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t say this lightly, but I think she was the only genius I have ever met, and I\u2019m 68 now,\u201d Kosminsky said this weekend. \u201cWhen in her company, as I was lucky enough to be a lot, it was clear she was operating on another level.\u201d</p> <p>His own grief, the director knows, cannot compare to that of her family, nor of Gerald, her husband of 50 years, but Kosminsky\u2019s fear of letting the author down proved difficult to handle, he admits: \u201cThankfully, we were exchanging detailed emails while she was writing the last book, and then afterwards, as the adaptation was coming together.

      "bodyText": "The 10-year wait is almost over. Wolf Hall, the hit television series based on Hilary Mantel\u2019s trio of historical novels, will be back on the BBC next Sunday, leading viewers through the dangerous, maze-like political court of Henry VIII. This time, however, the path was darker and lonelier for director Peter Kosminsky, who had to proceed without his guide, the book\u2019s late author. \u201cIt has been much harder, because Hilary is gone,\u201d he told the Observer ahead of the show\u2019s return. \u201cWhen she died, two years ago, I lost my collaborator and a good friend. Throughout making the first series, her attitude was always, \u2018Call me, night or day\u2019. She was never protective or defensive, and I was looking forward to an even deeper relationship this time, since I had known the last book from its inception.\u201d Kosminsky, who directed the acclaimed first series broadcast by the BBC in January 2015, grew close to the Booker prize-winning novelist as they worked to bring the content of the first books, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, to television screens. As Mantel wrote the final book in the trilogy, she sent her friend 100-word instalments, eager for feedback. \u201cThis was terrifying and bizarre,\u201d he recalls, \u201cShe was a double Booker prize-winner, so I had to be careful responding because I didn\u2019t want to bugger things up.\u201d Mantel\u2019s sudden death at the age of 70 then deprived him not only of \u201cthe person I respected almost more than anyone\u201d, but left him, Kosminsky says, with a heavy sense of responsibility and no opportunity to compare notes with \u201cthe best living writer in the English language\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t say this lightly, but I think she was the only genius I have ever met, and I\u2019m 68 now,\u201d Kosminsky said this weekend. \u201cWhen in her company, as I was lucky enough to be a lot, it was clear she was operating on another level.\u201d His own grief, the director knows, cannot compare to that of her family, nor of Gerald, her husband of 50 years, but Kosminsky\u2019s fear of letting the author down proved difficult to handle, he admits: \u201cThankfully, we were exchanging detailed emails while she was writing the last book, and then afterwards, as the adaptation was coming together. But I was expecting lots more as we went into production.\u201d The final instalment, scripted again by Peter Straughan, follows arch-strategist Thomas Cromwell, played once more by Mark Rylance, as he struggles to maintain his powerful place at the side of Damian Lewis\u2019s increasingly mercurial king. The missing figure of Cromwell\u2019s dead mentor, Cardinal Wolsey, repeatedly appears to him in a corner of his study to advise him. Kosminsky admits that he needed the same kind of reassurance from Mantel, although there was no such comforting apparition on set: \u201cThis time, we could not ask her if there was anything we should change.\u201d The last book may be titled The Mirror and the Light, but its narrative steers readers inexorably towards the pitchest black of conclusions. So turning the story into a six-part drama became a test of nerve. not just for Kosminsky but for his leading actor. \u201cThe story ends in the darkest way, and my job was to go on that journey with my actor. Mark gives a remarkable performance.

      "bodyText": "Many Arab and Muslim Americans across the country are making a final push to get ballots cast for Kamala Harris for president \u2013 despite other members of their communities being strongly opposed to a Harris administration given the White House\u2019s support for Israel. Haitham Wahab, a resident of Dearborn, Michigan, and a Lebanese American who has been canvassing for the Harris-Walz campaign, said one of the best ways to effect change is \u201cfrom the inside, through coalition-building\u201d. \u201cAs an Arab American, you should definitely vote,\u201d Wahab said. \u201cVoting for Harris is the best possible choice to preserve the maximum political power of the Arab American voter.\u201d That idea, that a vote for Harris is a strategic one if not necessarily a moral one, is being pushed by a number of advocates trying to turn fellow Arab and Muslim Americans out to the polls. \u201cWe deeply share the pain you experienced this past year from the unimaginable destruction in Gaza, and most recently in Lebanon, which has left us heartbroken and at times deeply traumatized,\u201d Arab Americans for Harris-Walz said in a statement last month. \u201cWe come to you as fellow Arabs, many of us once uncommitted voters, asking you to join us in committing to progress.\u201d A group of Arab American leaders endorsed Harris on Monday in Michigan \u2013 the swing state with the US\u2019s largest Arab American population. The endorsement came on the heels of a survey, conducted by the Arab News Research and Studies Unit and YouGov, that showed Arab American voters favoring Donald Trump over Harris. Wahab told the Guardian about the \u201chard conversations\u201d he\u2019s had over the past few months while knocking on doors of Arab and Muslim residents still on the fence about voting. \u201cThe reason why they are hard is because \u2026 this community is experiencing real pain,\u201d he said, referring to the area\u2019s many Arab residents with family members overseas in harm\u2019s way as Israel continues to strike Gaza and Lebanon. Wahab added: \u201cFor the rest of America, what\u2019s happening in the Middle East is foreign policy, but for these guys, it\u2019s domestic policy.\u201d The Biden administration has offered \u201crock-solid, unwavering support\u201d for Israel \u2013 a major point of contention among Arab and Muslim voters who have implored the White House to take a tougher stance on Israel, which has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians in Gaza in the last year. Harris, the vice-president to Joe Biden for the past four years, has been criticized for not breaking with Biden when it comes to her Middle East foreign policy. Harris\u2019s campaign also rejected pleas from activists to allow a Palestinian to speak on stage at the Democratic national convention this summer. Before Biden dropped out of the election and Harris became the Democratic nominee, activists managed to get nearly 700,000 people to vote \u201cuncommitted\u201d or similar in the Democratic primaries, in protest against Biden and in an effort to move him on Israel. Now, leaders of the movement are urging their base to vote against Trump, even though they have not explicitly endorsed Harris. Among their arguments, they point to Project 2025. In a video, the Uncommitted co-founder Lexis Zeidan calls the blueprint \u2013 drafted by conservative strategists for a potential Trump presidency \u2013 an \u201cobjectively insane document\u201d. \u201cThe current administration\u2019s handling of this genocide has been beyond enraging and demoralizing. But the reality is, it can get worse,\u201d Zeidan says in the video. \u201cNo one wants a Trump presidency more than [Israeli prime minister] Netanyahu, because that is his ticket to wiping Palestine off the map.\u201d An ad targeting Uncommitted voters in Michigan features one of the movement\u2019s leaders, Abbas Alawieh, imploring voters to consider Trump\u2019s potential Palestine policy. \u201cProject 2025 calls for the elimination of all humanitarian aid to the West Bank and Gaza, and here in the US, Trump plans to silence anyone who stands up for Palestinian rights,\u201d he says. The former Trump administration also has a track record of actions taken against Palestinian statehood, including moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing the city as Israel\u2019s capital, despite Palestinian claims to part of it as their own future capital. Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and former senior adviser, said in March that \u201cGaza\u2019s waterfront property could be very valuable\u201d and to \u201cmove the people out and clean it up\u201d. Advocates are also urging their communities to remember Trump\u2019s \u201cMuslim ban\u201d, which he vowed to restore if he wins in November. Emgage Action, the political arm of a prominent Muslim American group that mobilizes Muslim American voters, formally endorsed Harris last month. \u201cTo prevent Trump from returning to the White House, Emgage Action is endorsing Vice-President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz,\u201d the group\u2019s statement said. \u201cThis endorsement is not an agreement with Vice-President Harris on all issues, but rather, an honest guidance to our voters regarding the difficult choice they confront at the ballot box.\u201d Alzayat, a first-generation Arab and Muslim American and former US diplomat who worked on Middle East policy, said if voters, including those from within his own community, don\u2019t invest in Harris, who may cut her own path on Middle East policy, they run the risk of electing \u201csomebody who\u2019s going to be worse\u201d. \u201cIf somebody is so upset at this moment because of what\u2019s happening to the Palestinians, you wouldn\u2019t go and bring somebody who\u2019s going to be worse because of that anger and hurt,\u201d Alzayat said. \u201cYou invest in a candidate that at least is going to give you an opportunity.

With Gordon looking a natural in a role he would never have volunteered for, Arteta\u2019s defenders found themselves dragged repeatedly into places they did not really want to go and Isak\u2019s intelligent positioning emphasised why Arsenal\u2019s manager harbours a longstanding interest in recruiting the Sweden centre-forward. Arteta is also believed to be an admirer of Bruno Guimar\u00e3es and that opinion would presumably not have been altered as he watched the Brazilian \u2013 deployed at the heart of midfield on a day when Italy\u2019s Sandro Tonali began on the bench before replacing Joe Willock \u2013 persistently interrupt visiting attacks, while winning quite a few clever free-kicks along the way. Hats off too to the former Arsenal midfielder Willock, who alongside Guimar\u00e3es and the much-underrated Sean Longstaff, ensured Rice and friends most certainly did not have things all their own way.

      "bodyText": "A neo-Nazi terrorist who was found guilty last month of the attempted murder of an asylum seeker is a prolific online stalker who had previously been jailed and referred to the Prevent counter-terrorism scheme, the Observer can reveal. Callum Parslow was convicted on 25 October of attempted murder after stabbing an asylum seeker at a hotel in April. It can now be revealed he was jailed in 2018 for targeting 10 women and girls with messages describing sexually motivated murder, torture and rape, and then changed his name after his release. Callum Blake-O\u2019Brien, as he was formerly known, was referred to the Prevent anti-radicalisation programme in 2019 but no further action was taken. He was then arrested again last year for targeting another woman with sexual and racist messages. Two of Parslow\u2019s victims said they asked police whether he posed a physical threat, but were assured he was a \u201cloner\u201d and a \u201csaddo\u201d who was only a risk online. They feel their concerns were not taken seriously enough by police. On 2 April, Parslow launched a stabbing attack on an asylum seeker at the Pear Tree Inn, near Worcester, and police found multiple weapons including knives and an axe at his home. At the time, the 32-year-old was on bail and awaiting trial for his most recent offences against women, which followed a similar pattern to the abuse he was jailed for in 2018. Parslow was targeting Mercy Muroki, a policy researcher and former GB News presenter, from multiple accounts under fake names on Facebook, Instagram and X. Among the messages sent in July and August 2023 were videos of himself performing sexual acts and footage of a black woman being flogged. \u201cThe message he sent was about him fantasising that this would happen to me,\u201d said Muroki, who has chosen to waive her anonymity. As well as reporting the direct messages from Parslow to police, she sent investigators screengrabs of his wider violent and white supremacist posts on social media. Muroki, 29, said she raised concerns about whether Parslow could pose a physical threat to her, but was told that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d, partly because he lived in a different county and did not have a car. Officers said that in interviews he had admitted his online activity reflected his true beliefs but said he had only messaged Muroki because \u201che found it difficult to speak to women he fancies\u201d. Speaking to the Observer, Muroki said: \u201cI said to the police: \u2018This is clearly a very deranged person who is fixated on the far-right stuff and on me \u2013 do I need to be worried that he might escalate it to something in person?\u2019 \u201cThey were kind of like: \u2018Oh no, don\u2019t worry.\u2019 They said he seems like a bit of a loner, a bit of a saddo. That\u2019s how they characterised him \u2013 just a sad person on a computer \u2013 whereas actually I feel that the content he had posted demonstrated it was way past some keyboard warrior stuff.\u201d When police searched Parslow\u2019s flat in Worcester on 13 December 2023, they found a stockpile of Nazi memorabilia, two copies of Adolf Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf and numerous other far-right books, and seized Parslow\u2019s phone and laptop. But he was only charged with offences related to his messages to Muroki, and evidence presented to Leicester crown court suggested he started preparations in earnest for a terror attack soon after being released on bail. Muroki said the material at Parslow\u2019s flat \u201cdemonstrated he was a far-right lunatic but, had he not then gone on to stab somebody, I don\u2019t know the extent to which they would have taken any of that stuff seriously\u201d. She added: \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like the fact he was clearly a far-right risk was something they would have followed up on.\u201d Parslow was arrested shortly after fleeing the scene of the hotel stabbing on 2 April, having been found by police while trying to post a terrorist manifesto on X. As well as focusing on his white supremacist beliefs and calls for further attacks, the document was peppered with misogynist references. He called white women \u201calcoholic sluts\u201d who \u201chave as many abortions as possible\u201d and claimed there was a conspiracy to \u201cdemonise masculinity\u201d. Research commissioned by counter-terrorism policing in 2021 showed a \u201cstriking prevalence\u201d of domestic abuse in the lives of people referred to the Prevent programme. Muroki said: \u201cI felt like the police were a bit dismissive about my concerns that he might actually do something after I reported him. \u201cWhen I saw [news of the attack], I felt [like] my concerns were well founded \u2013 he was someone willing to do something like that. I think they should have taken the fact he was a risk a lot more seriously.\u201d Muroki said she was shocked that Parslow had been able to legally change his name after his release from prison in 2020. As Blake-O\u2019Brien, he had been given a 30-month prison sentence in February 2018 for stalking and harassing 10 women and girls online. Parslow was initially released from jail in 2019 but was recalled for breaching his licence conditions and served his full term in custody, which meant he was freed without a period of probation supervision and the only restrictions remaining were restraining orders issued to protect his victims. One of the women who brought the original case against Parslow, who was just 17 years old when his crimes against her began, said that her initial attempts to report him to police were rebuffed. \u201cThey said he wasn\u2019t a real threat,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was turned down by the police multiple times before being taken seriously. He never stopped harassing women \u2026 this is just the proof of it now.\u201d The woman said that finding out that Parslow had been able to commit further offences against Muroki and then a terror attack made her feel as if \u201cfighting for justice against him was a waste of my time\u201d. She added: \u201cIt took me a long time to trust people and heal from everything he said. I thought I would never have to hear his name again in my life, but hearing about him committing these types of crimes, and new violent crimes, makes me feel sick.\u201d Parslow, originally from Hereford, studied physics at Swansea University but dropped out without completing his degree. At the time he committed the terror attack in April, he was living in Worcester and working as a computer programmer for a local manufacturer. Parslow\u2019s attempted murder trial was subject to reporting restrictions after he denied three offences against Muroki, because he was due to face a separate trial later this month and his defence team argued the jury would be prejudiced by media coverage. But after being found guilty of attempted murder, he immediately pleaded guilty to two counts of malicious communications and one of online exposure. Parslow will be sentenced for both cases at Woolwich crown court in London in January. A spokesperson for West Mercia police said that Parslow was identified for offences against Muroki after his social media accounts were linked to an IP address at his Worcester home. \u201cHe was released on bail, with bail conditions appropriate to the nature of the offences,\u201d a statement added. \u201cThe investigation progressed at pace and remained ongoing at the time he carried out the attack at the Pear Tree Inn.\u201d",

It is to prepare, over the course of the next few years, for government to ensure that by the time of the next election, we have not just a clear set of Conservative pledges that appeal to the British people, but a clear plan for how to implement them, a clear plan to change this country by changing the way that government works.\u201d</p> \n<p>Victoria Atkins, the shadow health secretary and a prominent supporter of Jenrick, told Sky News that while she was disappointed, \u201cwe as a Conservative family really want this to work\u201d.</p> \n<p>The prime minister, Keir Starmer, congratulated Badenoch on her victory, saying her achievement in becoming the first Black leader of a party in Westminster was a \u201cproud moment for our country\u201d.</p> \n<p>Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, also sent his congratulations, adding that his party would \u201ccontinue to offer the best opposition to the government\u201d.</p> \n<p>Badenoch, who was born in the UK to Nigerian parents and grew up in Nigeria and the US, was congratulated by David Lammy, the foreign secretary. He <a href=\"https://x.com/DavidLammy/status/1852679290309034153\">tweeted</a>: \u201cYour election as the first Black leader of a Westminster party is an important moment not only for Brits from Black and minority ethnic backgrounds, but for our whole country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another Labour MP, Florence Eshalomi, <a href=\"https://x.com/FloEshalomi/status/1852686754748199027\">sent her congratulations</a> \u201cfrom one British Nigerian MP to another British Nigerian MP\u201d, adding: \u201cEku ori ire. Your dad would be proud.\u201d</p> \n<p>The contest revealed Conservative party membership appears to have fallen by almost a quarter over the past two years with the 95,000 people who voted in this year\u2019s contest a record low.</p> \n<p>In 2022, when Liz Truss defeated Rishi Sunak, 141,725 members out of about 172,000 voted. However, by Saturday there were only 131,680 Tory members eligible to vote for the next leader, a drop of 23%.</p> \n<p>The contest began in early September with an initial six candidates having secured the required 10 nominations from Tory MPs in order to stand: Priti Patel, Mel Stride, Tom Tugendhat, Cleverly, and Badenoch and Jenrick. </p> \n<p>Successive rounds of voting by MPs knocked out Patel and Stride, with the other four remaining in the race for the Conservative conference in early October, given the chance to present their cases direct to party members.</p> \n<p>Cleverly was generally seen as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/08/tom-tugendhat-knocked-out-of-tory-leadership-contest-after-mps-vote\">having performed best</a>, with Badenoch mainly winning headlines for calling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/sep/29/maternity-pay-is-excessive-says-tory-leadership-hopeful-kemi-badenoch\">maternity pay \u201cexcessive\u201d</a> and suggesting that up to 10% of civil servants were so bad they should be in prison.</p> \n<p>In the third round of MP voting shortly afterwards, Tugendhat was removed and Cleverly topped the poll, making him the favourite. But a day later Cleverly was sensationally eliminated himself, seemingly after efforts by his supporters to engineer a runoff with Jenrick and not Badenoch backfired.</p> \n<p>The final runoff, in which Tory members chose between Badenoch and Jenrick, involved no head-to-head debates and just one TV event, where the pair were questioned by party members. Jenrick\u2019s camp blamed Badenoch for avoiding debates.</p>",

It is to prepare, over the course of the next few years, for government to ensure that by the time of the next election, we have not just a clear set of Conservative pledges that appeal to the British people, but a clear plan for how to implement them, a clear plan to change this country by changing the way that government works.\u201d Victoria Atkins, the shadow health secretary and a prominent supporter of Jenrick, told Sky News that while she was disappointed, \u201cwe as a Conservative family really want this to work\u201d. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, congratulated Badenoch on her victory, saying her achievement in becoming the first Black leader of a party in Westminster was a \u201cproud moment for our country\u201d. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, also sent his congratulations, adding that his party would \u201ccontinue to offer the best opposition to the government\u201d. Badenoch, who was born in the UK to Nigerian parents and grew up in Nigeria and the US, was congratulated by David Lammy, the foreign secretary. He tweeted: \u201cYour election as the first Black leader of a Westminster party is an important moment not only for Brits from Black and minority ethnic backgrounds, but for our whole country.\u201d Another Labour MP, Florence Eshalomi, sent her congratulations \u201cfrom one British Nigerian MP to another British Nigerian MP\u201d, adding: \u201cEku ori ire. Your dad would be proud.\u201d The contest revealed Conservative party membership appears to have fallen by almost a quarter over the past two years with the 95,000 people who voted in this year\u2019s contest a record low. In 2022, when Liz Truss defeated Rishi Sunak, 141,725 members out of about 172,000 voted. However, by Saturday there were only 131,680 Tory members eligible to vote for the next leader, a drop of 23%. The contest began in early September with an initial six candidates having secured the required 10 nominations from Tory MPs in order to stand: Priti Patel, Mel Stride, Tom Tugendhat, Cleverly, and Badenoch and Jenrick. Successive rounds of voting by MPs knocked out Patel and Stride, with the other four remaining in the race for the Conservative conference in early October, given the chance to present their cases direct to party members. Cleverly was generally seen as having performed best, with Badenoch mainly winning headlines for calling maternity pay \u201cexcessive\u201d and suggesting that up to 10% of civil servants were so bad they should be in prison. In the third round of MP voting shortly afterwards, Tugendhat was removed and Cleverly topped the poll, making him the favourite. But a day later Cleverly was sensationally eliminated himself, seemingly after efforts by his supporters to engineer a runoff with Jenrick and not Badenoch backfired. The final runoff, in which Tory members chose between Badenoch and Jenrick, involved no head-to-head debates and just one TV event, where the pair were questioned by party members. Jenrick\u2019s camp blamed Badenoch for avoiding debates.",

      "body": "<p>Tiffany Owens stood before the city council in Saginaw, Michigan, struggling to contain her anguish.</p> <p>\u201cI hate this city because this city took away something that was so precious and dear to me. I\u2019ve been living here all my life and I had to bury two of my kids. They out in Forest Lawn cemetery,\u201d she said, her voice shaking with grief.</p> <p>\u201cWe just need y\u2019all to do something. I don\u2019t want another mother to have to stand here where I\u2019m standing. It\u2019s not fair that we all are here but I do not want another parent to have to go through this trauma, go through this pain.\u201d</p> <p>Owens\u2019 eldest son, Tamaris, was 12 years old when he was killed by a stray bullet from a drive-by shooting. Her 26-year-old daughter, Tamarea, met a similar fate nine years later in 2021. Owens fears for the wellbeing of her remaining son.</p> <p>The family tragedy does not stop there. Owens\u2019 niece, Tonquinisha McKinley, was killed outside her home during a family celebration before Tamarea\u2019s high school prom in 2013.</p> <p>Behind Owens, other mothers held photographs of children murdered in one of the most dangerous cities in the US. Saginaw has at times had the highest crime rate of any city in Michigan during recent years, <a href=\"https://www.abc12.com/news/crime/saginaw-passes-detroit-for-michigans-highest-violent-crime-rate/article_5a543b04-4970-11ed-bc67-3fba309bd153.html\">surpassing Detroit</a>, with which it shares many of the same problems of industrial decline, deepening poverty and diminishing population over decades.</p> <p>More than 180 people have been murdered in the city of Saginaw over the past decade, most of them with guns, alongside hundreds of non-fatal shootings. About 20 people have been murdered so far this year.</p> <p>The bereaved mothers were pleading for action from Saginaw\u2019s city council at its last meeting before local elections alongside the presidential ballot on Tuesday. For some, the local race is the more important of the two as they look to reverse their city\u2019s decline while the Saginaw council stands accused of dithering and focusing on the wrong priorities. Others see Saginaw\u2019s fate, and the safety of its families, as also inextricably tied to who gets into the White House.</p> <p>Tamara Tucker also spoke at the council meeting. She was still in high school when her 17-year-old brother was shot dead. Not long afterwards, she joined the support group Parents of Murdered Children to help her mother through a terrible time.</p> <p>Tucker remained a member when a few years later she, too, came to experience the grief of being a parent losing a child after her daughter was murdered.</p> <p>\u201cI thought, my God, how can this be? Not again,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p>    <p>Tucker\u2019s daughter, MoeNeisha Simmons-Ross, was trying to prevent her boyfriend from leaving her Saginaw apartment with a gun. He shot her with it. She was pregnant with their child. The boyfriend was convicted of murder.</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t the end. A few months later, Tucker\u2019s younger sister was killed in Florida, and then her nephew in Saginaw.</p> <p>Tucker blames \u201cselfishness\u201d for the violence and the city\u2019s failure to curb it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take the whole community to turn this around. I keep saying it, and I will say it until I\u2019m blue in the face, it\u2019s going to take the community caring. Apparently, there\u2019s not enough children being murdered for them to actually say we got to do something about this,\u201d she said.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Barbara Clark went to college to get a degree in criminal justice in an effort to understand the causes of the violence in Saginaw and what to do about it after her son, Tommie Ford, was murdered at 17 years old by another teenager jealous of Ford talking to his former girlfriend.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to learn as much about the criminal justice system because I need to be able to talk to them in their language so I can know what you\u2019re talking about when they tell me what you can and can\u2019t do,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Clark said that politicians, the police and people in other parts of Saginaw county were too often willing to blame parenting and gang culture for the killings so as to sidestep the part played by poverty, which runs at about 34% of the city\u2019s population, and lack of resources.</p> <p>She ties the rise in murders, shootings and other crimes to Saginaw\u2019s economic decline as more than a dozen car factories closed since the 1990s and the population fell sharply to about 45,000 today. Abandoned houses and bulldozed lots dot many streets on the lower-income east side of the city. Schools have been closed and consolidated. With a dwindling tax base, the city government cut back on services including recreational facilities.</p> <p>\u201cEverything that was there to help those young people, to go to recreation centres, to do anything, has been shut down, decimated. All the schools here are gone. The schools are now placed on the other side of town so you gotta be commuted to it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people want to say the parents ain\u2019t doing their job. That may be true in some cases but not in all. There are some parents, for instance us, we are doing the best that we can do. But when you have limited funds, there\u2019s only so much you can do. You\u2019re looking at a poverty level of people in the inner city that things are happening to the family. What needs to happen is for the city of Saginaw to bring things back in for these young people to do, give them a chance.\u201d</p> <p>There was plenty of sympathy for the mothers from city council members. One expressed condolences for the family of the latest victim, 14-year-old Keyvon Bentley, who was killed at the end of October.</p> <p>Council member Michael Flores, who is not running for re-election, read the names of some of those killed.</p>    <p>\u201cThe thing that hurts me the most as a public official is that we lose Saginaw\u2019s future constantly throughout every year that I\u2019ve been here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a lot of the murder victims that I just listed off were 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 ... It\u2019s the saddest thing that I\u2019ve experienced on council.\u201d</p> <p>But there was little commitment to specific change even from those members up for re-election.</p> <p>Criticism of the council has focused on how it is spending $52m in grants under Joe Biden\u2019s American Rescue Plan Act (Arpa). The council used half of the funds to fill a budget shortfall.</p> <p>The council\u2019s plan for the rest of the money includes $10m to support \u201ccommunity centres, childcare and youth development\u201d. But how that will be spent is still unresolved, to the frustration of campaigners.</p> <p>Flores told the Guardian the city \u201clacks either the imagination or the ability\u201d to provide opportunities for young people, including initiatives to help those who are otherwise drawn into \u201ca life of crime to be able to produce money for their families\u201d.</p> <p>He said the council was too focused on allocating money to develop upscale housing, in the hope of drawing higher-income residents to the city, at the expense of affordable homes that would improve the lives of lower-income families. He pointed to a recent case where the council spent $3m to upgrade a building only to sell it to a developer for $1,000 to convert it to relatively upscale condos while rejecting a higher offer that would have brought more affordable housing.</p> <p>\u201cThe council always has the opportunity to be on the side of the people or be on the side of outside developers that want to come in and get tax abatement or tax credits for developing. We never tend to give it to the people that really need the help,\u201d he said.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Carly Hammond is a union organiser running for a seat on the council who is campaigning for more Arpa money to be spent on facilities for young people.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a lot that the city council can do to combat youth violence and create youth opportunities. Back in the 1960s, there used to be much more robust after-school youth education programmes, community centres, funded by the city,\u201d she said.</p>    <p>\u201cA lot of these organisms and concepts were strategically dismantled. Rebuilding them takes a whole lot. Youth development means investing in neighbourhoods.\u201d</p> <p>Hammond accuses the council of hiding behind its own bureaucracy to explain why it is not doing more on affordable housing and support for community organisations. She also accuses the council of leaving some federal money on the table from the community development block grant because it failed to put together the proper documentation.</p> <p>\u201cThe lack of investment overall in the community is felt most by the children. They just feel like there\u2019s no future. If you hear parents and young people talk about this, they\u2019re asking for direct action. They\u2019re not asking for sympathy,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The council also heard from Matthew Carpus, president of the Saginaw police union. He said officers on the force long ago lost confidence in the city\u2019s police chief and council to address crime.</p> <p>\u201cMost victims in this city don\u2019t speak out. Either they move out of the city or they suffer in silence. Very few come to these meetings because, like officers, they feel you\u2019re not going to do anything,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cNot only isn\u2019t it being solved, it\u2019s not getting better, it\u2019s trending in the wrong direction. We need to try something different.\u201d</p> <p>Flores wants to see more of the Arpa money spent on policing.</p> <p>\u201cI have done many ride-alongs with police officers. For the amount of area that they have to cover, they\u2019re drastically understaffed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were calls, some of them domestic violence calls and the like, that just weren\u2019t able to be picked up because there were more pressing issues in the moment.\u201d</p> <p>The city has brought in the state police to patrol parts of Saginaw but Clark said that had resulted in little more than racially profiled stop-and-searches of cars.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not helping. Instead of them doing what they were brought in to do, which is community service, they\u2019re targeting. If these young men are blessed to have a nice car with nice rims and dress nice, you\u2019re definitely targeted. If your car is dressed, made up a certain type of way, they\u2019re definitely going to pull you over,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Clark is looking to the new council to change the trajectory. But she said the presidential election would be decisive because while Biden has directed financial support to lower-income communities, she expects Trump to do just the opposite.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s in the White House does affect us because it, I won\u2019t say it trickles down, it starts down and works it way up. They come for our programmes before they do anybody else\u2019s programme. They will cancel our programme before they cancel anybody else\u2019s programmes,\u201d she said.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s threat to execute Liz Cheney, \u201cwith a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her\u201d, is the apogee so far of his Hitlerian rhetoric. By his own words, Trump has proved her point that he is a \u201cdanger\u201d to the constitution and defied his apologists who insist he can be contained or that he doesn\u2019t really mean what he says. \u201cAnd let\u2019s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face,\u201d he said. \u201cShoot Liz Cheney\u201d has replaced \u201cHang Mike Pence.\u201d</p> <p>Hours after Trump declared his wish to kill Cheney, the Wall Street Journal editorial board, his reliable excuse maker for the executive collaborator class, published an <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-candidacy-2024-election-kamala-harris-f8f99a69?mod=hp_opin_pos_2\">editorial</a> stating, \u201cWe don\u2019t buy the fascism fears, and we doubt Democrats really do either.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is hellbent to break through any \u201csane-washing\u201d of the media smoothing over his viciousness and vulgarity. His call for an elaborate execution of a pre-eminent political opponent, a conservative Republican of the most partisan pedigree, is his definitive and final answer to those who quibble about his intentions and his unmooring from all traditional politics.</p> <p>His fascist-themed freakshow in Madison Square Garden followed by his firing squad fantasy are an augury of a second administration. His closing act has overwhelmed any media reflex for euphemism and both-siderism. He contemptuously stomps on every effort at normalization.</p> <p>Time and again, day after day, event after event, Trump insists on posing as the salient question of the election, certainly about the candidate himself: are you crazier today than you were four years ago?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/01/donald-trump-president-rich-money\">Trump may become president again \u2013 but he\u2019s already a useful idiot to the mega rich | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many of Trump\u2019s former White House staffers, cabinet secretaries and commanding generals are frantically attempting to warn against his madness, that he is \u201ca fascist to the core\u201d, as former chairman of the joint chiefs Gen Mark Milley has unequivocally stated. In private conversation, former staffers and others with intimate knowledge of Trump, all reliable people, talk about the real man as far viler than those who haven\u2019t seen him behind closed doors could possibly know.</p> <p>Knowledge of Trump\u2019s vileness is widespread among top-level Republicans. \u201cThey all hate him,\u201d a former senior Trump adviser told me categorically. And they all have stories, some exhibiting his narcissism, others his malice: how, for example, the time two senators from one state were summoned to the Oval Office to listen to Trump say he would travel there to have a mountain named after him. As a rule, they agree with Senator Mitch McConnell that he is \u201cdespicable\u201d. Unlike those former Trump staffers waving their arms, they are silent and complicit.</p> <p>Now, former staffers speculate about the hazy fine line between Trump\u2019s infantilism and his dementia. There is no responsible person left around Trump. He has learned the lesson, sealed by January 6, not to trust the \u201cnormies\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Trump\u2019s night in the Garden on 27 October was early Hitler in style, not middle Hitler. The bellowing obscenities, racist sneers and violent threats were more reminiscent of the Munich beer hall phase of Hitler rousing the street gangs of Brownshirts than the Nuremberg rallies of disciplined ranks of storm troopers massed before his reviewing stand.</p> <p>\u201cAn immense wave of eccentric barbarism \u2026 A primitive fairground brutality,\u201d wrote the great German novelist Thomas Mann in 1930 about the Nazi rallies he observed. \u201cThis fantastic state of mind, of a humanity that has outrun its ideas, is matched by a political scene in the grotesque style \u2026 hallelujahs and bell-ringing and dervish-like repetition of monotonous catchwords, until everybody foams at the mouth. Fanaticism turns into a means of salvation, enthusiasm into epileptic ecstasy, politics becomes an opiate for the masses, a proletarian eschatology; and reason veils her face.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA quarter-of-an-hour before the opening time I walked through the chief hall of the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus on the Platz in Munich and my heart was nearly bursting with joy,\u201d wrote Hitler in Mein Kampf.</p> <p>\u201cThe love in that room,\u201d said Trump after his rally at Madison Square Garden. \u201cIt was breathtaking. It was like a love fest, an absolute love fest.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s festival at the Garden was a fascist foreshadowing masquerading as a farce. As a screwball flying circus, it was a version of the Marx Brothers\u2019 Night at the Opera. Everything was turned upside down in a pandemonium. Trump\u2019s comedians, however, were no Groucho. It would have been better for Trump if his speakers had been equipped like the mute Harpo with a honking horn.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s master race of misfits found an authentic voice in the comic relief of Tony Hinchcliffe, who amid his slurs about Black people (\u201cWe carved watermelons together\u201d), Latinos, Jews and Palestinians, said, \u201cThere\u2019s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. Yeah, I think it\u2019s called Puerto Rico.\u201d</p> <p>Hinchcliffe is the host of a podcast aptly called Kill Tony. With a dubious laugh line, as if on cue, the stage swiveled. Triumph of the Will turned into West Side Story. His performance fatally died like the character Tony in West Side Story, only this Tony died by suicide.</p> <p>Life is all right in America<br>If you\u2019re all white in America</p> <p>With his assent, Trump\u2019s night at the Garden was orchestrated by a malevolent crew of eternally stunted pranksters and gangsters who took control of his campaign\u2019s closing argument. They were brought together principally by Trump\u2019s son Don Jr, a pitiable figure who engages in abominable displays to gain his father\u2019s approbation, and who has become central to the organization of the entourage floating around the campaign.</p> <p>\u201cPoor Don, he really got the brunt of everything,\u201d said Ivanka.

His robo-taxi crashes through a shop window.</p> <p>Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter and its transformation into X was doomed to fail because it is about his greatest weakness: human expression. He treats human relationships as a horror show. He is the father of 12 children, some of whom he\u2019s given the names of software programs and he has savagely disowned his trans daughter.

He claimed to be a childhood friend of Trump\u2019s from his Queens neighborhood, but, in fact, had only recently met him. In 1991, he pleaded <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/320/791/615717/\">guilty</a> to acting as a courier to distribute cocaine and was sentenced to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p> <p>Grant Cardone, a real estate operator from Florida, is a longtime <a href=\"https://x.com/yashar/status/1628233290384814080?lang=en\">Scientologist</a> and major donor to its slush fund used to harass critics. He told the Maga faithful that Harris and \u201cher pimp handlers will destroy our country\u201d. To great applause, he flipped his middle finger.</p> <p>A local New York radio broadcaster, Sid Rosenberg, who had <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-claims-harris-whos-married-to-a-jewish-man-doesnt-like-jewish-people\">called</a> Harris\u2019s husband, Doug Emhoff, \u201ca crappy Jew\u201d, to Trump\u2019s approval in April, told the crowd, \u201cShe is some sick bastard, that Hillary Clinton, huh? What a sick son of a bitch. The whole fucking party, a bunch of degenerates, lowlives, Jew haters and lowlives. Every one of them. Every one of them.\u201d</p> <p>The obscenities echoing in the Garden embroidered the vulgar vision of the great replacement theory. \u201cAmerica is for Americans and Americans only,\u201d declared Stephen Miller, a former Trump aide. If Trump were to be elected, Miller would play a large role in implementing what Trump boasted would be \u201cthe largest deportation program in American history\u201d.</p> <p>Trump came on stage to shout threats to the rafters. \u201cThe United States is now an occupied country, but it will soon be an occupied country no longer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same country any more.\u201d He stated he would restore the country to what it was by reaching backwards in history. \u201cI will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Think of that. That\u2019s how far back. That\u2019s when they had law and order. They had some tough ones. Think of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.\u201d</p> <p>Undoubtedly, Trump had no clue he was referring to the political period that Thomas Jefferson described as \u201cthe reign of witches\u201d. President John Adams enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts to harass and imprison his critics and opponents, the Democratic-Republicans organized by Jefferson and James Madison, a grouping that was the origin of the Democratic party. Adams lost the election of 1800 to Jefferson. Adams was bitter, but freely and peacefully gave up the presidency, and transferred power in the first election after Washington. The acts expired, except for the Alien Enemies Act, which is invoked now by Trump. Yet, that act is only operative during wartime.</p> <p>\u201cAnd when I say the enemy from within, the other side goes crazy, becomes a sound hole,\u201d Trump barked. \u201cHow can he say now they\u2019ve done very bad things to this country? They are indeed the enemy from within. But this is who we\u2019re fighting.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s vision of America was also Hitler\u2019s understanding of the country. Albert Speer, Hitler\u2019s architect and chief of war production, became his confidant. He participated in hundreds of dinner table conversations with Hitler. \u201cIn general, no such thing as an American people existed as a unit,\u201d Speer wrote in his memoir of Hitler\u2019s view. \u201cThey were nothing but a mass of immigrants from many nations and races.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>After the disastrous show at the Garden, Rogan, keen on his commercial viability, separated himself from his sinking sidekick, Hinchcliffe, while at the same time winking at his bro base with a couple of little racially tinged asides. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta tell you, that joke kills at comedy clubs. I don\u2019t like the joke, [but] it kills,\u201d Rogan said on his podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, if you\u2019re Puerto Rican and you hear that in the audience, you\u2019re like [groans]. But it\u2019s a funny joke. The joke does well. But I said to him, I go, \u2018Dude, that\u2019s the one that\u2019s gonna get you stabbed.\u2019 And he used to talk about it on stage, saying, \u2018Joe Rogan always says that\u2019s the one that\u2019s gonna get me stabbed.\u2019\u201d After creating some distance between himself and Hinchcliffe, he singled out Barack Obama for criticizing the \u201cjoke\u201d as \u201creally fucked up. You know that\u2019s a joke. That\u2019s like going to a Quentin Tarantino movie [and saying], \u2018And then the man killed that woman.\u2019 Like, he didn\u2019t really kill that woman \u2026 this is a movie.\u201d But \u201cKill Tony\u201d really did make himself roadkill and in the process \u201cstabbed\u201d Trump in what was not a movie or a comedy club.</p> <p>Dancing around having Harris as a guest, Rogan decided that if she would not drop her schedule to see him he would not deign to travel to interview her. Instead, he hosted JD Vance for three hours on Halloween, in which Vance <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/31/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/vance-on-rogan-00186657\">held forth</a> on how young men with more testosterone are more conservative, liberal women are \u201ccelebrating\u201d their abortions with \u201cbirthday cakes\u201d, and that the surefire way to gain admission to an Ivy League university \u201cis to be trans\u201d. Then, after confidently predicting Trump would win \u201cthe normal gay guy\u201d, Vance pronounced the Emily In Paris Netflix series a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Conspicuously missing from the cabal that staged the Garden fiasco was the most diligent student of Hitler of all the minions swirling around Trump. Steve Bannon, imprisoned for defying a congressional subpoena to testify on his role on January 6, was still behind bars.</p> <p>When Bannon saw Trump descend down the Trump Tower escalator to launch his campaign in 2015, he thought, \u201cThat\u2019s Hitler!\u201d Bannon was ecstatic, he told New York Times correspondent Jeremy Peters in his book Insurgency: How Republicans Lost Their Party and Got Everything They Ever Wanted. Trump was the demagogue he was waiting for.</p> <p>After a career on Wall Street, Bannon spent years failing as a film producer; then, radicalized as a rightwinger, he announced his ambition to become \u201cthe Leni Riefenstahl of the GOP\u201d. Promoting his dreadful documentary in 2011 on Sarah Palin, The Undefeated, he said, \u201cPeople have said I\u2019m like Leni Riefenstahl.\u201d Riefenstahl was the leading film-maker of the Third Reich, mistress of Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels, and auteur of Triumph of the Will, a brilliant, innovative account of Hitler\u2019s 1935 Nazi rally in Nuremberg. Bannon, who became Trump\u2019s campaign manager in 2016 and White House senior adviser, saw himself staging Trump as Riefenstahl filmed Hitler. He boasted that he asked himself, \u201cWhat would Leni Riefenstahl do?\u201d</p> <p>Bannon walked out of federal prison on 29 October. He still faces New York state charges of financial fraud in a scheme to fleece donors to build Trump\u2019s wall along the Mexican border. He declared that he would resume where he left off. He was on to the coup of 2024. He picked up once again on the big lie of \u201celection integrity\u201d, that the 2024 election might be stolen from Trump just like in 2020. \u201cIf people think American politics have been divisive before,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/29/steve-bannon-released-from-prison-early-a-week-before-us-election\">said</a> Bannon, \u201cyou haven\u2019t seen anything.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Self-Made-Man-Political-Abraham-Lincoln/dp/1476777268/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=A+Self-Made+Man&amp;qid=1597952377&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1\">A Self-Made Man</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wrestling-His-Angel-Political-1849-1856/dp/150115379X/ref=pd_lpo_14_img_1/141-7485861-0988151?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=150115379X&amp;pd_rd_r=a9c485bb-87bd-4934-9aed-937591fb3ecd&amp;pd_rd_w=WPRE2&amp;pd_rd_wg=C7lVx&amp;pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&amp;pf_rd_r=4TE076HKJFEC3JAZ6JHR&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=4TE076HKJFEC3JAZ6JHR\">Wrestling With His Angel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-Powers-Earth-Political-1856-1863/dp/1476777284\">All the Powers of Earth</a></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s threat to execute Liz Cheney, \u201cwith a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her\u201d, is the apogee so far of his Hitlerian rhetoric. By his own words, Trump has proved her point that he is a \u201cdanger\u201d to the constitution and defied his apologists who insist he can be contained or that he doesn\u2019t really mean what he says. \u201cAnd let\u2019s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face,\u201d he said. \u201cShoot Liz Cheney\u201d has replaced \u201cHang Mike Pence.\u201d Hours after Trump declared his wish to kill Cheney, the Wall Street Journal editorial board, his reliable excuse maker for the executive collaborator class, published an editorial stating, \u201cWe don\u2019t buy the fascism fears, and we doubt Democrats really do either.\u201d Trump is hellbent to break through any \u201csane-washing\u201d of the media smoothing over his viciousness and vulgarity. His call for an elaborate execution of a pre-eminent political opponent, a conservative Republican of the most partisan pedigree, is his definitive and final answer to those who quibble about his intentions and his unmooring from all traditional politics. His fascist-themed freakshow in Madison Square Garden followed by his firing squad fantasy are an augury of a second administration. His closing act has overwhelmed any media reflex for euphemism and both-siderism. He contemptuously stomps on every effort at normalization. Time and again, day after day, event after event, Trump insists on posing as the salient question of the election, certainly about the candidate himself: are you crazier today than you were four years ago? Many of Trump\u2019s former White House staffers, cabinet secretaries and commanding generals are frantically attempting to warn against his madness, that he is \u201ca fascist to the core\u201d, as former chairman of the joint chiefs Gen Mark Milley has unequivocally stated. In private conversation, former staffers and others with intimate knowledge of Trump, all reliable people, talk about the real man as far viler than those who haven\u2019t seen him behind closed doors could possibly know. Knowledge of Trump\u2019s vileness is widespread among top-level Republicans. \u201cThey all hate him,\u201d a former senior Trump adviser told me categorically. And they all have stories, some exhibiting his narcissism, others his malice: how, for example, the time two senators from one state were summoned to the Oval Office to listen to Trump say he would travel there to have a mountain named after him. As a rule, they agree with Senator Mitch McConnell that he is \u201cdespicable\u201d. Unlike those former Trump staffers waving their arms, they are silent and complicit. Now, former staffers speculate about the hazy fine line between Trump\u2019s infantilism and his dementia. There is no responsible person left around Trump. He has learned the lesson, sealed by January 6, not to trust the \u201cnormies\u201d. *** Trump\u2019s night in the Garden on 27 October was early Hitler in style, not middle Hitler. The bellowing obscenities, racist sneers and violent threats were more reminiscent of the Munich beer hall phase of Hitler rousing the street gangs of Brownshirts than the Nuremberg rallies of disciplined ranks of storm troopers massed before his reviewing stand. \u201cAn immense wave of eccentric barbarism \u2026 A primitive fairground brutality,\u201d wrote the great German novelist Thomas Mann in 1930 about the Nazi rallies he observed. \u201cThis fantastic state of mind, of a humanity that has outrun its ideas, is matched by a political scene in the grotesque style \u2026 hallelujahs and bell-ringing and dervish-like repetition of monotonous catchwords, until everybody foams at the mouth. Fanaticism turns into a means of salvation, enthusiasm into epileptic ecstasy, politics becomes an opiate for the masses, a proletarian eschatology; and reason veils her face.\u201d \u201cA quarter-of-an-hour before the opening time I walked through the chief hall of the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus on the Platz in Munich and my heart was nearly bursting with joy,\u201d wrote Hitler in Mein Kampf. \u201cThe love in that room,\u201d said Trump after his rally at Madison Square Garden. \u201cIt was breathtaking. It was like a love fest, an absolute love fest.\u201d Trump\u2019s festival at the Garden was a fascist foreshadowing masquerading as a farce. As a screwball flying circus, it was a version of the Marx Brothers\u2019 Night at the Opera. Everything was turned upside down in a pandemonium. Trump\u2019s comedians, however, were no Groucho. It would have been better for Trump if his speakers had been equipped like the mute Harpo with a honking horn. Trump\u2019s master race of misfits found an authentic voice in the comic relief of Tony Hinchcliffe, who amid his slurs about Black people (\u201cWe carved watermelons together\u201d), Latinos, Jews and Palestinians, said, \u201cThere\u2019s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. Yeah, I think it\u2019s called Puerto Rico.\u201d Hinchcliffe is the host of a podcast aptly called Kill Tony. With a dubious laugh line, as if on cue, the stage swiveled. Triumph of the Will turned into West Side Story. His performance fatally died like the character Tony in West Side Story, only this Tony died by suicide. Life is all right in America If you\u2019re all white in America With his assent, Trump\u2019s night at the Garden was orchestrated by a malevolent crew of eternally stunted pranksters and gangsters who took control of his campaign\u2019s closing argument. They were brought together principally by Trump\u2019s son Don Jr, a pitiable figure who engages in abominable displays to gain his father\u2019s approbation, and who has become central to the organization of the entourage floating around the campaign. \u201cPoor Don, he really got the brunt of everything,\u201d said Ivanka. Abandoned and abused, he was shipped off to Czechoslovakia after the divorce of his parents to be raised during the summers by his mother\u2019s grandparents \u2013 \u201cthe most memorable time in my life\u201d, he said. He learned to speak fluent Czech. Back home, his new stepfather tried to choke him. His college roommates at the University of Pennsylvania recalled Trump coming to visit and smashing Don Jr in the face in front of his friends, knocking him to the ground. When Trump was invited to give a formal speech at Penn, Don Jr refused to attend. He wouldn\u2019t speak with his brutal father for years. He drank heavily, \u201ca fall-down drunk\u201d, said a college friend. His first wife, Vanessa, once said to him, \u201cYou\u2019re the one with the retarded father.\u201d Now, Don Jr does anything he can to win Trump\u2019s distracted attention and alienated affection. On the podium, he called out to his dad as \u201cthe king of New York\u201d. Tony Hinchcliffe rose to the level of insult comedian as an opening club act for Joe Rogan. They both live in Austin. Rogan devoted three hours on his podcast on 26 October to a limp interview with Trump in which he failed to challenge Trump\u2019s dozens of flagrant lies. Rogan traffics in being conspiracy theory curious and science hostile to explain the world, which he punctuates with guffaws of jocular misogyny, the occasional racial inference, some gay bashing and tough-guy posturing. He is the faux regular bros\u2019 Alex Jones, the incels\u2019 Hugh Hefner. Both Rogan and Hinchcliffe are pals of Tucker Carlson. Tucker lately warmed up a Trump rally in Georgia with his sexual fantasy of a \u201chormone-addled 15-year-old daughter\u201d, when \u201cDad comes home and he\u2019s pissed \u2026 You\u2019ve been a bad girl. You\u2019ve been a bad little girl and you\u2019re getting a vigorous spanking right now. And no, it\u2019s not going to hurt me more than it hurts you. No, it\u2019s not. I\u2019m not going to lie. It\u2019s going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me. And you earned this.\u201d A former colleague of Carlson\u2019s says he has been talking intently about his spanking obsession for years, though this was the first time in public. Tucker would appear as the interviewer of Trump on 31 October at an Arizona rally, where he brought up \u201cDick Cheney\u2019s repulsive little daughter\u201d, which triggered Trump to call her \u201cderanged\u201d and then call for her execution. Tucker, Don Jr\u2019s buddy, was instrumental in the selection of JD Vance as Trump\u2019s running mate. JD, with his deep thoughts on \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d and \u201cthe whole purpose of the postmenopausal female\u201d, is a new addition to the boys\u2019 club. Except for Rogan, all of them, from comic to billionaire to VP candidate, appeared on the podium at the Garden. Tucker Carlson, taking his turn at standup, distinguished himself by slagging the woman who\u2019s been a bad girl: \u201cAs the first Samoan-Malaysian, low-IQ, former California prosecutor ever to be elected president \u2026\u201d Then, Elon Musk, relocated to Austin. He has launched himself like one of his spaceships into Trump\u2019s orbit. The aspiring oligarch has donated tens of millions to a political action committee to support Trump, produced misleading TV spots to smear Harris, and used X to promote disinformation for Trump. He offers a million-dollar giveaway to register voters, cheap money, which has landed him in a Philadelphia court. He speaks secretly to Putin. Whenever Musk strays from his skill at hardware and software into the realm of human interaction, however, he falls flat on his face. His robo-taxi crashes through a shop window. Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter and its transformation into X was doomed to fail because it is about his greatest weakness: human expression. He treats human relationships as a horror show. He is the father of 12 children, some of whom he\u2019s given the names of software programs and he has savagely disowned his trans daughter. He bought an enclosed compound in Texas to contain former wives and children. \u201cHe has even offered his own sperm to friends and acquaintances,\u201d the New York Times has reported. He seeks life on Mars because he\u2019s an alien on Earth. Techno authoritarianism is the only comfortable spot on his political spectrum. He calls himself \u201cTechno-King\u201d. Trump has promised him that he will be put in charge of the federal workforce \u201cto start from scratch\u201d. Musk was sanctioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission in September. His regulatory troubles will all go away with Trump. The Nasa and defense contracts will flow. If anything might befall Trump, Musk and his fellow techno authoritarians have Vance positioned a heartbeat away. At the rally, Musk introduced himself, \u201cI am dark Gothic Maga.\u201d Among the other speakers in the Garden, David Rem, a 60-year-old New York sanitation worker, mounted the podium to hex Harris as \u201cthe antichrist\u201d and \u201cthe devil\u201d. He claimed to be a childhood friend of Trump\u2019s from his Queens neighborhood, but, in fact, had only recently met him. In 1991, he pleaded guilty to acting as a courier to distribute cocaine and was sentenced to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. Grant Cardone, a real estate operator from Florida, is a longtime Scientologist and major donor to its slush fund used to harass critics. He told the Maga faithful that Harris and \u201cher pimp handlers will destroy our country\u201d. To great applause, he flipped his middle finger. A local New York radio broadcaster, Sid Rosenberg, who had called Harris\u2019s husband, Doug Emhoff, \u201ca crappy Jew\u201d, to Trump\u2019s approval in April, told the crowd, \u201cShe is some sick bastard, that Hillary Clinton, huh? What a sick son of a bitch. The whole fucking party, a bunch of degenerates, lowlives, Jew haters and lowlives. Every one of them. Every one of them.\u201d The obscenities echoing in the Garden embroidered the vulgar vision of the great replacement theory. \u201cAmerica is for Americans and Americans only,\u201d declared Stephen Miller, a former Trump aide. If Trump were to be elected, Miller would play a large role in implementing what Trump boasted would be \u201cthe largest deportation program in American history\u201d. Trump came on stage to shout threats to the rafters. \u201cThe United States is now an occupied country, but it will soon be an occupied country no longer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same country any more.\u201d He stated he would restore the country to what it was by reaching backwards in history. \u201cI will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Think of that. That\u2019s how far back. That\u2019s when they had law and order. They had some tough ones. Think of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.\u201d Undoubtedly, Trump had no clue he was referring to the political period that Thomas Jefferson described as \u201cthe reign of witches\u201d. President John Adams enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts to harass and imprison his critics and opponents, the Democratic-Republicans organized by Jefferson and James Madison, a grouping that was the origin of the Democratic party. Adams lost the election of 1800 to Jefferson. Adams was bitter, but freely and peacefully gave up the presidency, and transferred power in the first election after Washington. The acts expired, except for the Alien Enemies Act, which is invoked now by Trump. Yet, that act is only operative during wartime. \u201cAnd when I say the enemy from within, the other side goes crazy, becomes a sound hole,\u201d Trump barked. \u201cHow can he say now they\u2019ve done very bad things to this country? They are indeed the enemy from within. But this is who we\u2019re fighting.\u201d Trump\u2019s vision of America was also Hitler\u2019s understanding of the country. Albert Speer, Hitler\u2019s architect and chief of war production, became his confidant. He participated in hundreds of dinner table conversations with Hitler. \u201cIn general, no such thing as an American people existed as a unit,\u201d Speer wrote in his memoir of Hitler\u2019s view. \u201cThey were nothing but a mass of immigrants from many nations and races.\u201d *** After the disastrous show at the Garden, Rogan, keen on his commercial viability, separated himself from his sinking sidekick, Hinchcliffe, while at the same time winking at his bro base with a couple of little racially tinged asides. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta tell you, that joke kills at comedy clubs. I don\u2019t like the joke, [but] it kills,\u201d Rogan said on his podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, if you\u2019re Puerto Rican and you hear that in the audience, you\u2019re like [groans]. But it\u2019s a funny joke. The joke does well. But I said to him, I go, \u2018Dude, that\u2019s the one that\u2019s gonna get you stabbed.\u2019 And he used to talk about it on stage, saying, \u2018Joe Rogan always says that\u2019s the one that\u2019s gonna get me stabbed.\u2019\u201d After creating some distance between himself and Hinchcliffe, he singled out Barack Obama for criticizing the \u201cjoke\u201d as \u201creally fucked up. You know that\u2019s a joke. That\u2019s like going to a Quentin Tarantino movie [and saying], \u2018And then the man killed that woman.\u2019 Like, he didn\u2019t really kill that woman \u2026 this is a movie.\u201d But \u201cKill Tony\u201d really did make himself roadkill and in the process \u201cstabbed\u201d Trump in what was not a movie or a comedy club. Dancing around having Harris as a guest, Rogan decided that if she would not drop her schedule to see him he would not deign to travel to interview her. Instead, he hosted JD Vance for three hours on Halloween, in which Vance held forth on how young men with more testosterone are more conservative, liberal women are \u201ccelebrating\u201d their abortions with \u201cbirthday cakes\u201d, and that the surefire way to gain admission to an Ivy League university \u201cis to be trans\u201d. Then, after confidently predicting Trump would win \u201cthe normal gay guy\u201d, Vance pronounced the Emily In Paris Netflix series a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d. *** Conspicuously missing from the cabal that staged the Garden fiasco was the most diligent student of Hitler of all the minions swirling around Trump. Steve Bannon, imprisoned for defying a congressional subpoena to testify on his role on January 6, was still behind bars. When Bannon saw Trump descend down the Trump Tower escalator to launch his campaign in 2015, he thought, \u201cThat\u2019s Hitler!\u201d Bannon was ecstatic, he told New York Times correspondent Jeremy Peters in his book Insurgency: How Republicans Lost Their Party and Got Everything They Ever Wanted. Trump was the demagogue he was waiting for. After a career on Wall Street, Bannon spent years failing as a film producer; then, radicalized as a rightwinger, he announced his ambition to become \u201cthe Leni Riefenstahl of the GOP\u201d. Promoting his dreadful documentary in 2011 on Sarah Palin, The Undefeated, he said, \u201cPeople have said I\u2019m like Leni Riefenstahl.\u201d Riefenstahl was the leading film-maker of the Third Reich, mistress of Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels, and auteur of Triumph of the Will, a brilliant, innovative account of Hitler\u2019s 1935 Nazi rally in Nuremberg. Bannon, who became Trump\u2019s campaign manager in 2016 and White House senior adviser, saw himself staging Trump as Riefenstahl filmed Hitler. He boasted that he asked himself, \u201cWhat would Leni Riefenstahl do?\u201d Bannon walked out of federal prison on 29 October. He still faces New York state charges of financial fraud in a scheme to fleece donors to build Trump\u2019s wall along the Mexican border. He declared that he would resume where he left off. He was on to the coup of 2024. He picked up once again on the big lie of \u201celection integrity\u201d, that the 2024 election might be stolen from Trump just like in 2020. \u201cIf people think American politics have been divisive before,\u201d said Bannon, \u201cyou haven\u2019t seen anything.\u201d Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln: A Self-Made Man, Wrestling With His Angel and All the Powers of Earth",

If British researchers are prevented from developing their research then there is a real risk their expertise will wither and the country will lose investment and scientific talent. \u201cWe are creating the opportunities to enhance animal health and welfare, reduce the burden of disease, but we are not creating the opportunity to actually manifest that in the UK \u2013 unlike many other countries, such as the US and Brazil,\u201d added Hammond. \u201cI can see a situation where we export our knowledge but end up having to import the products created from that knowledge.\u201d Prof Johnathan Napier, the science director at Rothamsted Research in Hertforshire, said that the government\u2019s enthusiasm for plants over animals could be explained \u2013 at least partly \u2013 by the fact that there were potentially many more gene-edited crops in the pipeline than gene-edited animals. \u201cOn the other hand, if you have a technology that could reduce the susceptibility of farmed animals to some pretty unpleasant diseases, why not use it?\u201d he added.",

It is hard to overstate the challenges Rishi Sunak\u2019s replacement faces, even setting aside the much-cited fact that the last new UK leader to take a party directly from losing office and back to government was Margaret Thatcher in 1979. To begin with, as Badenoch acknowledged in her victory speech which came with a warning that Tories must \u201ctell the truth\u201d to win back the trust of the voting public, opposition is just as difficult, especially after so long in government. There is a sense that quite a number of the 121 remaining Conservative MPs are still only just getting used to the sparse opposition benches and limited number of select committee places, plus the more general sense of chill after the beam of publicity and scrutiny has moved away.

As the campaign progressed, Badenoch won the backing of ever more moderate and centrist MPs and other party grandees, some of whom conceded that they were in effect doing so with their noses held, because they believed Jenrick would be so damaging and divisive.

In 2023, after a legal change, its Saudi arm, AS&amp;H Clifford Chance \u2013 a joint venture with a local firm \u2013 became one of the first foreign firms <a href=\"https://www.globallegalpost.com/news/saudi-arabia-grants-first-foreign-licences-to-trio-of-international-firms-1488123561\">approved to practise law.</a></p> <p>Only last month, it was named Saudi law firm of the year at a glitzy awards ceremony in Dubai.</p> <p>Now the firm\u2019s long-running links to the Saudi regime are facing scrutiny after it was commissioned to produce an \u201cindependent\u201d assessment of Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record as part of the country\u2019s bid to host the 2034 Fifa World Cup \u2013 a report that has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/31/saudi-arabia-football-world-cup-bid-report-asandh-clifford-chance-fifa-2034-rights-groups\">roundly condemned as a \u201cwhitewash\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The <em>Observer </em>understands that at least one other law firm approached to conduct the assessment refused because of reputational concerns and fears over conflicts of interest.</p> <p>But the Saudi arm of Clifford Chance \u2013 whose recent work also includes overseeing a multibillion-pound football stadium deal for two clubs in the Saudi Pro League \u2013 agreed. The appointment is understood to have been signed off by Fifa, world football\u2019s governing body.</p> <p>Required as part of Fifa\u2019s bidding process, the assessment was supposed to give an independent and unbiased picture of the human rights context in the kingdom. UN guiding principles, which Fifa <a href=\"https://inside.fifa.com/social-impact/human-rights\">says it abides by</a>, say such assessments should \u201cinclude all internationally recognised human rights as a reference point\u201d.</p>    <p>But documents seen by the <em>Observer </em>show that AS&amp;H Clifford Chance agreed to severely limit the scope of its report after a request from the Saudi Arabian Football Federation (Saff), which again was approved by Fifa.</p> <p>The restrictions mean the report only looked at human rights that are recognised in Saudi Arabia \u2013 rather than those recognised globally \u2013 and were considered relevant by the Saudi football federation.</p> <p>Across 39 pages, there is no mention of discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in Saudi Arabia, the criminalisation of same-sex sexual activity, controls on freedom of expression and the prohibition of trade unions or forced evictions, such as during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/04/its-being-built-on-our-blood-the-true-cost-of-saudi-arabia-5bn-mega-city-neom\">construction of the mega-city Neom</a>. In the methodology notes for the report, AS&amp;H Clifford Chance says the scope was \u201cdetermined by Saff in agreement with Fifa\u201d. The notes also reveal the review was completed after only six weeks of desk work and relied solely on interviews with government ministries. Human rights groups and those affected by alleged abuses, such as migrant workers, were not consulted.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/10/saudi-arabia-fifa-organizations-demand-a-credible-human-rights-assessment-for-2034-world-cup-bid/\">Last week, a coalition of 11 human rights organisations</a> attacked the report as \u201cfatally flawed\u201d, claiming it dramatically downplayed the \u201csevere risk\u201d of hosting the World Cup in Saudi Arabia. Julia Legner, executive director of ALQST for Human Rights, a Saudi Arabian diaspora organisation, said it gave an \u201cartificially limited, misleading and overly positive perspective\u201d, while James Lynch of FairSquare, a nonprofit advocacy group, called it a \u201cwhitewash\u201d.</p> <p>Lynch said it was \u201cunthinkably bad\u201d and \u201cgenuinely bizarre\u201d that Clifford Chance \u2013 renowned for its human rights practice in the UK \u2013 would disregard international standards to agree to parameters set by the Saudi football federation. Its failure to consult external stakeholders was \u201ccompletely wild\u201d, he added.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a departure from standard practice,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might say: \u2018Look, we didn\u2019t have enough time.\u2019 But that\u2019s not OK. Either don\u2019t take it, or don\u2019t call it an independent human rights assessment \u2013 because it\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>The firm is also accused of cherrypicking comments from UN bodies, leaving out the most damning findings, such as those about women and girls facing criminal proceedings if they press charges in sexual abuse cases. No reports by UN special rapporteurs are included and there is no mention of the murder of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi, nor the Ritz-Carlton purge.</p> <p>Steve Cockburn, head of labour rights and sport at Amnesty International, said: \u201cIt is incredible that AS&amp;H Clifford Chance omitted such glaring risks from its assessment and scandalous that Fifa paved the way for them to do so.\u201d</p> <p>The controversy over the report, which was first published by Fifa in July but received little attention, has caused turmoil at Clifford Chance\u2019s Canary Wharf HQ.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/28/saudi-arabia-world-cup-2034-qatar-fifa-neom\">Saudi Arabia\u2019s World Cup bid gathers pace \u2013 but at what cost to human life? | Nick Ames</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The firm is known for its pro bono and human rights work, and one of its partners co-chairs the Business and Human Rights Lawyers Association.

Seven years on from the infamous purge at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh, Clifford Chance \u2013 whose global revenues rose 9% to \u00a32.3bn in the last financial year \u2013 has expanded in Saudi Arabia to become an \u201cunrivalled legal powerhouse\u201d, according to its website. It boasts large government clients, including key ministries and the sovereign public investment fund. In 2023, after a legal change, its Saudi arm, AS&amp;H Clifford Chance \u2013 a joint venture with a local firm \u2013 became one of the first foreign firms approved to practise law. Only last month, it was named Saudi law firm of the year at a glitzy awards ceremony in Dubai. Now the firm\u2019s long-running links to the Saudi regime are facing scrutiny after it was commissioned to produce an \u201cindependent\u201d assessment of Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record as part of the country\u2019s bid to host the 2034 Fifa World Cup \u2013 a report that has been roundly condemned as a \u201cwhitewash\u201d. The Observer understands that at least one other law firm approached to conduct the assessment refused because of reputational concerns and fears over conflicts of interest. But the Saudi arm of Clifford Chance \u2013 whose recent work also includes overseeing a multibillion-pound football stadium deal for two clubs in the Saudi Pro League \u2013 agreed. The appointment is understood to have been signed off by Fifa, world football\u2019s governing body. Required as part of Fifa\u2019s bidding process, the assessment was supposed to give an independent and unbiased picture of the human rights context in the kingdom. UN guiding principles, which Fifa says it abides by, say such assessments should \u201cinclude all internationally recognised human rights as a reference point\u201d. But documents seen by the Observer show that AS&amp;H Clifford Chance agreed to severely limit the scope of its report after a request from the Saudi Arabian Football Federation (Saff), which again was approved by Fifa. The restrictions mean the report only looked at human rights that are recognised in Saudi Arabia \u2013 rather than those recognised globally \u2013 and were considered relevant by the Saudi football federation. Across 39 pages, there is no mention of discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in Saudi Arabia, the criminalisation of same-sex sexual activity, controls on freedom of expression and the prohibition of trade unions or forced evictions, such as during construction of the mega-city Neom. In the methodology notes for the report, AS&amp;H Clifford Chance says the scope was \u201cdetermined by Saff in agreement with Fifa\u201d. The notes also reveal the review was completed after only six weeks of desk work and relied solely on interviews with government ministries. Human rights groups and those affected by alleged abuses, such as migrant workers, were not consulted. Last week, a coalition of 11 human rights organisations attacked the report as \u201cfatally flawed\u201d, claiming it dramatically downplayed the \u201csevere risk\u201d of hosting the World Cup in Saudi Arabia. Julia Legner, executive director of ALQST for Human Rights, a Saudi Arabian diaspora organisation, said it gave an \u201cartificially limited, misleading and overly positive perspective\u201d, while James Lynch of FairSquare, a nonprofit advocacy group, called it a \u201cwhitewash\u201d. Lynch said it was \u201cunthinkably bad\u201d and \u201cgenuinely bizarre\u201d that Clifford Chance \u2013 renowned for its human rights practice in the UK \u2013 would disregard international standards to agree to parameters set by the Saudi football federation. Its failure to consult external stakeholders was \u201ccompletely wild\u201d, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s such a departure from standard practice,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might say: \u2018Look, we didn\u2019t have enough time.\u2019 But that\u2019s not OK. Either don\u2019t take it, or don\u2019t call it an independent human rights assessment \u2013 because it\u2019s not.\u201d The firm is also accused of cherrypicking comments from UN bodies, leaving out the most damning findings, such as those about women and girls facing criminal proceedings if they press charges in sexual abuse cases. No reports by UN special rapporteurs are included and there is no mention of the murder of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi, nor the Ritz-Carlton purge. Steve Cockburn, head of labour rights and sport at Amnesty International, said: \u201cIt is incredible that AS&amp;H Clifford Chance omitted such glaring risks from its assessment and scandalous that Fifa paved the way for them to do so.\u201d The controversy over the report, which was first published by Fifa in July but received little attention, has caused turmoil at Clifford Chance\u2019s Canary Wharf HQ. The firm is known for its pro bono and human rights work, and one of its partners co-chairs the Business and Human Rights Lawyers Association. But according to people familiar with the assessment, key staff with relevant expertise were not consulted. \u201cIt\u2019s created an internal shitstorm,\u201d a source said. Another said: \u201cIt\u2019s a shoddy piece of work. It would have been a mistake for anyone credible to take on this task given the parameters were scoped so narrowly. Given the conditions attached, there was no way to do it in an ethical way.\u201d The revelations also risk undermining the firm\u2019s pledge to champion LGBTQ rights. In 2023, Clifford Chance was ranked as one of the world\u2019s best LGBT employers in Stonewall\u2019s global workplace equality index, which recognises organisations that have \u201ctaken steps to advance LGBT equality across their global locations\u201d. A quote from the global head of inclusion, showcased on the site, says: \u201cIt is not enough to have values, we must be champions for them and be willing to campaign for them if they are to be real.\u201dSaudi Arabia has a long record of persecuting LGBT people. While the head of its World Cup unit pledged in September that people coming for the tournament \u201cwill be respected\u201d regardless of sexuality or gender identity, sex outside marriage \u2013 including same-sex relations \u2013 is criminalised. Punishments can include death and LGBT people \u201cpractise extreme self-censorship to survive their daily lives\u201d, according to Human Right Watch. The issue is not mentioned in the World Cup report. The fallout also raises wider questions for Fifa about the integrity of Saudi Arabia\u2019s World Cup bid as a vote to confirm the kingdom as 2034 host approaches. The bid attracted controversy from the start after the Fifa council, led by the organisation\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, took steps widely seen as helping to pave the way for Saudi Arabia to succeed, including deciding to host the 2030 tournament over three continents \u2013 restricting the hosting eligibility for 2034 to Asia or Oceania. There was also a sped-up process that gave countries only 25 days to express their intent. After Saudi Arabia emerged as sole bidder, the Norwegian Football Federation attacked the process as \u201cnot transparent enough\u201d. Fifa insists that it was fair. Saudi Arabia\u2019s designation as the host nation is expected to be ratified at a Fifa congress meeting on 11 December in Zurich, where the organisation\u2019s 211 members will vote. A spokesperson for Fifa said a \u201cthorough bidding process\u201d was under way and that it would not comment until that had concluded. It declined to comment on the Clifford Chance report but said it planned to publish an evaluation of Saudi Arabia\u2019s bid, including the human rights assessment, before the congress meeting. Clifford Chance did not comment on the human rights assessment, its connections to the Saudi government or its alleged involvement in the transfer of assets in the Ritz-Carlton purge. In an email to advocacy groups last week, its global managing partner, Charles Adams, said it would be \u201cinappropriate to comment \u2026 beyond the content contained in the published report\u201d. The Saudi government was contacted for comment. It has previously dismissed claims of torture during its \u201canti-corruption\u201d purge at the Ritz-Carlton, saying they were \u201cabsolutely untrue\u201d.",

Biden, isolating with Covid at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and facing calls from all corners of his party to step aside, had reached the history-altering decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/21/joe-biden-withdraw-running-president\">end his bid</a> for re-election.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Harris <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theviewabc/reel/DA3kYW2RKp2/\">said</a> she asked the US president. \u201cBecause what a big decision.\u201d</p> <p>With Biden\u2019s endorsement, Harris, still wearing her workout clothes and hooded sweatshirt from her alma mater, Howard University, leapt into action. Time was of the essence. Over the next 10 hours, with pizza boxes littered around her, she placed 100 calls to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> whose support she would need to secure the nomination.</p> <p>By the time Harris walked into her inherited campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, to the strains of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s hard-charging anthem Freedom, her ascension seemed suddenly \u2013 and unexpectedly \u2013 inevitable.</p> <p>In the roughly 100 days since, Harris has enthralled her party, which had been all but resigned to defeat with Biden as its nominee. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/06/kamala-harris-running-mate-tim-walz\">selected</a> a running mate, the affable Minnesota governor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tim-walz\">Tim Walz</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/23/kamala-harris-democratic-nomination-convention\">accepted</a> the nomination at a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/18/democratic-national-convention-chicago\"> joy-filled </a>convention; supercharged volunteer sign-ups and on-the-ground organizing; raised a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/harris-funding-swing-state-concerns\">staggering billion dollars</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/trump-harris-debate-analysis\">dominated</a> the contest\u2019s only presidential debate against her opponent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.

The race has built to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/01/presidential-polls-latest-donald-trump-kamala-harris-election\">deadlocked finale</a>, with each of the seven battleground states \u2013 and the nation \u2013 virtually tied just days before the final votes of the 2024 election are cast. Along the way, some of that early shine has worn off. Trump has crept back in the polls. Critics have carped at the Harris campaign\u2019s traditionalism, and a perception among some that she has focused too much on Trump\u2019s threat and not offered enough of a vision of her own for Americans to be inspired by.</p> <p>On Tuesday, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/30/us-presidential-election-trump-harris-updates\">delivered</a> her last major speech of the campaign from the Ellipse in Washington, a direct appeal to the vanishingly small slice of Americans who have yet to make up their minds.</p> <p>The significance of the site, an oval-shaped park south of the White House, was twofold. It was intended as a stark reminder of the violent forces Trump inflamed from that very spot nearly four years ago, when he implored supporters to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966396848/read-trumps-jan-6-speech-a-key-part-of-impeachment-trial\">fight like hell</a>\u201d before a mob of them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-capitol-breach\">stormed</a> the US Capitol.</p> <p>And it was meant to underline the possibility of a Harris presidency.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">Get our free app</a> and sign up for election alerts</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>With the White House illuminated behind her, Harris declared: \u201cFor too long, we have been consumed with too much division, chaos and mutual distrust. And it can be easy to forget a simple truth: it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\u201d</p> <p>She cast the election as a contest between herself, a unifier with a \u201cto-do list\u201d and Trump, a \u201cpetty tyrant\u201d seeking a return to \u201cunchecked power\u201d. In 90 days, one of them would take the oath of office. \u201cKamala! Kamala!\u201d chanted the crowd, her largest to date with an estimated 75,000 people who spilled beyond the park, toward the Washington Monument.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Harris is running the shortest presidential campaign in modern US history. If she wins, she will have persuaded Americans to do something unprecedented in the country\u2019s 248-year history: elect a woman and woman of color to the presidency.</p> <p>At 18, could she have ever imagined this would be her life, Pro Football Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe asked the 60-year-old during a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu5yD3fu6A8\"> recent appearance</a> on his podcast. \u201cNever,\u201d Harris said, shaking her head. \u201cNever.\u201d</p>    <p>The daughter of an endocrinologist from India and an economist from Jamaica, Harris said an \u201cinstinct to protect\u201d propelled her career as a prosecutor, and was central to her opening pitch against Trump. From the courtroom, Harris took on \u201cpredators\u201d, \u201cfraudsters\u201d and \u201cscammers\u201d, she would begin, building to the line: \u201cSo hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump\u2019s type.\u201d</p> <p>In an election defined by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/25/us-presidential-election-trump-harris-updates\">striking gender gap</a> \u2013 with women powering Harris and men turning toward Trump \u2013 the central question may be who Americans trust to protect them \u2013 and what they believe they need protecting from.</p> <p>Harris has vowed to protect Americans\u2019 \u201cfundamental freedoms\u201d \u2013 abortion rights, clean air, decades-old alliances, and democracy itself. Trump has cast himself, by contrast, as the protector of a nation under \u201cinvasion\u201d, overrun by illegal immigration and crime.

      "bodyText": "On the second to last Sunday in July, Kamala Harris had just finished making pancakes and bacon for her grandnieces at the vice-president\u2019s residence in Washington, and was sitting down with them to work on a jigsaw puzzle when Joe Biden called. \u201cI got up to take the call, and then life changed,\u201d Harris recounted later. Biden, isolating with Covid at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and facing calls from all corners of his party to step aside, had reached the history-altering decision to end his bid for re-election. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Harris said she asked the US president. \u201cBecause what a big decision.\u201d With Biden\u2019s endorsement, Harris, still wearing her workout clothes and hooded sweatshirt from her alma mater, Howard University, leapt into action. Time was of the essence. Over the next 10 hours, with pizza boxes littered around her, she placed 100 calls to Democrats whose support she would need to secure the nomination. By the time Harris walked into her inherited campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, to the strains of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s hard-charging anthem Freedom, her ascension seemed suddenly \u2013 and unexpectedly \u2013 inevitable. In the roughly 100 days since, Harris has enthralled her party, which had been all but resigned to defeat with Biden as its nominee. She selected a running mate, the affable Minnesota governor, Tim Walz; accepted the nomination at a joy-filled convention; supercharged volunteer sign-ups and on-the-ground organizing; raised a staggering billion dollars; dominated the contest\u2019s only presidential debate against her opponent, Donald Trump. She secured endorsements from a host of his former advisers and aides, as well as several of the planet\u2019s biggest stars. She appeared on popular podcasts, daytime TV and news networks and delivered a closing argument that blended the economic and the existential anxieties driving Americans\u2019 choice in November. But has it all been enough? The race has built to a deadlocked finale, with each of the seven battleground states \u2013 and the nation \u2013 virtually tied just days before the final votes of the 2024 election are cast. Along the way, some of that early shine has worn off. Trump has crept back in the polls. Critics have carped at the Harris campaign\u2019s traditionalism, and a perception among some that she has focused too much on Trump\u2019s threat and not offered enough of a vision of her own for Americans to be inspired by. On Tuesday, she delivered her last major speech of the campaign from the Ellipse in Washington, a direct appeal to the vanishingly small slice of Americans who have yet to make up their minds. The significance of the site, an oval-shaped park south of the White House, was twofold. It was intended as a stark reminder of the violent forces Trump inflamed from that very spot nearly four years ago, when he implored supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d before a mob of them stormed the US Capitol. And it was meant to underline the possibility of a Harris presidency. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts With the White House illuminated behind her, Harris declared: \u201cFor too long, we have been consumed with too much division, chaos and mutual distrust. And it can be easy to forget a simple truth: it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\u201d She cast the election as a contest between herself, a unifier with a \u201cto-do list\u201d and Trump, a \u201cpetty tyrant\u201d seeking a return to \u201cunchecked power\u201d. In 90 days, one of them would take the oath of office. \u201cKamala! Kamala!\u201d chanted the crowd, her largest to date with an estimated 75,000 people who spilled beyond the park, toward the Washington Monument. *** Harris is running the shortest presidential campaign in modern US history. If she wins, she will have persuaded Americans to do something unprecedented in the country\u2019s 248-year history: elect a woman and woman of color to the presidency. At 18, could she have ever imagined this would be her life, Pro Football Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe asked the 60-year-old during a recent appearance on his podcast. \u201cNever,\u201d Harris said, shaking her head. \u201cNever.\u201d The daughter of an endocrinologist from India and an economist from Jamaica, Harris said an \u201cinstinct to protect\u201d propelled her career as a prosecutor, and was central to her opening pitch against Trump. From the courtroom, Harris took on \u201cpredators\u201d, \u201cfraudsters\u201d and \u201cscammers\u201d, she would begin, building to the line: \u201cSo hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump\u2019s type.\u201d In an election defined by a striking gender gap \u2013 with women powering Harris and men turning toward Trump \u2013 the central question may be who Americans trust to protect them \u2013 and what they believe they need protecting from. Harris has vowed to protect Americans\u2019 \u201cfundamental freedoms\u201d \u2013 abortion rights, clean air, decades-old alliances, and democracy itself. Trump has cast himself, by contrast, as the protector of a nation under \u201cinvasion\u201d, overrun by illegal immigration and crime. At a recent rally, he crassly suggested he would protect women, whether they \u201clike it or not\u201d. Harris\u2019s critics \u2013 even those who will begrudgingly vote for her \u2013 knock her as a maddeningly scripted politician who lacks an ideological core and who has struggled to articulate a serious policy agenda. At a CNN town hall, she hewed closely to a set of talking points, offering circular responses to pointed questions. And yet, during the 80-minute segment, she delivered her most forceful warning about Trump\u2019s authoritarian tendencies. Yes, she agreed, her opponent was a fascist. Harris has waved off any criticism, calling herself disciplined. At a rally with Harris, Michelle Obama defended her further by suggesting critics were holding the nation\u2019s first female and first Black vice-president to a \u201chigher standard\u201d than Trump, who often rambles incoherently, had threatened to jail his political opponents, and would be the first convicted felon elected to the White House if he wins. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll forgive me if I\u2019m a little frustrated that some of us are choosing to ignore Donald Trump\u2019s gross incompetence while asking Kamala to dazzle us at every turn,\u201d Obama said in Kalamazoo, Michigan. \u201cPreach!\u201d a woman shouted from the audience. Over the course of her abbreviated campaign, Harris has laid out a broad strokes economic agenda with proposals for first-time homebuyers, caregivers, new parents, and the \u201csandwich\u201d generation of adults caring for their children and their parents. She has, meanwhile, backed away from her past support for progressives policies on immigration and fracking, which helped fuel the San Francisco liberal caricature, though it never quite suited the former \u201ctop cop\u201d of California. Drawing on support from anti-Trump Republicans, she has vowed to put a Republican in her cabinet, and insisted she would be a president for \u201call Americans\u201d, including Trump\u2019s supporters. Along the way, many stars have aligned for her. Oprah sang her praise \u2013 \u201cKamaaaaala\u201d \u2013 in a DNC speech. Taylor Swift endorsed Harris after her debate performance against Trump. Beyonc\u00e9 embraced Harris at an abortion-rights focused event in Texas. Bad Bunny urged support for her after a shock jock disparaged Puerto Rico as an \u201cisland of garbage\u201d at a Trump rally. She has also won support from the billionaire Mark Cuban, who has traveled the country making the case that Harris would be better for business than the man who made his name as a Manhattan builder. Tory Gavito, the president of Way to Win, a hub for liberal donors and organizers, likened Harris\u2019s dizzying \u201ceverything, everywhere, all at once\u201d campaign to the Wizard of Oz. The vice-president was thrust to the forefront of American politics and quickly assembled an unlikely coalition that includes gen Z meme-makers and the former Republican vice-president Dick Cheney. \u201cNow here we are. This is the end of the road,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine it having been done any other way.\u201d *** Although Harris has served as the vice-president for nearly four years, she nevertheless arrived at the top of the Democratic ticket relatively unknown. But in stark reversal of fortunes, she defied skeptics of her political skill, and her popularity soared. \u201cShe has not put a foot wrong,\u201d said Paul Begala, a veteran Democratic strategist and former adviser to Bill Clinton. If he had to identify a misstep, it would be during an appearance on ABC\u2019s The View, where, when asked how she would distinguish herself from Biden, Harris responded: \u201cNot a thing that comes to mind.\u201d The Trump campaign seized on the line, tying Harris to the unpopular president. Begala marveled at the way Harris has \u201csquared the circle\u201d between Democrats who believed her closing message should be centered around Trump\u2019s threats to democracy \u2013 as the party did in the 2022 midterms when they blunted the anticipated red wave \u2013 and those who argued she should conclude with an economic-focused message, highlighting Americans\u2019 top voting issue.

Since the supreme court overturned Roe in 2022, Harris has been a powerful messenger on abortion rights, framing it as a matter of bodily autonomy. On the campaign trail, she has been joined by women whose lives have been put a risk by their state\u2019s abortion bans, as well as by the family of Amber Thurman, the 28-year-old mother from Georgia who died of sepsis in 2022 after being denied timely medical care to treat a medication abortion. \u201cWe need to make sure that we know who is responsible for those deaths, and that is Donald Trump, his supreme court, and all of the Maga Republicans who have voted for legislation up and down the ballot across the country,\u201d said Silvina Alarc\u00f3n, political director at Reproductive Freedom for All. Harris has also had to navigate, as she has her entire career, a torrent of racist and sexist abuse, including from her opponent, who has insulted her intelligence, calling her \u201cdumb as a rock\u201d and an \u201cextremely low IQ person\u201d. During a live interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists, Trump attacked her racial identity and asked when she \u201chappened to turn Black\u201d. The remark drew gasps in the room. Christina Reynolds, a senior vice-president of communications for Emily\u2019s List, the influential political group that backs female candidates who support abortion rights, said Harris has faced all of the obstacles that have long burdened women, and especially women of color, who seek high political office. But she has also helped blaze her own trail, demonstrating leadership as the vice-president. \u201cShe\u2019s had to stack up to the division and hate and lies, while building the plane,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cI think that when she wins, it will be historic and epic and truly a testament to her and the people around her and the work that they\u2019ve done.\u201d *** Support for Harris has slightly fallen as the Trump campaign sharpened its attacks. Looming over a race that appears to be teetering on a razor\u2019s edge is whether Harris can stitch together her own diverse coalition, similar to the one that elevated Biden in 2020, while polls show Trump making inroads with voters of color and young people, especially men. Democrats are closely watching places such as Dearborn, Michigan, where Democratic emissaries from Barack Obama and the independent senator Bernie Sanders are working to stave off a mass defection of Arab and Muslim American voters furious at the administration over the deadly war in Gaza. At nearly every stop, Harris is heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters, many of whom have said they plan to vote for a third party candidate or not at all. John Zogby, an author and pollster who studies the Arab American electorate, said the scale of the devastation in Gaza and now Lebanon, and the depth of these voters\u2019 discontent, have reached a \u201cpoint of almost no return\u201d. \u201cIt really is different this time,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>Max Ayres has a hole in his head. Well, his self-portrait does. He\u2019d like to fix it, but there\u2019s a great big gash in the canvas. As he steps into his living room, the corner of the ceiling droops down in a great triangle. The walls around him are black. He faces another self-portrait where flames have stripped away his entire body. Each wall of his modest council flat is covered with paintings \u2013 self-portraits, still lifes, some stored, some hung. Ayres has more than 1,000 in total \u2013 and most are now burnt.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to say the phrase \u2018got on like a house on fire\u2019 any more,\u201d he tells me. He was relocated in February after his flat caught fire while he was in hospital, yet in late September with the threat of autumn looming, he\u2019s still there. \u201cThis is supposed to be temporary,\u201d he says, as he shows me around, \u201cbut it\u2019s not temporary enough. It\u2019s an insult to buildings.\u201d</p> <p>Ayres has never \u201cmade it\u201d as an artist. Probably because he refuses to make any money from his works. \u201cNever sold a painting,\u201d he says unashamedly. \u201cYou don\u2019t make money out of a natural ability. I don\u2019t do it for money; I do it for art and for people. And, if I started making money, I\u2019d have to register for income tax.\u201d</p>    <p>The blaze made quick work of the art stored in Ayres\u2019s flat: paintbrushes burned like dry straw, oil paintings melted to the walls. The results are shocking, like accidental works of Francis Bacon or details from Goya\u2019s black paintings. One self-portrait leaves Ayres unrecognisable as it oozes with black bubbles, others have their canvases cracked and broken from the scorching heat of the fire. </p> <p>Art first entered Ayres\u2019s life at the age of eight after he walked into a field with a sketchpad and pen and drew his neighbour\u2019s goats. He never moved away from his home town of Leigh, Greater Manchester, and never formally trained. At 72, he has never been abroad, never married and never stopped painting.</p> <p>A life of bad luck has seemed to follow Ayres. His childhood was afflicted by measles, chickenpox and earaches so bad that he\u2019d \u201cscream his head off\u201d. He says he \u201cdidn\u2019t have many friends\u201d, though he recalls one acquaintance, David, and how they\u2019d study the moon with a telescope in his back garden. He remembers David asking if people might ever walk on the moon? \u201cOf course not,\u201d Ayres replied, \u201cit\u2019s simply not possible.\u201d</p>    <p>In the 90s, he was kicked out of a library performance of Beethoven by an \u201cignorant sod\u201d of a porter because he was still covered in paint from his work hours earlier. In 2003, the local press quoted him as being \u201clivid\u201d after Leigh Infirmary binned four paintings he\u2019d donated \u2013 and lost 16 others. But all of these events pale in comparison with the death of his father, Joseph Ayres, when Max was just 13 \u2013 a topic he avoids if he can help it. Joseph was a master builder and member of the Royal Engineers. Ayres speaks of his father fondly, and a framed portrait of him sits by his television \u2013 the only family picture on display.</p> <p>A 1992 Manchester Evening News interview tells of how Joseph\u2019s death led to a \u201cprofound depression\u201d that lingered until Ayres was 28, despite years of psychiatric treatment. He has suffered with intestinal problems from an early age, meaning he \u201cdidn\u2019t have the physical resilience to do a job\u201d \u2013 though he recounts one stint at the now-defunct Lennon\u2019s supermarket chain. During a shift he divulged he was an artist to a co-worker, who responded by smacking Ayres\u2019s knuckles until they were swollen before declaring: \u201cSee if you can paint after that!\u201d</p> <p>Ayres did paint after that, and in abundance. \u201cHaphazard and casual\u201d is how he describes his output. He may not have had a career, but his work ethic is something to behold. During his younger years he spent countless hours outdoors, painting the many mills and pits across historical Lancashire. His health left him in agony for days at a time, but he\u2019d still relentlessly march out and paint the region\u2019s doomed industrial buildings, capturing them before diggers and men in hi-vis jackets took them apart. </p> <p>You get the sense Ayres sees his industrial paintings as his true life\u2019s work. Sitting in his armchair, surrounded by brushes and tobacco smoke, he waxes lyrical for some time about the Mayor and Mayoress, two sleeping giant engines that he\u2019d like to paint one day, housed in the renovated Spinners Mill nearby. Cruelly, he was supposed to exhibit his collection there a month before the fire.</p>    <p>\u201cI always wanted to achieve more,\u201d he says. \u201cI always felt I\u2019d underachieved. Because I never learned to drive, I was reliant on other people. I would\u2019ve liked to have gone to the industrial places, but that wasn\u2019t their idea of a holiday.\u201d He had to stop painting industrial buildings in 2013 when he became house-bound. Unable to explore the outside world, he turned to painting himself and the shopping his carers brought him.</p> <p>Back in December of last year, Ayres found himself stuck in his bathroom, stricken with extreme pneumonia. \u201cI probably would\u2019ve died,\u201d he says. His carers had him sent to hospital and not long later he got the call about the fire.</p> <p>\u201cI was numbed,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first thing I thought was that I wished they could get me down there so I could do something practical. But you\u2019re stuck in hospital and they treat you like you don\u2019t have a life outside.\u201d He was told someone would give him a lift to the flat so he could assess the damage, but they never showed up.</p> <p>Strangely, Ayres doesn\u2019t feel that lucky that he wasn\u2019t there. \u201cIf I\u2019d have been, I probably would have phoned 999 and got some wet towels, gone to the mains and switched the electric off. I want to be productive, rational.\u201d</p>    <p>There has been interest in displaying his portraits, burns and all, but a reluctance hangs over Ayres. Local gallery coordinator Angie Ryan \u2013 who\u2019d planned the Spinners show \u2013 attempted to raise funds for some of the gigantic collection to be restored, but restoration is laborious and expensive.

      "body": "<p>Shopping centres across the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/19/demise-uk-shopping-centre-bolton-crompton-place\">have declined in recent years</a>, as store closures and online shopping change consumer habits for good.</p> <p>According to a report by the property consultancy Lambert Smith Hampton, about 60 of the UK\u2019s 500 bigger shopping centres are likely to be razed, and a further 200 could be partially demolished.</p> <p>Here, four people describe how their local shopping centres have changed, the impact on communities, and what the future looks like.</p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s a shadow of what it was\u2019</h2>    <p>\u201cThings have changed immeasurably since I was a child,\u201d said 74-year-old Gordon Jackson from Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester. \u201cMerseyway shopping centre has become a wasteland of empty shops, which is so sad to see. A cinema complex was built in 2017 to help revive it and it <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/05/soulless-leisure-shed-redrock-stockport-wins-carbuncle-cup\">won the Carbuncle Cup</a> for being hideous.</p> <p>\u201cI remember the market area that existed before the shopping centre [built in the 1960s]. It was where everyone went to do their shopping and it was very much alive. When I was about five or six, Saturday was shopping day so we\u2019d go to the market area and greet people we knew. One memory is of the Co-op \u2013 every time my mother bought something she would give her \u2018divi\u2019 [dividend] number and she\u2019d get a small strip of yellow paper telling her how much she\u2019d spent. When divi day came around [when profits were shared among members], you would get money back and my mum would use it to buy my school uniform. I\u2019d also get a cup of Horlicks as a treat.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson, a retired college lecturer, believes online shopping, higher business rates and rents, and electricity and heating costs have left businesses struggling to stay open. \u201cPeople don\u2019t meet as a community as they used to \u2013 it\u2019s so expensive to do things like go to the cinema that they stay at home.</p> <p>\u201cThe area is part of a regeneration project by the council, which I hope will help, but it\u2019s a shadow of what it was.\u201d</p>    <h2>\u2018Everybody would watch the mechanical clock\u2019</h2> <p>Joanne Harris, 53, a retired teacher from Rawtenstall in Lancashire, regularly visited the once busy Accrington Arndale Centre after it opened in 1987.</p> <p>\u201cI remember it opening when I was about 16. I used to have a Saturday job as a childminder when I was at school. I looked after a little girl and we used to go every weekend. We\u2019d stop to look at a beautiful mechanical clock, which would play the tune of Rock Around the Clock on the hour. We had Marks and Spencer, Woolworths, Dorothy Perkins, New Look, Stationery Box, and so on. The centre is small and some of the shops were a bit rubbish, but it was bustling.\u201d</p> <p>Over the years, however, it declined. \u201cThey built a dual carriageway around 1990 and pedestrianised the centre. I think that\u2019s when it started going downhill as people started bypassing the town.\u201d</p> <p>Shops started closing and the clock <a href=\"https://www.lancs.live/news/local-news/its-high-time-the-world-clock-1272643\">was removed in 2004</a> after falling into disrepair. \u201cOnce the clock and M&amp;S went, it started to lose its appeal. The car park used to be free, too, now you have to pay. Nowadays I mostly go to Accrington to see my friend who\u2019s got a cafe \u2013 and that\u2019s all there is there. Cafes, nail bars, sun bed salons, hairdressers, and charity shops.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I see something and think it might be cheaper online\u2019</h2>    <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re doing better than other city centres,\u201d said software developer Phillip Darlington describing Nottingham, where he lives.</p> <p>Of the two shopping centres he remembers, Victoria shopping centre still stands, while Broad Marsh shopping centre was closed and transformed into a <a href=\"https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/nottingham-broad-marsh-park-opens-9530370\">new public green space</a> as part of development of the area.</p> <p>\u201cThe city has always featured in my interest in shopping since 1988. When I was 11, I came on a day trip from Telford and the highlight was going to Jessops (now John Lewis) due to its Lego department. In 1996, when I settled in the city, it had no less than five department stores plus large stores of now defunct chains such as C&amp;A, BHS and Littlewoods.

      "bodyText": "Shopping centres across the UK have declined in recent years, as store closures and online shopping change consumer habits for good. According to a report by the property consultancy Lambert Smith Hampton, about 60 of the UK\u2019s 500 bigger shopping centres are likely to be razed, and a further 200 could be partially demolished. Here, four people describe how their local shopping centres have changed, the impact on communities, and what the future looks like. \u2018It\u2019s a shadow of what it was\u2019 \u201cThings have changed immeasurably since I was a child,\u201d said 74-year-old Gordon Jackson from Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester. \u201cMerseyway shopping centre has become a wasteland of empty shops, which is so sad to see. A cinema complex was built in 2017 to help revive it and it won the Carbuncle Cup for being hideous. \u201cI remember the market area that existed before the shopping centre [built in the 1960s]. It was where everyone went to do their shopping and it was very much alive. When I was about five or six, Saturday was shopping day so we\u2019d go to the market area and greet people we knew. One memory is of the Co-op \u2013 every time my mother bought something she would give her \u2018divi\u2019 [dividend] number and she\u2019d get a small strip of yellow paper telling her how much she\u2019d spent. When divi day came around [when profits were shared among members], you would get money back and my mum would use it to buy my school uniform. I\u2019d also get a cup of Horlicks as a treat.\u201d Jackson, a retired college lecturer, believes online shopping, higher business rates and rents, and electricity and heating costs have left businesses struggling to stay open. \u201cPeople don\u2019t meet as a community as they used to \u2013 it\u2019s so expensive to do things like go to the cinema that they stay at home. \u201cThe area is part of a regeneration project by the council, which I hope will help, but it\u2019s a shadow of what it was.\u201d \u2018Everybody would watch the mechanical clock\u2019 Joanne Harris, 53, a retired teacher from Rawtenstall in Lancashire, regularly visited the once busy Accrington Arndale Centre after it opened in 1987. \u201cI remember it opening when I was about 16. I used to have a Saturday job as a childminder when I was at school. I looked after a little girl and we used to go every weekend. We\u2019d stop to look at a beautiful mechanical clock, which would play the tune of Rock Around the Clock on the hour. We had Marks and Spencer, Woolworths, Dorothy Perkins, New Look, Stationery Box, and so on. The centre is small and some of the shops were a bit rubbish, but it was bustling.\u201d Over the years, however, it declined. \u201cThey built a dual carriageway around 1990 and pedestrianised the centre. I think that\u2019s when it started going downhill as people started bypassing the town.\u201d Shops started closing and the clock was removed in 2004 after falling into disrepair. \u201cOnce the clock and M&amp;S went, it started to lose its appeal. The car park used to be free, too, now you have to pay. Nowadays I mostly go to Accrington to see my friend who\u2019s got a cafe \u2013 and that\u2019s all there is there. Cafes, nail bars, sun bed salons, hairdressers, and charity shops.\u201d \u2018I see something and think it might be cheaper online\u2019 \u201cI think we\u2019re doing better than other city centres,\u201d said software developer Phillip Darlington describing Nottingham, where he lives. Of the two shopping centres he remembers, Victoria shopping centre still stands, while Broad Marsh shopping centre was closed and transformed into a new public green space as part of development of the area. \u201cThe city has always featured in my interest in shopping since 1988. When I was 11, I came on a day trip from Telford and the highlight was going to Jessops (now John Lewis) due to its Lego department. In 1996, when I settled in the city, it had no less than five department stores plus large stores of now defunct chains such as C&amp;A, BHS and Littlewoods. It was really quite vibrant. \u201cNottingham appeared to hit the buffers in the 2010s with the Victoria centre looking worn and Broad Marsh emptying, with promises of an amazing new centre around the corner, which never came. Victoria shopping centre is still going strong and there\u2019s a nearby complex including a cinema, retro arcade, and golf.\u201d Darlington, 49, prefers to buy clothes online but still goes in once a month. \u201cI still like to go into the shops \u2013 albeit window shopping. I often see something and think it might be cheaper online. \u2018I want to be introduced to something different\u2019 For Joan, 33, Centre:MK in Milton Keynes is becoming a graveyard of high street chains that have gone under. \u201cWhen I shopped there in the 2000s as a teen, I remember only chains could really afford a space and there were very few independent retailers \u2013 but there would be more variety. \u201cThe struggle for retail stores to survive since the financial crash in 2008 can be seen in real time with the shopping centre,\u201d said the finance worker, who is from the Buckinghamshire city. \u201cStores are set up, trade for maybe two or three years, before they are inevitably shut down. As time has gone on, and this has become more apparent since 2020, fewer units are being filled, and the space each unit has is becoming smaller as retailers are unable to afford to pay the rent on larger units.\u201d Joan feels the lack of seating areas in open spaces is a part of why people don\u2019t use shopping centres. \u201cMy friends and I would meet and sit by the fountain but that\u2019s gone now. \u201cI tend to shop more online now as it\u2019s easier to locate independent retailers via Instagram and Etsy,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t even have to buy new, apps like Vinted have given me access to a lot of unique affordable finds that the shopping centre wouldn\u2019t be able to offer. \u201cAlternatively, if I do go out shopping \u2018in person\u2019 I do this in London, Oxford, or Cambridge.

Human rights researchers have said that the shootings fit a pattern of opposition politicians, journalists, activists and lawyers being killed and no one being brought to justice. \u201cIt\u2019s premature to say whether or not there are any clues [as to who the killers are],\u201d said Hil\u00e1rio Lole, spokesperson for the National Criminal Investigation Service, which is investigating the case. Ant\u00f3nio Niquice, a member of Frelimo\u2019s central committee, said he was shocked by the shootings and called on the judiciary to hold the killers accountable. Plain clothes policemen also allegedly shot at Mondlane as he held a press conference on 21October at the site where Dias and Guambe were killed. \u201cThey started firing real bullets directly at\u2026 Ven\u00e2ncio,\u201d said Amade Ali, a 30-year-old who was acting as one of Mondlane\u2019s bodyguards. \u201cWe started running to the car [and I] suddenly got hit by a real bullet, not a rubber one,\u201d he said, indicating that a bullet had hit his right cheekbone.For those mourning Jeremias, their grief has merged with calls for political change. Last Tuesday, as mourners wept over his coffin, wearing white t-shirts bearing his face and holding up his photo. They shouted out, calling for justice and democracy. In footage broadcast by STV, a local TV station, two young women held up paper signs in Portuguese that read: \u201cYou can kill me but don\u2019t kill democracy.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Eduardo Crespo\u2019s sensitive documentary follows a cohort of boys at an Argentina agro-technical boarding school called Las Delicias (The Delights), and makes magic out of the mundane. On the surface, the students\u2019 day-to-day rituals in the countryside appear quite ordinary. After getting up from their bunk beds, they go to classes or tend the crops on campus. In their downtime, they play video games or hang out with their peers. And yet, it is these quiet moments of adolescent togetherness that are the most revelatory. Here is a film about the unseen intimacies between boys, and how they learn to interact with the world at large.</p> <p>Many of the pupils come to Las Delicias with an interest in agriculture, while others are looking for rehabilitation after being expelled from other schools. Like a friend, the camera stays close to the youngsters, but doesn\u2019t dwell extensively on any single individual, lingering instead on vignettes of growing pains and childlike wonder. One moment, a boy frets in the doctor\u2019s office about a sore throat; the next we see another pupil sweetly looking after a fallen bird. The recurring mention of a missing phone along with the teachers\u2019 gentle pleas for the responsible party to step forward also lends the piece a dose of drama \u2013 with a very moving conclusion.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uvzmkCDdB4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0uvzmkCDdB4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Perhaps due to its 65-minute runtime, Crespo\u2019s film barely digs into how Las Delicias operates as a school. For instance, we occasionally see female students on school grounds, yet it remains unclear if this institution is co-ed. Nevertheless, the depiction of boys\u2019 inner lives remains a striking one. As one crop of pupils graduates, a new group arrives, a touching bookend that embodies the circular nature of youth itself.</p> <p>\u2022 The Delights is on True Story from 1 November.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eduardo Crespo\u2019s sensitive documentary follows a cohort of boys at an Argentina agro-technical boarding school called Las Delicias (The Delights), and makes magic out of the mundane. On the surface, the students\u2019 day-to-day rituals in the countryside appear quite ordinary. After getting up from their bunk beds, they go to classes or tend the crops on campus. In their downtime, they play video games or hang out with their peers. And yet, it is these quiet moments of adolescent togetherness that are the most revelatory. Here is a film about the unseen intimacies between boys, and how they learn to interact with the world at large. Many of the pupils come to Las Delicias with an interest in agriculture, while others are looking for rehabilitation after being expelled from other schools. Like a friend, the camera stays close to the youngsters, but doesn\u2019t dwell extensively on any single individual, lingering instead on vignettes of growing pains and childlike wonder. One moment, a boy frets in the doctor\u2019s office about a sore throat; the next we see another pupil sweetly looking after a fallen bird. The recurring mention of a missing phone along with the teachers\u2019 gentle pleas for the responsible party to step forward also lends the piece a dose of drama \u2013 with a very moving conclusion. Perhaps due to its 65-minute runtime, Crespo\u2019s film barely digs into how Las Delicias operates as a school. For instance, we occasionally see female students on school grounds, yet it remains unclear if this institution is co-ed. Nevertheless, the depiction of boys\u2019 inner lives remains a striking one. As one crop of pupils graduates, a new group arrives, a touching bookend that embodies the circular nature of youth itself. \u2022 The Delights is on True Story from 1 November.",

Growing up on the Aylesbury estate in Peckham, London, before moving to Plumstead, Tempah broke into the mainstream in 2010. With songs such as Frisky, Written in the Stars and Not Letting Go, he won two Brit awards, while Pass Out became his first of seven No 1 singles, the most by any UK rap artist.

We&nbsp;were visiting cousins in West Palm&nbsp;Beach, Florida. As a family from a&nbsp;humble background, our parents worked really hard to get us out there. That summer felt like a pretty big deal.</p> <p>Even though there\u2019s a six-year age gap, Kelvin and I have always been really close. Along with our two sisters, we were raised with a lot of love. Saying that, we were probably annoying each other in this photo. I&nbsp;couldn\u2019t swim at the time and, being from inner-city London, I hadn\u2019t experienced many coastlines before. While I was excited about going in the water, as soon as I realised it wasn\u2019t bath temperature, I got the shock of my life. Hence the expression.</p> <p>As the oldest brother, I was raised quite differently from Kelvin \u2013 there was an expectation that I would set a&nbsp;good example to the rest of my siblings. Meanwhile, Kelvin had a softer time. He was, and still is, charismatic and energetic. We have a&nbsp;lot of similar traits, too \u2013 he is very loving and quite hard on himself, which I definitely am.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>My parents wanted me to pursue a safe career, to become a doctor or\u00a0a\u00a0lawyer. I\u00a0knew if I believed in anything hard enough, I could prove them wrong</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I don\u2019t want to take all the credit, but when it came to cultural taste, a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;of mine and Kelvin\u2019s shared passions growing up came from whatever I was into. I was listening to&nbsp;UK garage and American hip\u2011hop, and, while we\u2019ve never made a track together, sometimes me and Kelvin would go back to back or spit some bars. Wrestling was another of my&nbsp;obsessions, and I would try out a&nbsp;few moves on my little brother.</p> <p>Back when this photo was taken, I&nbsp;was just a young dreamer who was starting to manifest what he wanted his future to look like. My goal was clear: \u201cRight now we are living on a&nbsp;council estate in Peckham, but eventually we\u2019re going to get out. I\u2019ll&nbsp;have my own house, and I\u2019m going to travel the world!\u201d While rapping started as a hobby, slowly it turned into a real career.</p> <p>I worked hard because I\u2019d seen how&nbsp;hard my parents worked. Mum emigrated from Nigeria to the UK in her late teens. She and Dad started over again in Britain, working multiple jobs, from human resources to social work, as well as getting educated again. My story is a testament to their survival. It set me up to dream big: I took a strand of their ambition, and ran with it.</p> <p>Because of how much they struggled, I don\u2019t think my parents understood why I was trying to do something creative and risky. They wanted me to pursue a safe, academic, linear career; to become a doctor or&nbsp;a&nbsp;lawyer. Despite their resistance, I&nbsp;knew if I believed in anything hard enough, I could prove them wrong. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/19/hamza-yassin-looks-back-i-lived-in-my-car-for-nine-months-while-i-cut-my-teeth-as-a-wildlife-cameraman\">Hamza Yassin looks back: \u2018I lived in my car for nine months while I cut my teeth as a wildlife cameraman\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2009 I got signed.

We sit down, eat lunch and talk about how we\u2019re all feeling. That\u2019s been one of the biggest changes \u2013 opening up more. We\u2019ve grown a lot spiritually, too.

      "bodyText": "Carefree menstrual pads are contaminated with toxic PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, which presents a threat to the reproductive health of women using the products, a new lawsuit filed in California state court alleges. The suit demands Carefree and its parent company, personal care product giant Edgewell, remove PFAS from the products or put a warning label on its packaging. The exposure is potentially a \u201cbig health problem\u201d, said Vineet Dubey, an attorney representing Ecological Alliance, a consumer advocacy group which brought the suit. \u201cThis is a product that has direct exposure into the bloodstream because of the way it\u2019s used and positioned on women\u2019s bodies, so this is alarming, and it\u2019s scary,\u201d Dubey said. The suit was brought under California\u2019s Proposition 65 law that requires companies to warn the state\u2019s consumers if toxic chemicals are present in products. Edgewell did not immediately respond to a request for comment. PFAS are a class of about 15,000 chemicals typically used to make products that resist water, stains and heat. They are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down, and they accumulate in humans and the environment. The chemicals are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders, birth defects and other serious health problems. There are virtually no federal limits on PFAS in consumer products despite the fact that they are widely used across the economy. Ecological Alliance tested the products and found PFOA, one of the most common and dangerous PFAS compounds. The Environmental Protection Agency this year found that virtually no level of exposure to PFOA in drinking water is safe and set a drinking water limit of 4ppt (parts per trillion). Testing found PFOA leached from the menstrual pads at about 756ppt per hour. Recent research found that skin likely absorbs PFAS at much higher rates than previously thought, raising concerns about a product that is pressed up against women\u2019s skin for hours at a time. PFOA specifically is linked to reproductive health issues like hormone disruption, low birth weight, infertility, immune system toxicity in fetuses and more. It\u2019s unclear why the chemicals are in the products. PFAS are commonly used as waterproofing agents, and it is possible the PFOA, or a chemical that breaks down into PFOA once in the environment, is intentionally added. PFAS have been detected at high levels in toilet paper and diapers. It is also possible there is unintentional contamination somewhere in the supply chain. Ecological Alliance in February filed a formal warning that it intended to sue Carefree if the company did not remove the chemicals or take action, or if the state\u2019s regulators and attorney general did not take action. No one responded to the filing. The suit asks the judge to stop the products from being sold until they\u2019re free of the chemicals. Dubey has previously sued under Proposition 65 for PFAS or other toxic chemical contamination and said companies often reformulate products or make supply chain changes to address the issue, but they do not always. \u201cI hope [Carefree] acts responsibly because of how potentially dangerous PFAS exposure is in this way, but I never put it past corporations to fight to death to do the wrong thing,\u201d he added.",

The DA\u2019s office in Jefferson parish \u2013 the word that Louisiana uses for county \u2013 pointed to a prior statement that it issued saying Gasser\u2019s guilty plea brought a measure of \u201cfinality\u201d to a case that was upended by the US supreme court\u2019s elimination of non-unanimous jury verdicts in 2020.</p> <p>Before his death at age 28 cast <a href=\"https://thelab.bleacherreport.com/joe-mcknight-life-story/\">a national spotlight</a> on Louisiana\u2019s version of a so-called \u201cstand your ground\u201d law, McKnight helped John Curtis Christian high school in Jefferson parish\u2019s River Ridge win three Louisiana state championships. He scored more than 50 touchdowns during his last two campaigns there alone, which were considered legendary among Louisiana prep sports aficionados.</p> <p>He later played college football at the University of Southern California and spent three seasons with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a> as well as one with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> before a torn achilles tendon effectively ended his playing career.</p> <p>McKnight was working at a local mental health hospital and keeping in shape for a possible football comeback when he encountered Gasser \u2013 a telecommunications contractor at the time \u2013 as both men drove on a bridge crossing the Mississippi River in New Orleans on 1 December 2016.</p> <p>Witnesses later told authorities that McKnight had been weaving in and out of traffic at high speed when he cut Gasser off. A miles-long car chase ensued, with the men exchanging expletives until they both stopped at a traffic light after getting off on a suburban roadway exit.</p> <p>McKnight got out of his car and approached Gasser\u2019s open passenger window when a pistol-wielding Gasser \u2013 from his driver\u2019s seat \u2013 shot McKnight dead.</p> <p>Authorities later charged Gasser with second-degree murder, though he maintained he had to shoot McKnight to save himself from serious physical harm or worse.

      "bodyText": "The man who shot the former NFL player Joe McKnight to death during a road rage confrontation outside New Orleans has completed his prison sentence less than eight years after the killing. Ronald Gasser\u2019s release from imprisonment quietly ended a winding legal saga that involved an overturned murder conviction and his subsequently pleading guilty to manslaughter \u2013 despite his initial claims of fatally shooting McKnight in justifiable defense of his life. Reached by telephone on Friday and asked whether he had any message to share with the public over his actions, the 62-year-old Gasser expressed his belief that \u201cthe community has moved on for the most part\u201d. \u201cThe news cycle is so fast these days \u2013 most people don\u2019t even remember this,\u201d Gasser remarked. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing.\u201d McKnight\u2019s sister, Johanna, said her family had no comment \u201cbecause it\u2019s out of our control\u201d. The district attorney\u2019s office which prosecuted Gasser also declined comment on the completion of his prison sentence. The DA\u2019s office in Jefferson parish \u2013 the word that Louisiana uses for county \u2013 pointed to a prior statement that it issued saying Gasser\u2019s guilty plea brought a measure of \u201cfinality\u201d to a case that was upended by the US supreme court\u2019s elimination of non-unanimous jury verdicts in 2020. Before his death at age 28 cast a national spotlight on Louisiana\u2019s version of a so-called \u201cstand your ground\u201d law, McKnight helped John Curtis Christian high school in Jefferson parish\u2019s River Ridge win three Louisiana state championships. He scored more than 50 touchdowns during his last two campaigns there alone, which were considered legendary among Louisiana prep sports aficionados. He later played college football at the University of Southern California and spent three seasons with the New York Jets as well as one with the Kansas City Chiefs before a torn achilles tendon effectively ended his playing career. McKnight was working at a local mental health hospital and keeping in shape for a possible football comeback when he encountered Gasser \u2013 a telecommunications contractor at the time \u2013 as both men drove on a bridge crossing the Mississippi River in New Orleans on 1 December 2016. Witnesses later told authorities that McKnight had been weaving in and out of traffic at high speed when he cut Gasser off. A miles-long car chase ensued, with the men exchanging expletives until they both stopped at a traffic light after getting off on a suburban roadway exit. McKnight got out of his car and approached Gasser\u2019s open passenger window when a pistol-wielding Gasser \u2013 from his driver\u2019s seat \u2013 shot McKnight dead. Authorities later charged Gasser with second-degree murder, though he maintained he had to shoot McKnight to save himself from serious physical harm or worse. And he received a 30-year prison sentence after jurors in January 2018 convicted him of manslaughter \u2013 essentially an unintentional but nonetheless illicit killing carried out in the heat of passion. But the jury\u2019s verdict against Gasser was only endorsed by 10 of 12 jurors. And two years later, the US supreme court ruled that such split jury verdicts were unconstitutional. Prosecutors sought to charge Gasser again with second-degree murder, but Louisiana\u2019s state supreme court prevented it. The court found that trying Gasser for murder again after jurors\u2019 decided to not convict him of that in 2018 violated the US constitution\u2019s prohibition against double jeopardy. That left Gasser ready to stand trial on a charge of manslaughter in early 2023. But in late 2022, he pleaded guilty as charged and received a 10-year sentence. Gasser had already served a substantial portion of that punishment awaiting his 2018 trial in custody as well as in prison after the conviction. He also awaited his trial in custody. Meanwhile, Gasser had the ability to shave time off his sentence by demonstrating good behavior in prison. Johanna McKnight said her family learned Gasser was done serving his prison time in July \u2013 about a year and a half after the 2022 guilty plea. Others were clued into Gasser\u2019s release from prison in October after he successfully petitioned that authorities return to him some personal belongings which had been seized from him on the day he killed McKnight. Among them was a ladder that Gasser had left in his passenger seat on the day of the slaying. Prosecutors had argued that ladder was a barrier providing Gasser additional protection against McKnight, who was unarmed that day. Information from Louisiana\u2019s department of corrections said Gasser remained under the supervision of a probation and parole office in Jefferson parish. McKnight\u2019s survivors included a son, Jaiden, who is now pursuing his own high school football career. Gasser\u2019s legal fate cut a stark contrast with that of Cardell Hayes, who in April 2016 shot the former New Orleans Saints football player Will Smith to death in an unrelated road rage confrontation in the city. By a vote of 10-2, a jury convicted Hayes of manslaughter \u2013 just 10 days after McKnight\u2019s death, in a courthouse less than 7 miles (11km) away from that crime scene. He was given 25 years in prison yet benefited from the same ruling that Gasser did. Prosecutors re-charged Hayes with manslaughter while he awaited the case\u2019s conclusion after bonding out of custody. He reportedly considered a guilty but stood a second trial in January. Ultimately, jurors unanimously found Hayes, 37, guilty of manslaughter. And in July, he was handed a sentence of a little more than 22 years in prison.",

It kind of turns me on now Eric lives in his studio in a shared, open-plan apartment, and when we first started dating over a year ago there was a problem because his room didn\u2019t have a door, or a bed \u2013 he mostly sleeps in a hammock, though there is a sofa bed. It meant I felt we had to be very careful when we had sex in case other people saw us. After a while we made a curtain, which helps. If we hear people are in the kitchen when we are having sex, we do it anyway. It kind of turns me on now. There is a 20-year age gap between us. I\u2019ve had older boyfriends before but my experience has always been that after a couple of days of having sex, the frequency really goes down. I was always the one with a bigger appetite, but I don\u2019t feel like this with Eric at all. Our libidos match. We live in different cities and I spend one week at home, and one week with Eric. We don\u2019t immediately have sex when we meet up. I need to be next to him, maybe lying in bed not talking about sexual things to help me feel connected. After that I start to crawl my fingers on his back, we kiss and that\u2019s normally a sign. We don\u2019t tend to do a lot of oral sex. I feel some shame around it. I was raised in a Catholic family so everything about sex was forbidden. I didn\u2019t have a lot of knowledge about it when I was younger, and because of that I\u2019ve never been totally into it.

Now, the ACLU hopes to make state supreme courts into what Deirdre Schifeling, its chief political and advocacy officer, calls a \u201ccounterbalance\u201d to this federal bench. \u201cWe have a plan through 2030 to work to build a more representative court,\u201d said Schifeling, who has a spreadsheet of the supreme court races that will take place across eight states for years to come. (As a non-partisan organization, the ACLU focuses on voter education and candidates\u2019 \u201ccivil rights and civil liberties\u201d records.) This cycle, the organization\u2019s messaging has centered on abortion. \u201cNationally, you\u2019re seeing polling that shows the top thing that voters are voting on is the economy. But these judges don\u2019t really influence the economy,\u201d Schifeling said. \u201cOf the issues that they can actually influence and have power over, reproductive rights is by far the most important to voters.\u201d Abortion rights supporters are testing out this strategy even in some of the United States\u2019 most anti-abortion states. In Texas, where ProPublica this week reported two women died after being denied emergency care due to the state\u2019s abortion ban, former US air force undersecretary Gina Ortiz Jones has launched the Find Out Pac, which aims to unseat three state supreme court justices. Justices Jane Bland, Jimmy Blacklock and John Devine, the Pac has declared, \u201cfucked around with our reproductive freedom\u201d in cases upholding Texas\u2019s abortion restrictions. Now, Jones wants them out. \u201cWhy would we not try to hold some folks accountable?\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis is the most direct way in which Texas voters can have their voices heard on this issue.\u201d (There is no way for citizens to initiate a ballot measure in Texas.) The Pac has been running digital ads statewide on how the Texas ban has imperiled access to medically necessary care. However, since state supreme court races have long languished in relative obscurity, voters don\u2019t always know much about them and may very well default to voting on party lines in the seven states where the ballots list the affiliations of nominees for the bench. Although the majority of Texans believe abortions should be legal in all or some cases, nearly half of Texans don\u2019t recall seeing or hearing anything about their supreme court in the last year, according to Find Out Pac\u2019s own polling. \u201cThis conversation that we\u2019re having in Texas, around the importance of judicial races, is new for us as Democrats,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the Republicans.\u201d",

Barrett described conversations round the Giuliani dinner table during the second world war. Harold Giuliani, Rudy\u2019s father, was there, rather than at the front \u2013 because he was a mob enforcer and stick-up guy who\u2019d done time in Sing Sing, and was therefore not the kind of guy Uncle Sam wanted in uniform.</p> <p>As Barrett wrote of Rudy\u2019s mom, meanwhile, \u201cThe fact that their homeland was an Axis country did not diminish Helen Giuliani\u2019s sense of patriotism. \u2018She liked Mussolini and things like that,\u2019\u201d recalled Anna, Rudy\u2019s aunt.</p> <p>There\u2019s more \u2013 though not, of course, in Giuliani\u2019s new book.

Bannon gives Giuliani a foreword. It lacks the fire and fury of past pronouncements by Trump\u2019s former White House strategist. Calling Giuliani a \u201cbrilliant lawyer\u201d, Bannon concludes: \u201cIt will be clear to any American, after reading this book, that the Biden family \u2026 and even non-blood-related close allies \u2013 are a threat to the United States.\u201d</p> <p>To repeat: Biden hasn\u2019t been a candidate for re-election for three months and more.</p> <p>Still, none of these folks are prepared to leave the stage. Four years ago, Trump pardoned Bannon on fraud and conspiracy charges. In December, Bannon will go on trial in New York, in connection with an alleged border wall scam.

      "bodyText": "Imara Jones was filming a documentary on a road trip in California when she took a break to scroll the news. A story about state lawmakers in Idaho banning transgender girls from playing on female sports teams at public schools caught her attention; it was the second anti-trans legislation that Jones had seen passed in 2020. She turned to her producer and told her that they needed to look into \u201cthis anti-trans stuff\u201d. Dozens of similar bills were introduced in statehouses throughout the nation soon after. A year later, Jones launched her podcast The Anti-Trans Hate Machine: A Plot Against Equality to look into the religious extremists, conservative political groups and billionaires pushing an anti-trans agenda. Since then, the urgency of her work has only grown. Republicans have spent more than $65m on anti-trans television ads in recent months, according to the New York Times, despite the negative impact that they have on trans people\u2019s safety and wellbeing, and scant evidence of its effectiveness in swaying voters. And in 2023 and 2024, more than 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced each year. On her podcast, Jones \u2013 a Black trans journalist and founder of the platform TransLash Media \u2013 investigates the anti-trans industry with a conversational tone, all while centering the voices and experiences of trans people. \u201cI have a belief that when you see the same thing happening in different parts of the country at the same time, that that\u2019s something to look into,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think that coincidence is always great as a fertile ground for journalism and for looking under the hood about what\u2019s going on.\u201d In the first episode of this year\u2019s season, Jones looks at how the paramilitary group Proud Boys uses anti-trans rhetoric to stoke political upheaval. Far-right militia groups have grown at unprecedented numbers in recent years, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), while political violence in general has also increased. For trans people, such rhetoric can lead to increased violence against them, as well as suicidal ideation. A recent report from the LGBTQ+ advocacy group The Trevor Project found that suicide attempts among trans and non-binary youth increased by up to 72% in states that enacted anti-trans laws. \u201cWe know that trans people overall have been facing more violence since there\u2019s been an uptick in anti-trans rhetoric in terms of hate crimes,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSo we know that there is an impact on people\u2019s safety and wellbeing solely because of the [public] conversation.\u201d Jones hopes that through her work, that the press and political leaders will begin to see anti-trans rhetoric as a serious threat to democracy and community safety. \u201cThe biggest solution is to take these attacks seriously,\u201d Jones said, \u201cto understand the way in which they are being deployed for paramilitary violence, for political violence, to destabilize communities, to undermine democratic conversations politically, to take votes away\u201d. A \u2018trans moral panic\u2019 Anti-trans ads are being deployed by the Republican party now due to the tightness of the presidential election, according to Jones. During their September debate, for instance, Trump attacked Kamala Harris\u2019s 2019 comments about her support of gender-affirming surgery for incarcerated trans people. \u201cAnti-trans issues work the best in really tight elections where the margins are really close and you\u2019re just trying to convert one or two votes per precinct, and that\u2019s enough to help you win,\u201d Jones said. Another reason why anti-trans ads are particularly salient now is because the GOP is using them to court voters who supported the Republican candidate Nikki Haley, who ran on an anti-trans platform, she added. Many of those voters are suburban women who lean Republican, but sometimes vote Democrat in local elections. Both parties are now vying for their votes. \u201cHarris is making a play for the Nikki Haley voter, and there\u2019s some indication that she is gaining enough ground to maybe get her over the top,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the type of population that would be receptive to anti-trans messages.\u201d Christian nationalists and rightwing politicians view trans people as collateral damage as they strive for political wins, according to Jones. And bundled in with anti-trans rhetoric is opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. A \u201ctrans moral panic\u201d among the far-right has led to an uptick in legislation that bans both DEI policies and trans protections, said Emerson Hodges, a research analyst for the intelligence project at the SPLC.

Billed as the inclusion of various perspectives in an argument, viewpoint diversity is problematic because it promotes \u201cthis false narrative that DEI is a threat to white Christian men\u201d, he said, \u201cand they utilize that to push these anti-trans, anti-LGBT bills\u201d.

      "body": "<p>In an era when social media has turned us all into products to promote, Keke Palmer is the whole damn corporation. As a one-woman multimedia, multiplatform conglomerate, the 31-year-old is starring in acclaimed movies (the Oscar-robbed stripper heist film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/07/hustlers-review-j-lo-strippers-candace-wu\">Hustlers</a>; Jordan Peele\u2019s 2022 sci-fi-western-horror hybrid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/20/nope-review-jordan-peele-daniel-kaluuya\">Nope</a>), releasing R&amp;B pop music (including 2020\u2019s Virgo Tendencies, Pt II), hosting gameshows (the Jimmy Fallon-produced Password on NBC), talkshows (Just Keke on BET, plus a stint on Good Morning America) and her own podcast (Baby, This Is Keke Palmer), all the while regularly serving up sassy memes to the hungry internet hordes as casually as McDonald\u2019s serves fries. It\u2019s like Keke Palmer writes in the introduction to Keke Palmer\u2019s new book Master of Me: The Secret to Controlling Your Narrative \u2013 in the diva-ish third-person, of course \u2013 Keke Palmer can do it all, honey!</p> <p>This morning, that means being in New York to record some additional dialogue on her new movie and finish the edit on a new TV show she\u2019s producing, then squeezing in some time watching Sesame Street with her 20-month-old son, Leodis, before ducking out to find a quiet spot to continue our video chat about Master of Me \u2013 which, she says, isn\u2019t a memoir exactly. \u201cI think my push-up against the word is because it feels so me, me, me,\u201d she says.</p>    <p>She\u2019s holding her cameraphone under her chin as she walks, talks and chews gum, giving a low-angle view of her oversized, square-framed glasses, sleek shoulder-length hair and baseball cap. It\u2019s a lot to juggle, but Palmer does not miss a beat as she expounds on her performance-as-public-service philosophy, in that characteristic, singsong preacher\u2019s cadence. \u201cAlthough it is about me, it\u2019s about how my stories reflect [the reader\u2019s] stories \u2026 I really wanted it to feel quite communal.\u201d</p> <p>To that end, Master of Me combines the usual stuff of celebrity autobiography \u2013 a rundown of career highs and lows, fulsome expressions of gratitude to mentors and the inside track on her personal life (namely the breakup from her son\u2019s father, Darius Jackson, that prompted an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/23/usher-keke-palmer-boyfriend-mother\">Usher diss track in his direction</a>) with a strong sense of Palmer\u2019s reader-empowerment mission. Chapter titles include Affirmations for Keke (and Anyone Else Who Needs to Hear This) and For My Entrepreneur Baddies, while each section is rounded off with a multiple-choice \u201cSelf-Assessment Exercise\u201d. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to be asking somebody to buy a book, I definitely want it to feel like this is something you\u2019re going to get a lot of use out of, y\u2019know?\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Content creation is a great thing to leverage and to diversify your portfolio \u2026 but I really was just following the creativity bug</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A multitasker, both by vocation and necessity, Palmer derived her book\u2019s title from a longer, less disparaging variation on the adage: \u201cA jack of all trades is master of none,\u201d she quotes now, having found a sofa to settle on, \u201cbut oftentimes better than a master of one!\u201d It\u2019s this last bit that resonated: \u201cNow that is the truth! Because if I\u2019m just focusing on one thing, then all my power is going to that, instead of mastering oneself, which is the hardest thing to do, but it makes you capable of more.\u201d</p> <p>If this sounds solipsistic, note that it also fits her broader analysis of economic history: \u201cThat saying was popular during the Industrial Revolution so, of course, they want you to master one particular trade, because that helps the industry. Now we\u2019re moving into a new time where it ain\u2019t about the industry; I\u2019m the industry. I am putting myself in the centre, not giving it all to one corporation.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t always this way. Palmer came up as a child performer, giving her all to two corporations in particular, Disney and Nickelodeon. Today, she describes herself, not without pride, as a graduate of \u201cthe Disney School\u201d, an informal but influential establishment that includes Selena Gomez, Ryan Gosling and Zendaya. What did she learn there? \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like vaudevillian-ish or MGM-style,\u201d she says, referencing the golden-era Hollywood studio responsible for developing Judy Garland. \u201cThey just teach you to be a multifaceted entertainer and to repurpose yourself in every way you can. Because, essentially, that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do as a company: get the biggest bang for their buck.\u201d</p> <p>Palmer was nine when she started working and just 12 when she became the main breadwinner for her family \u2013 mum Sharon, dad Larry, older sister Loreal and younger twin siblings Lawrencia and Lawrence. This must have disrupted the dynamic at home? \u201cIt definitely did,\u201d says Palmer, who answers every question with endearing sincerity. \u201cIt was weird for me.\u201d</p>    <p>They managed to stay close, however, which Palmer attributes to a family culture of flexible collaboration and eschewing traditional gender roles: \u201cBecause that\u2019s what life calls us all to do \u2026 Y\u2019know, I look today at what the kids are saying online \u2013 and by \u2018the kids\u2019, I mean the folks, everyone \u2013 we have these weird ideas of what it means to be a man or woman, and it\u2019s so stringent. My parents bounced back and forth to play all different roles.\u201d</p> <p>The weirder thing, on reflection, was how other industry adults, those outside her family, behaved. \u201cEspecially as a Black child. It was very like \u2018You\u2019re too good to be here \u2026 you deserve to be a part of a different family\u2019 type of energy. It\u2019s like, well, this family is mine. It\u2019s OK if they\u2019re from the midwest or they don\u2019t look the way you think they should look. There was this elitism that was projected on my parents, even though they were the ones that raised me to be the person that I am; the person that people think couldn\u2019t be their child.\u201d</p> <p>The uncomfortable interactions didn\u2019t end there, either. In Master of Me, Palmer details several encounters, on set and off, which range from inappropriate behaviour to what she terms \u201cregular-degular sexual harassment\u201d. Has she since developed an instinct for sorting scurrilous rumour from serious red flag? \u201cWell sometimes it\u2019s the whole thing of \u2018that person didn\u2019t do anything to me\u2019,\u201d she says, before growing quieter. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned that don\u2019t really mean anything.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, she says, \u201cif those are principles you stand by, then your actions and who you deal with should align\u201d. That said, she wouldn\u2019t want to be mistaken for an omniscient database of celebrity misdeeds: \u201cI think that is something, too, that we\u2019re sometimes assuming in this day and age: that everybody knows what everybody did! Y\u2019know, sometimes you don\u2019t know! You ain\u2019t reading up, or you\u2019re not paying attention! And it\u2019s fair to say \u2018Wait a minute, I didn\u2019t know all the details\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m not sure\u2019.\u201d</p>    <p>Palmer is generally plugged into the discourse, however, because when she aged out of child stardom, it was social media that allowed her to come into her own as an autonomous entrepreneur baddy. \u201cContent creation is a great thing to leverage and to diversify your portfolio,\u201d she says, sounding like one of the Wall Street bros her character defrauds in Hustlers. \u201cI wish I could say I immediately knew it was my way to freedom, but I really was just following the creativity bug.\u201d She began producing skits and sketches on TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat, which then led to more traditional opportunities, such as making musical theatre history as Broadway\u2019s first Black Cinderella in 2014. Even today, if you\u2019re keeping up with Keke \u201cKeep a Job\u201d Palmer (as she\u2019s been fondly dubbed by fans) on film and TV, you\u2019re seeing only a fraction of her total output.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she maintains that portfolio diversity by always having multiple projects on the go. In addition to Master of Me, this currently includes co-starring with Glastonbury-headlining musician SZA in an upcoming Issa Rae-produced film; a role alongside Keanu Reeves and Seth Rogan in Aziz Ansari\u2019s feature-directorial debut, Good Fortune, and teasing music video drops for her semi-satirical \u2013 but seemingly fully functional \u2013 girl group, DivaGurl. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like my version of Spinal Tap,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It was also social media that allowed Palmer to showcase her calling-card personality; the \u201cMe\u201d that she\u2019s successfully mastered and monetised. This is what persuaded Jordan Peele to cast her in Nope without an audition, and that bonded her with Hustlers co-star and fellow multitasker Jennifer Lopez. \u201cShe always had this vibe of \u2018I like you\u2019 towards me \u2026 Y\u2019know, her ass is really still \u2018Jenny from the Block\u2019. She really is real like that.\u201d</p>    <p>The Keke Palmer persona is less \u201cfrom the Block\u201d, more \u201cfrom the backstage musical\u201d, due in part to the old-school entertainer ethic instilled in her from childhood.

      "bodyText": "In an era when social media has turned us all into products to promote, Keke Palmer is the whole damn corporation. As a one-woman multimedia, multiplatform conglomerate, the 31-year-old is starring in acclaimed movies (the Oscar-robbed stripper heist film Hustlers; Jordan Peele\u2019s 2022 sci-fi-western-horror hybrid Nope), releasing R&amp;B pop music (including 2020\u2019s Virgo Tendencies, Pt II), hosting gameshows (the Jimmy Fallon-produced Password on NBC), talkshows (Just Keke on BET, plus a stint on Good Morning America) and her own podcast (Baby, This Is Keke Palmer), all the while regularly serving up sassy memes to the hungry internet hordes as casually as McDonald\u2019s serves fries. It\u2019s like Keke Palmer writes in the introduction to Keke Palmer\u2019s new book Master of Me: The Secret to Controlling Your Narrative \u2013 in the diva-ish third-person, of course \u2013 Keke Palmer can do it all, honey! This morning, that means being in New York to record some additional dialogue on her new movie and finish the edit on a new TV show she\u2019s producing, then squeezing in some time watching Sesame Street with her 20-month-old son, Leodis, before ducking out to find a quiet spot to continue our video chat about Master of Me \u2013 which, she says, isn\u2019t a memoir exactly. \u201cI think my push-up against the word is because it feels so me, me, me,\u201d she says. She\u2019s holding her cameraphone under her chin as she walks, talks and chews gum, giving a low-angle view of her oversized, square-framed glasses, sleek shoulder-length hair and baseball cap. It\u2019s a lot to juggle, but Palmer does not miss a beat as she expounds on her performance-as-public-service philosophy, in that characteristic, singsong preacher\u2019s cadence. \u201cAlthough it is about me, it\u2019s about how my stories reflect [the reader\u2019s] stories \u2026 I really wanted it to feel quite communal.\u201d To that end, Master of Me combines the usual stuff of celebrity autobiography \u2013 a rundown of career highs and lows, fulsome expressions of gratitude to mentors and the inside track on her personal life (namely the breakup from her son\u2019s father, Darius Jackson, that prompted an Usher diss track in his direction) with a strong sense of Palmer\u2019s reader-empowerment mission. Chapter titles include Affirmations for Keke (and Anyone Else Who Needs to Hear This) and For My Entrepreneur Baddies, while each section is rounded off with a multiple-choice \u201cSelf-Assessment Exercise\u201d. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to be asking somebody to buy a book, I definitely want it to feel like this is something you\u2019re going to get a lot of use out of, y\u2019know?\u201d she says. A multitasker, both by vocation and necessity, Palmer derived her book\u2019s title from a longer, less disparaging variation on the adage: \u201cA jack of all trades is master of none,\u201d she quotes now, having found a sofa to settle on, \u201cbut oftentimes better than a master of one!\u201d It\u2019s this last bit that resonated: \u201cNow that is the truth! Because if I\u2019m just focusing on one thing, then all my power is going to that, instead of mastering oneself, which is the hardest thing to do, but it makes you capable of more.\u201d If this sounds solipsistic, note that it also fits her broader analysis of economic history: \u201cThat saying was popular during the Industrial Revolution so, of course, they want you to master one particular trade, because that helps the industry. Now we\u2019re moving into a new time where it ain\u2019t about the industry; I\u2019m the industry. I am putting myself in the centre, not giving it all to one corporation.\u201d It wasn\u2019t always this way. Palmer came up as a child performer, giving her all to two corporations in particular, Disney and Nickelodeon. Today, she describes herself, not without pride, as a graduate of \u201cthe Disney School\u201d, an informal but influential establishment that includes Selena Gomez, Ryan Gosling and Zendaya. What did she learn there? \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like vaudevillian-ish or MGM-style,\u201d she says, referencing the golden-era Hollywood studio responsible for developing Judy Garland. \u201cThey just teach you to be a multifaceted entertainer and to repurpose yourself in every way you can. Because, essentially, that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do as a company: get the biggest bang for their buck.\u201d Palmer was nine when she started working and just 12 when she became the main breadwinner for her family \u2013 mum Sharon, dad Larry, older sister Loreal and younger twin siblings Lawrencia and Lawrence. This must have disrupted the dynamic at home? \u201cIt definitely did,\u201d says Palmer, who answers every question with endearing sincerity. \u201cIt was weird for me.\u201d They managed to stay close, however, which Palmer attributes to a family culture of flexible collaboration and eschewing traditional gender roles: \u201cBecause that\u2019s what life calls us all to do \u2026 Y\u2019know, I look today at what the kids are saying online \u2013 and by \u2018the kids\u2019, I mean the folks, everyone \u2013 we have these weird ideas of what it means to be a man or woman, and it\u2019s so stringent. My parents bounced back and forth to play all different roles.\u201d The weirder thing, on reflection, was how other industry adults, those outside her family, behaved. \u201cEspecially as a Black child. It was very like \u2018You\u2019re too good to be here \u2026 you deserve to be a part of a different family\u2019 type of energy. It\u2019s like, well, this family is mine. It\u2019s OK if they\u2019re from the midwest or they don\u2019t look the way you think they should look. There was this elitism that was projected on my parents, even though they were the ones that raised me to be the person that I am; the person that people think couldn\u2019t be their child.\u201d The uncomfortable interactions didn\u2019t end there, either. In Master of Me, Palmer details several encounters, on set and off, which range from inappropriate behaviour to what she terms \u201cregular-degular sexual harassment\u201d. Has she since developed an instinct for sorting scurrilous rumour from serious red flag? \u201cWell sometimes it\u2019s the whole thing of \u2018that person didn\u2019t do anything to me\u2019,\u201d she says, before growing quieter. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned that don\u2019t really mean anything.\u201d Ultimately, she says, \u201cif those are principles you stand by, then your actions and who you deal with should align\u201d. That said, she wouldn\u2019t want to be mistaken for an omniscient database of celebrity misdeeds: \u201cI think that is something, too, that we\u2019re sometimes assuming in this day and age: that everybody knows what everybody did! Y\u2019know, sometimes you don\u2019t know! You ain\u2019t reading up, or you\u2019re not paying attention! And it\u2019s fair to say \u2018Wait a minute, I didn\u2019t know all the details\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m not sure\u2019.\u201d Palmer is generally plugged into the discourse, however, because when she aged out of child stardom, it was social media that allowed her to come into her own as an autonomous entrepreneur baddy. \u201cContent creation is a great thing to leverage and to diversify your portfolio,\u201d she says, sounding like one of the Wall Street bros her character defrauds in Hustlers. \u201cI wish I could say I immediately knew it was my way to freedom, but I really was just following the creativity bug.\u201d She began producing skits and sketches on TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat, which then led to more traditional opportunities, such as making musical theatre history as Broadway\u2019s first Black Cinderella in 2014. Even today, if you\u2019re keeping up with Keke \u201cKeep a Job\u201d Palmer (as she\u2019s been fondly dubbed by fans) on film and TV, you\u2019re seeing only a fraction of her total output. Meanwhile, she maintains that portfolio diversity by always having multiple projects on the go. In addition to Master of Me, this currently includes co-starring with Glastonbury-headlining musician SZA in an upcoming Issa Rae-produced film; a role alongside Keanu Reeves and Seth Rogan in Aziz Ansari\u2019s feature-directorial debut, Good Fortune, and teasing music video drops for her semi-satirical \u2013 but seemingly fully functional \u2013 girl group, DivaGurl. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like my version of Spinal Tap,\u201d she says. It was also social media that allowed Palmer to showcase her calling-card personality; the \u201cMe\u201d that she\u2019s successfully mastered and monetised. This is what persuaded Jordan Peele to cast her in Nope without an audition, and that bonded her with Hustlers co-star and fellow multitasker Jennifer Lopez. \u201cShe always had this vibe of \u2018I like you\u2019 towards me \u2026 Y\u2019know, her ass is really still \u2018Jenny from the Block\u2019. She really is real like that.\u201d The Keke Palmer persona is less \u201cfrom the Block\u201d, more \u201cfrom the backstage musical\u201d, due in part to the old-school entertainer ethic instilled in her from childhood. She calls everyone \u201choney\u201d or \u201cbaby\u201d, for instance, regardless of circumstance or seniority. \u201cI noticed as a teenager that people like Whitney Houston, all the really fabulous women, they always said \u2018honey\u2019, \u2018baby\u2019 to people,\u201d she explains. This pairs well with her range of homespun catchphrases, such as \u201cSorry to this man\u201d (resulting from her much-memed failure to identify former US vice-president Dick Cheney) and \u201cThe gag is \u2026 \u201d, which is usually accompanied by some vaudevillian mugging to camera. The gag here is that, in all other respects, Palmer is a thoroughly modern millennial. She\u2019s obsessed with astrology (\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly like science \u2026 But it is kind of like science\u201d), describes the role of US presidents as \u201cthe most extreme form of an influencer\u201d and \u2013 most millennial-coded of all \u2013 has learned to ride the waves of the gig economy, and social media, without going under. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I have a super-salaciously interesting life,\u201d she says, when I ask how she decides what to share publicly and what to hold back. \u201cBut it can\u2019t just be for entertainment\u2019s sake, it has to have a bigger meaning. Not in terms of, like, world peace, but if I\u2019m going to get personal, if I\u2019m going to get real with you, then how can it be of service?\u201d Keke Palmer may be only 31, but in former-child-star years, that\u2019s about 100.

While Godley toyed with Thatcherism in early life, in recent years she railed against the likes of Boris Johnson and added her voice to the pro-independence cause in Scotland. She used her online presence to support the SNP and condemn transphobia, and also regularly shared updates of sausage dog Honey. Godley gave birth to Ashley in 1986. Storrie followed in her mother\u2019s footsteps, becoming a professional comedian. The two created online sketches together and co-starred in sitcom Dinosaur, while Storrie supported Godley on her final standup tour, Not Dead Yet. Godley was diagnosed with stage three ovarian cancer in 2021. The cancer returned in 2023, prompting Godley to embark on her final tour. In it, she regaled audiences with tales from her extraordinary life, showing for a final time her talents as a raconteur. In September, she cancelled her autumn tour, after initially hoping she would be able to continue touring. In a post on her X account on Thursday, her daughter Ashley revealed that Godley had been awarded an honorary degree from the University of Glasgow, which she said had \u201cbrought her so much joy\u201d in her final days. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2024 to correct a reference to Janey Godley\u2019s diagnosis.",

Here are five things you might not yet know about her. She\u2019s an engineer \u2013 but not the kind that builds bridges During the campaign, Badenoch made much of her engineering background, arguing that it allowed her to view problems in an analytical way, unburdened by ideology.

Levels of political violence have actually been lower this year than recent years, but there has been a continuation of high levels of threats and harassment, said Shannon Hiller, executive director of the Bridging Divides Initiative at Princeton University, which studies and tracks political violence. Elections officials in particular have been consistent targets of threats and harassment campaigns. Concerns about political violence among local elected officials have also risen.</p> <p>\u201cWhether it\u2019s bad actors or foreign actors, even trying to create that environment of fear is part of what people are doing to undermine our democracy,\u201d Hiller said. \u201cSo the best way to push back on that is to remind folks it\u2019s very safe and secure to vote and people feel confident to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Still, voters feel a sense of unease. A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/30/voters-fear-violence-trump-loss/?lid=mnqtc1avlpio&amp;utm_campaign=TheStakesUSElectionEdition&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=thestakesuselectionedition_email\">recent survey</a> of swing state voters by the Washington Post found fears that there would be violence if Trump loses the election. In six swing states, 57% of voters said they were at least somewhat worried about Trump supporters turning violent if he loses, far more than the percentage of voters who feared the same for a Harris loss.</p> <h2>January 6 memory hole</h2> <p>The January 6 insurrection serves to some as a reminder of what a riled-up populace ready to take action for political aims can do. But for Trump, it\u2019s now a \u201cday of love\u201d. He has promised to pardon many of those involved in the attack and referred to them as political prisoners. </p> <p>Having a leader encourage acts of violence or \u201cfear and loathing\u201d of the other side \u201ccreates a permission structure for people who want to commit acts of violence to go ahead and do so. They feel more justified, and they expect that they\u2019ll be protected,\u201d Hughes said.</p> <p>Experts don\u2019t believe the US Capitol could see a similar attack because of precautions taken since January 6, but state capitols and other buildings may not be as prepared.</p> <p>Pape has studied those involved in January 6. So far, more than 1,300 have been arrested for their actions that day, the vast majority of whom were not clearly affiliated with a domestic extremist group like the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers. Most of those sentenced have since stayed off the radar and are not commenting online about their political beliefs, Pape has found. Of those who do speak publicly about their charges or beliefs, many have doubled down on the issues that motivated them after the 2020 election. They have continued to express support for Trump and for election fraud narratives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/28/neo-nazi-the-base-recruitment-russia\">Neo-Nazi group the Base found a safe space to recruit Americans: the Russian internet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Billy Knutson of South Dakota was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/national-international/man-charged-with-storming-capitol-made-rap-videos-about-riot/3494787/\">charged</a> for his actions on January 6 and has since rapped about the insurrection: \u201cSince they stole the election we living behind enemy lines \u2026 We are the people, we won\u2019t be defeated / No peace and no quarter, we never retreated.\u201d</p> <p>Jake Lang, who is alleged to have swung a baseball bat at police on January 6, has been in prison for more than three years awaiting trial.

Extremism experts told the magazine that \u201cits inmates might re-enter society more primed to take violent action than they were before the Capitol riot\u201d.</p> <p>By reframing what January 6 was, Trump has given permission for his supporters to take similar action again, political violence experts warn.</p> <h2>Lone actors a risk</h2> <p>A memo from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) warned in September that there was a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of domestic violent extremists mobilizing \u201cagainst ideological opponents, government officials, and law enforcement in an attempt to initiate a civil war\u201d until at least early 2025. The <a href=\"https://propertyofthepeople.org/document-detail/?doc-id=25232267\">document</a>, obtained by the public records watchdog group Property of the People, said the threat comes from lone offenders, as large group action would probably be deterred by the January 6 convictions.</p> <p>The two assassination attempts against Trump could inspire copycats or retaliation, the agency said. \u201cReal or perceived mistakes or discrepancies in the electoral process\u201d could also play into broader election fraud narratives that stir up domestic violent extremists. Issues like mass migration could drive these extremists.</p> <p>\u201cWidespread or high-profile civil unrest, mass immigration, or crimes by migrants or minorities perceived as threatening the United States may drive some DVEs [domestic violent extremists] to mobilize to violence to \u2018save America\u2019 from perceived threats,\u201d the memo said. \u201cFor example, online users discussed the potential of a sweeping Executive Order that would have given some migrants citizenship, with one user stating, \u2018Biden does that executive order, we shoot all democrat officials. And the supporting federal agents.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Another DHS and FBI intelligence <a href=\"https://propertyofthepeople.org/document-detail/?doc-id=25255593\">bulletin</a> obtained by Property of the People from early October said the threat was heightened until inauguration day in January 2025 and extremists could use tactics such as \u201cphysical attacks, threats of violence, swatting and doxing, mailing or otherwise delivering suspicious items, arson, and other means of property destruction\u201d. The memo also said there was potential for violence based on grievances related to immigration, LGBTQIA+ rights and abortion access.</p> <p>Surveys have shown increased support for the use of violence to achieve political goals. When support for violence is more mainstream, it can nudge volatile people who are considering taking action over the edge because they believe they are fulfilling a popular mandate, Pape said.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a political cause that they sense from the media is popular, and then they want some of that popularity and fame for themselves, so they do a violent act in the name of that political cause,\u201d Pape said.</p> <p>The risk of violence doesn\u2019t automatically dissipate after the election. But while a Trump loss could inspire his supporters to take action, it could also release the hold he has on the right.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you have a very influential leader who acts as the center of gravity for a movement that engages in threats and even violence, when the leader recedes from you, that center of gravity has a way of dissolving, and the problems have a way of dissipating,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo there is a possibility that the outcome of this election will in itself improve the problem somewhat.\u201d</p>",

Online forums frequented by the far right are showing patterns similar to those that preceded the January 6 attack. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely possible that someone motivated by mis- or disinformation that they see online about some polling place in their community could show up with a gun and try to enforce vigilante justice,\u201d said Brian Hughes, associate director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab at American University. Alex Jones, the longtime conspiracist, has issued reports on his show for several days warning of a deep state plot to sow chaos around the voting process. \u201cAnd then there will be a big disputed election and it will get Democrats and Republicans all mad at each other, and that\u2019s the civil war conditions,\u201d Jones said on a broadcast this week. Elections officials emphasize that voting is still very safe in the US, and the threat of political violence should not deter people from casting a ballot. Levels of political violence have actually been lower this year than recent years, but there has been a continuation of high levels of threats and harassment, said Shannon Hiller, executive director of the Bridging Divides Initiative at Princeton University, which studies and tracks political violence. Elections officials in particular have been consistent targets of threats and harassment campaigns. Concerns about political violence among local elected officials have also risen. \u201cWhether it\u2019s bad actors or foreign actors, even trying to create that environment of fear is part of what people are doing to undermine our democracy,\u201d Hiller said. \u201cSo the best way to push back on that is to remind folks it\u2019s very safe and secure to vote and people feel confident to do so.\u201d Still, voters feel a sense of unease. A recent survey of swing state voters by the Washington Post found fears that there would be violence if Trump loses the election. In six swing states, 57% of voters said they were at least somewhat worried about Trump supporters turning violent if he loses, far more than the percentage of voters who feared the same for a Harris loss. January 6 memory hole The January 6 insurrection serves to some as a reminder of what a riled-up populace ready to take action for political aims can do. But for Trump, it\u2019s now a \u201cday of love\u201d. He has promised to pardon many of those involved in the attack and referred to them as political prisoners. Having a leader encourage acts of violence or \u201cfear and loathing\u201d of the other side \u201ccreates a permission structure for people who want to commit acts of violence to go ahead and do so. They feel more justified, and they expect that they\u2019ll be protected,\u201d Hughes said. Experts don\u2019t believe the US Capitol could see a similar attack because of precautions taken since January 6, but state capitols and other buildings may not be as prepared. Pape has studied those involved in January 6. So far, more than 1,300 have been arrested for their actions that day, the vast majority of whom were not clearly affiliated with a domestic extremist group like the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers. Most of those sentenced have since stayed off the radar and are not commenting online about their political beliefs, Pape has found. Of those who do speak publicly about their charges or beliefs, many have doubled down on the issues that motivated them after the 2020 election. They have continued to express support for Trump and for election fraud narratives. Billy Knutson of South Dakota was charged for his actions on January 6 and has since rapped about the insurrection: \u201cSince they stole the election we living behind enemy lines \u2026 We are the people, we won\u2019t be defeated / No peace and no quarter, we never retreated.\u201d Jake Lang, who is alleged to have swung a baseball bat at police on January 6, has been in prison for more than three years awaiting trial. He has brought in more than $240,000 in an online fundraiser on GiveSendGo, the rightwing crowdfunding site, to fund a \u201cJ6 truther\u201d website: \u201cThis is the single most important thing you can do to support the Jan 6 political prisoners and help exonerate these brave patriots,\u201d he tells donors. He has also been helping set up a \u201cnetwork of election deniers and conspiracists\u201d known as the North American Patriot and Liberty Militia, or Napalm, Wired reported. The \u201cpatriot wing\u201d of the DC jail where some violent January 6 participants are being held may be further radicalizing the people staying there, a New York Magazine report posited. Extremism experts told the magazine that \u201cits inmates might re-enter society more primed to take violent action than they were before the Capitol riot\u201d. By reframing what January 6 was, Trump has given permission for his supporters to take similar action again, political violence experts warn. Lone actors a risk A memo from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) warned in September that there was a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of domestic violent extremists mobilizing \u201cagainst ideological opponents, government officials, and law enforcement in an attempt to initiate a civil war\u201d until at least early 2025. The document, obtained by the public records watchdog group Property of the People, said the threat comes from lone offenders, as large group action would probably be deterred by the January 6 convictions. The two assassination attempts against Trump could inspire copycats or retaliation, the agency said. \u201cReal or perceived mistakes or discrepancies in the electoral process\u201d could also play into broader election fraud narratives that stir up domestic violent extremists. Issues like mass migration could drive these extremists. \u201cWidespread or high-profile civil unrest, mass immigration, or crimes by migrants or minorities perceived as threatening the United States may drive some DVEs [domestic violent extremists] to mobilize to violence to \u2018save America\u2019 from perceived threats,\u201d the memo said. \u201cFor example, online users discussed the potential of a sweeping Executive Order that would have given some migrants citizenship, with one user stating, \u2018Biden does that executive order, we shoot all democrat officials. And the supporting federal agents.\u2019\u201d Another DHS and FBI intelligence bulletin obtained by Property of the People from early October said the threat was heightened until inauguration day in January 2025 and extremists could use tactics such as \u201cphysical attacks, threats of violence, swatting and doxing, mailing or otherwise delivering suspicious items, arson, and other means of property destruction\u201d. The memo also said there was potential for violence based on grievances related to immigration, LGBTQIA+ rights and abortion access. Surveys have shown increased support for the use of violence to achieve political goals. When support for violence is more mainstream, it can nudge volatile people who are considering taking action over the edge because they believe they are fulfilling a popular mandate, Pape said. \u201cThere\u2019s a political cause that they sense from the media is popular, and then they want some of that popularity and fame for themselves, so they do a violent act in the name of that political cause,\u201d Pape said. The risk of violence doesn\u2019t automatically dissipate after the election. But while a Trump loss could inspire his supporters to take action, it could also release the hold he has on the right. \u201cWhen you have a very influential leader who acts as the center of gravity for a movement that engages in threats and even violence, when the leader recedes from you, that center of gravity has a way of dissolving, and the problems have a way of dissipating,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo there is a possibility that the outcome of this election will in itself improve the problem somewhat.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/rachel-reeves-goes-back-to-the-future-with-a-tax-and-spend-budget\">delivered her long-awaited first budget</a> on Wednesday. Here is our checklist of things you may want to do with your finances as a result.</p> <h2>Use your Isa allowance</h2> <p>The chancellor confirmed that the limit on payments into these tax-efficient wrappers will remain at \u00a320,000 a year until 2030. If you want to invest in stocks and shares, it makes good sense to use up that allowance first, as you can keep all of your capital gains. This was the case before the budget, but the increase in the rate of capital gains tax (CGT) on shares makes it all the more important.</p> <p>On Wednesday, CGT on shares and other assets went up from 20% to 24% for higher-rate taxpayers, and from 10% to 18% for basic-rate taxpayers. If you are lucky enough to make a \u00a315,000 profit on shares, and have no losses to offset, outside an Isa you would pay CGT on everything above your \u00a33,000 annual allowance. For a higher-rate taxpayer, that means a CGT bill of \u00a32,880, and \u00a312,120 in your pocket. Make the same gain inside your Isa and you will keep the whole \u00a315,000.</p>    <p>You can shield stocks and shares you already own from tax on future gains by moving them into the wrapper \u2013 a process known as bed and Isa, which lots of Isa providers will help you with. However, you will pay stamp duty on shares you move, and might face CGT if you have already made a big gain, so get advice first.</p> <p>Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at the advice firm AJ Bell, says investors doing this can use their \u00a33,000 annual CGT allowance, and can reduce any gains by selling off loss-making shares at the same time. \u201cLosses can be used to offset gains, thereby reducing the capital gains tax liability, then either or both investments can be rebought within the Isa to avoid tax on future gains,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>If you\u2019re buying a home, get your skates on</h2> <p>If you are planning on buying in England or Northern Ireland, act now to try to make sure the purchase is complete before changes in stamp duty come in next year.</p> <p>The chancellor opted not to extend temporary thresholds put in place by the previous government, so from next April, you will start paying stamp duty on any property priced over \u00a3125,000, down from \u00a3250,000 now. First-time buyers will have to pay on homes worth more than \u00a3300,000, a reduction from the current \u00a3425,000. And they will get first-time buyer relief only on homes costing up to \u00a3500,000, compared with \u00a3625,000 now.</p>    <p>This means that if you move to a home costing \u00a3266,000, the average UK sale price according to Nationwide building society, you will have to pay \u00a32,500 more in tax. If you are a first-time buyer, you will still not have to pay anything.</p> <p>In London, where the average price is \u00a3524,000, a first-time buyer will lose their benefits and will have to pay \u00a311,250 more than under the current rules.</p> <p>It is already too late for anyone buying a second home to avoid increases in stamp duty, however, as changes to the higher rates for additional dwellings (HRAD) surcharge, paid by property buyers who already own a home, came in on Thursday.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t wait for lower mortgage rates</h2> <p>Most mortgage experts believe that the fallout from the budget, plus next week\u2019s US election, mean volatility ahead in terms of interest rates. So if you are coming towards the end of your current mortgage product and will need a new one, David Hollingworth at the broker L&amp;C Mortgages suggests locking into a deal now.</p> <p>Remortgage offers are typically valid for up to six months, so if your deal is ending in four or five months\u2019 time, you can reserve a loan now and wait to see what happens. If the cost of new dealscomes down, you are not committed to that offer and can go elsewhere, and if they have risen, you have locked in at a cheaper rate.</p> <p>Within hours of the budget, Virgin Money announced rate increases across its fixed mortgage range, while Santander announced it was cutting the cost of its new fixes. Post-budget, money market movements suggested that we could see new fixed-rate mortgage pricing either stay flat or edge up in the short term. But, \u201cthat\u2019s not rocketing up\u201d, says Hollingworth.</p>    <p>It is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/21/uk-interest-rates-fall-next-autumn-goldman-sachs-predicts\">still expected</a> that the Bank of England will cut borrowing costs from 5% to 4.75% next week. But on Thursday, investors were pricing in fewer than four interest rate cuts over the next year, compared with nearly five before the budget.</p> <p>Most people taking out a mortgage are still going for fixed-rate deals, says Hollingworth. As well as the payment certainty they offer, they are also typically cheaper than base-rate tracker deals, where what you pay moves down (or up) in line with the official base rate. Late this week, the cheapest five-year fixes for remortgagers were at about 3.7%, and over two years at about 4%.</p> <h2>Review your pension inheritance plans</h2> <p>The budget contained bad news for well-off older people who planned to leave unspent pension savings to children or grandchildren after Reeves announced that this money will be included in inheritance tax (IHT).</p> <p>IHT is a tax paid on someone\u2019s assets after they die if they leave enough to go above a certain threshold. The standard IHT rate is 40%, and it is charged only on the part of the estate that is above the tax-free threshold, which remained unchanged at \u00a3325,000. (There is a separate threshold for homes.)</p> <p>At the moment, pensions tend to be outside people\u2019s estates for IHT purposes (the so-called \u201cpension freedoms\u201d introduced in 2015 removed a 55% charge for pensions funds which remained unused at death). However, Reeves announced that money left in a defined contribution pension after your death will be included from April 2027.</p> <p>The exemption for spouses or civil partners will continue to apply, so everything can be left to them without an IHT bill. But other beneficiaries could face tax.</p> <p>Bringing pensions within IHT meansanyone planning to leave money in their pension to give tax-efficiently to family after their death will need to revisit their finances and maybe review their will. </p>    <p>You can give away assets or cash up to a total of \u00a33,000 in a tax year without it being added to the value of your estate. Meanwhile, the \u201cpotentially exempt transfer\u201d rules allow you to give money or gifts of any amount or value to anyone which will become exempt from IHT as long as you live for seven years after giving them.</p> <p>Robert Salter, a director at the accountants Blick Rothenberg, says wealthier clients will consider withdrawing some of their pension savings at an earlier stage than might have otherwise been the case. \u201cThis is so they can then potentially transfer the amounts they have withdrawn to their children/grandchildren as potentially exempt transfers for IHT purposes.\u201d</p> <p>If you expect your pension to still form a large part of your estate when you die, and you have take out a life insurance plan to cover IHT, Neil Lancaster, a private client tax partner at Wilson Wright, says you should review your arrangement.</p> <p>\u201cFamilies may need to adjust their life cover policies to account for these potential liabilities linked to pension values,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>Ask your employer about salary sacrifice</h2> <p>One of the big money-spinners announced on Wednesday was an increase in the national insurance contributions employers will need to make for each of their staff. From April 2025, the rate they pay will go up to 15% and the earnings threshold at which they start to pay will be reduced from \u00a39,100 to \u00a35,000. Employers may try to recover the costs by reducing perks, or they may be inclined to run <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/apr/06/salary-sacrifice-how-british-workers-can-take-home-more-by-getting-paid-less\">salary sacrifice schemes</a>, which reduce their NICs bill but offer you an advantage. The schemes let you reduce your pay by an amount which typically goes into a pension, or on a car or bike, with the payment made before tax or NI are taken off.</p> <p>\u201cEmployers are staring at a significant increase in costs: facilitating salary sacrifice is one way employers can address this burden and it is likely than many firms which now don\u2019t will make such schemes available,\u201d says Jason Hollands, managing director of the wealth management group Evelyn Partners.</p> <p>The budget small print contained some news which will make salary sacrifice more appealing to parents earning more than \u00a360,000 a year each. Plans to change the child benefit tax charge so that paying back the benefit is based on household, rather than an individual\u2019s, income have been quietly scrapped. This means that if there is one earner on \u00a360,000-\u00a380,000 they will have to return some of the money; above \u00a380,000 they will pay back the whole lot. Reducing your salary through salary sacrifice will let you hold on to more child benefit.</p> <h2>\u2018<strong>I feared a big rise in capital gains tax\u2019</strong></h2>    <p>A few weeks ago, Rupert March, a former middle-ranking executive at a global tech company, realised that he might need to cash in his employee shares amid pre-budget speculation that Rachel Reeves might raise capital gains tax to as high as 39%.</p> <p>Before the budget, the 66-year-old said selling the shares in the company he used to work for \u201cwasn\u2019t something I was planning to do [now]. But \u2026 if it went up [from 20%] to 39%, I\u2019d be looking at \u00a3600,000 in capital gains.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cI never managed to save significant sums while working, so there were many sleepless nights. And my employee stock plan was a constant underperfomer. However, in the last few years the stock price has risen sharply, significantly ramping up my net worth.\u201d</p> <p>After 23 years living in the EU, March and his wife are renting in London and would like to buy a home, so an extra several hundred thousand pounds in CGT would have dramatically altered their life plans.</p> <p>In the end, Reeves did increase CGT, although not by as much as many had feared. For higher-rate taxpayers, CGT on share gains went up to 24% with immediate effect.</p> <p>After the announcement, March said that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t take the risk [of a big rise]\u201d and had \u201csaved some money\u201d as a result of the 11th-hour disposal the day before the budget.</p> <p>As someone \u201cof pension age\u201d, he welcomed the announcement that the basic and new state pension will increase by 4.1% in April next year, which means more than 12 million pensioners will receive up to an additional \u00a3470 a year.</p>",

This means that if you move to a home costing \u00a3266,000, the average UK sale price according to Nationwide building society, you will have to pay \u00a32,500 more in tax. If you are a first-time buyer, you will still not have to pay anything. In London, where the average price is \u00a3524,000, a first-time buyer will lose their benefits and will have to pay \u00a311,250 more than under the current rules. It is already too late for anyone buying a second home to avoid increases in stamp duty, however, as changes to the higher rates for additional dwellings (HRAD) surcharge, paid by property buyers who already own a home, came in on Thursday. Don\u2019t wait for lower mortgage rates Most mortgage experts believe that the fallout from the budget, plus next week\u2019s US election, mean volatility ahead in terms of interest rates.

Late this week, the cheapest five-year fixes for remortgagers were at about 3.7%, and over two years at about 4%. Review your pension inheritance plans The budget contained bad news for well-off older people who planned to leave unspent pension savings to children or grandchildren after Reeves announced that this money will be included in inheritance tax (IHT). IHT is a tax paid on someone\u2019s assets after they die if they leave enough to go above a certain threshold. The standard IHT rate is 40%, and it is charged only on the part of the estate that is above the tax-free threshold, which remained unchanged at \u00a3325,000.

The exemption for spouses or civil partners will continue to apply, so everything can be left to them without an IHT bill. But other beneficiaries could face tax. Bringing pensions within IHT meansanyone planning to leave money in their pension to give tax-efficiently to family after their death will need to revisit their finances and maybe review their will. You can give away assets or cash up to a total of \u00a33,000 in a tax year without it being added to the value of your estate. Meanwhile, the \u201cpotentially exempt transfer\u201d rules allow you to give money or gifts of any amount or value to anyone which will become exempt from IHT as long as you live for seven years after giving them. Robert Salter, a director at the accountants Blick Rothenberg, says wealthier clients will consider withdrawing some of their pension savings at an earlier stage than might have otherwise been the case. \u201cThis is so they can then potentially transfer the amounts they have withdrawn to their children/grandchildren as potentially exempt transfers for IHT purposes.\u201d If you expect your pension to still form a large part of your estate when you die, and you have take out a life insurance plan to cover IHT, Neil Lancaster, a private client tax partner at Wilson Wright, says you should review your arrangement. \u201cFamilies may need to adjust their life cover policies to account for these potential liabilities linked to pension values,\u201d he says. Ask your employer about salary sacrifice One of the big money-spinners announced on Wednesday was an increase in the national insurance contributions employers will need to make for each of their staff. From April 2025, the rate they pay will go up to 15% and the earnings threshold at which they start to pay will be reduced from \u00a39,100 to \u00a35,000. Employers may try to recover the costs by reducing perks, or they may be inclined to run salary sacrifice schemes, which reduce their NICs bill but offer you an advantage. The schemes let you reduce your pay by an amount which typically goes into a pension, or on a car or bike, with the payment made before tax or NI are taken off. \u201cEmployers are staring at a significant increase in costs: facilitating salary sacrifice is one way employers can address this burden and it is likely than many firms which now don\u2019t will make such schemes available,\u201d says Jason Hollands, managing director of the wealth management group Evelyn Partners. The budget small print contained some news which will make salary sacrifice more appealing to parents earning more than \u00a360,000 a year each. Plans to change the child benefit tax charge so that paying back the benefit is based on household, rather than an individual\u2019s, income have been quietly scrapped. This means that if there is one earner on \u00a360,000-\u00a380,000 they will have to return some of the money; above \u00a380,000 they will pay back the whole lot. Reducing your salary through salary sacrifice will let you hold on to more child benefit. \u2018I feared a big rise in capital gains tax\u2019 A few weeks ago, Rupert March, a former middle-ranking executive at a global tech company, realised that he might need to cash in his employee shares amid pre-budget speculation that Rachel Reeves might raise capital gains tax to as high as 39%. Before the budget, the 66-year-old said selling the shares in the company he used to work for \u201cwasn\u2019t something I was planning to do [now]. But \u2026 if it went up [from 20%] to 39%, I\u2019d be looking at \u00a3600,000 in capital gains.\u201d He said: \u201cI never managed to save significant sums while working, so there were many sleepless nights. And my employee stock plan was a constant underperfomer. However, in the last few years the stock price has risen sharply, significantly ramping up my net worth.\u201d After 23 years living in the EU, March and his wife are renting in London and would like to buy a home, so an extra several hundred thousand pounds in CGT would have dramatically altered their life plans. In the end, Reeves did increase CGT, although not by as much as many had feared. For higher-rate taxpayers, CGT on share gains went up to 24% with immediate effect. After the announcement, March said that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t take the risk [of a big rise]\u201d and had \u201csaved some money\u201d as a result of the 11th-hour disposal the day before the budget. As someone \u201cof pension age\u201d, he welcomed the announcement that the basic and new state pension will increase by 4.1% in April next year, which means more than 12 million pensioners will receive up to an additional \u00a3470 a year.",

      "body": "<p>It has been nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/dec/31/is-the-uk-about-to-have-liftoff-in-the-global-space-industry\">70 years since Francis Thomas Bacon developed a source of clean green energy</a> that would help power the first moon landing and change the course of history.</p> <p>Yet, few are aware of the Essex-born, Cambridge-based engineer whose invention of the first working hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell helped send Apollo 11 to the moon. His pioneering work is still a source of inspiration for scientists working on renewable energy solutions today.</p> <p>Now, the charity Cambridge Past, Present &amp; Future is seeking to shine a light on Bacon\u2019s remarkable achievements by honouring him with a blue plaque at his former home in Little Shelford, Cambridgeshire.</p> <p>Bacon\u2019s fuel cells \u2013 nicknamed \u201cBacon Cells\u201d by Nasa in his honour \u2013 provided secondary power for the Apollo missions, producing electricity for the communications, air conditioning and lights, as well as water for the astronauts.</p> <p>\u201cNormally, in the course of time, a battery runs down and you\u2019ve got to recharge it,\u201d Bacon told <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/ws/av-embeds/articles/cjl31dzp43jo/p07h6gng/en-gb\">BBC Radio 4</a>, shortly before the moon landings in 1969. \u201cNow, [with] this device, as long as you go on feeding hydrogen and oxygen into it, and you remove the water formed, it will go on generating power indefinitely \u2013 and the astronauts drink the water.\u201d</p>    <p>The efficiency and high energy density of the fuel cells played such an integral role in the success of the Apollo missions that President Richard Nixon told Bacon: \u201cWithout you, Tom, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten to the moon.\u201d</p> <p>Sam Stranks, professor of energy materials and optoelectronics at Cambridge University, said: \u201cHe was a pioneer. Fuel cell technology was extremely important to the space programme, because as long as you can continuously supply the gases, you can keep producing electricity.\u201d This is vital in a remote location like outer space. \u201cObviously, there\u2019s no easy means to get electricity there.\u201d</p> <p>Bacon\u2019s legacy is still inspiring scientists working on new technologies for solar power, hydrogen generation and battery storage today, Stranks said, and fuel cells remain \u201cvery relevant\u201d as a potential way of providing green electricity and emergency power, particularly in remote places. They could also power the electric engines of long-haul trucks and ships in the future, avoiding the need for impossibly large and heavy rechargeable batteries and fulfilling a dream Bacon shared in his BBC radio interview. \u201cI always hoped it would be used for driving vehicles about,\u201d he said, before predicting: \u201cIn a modified form, it is going to come.\u201d</p> <p>Stranks said: \u201cI see him very much as a visionary and an unsung hero. The fuel cell is a sustainable power solution that foreshadows today\u2019s clean energy efforts and was decades ahead of its time.\u201d</p> <p>A direct descendent of the Elizabethan philosopher and empiricist Francis Bacon, he began researching fuel cells while working for an engineering firm in 1932, a few years after graduating from Cambridge with a third-class <a href=\"https://archivesearch.lib.cam.ac.uk/repositories/9/resources/1413\">degree in mechanical sciences</a>.</p> <p>Nearly a century earlier, the physicist William Grove had demonstrated the theoretical concept of fuel cells in 1839, but <a href=\"https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/in-depth/late-great-engineers-william-robert-grove-inventor-of-the-hydrogen-fuel-cell/\">failed to generate much electricity</a>. Excited by the huge potential, Bacon secretly started conducting experiments with the highly flammable gases, on his employer\u2019s premises.</p> <p>Told to either stop or leave, he quit his job and devoted his life to engineering a solution to this complex problem, working first at Cambridge University, then Marshall, a local engineering firm. </p> <p>He later revealed in his BBC interview that it was unclear for decades what the practical use of his invention would be, and he struggled to fund his research as a result. Then, in 1962, Nasa decided to develop his alkaline fuel cell for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/07/apollo-programme-first-steps-into-space-fifty-years-on-half-century-since-photogaphs-book\">the Apollo programme</a> and a US company invested $100m in the project.</p> <p>\u201cBritish engineers have some of the most brilliant ideas, but turning those ideas into commercial successes is what then often fails, and Bacon faced this,\u201d said Cambridge professor Clemens Kaminski, head of the chemical engineering and biotechnology department where Bacon once worked. \u201cYet he persevered.\u201d</p> <p>After they returned to Earth, astronauts Neil Armstong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins met Bacon at Downing Street and presented him with a signed photograph of Armstrong\u2019s famous first \u201csmall step\u201d on the moon.</p> <p>Outside the scientific community, however, Bacon, who died in 1992, is not very well known, Kaminski said. \u201cHe was an incredibly modest and quiet man. His delight was solving problems and coming up with real solutions for the benefit of society.\u201d</p> <p>He thinks Bacon was so far ahead of his time that it may be 20 or 30 years before his legacy is fully understood. \u201cIf we can crack the problem of generating and storing hydrogen sustainably and efficiently, then the fuel cell could make an enormous impact on everyday life.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2024. An earlier version called the local engineering firm Marshalls; this should have said Marshall.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It has been nearly 70 years since Francis Thomas Bacon developed a source of clean green energy that would help power the first moon landing and change the course of history. Yet, few are aware of the Essex-born, Cambridge-based engineer whose invention of the first working hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell helped send Apollo 11 to the moon. His pioneering work is still a source of inspiration for scientists working on renewable energy solutions today. Now, the charity Cambridge Past, Present &amp; Future is seeking to shine a light on Bacon\u2019s remarkable achievements by honouring him with a blue plaque at his former home in Little Shelford, Cambridgeshire. Bacon\u2019s fuel cells \u2013 nicknamed \u201cBacon Cells\u201d by Nasa in his honour \u2013 provided secondary power for the Apollo missions, producing electricity for the communications, air conditioning and lights, as well as water for the astronauts. \u201cNormally, in the course of time, a battery runs down and you\u2019ve got to recharge it,\u201d Bacon told BBC Radio 4, shortly before the moon landings in 1969. \u201cNow, [with] this device, as long as you go on feeding hydrogen and oxygen into it, and you remove the water formed, it will go on generating power indefinitely \u2013 and the astronauts drink the water.\u201d The efficiency and high energy density of the fuel cells played such an integral role in the success of the Apollo missions that President Richard Nixon told Bacon: \u201cWithout you, Tom, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten to the moon.\u201d Sam Stranks, professor of energy materials and optoelectronics at Cambridge University, said: \u201cHe was a pioneer. Fuel cell technology was extremely important to the space programme, because as long as you can continuously supply the gases, you can keep producing electricity.\u201d This is vital in a remote location like outer space. \u201cObviously, there\u2019s no easy means to get electricity there.\u201d Bacon\u2019s legacy is still inspiring scientists working on new technologies for solar power, hydrogen generation and battery storage today, Stranks said, and fuel cells remain \u201cvery relevant\u201d as a potential way of providing green electricity and emergency power, particularly in remote places. They could also power the electric engines of long-haul trucks and ships in the future, avoiding the need for impossibly large and heavy rechargeable batteries and fulfilling a dream Bacon shared in his BBC radio interview. \u201cI always hoped it would be used for driving vehicles about,\u201d he said, before predicting: \u201cIn a modified form, it is going to come.\u201d Stranks said: \u201cI see him very much as a visionary and an unsung hero. The fuel cell is a sustainable power solution that foreshadows today\u2019s clean energy efforts and was decades ahead of its time.\u201d A direct descendent of the Elizabethan philosopher and empiricist Francis Bacon, he began researching fuel cells while working for an engineering firm in 1932, a few years after graduating from Cambridge with a third-class degree in mechanical sciences. Nearly a century earlier, the physicist William Grove had demonstrated the theoretical concept of fuel cells in 1839, but failed to generate much electricity. Excited by the huge potential, Bacon secretly started conducting experiments with the highly flammable gases, on his employer\u2019s premises. Told to either stop or leave, he quit his job and devoted his life to engineering a solution to this complex problem, working first at Cambridge University, then Marshall, a local engineering firm. He later revealed in his BBC interview that it was unclear for decades what the practical use of his invention would be, and he struggled to fund his research as a result. Then, in 1962, Nasa decided to develop his alkaline fuel cell for the Apollo programme and a US company invested $100m in the project. \u201cBritish engineers have some of the most brilliant ideas, but turning those ideas into commercial successes is what then often fails, and Bacon faced this,\u201d said Cambridge professor Clemens Kaminski, head of the chemical engineering and biotechnology department where Bacon once worked. \u201cYet he persevered.\u201d After they returned to Earth, astronauts Neil Armstong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins met Bacon at Downing Street and presented him with a signed photograph of Armstrong\u2019s famous first \u201csmall step\u201d on the moon. Outside the scientific community, however, Bacon, who died in 1992, is not very well known, Kaminski said. \u201cHe was an incredibly modest and quiet man. His delight was solving problems and coming up with real solutions for the benefit of society.\u201d He thinks Bacon was so far ahead of his time that it may be 20 or 30 years before his legacy is fully understood. \u201cIf we can crack the problem of generating and storing hydrogen sustainably and efficiently, then the fuel cell could make an enormous impact on everyday life.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2024. An earlier version called the local engineering firm Marshalls; this should have said Marshall.",

With the active support of Republicans in the US Senate, then President Trump appointed three new hard-right justices to the country\u2019s top court, creating a 6-3 conservative-to-liberal supermajority.</p> \n<p>That super-majority duly repaid Trump. First it abolished the constitutional right to an abortion in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-abortion-summary-supreme-court\">Roe v Wade</a>, and then it granted him substantial immunity from criminal charges.</p> \n<p>The immunity ruling has had a direct bearing on the federal prosecutions against Trump brought by the special counsel Jack Smith. It could alter the parameters of a second Trump term, which he has already indicated will be devoted to <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5060238/pres-trump-i-justicei-retribution\">retribution against</a> his political enemies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/03/trump-mass-deportations-detention-camps-military-migrants\">mass deportations</a> of undocumented immigrants, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/17/trump-wins-elections-outcomes-stakes\">mobilization of the military</a> against domestic targets, and other legally questionable moves.</p> \n<p>A similar feedback loop is also operating in the lower courts. Take the US district judge whom Trump appointed in Florida, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/18/trump-special-master-mar-a-lago-judiciary-courts\">Aileen Cannon</a>, who in July <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/15/judge-dismisses-trump-classified-documents-case\">dismissed the criminal case</a> against him for having hoarded classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago club. The judgment is being appealed.</p> \n<p>At stake in this historically important election is whether Trump will be able to strengthen and deepen this feedback loop during a second term. And if so, how he would then deploy it.</p> \n<p>The most obvious way to bolster an already powerful mechanism is to appoint more judges. Last time, Trump filled no fewer than 234 federal judicial seats.</p> \n<p>That included three supreme court justices: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. He also placed 54 appeals court judges, the most powerful judges in the nation other than supreme court justices \u2013 just one fewer in four years than Barack Obama achieved over his entire eight years in office.</p> \n<p>Top of Trump\u2019s list of priorities will be to cement the far-right grip he has already secured on the supreme court. He could ensure the dominance of the supermajority for years to come if he could replace the older ultra-right justices, Clarence Thomas, who is 76, and Samuel Alito, 74, with similarly strident ideologues half their age.</p> \n<p>Given their own fondness for the political values of the Make America Great Again movement, the two oldest justices may well be tempted to step down while Trump were in the White House to ensure continuity. Thomas, a rightwing stalwart, has already been on the top court for 33 years.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe most likely retirement would be that of Justice Thomas,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University law center and an authority on the supreme court.</p> \n<p>An even greater prize for Trump would be if one of the three liberal-leaning justices were forced to step down from her lifelong post. All eyes will be on the oldest of the trio, Sonia Sotomayor, 70.</p> \n<p>Were Trump able to replace even one liberal justice, the supermajority would be boosted from its current dominant status to one that would be unassailable. A 7-to-2 balance would eradicate any ambiguity, remove any chance of compromise or moderation, and lock in a watertight far-right jurisprudence for at least a generation.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf Donald Trump takes the White House and the Republicans control the Senate then it will be the next one, two, three justice appointments, and this will be our entire judiciary,\u201d Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, told CBS News recently. \u201cThere will be no one to stop them, and with a supreme court that has basically said Donald Trump can be a king, there will be no checks on him.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the lower courts, Trump would also push to continue his remolding of the judiciary, both by aggressively pursuing new appointments to the federal bench and by championing judges who pay lip service to Maga values. If the Republicans regain control of the US Senate next week, there would be few impediments to him pursuing his goal.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe extent to which the Senate had any kind of a backbone during the confirmation process for new judges during the Trump administration is likely to go away,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cThe constraints on Trump\u2019s most extreme picks would vanish.\u201d</p> \n<p>A main target would be to push the powerful appeals courts further to the right. The New Orleans-based fifth circuit, the most hard-right appeals court in the country, already has six Trump appointees among its 17 active judges, and a second Trump term will aim to enhance that figure.</p> \n<p>Waldman pointed out that the most ideologically driven judges appointed by Trump came towards the end of his presidency, indicating the increasingly radical direction in which he was moving.

      "bodyText": "If Donald Trump re-enters the White House on 20 January he will do so emboldened by a power that no previous incoming president has ever enjoyed: immunity from criminal prosecution for any act carried out in his official capacity. The protection, awarded in a July ruling from the far-right supermajority of the US supreme court, changes fundamentally the dynamics of the Oval Office. \u201cThe justices wrote a how-to guide for a president who wants to break the law,\u201d said Michael Waldman, president of the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cIn practical terms, if you are a president who wants to break the law, make sure your co-conspirators are also government employees \u2013 then you\u2019re off the hook.\u201d The immunity ruling, in Trump v United States, is the clearest example yet of the judicial feedback loop that the former president established during his 2017 to 2021 presidency. With the active support of Republicans in the US Senate, then President Trump appointed three new hard-right justices to the country\u2019s top court, creating a 6-3 conservative-to-liberal supermajority. That super-majority duly repaid Trump. First it abolished the constitutional right to an abortion in Roe v Wade, and then it granted him substantial immunity from criminal charges. The immunity ruling has had a direct bearing on the federal prosecutions against Trump brought by the special counsel Jack Smith. It could alter the parameters of a second Trump term, which he has already indicated will be devoted to retribution against his political enemies, mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, mobilization of the military against domestic targets, and other legally questionable moves. A similar feedback loop is also operating in the lower courts. Take the US district judge whom Trump appointed in Florida, Aileen Cannon, who in July dismissed the criminal case against him for having hoarded classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago club. The judgment is being appealed. At stake in this historically important election is whether Trump will be able to strengthen and deepen this feedback loop during a second term. And if so, how he would then deploy it. The most obvious way to bolster an already powerful mechanism is to appoint more judges. Last time, Trump filled no fewer than 234 federal judicial seats. That included three supreme court justices: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. He also placed 54 appeals court judges, the most powerful judges in the nation other than supreme court justices \u2013 just one fewer in four years than Barack Obama achieved over his entire eight years in office. Top of Trump\u2019s list of priorities will be to cement the far-right grip he has already secured on the supreme court. He could ensure the dominance of the supermajority for years to come if he could replace the older ultra-right justices, Clarence Thomas, who is 76, and Samuel Alito, 74, with similarly strident ideologues half their age. Given their own fondness for the political values of the Make America Great Again movement, the two oldest justices may well be tempted to step down while Trump were in the White House to ensure continuity. Thomas, a rightwing stalwart, has already been on the top court for 33 years. \u201cThe most likely retirement would be that of Justice Thomas,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University law center and an authority on the supreme court. An even greater prize for Trump would be if one of the three liberal-leaning justices were forced to step down from her lifelong post. All eyes will be on the oldest of the trio, Sonia Sotomayor, 70. Were Trump able to replace even one liberal justice, the supermajority would be boosted from its current dominant status to one that would be unassailable. A 7-to-2 balance would eradicate any ambiguity, remove any chance of compromise or moderation, and lock in a watertight far-right jurisprudence for at least a generation. \u201cIf Donald Trump takes the White House and the Republicans control the Senate then it will be the next one, two, three justice appointments, and this will be our entire judiciary,\u201d Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, told CBS News recently. \u201cThere will be no one to stop them, and with a supreme court that has basically said Donald Trump can be a king, there will be no checks on him.\u201d In the lower courts, Trump would also push to continue his remolding of the judiciary, both by aggressively pursuing new appointments to the federal bench and by championing judges who pay lip service to Maga values. If the Republicans regain control of the US Senate next week, there would be few impediments to him pursuing his goal. \u201cThe extent to which the Senate had any kind of a backbone during the confirmation process for new judges during the Trump administration is likely to go away,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cThe constraints on Trump\u2019s most extreme picks would vanish.\u201d A main target would be to push the powerful appeals courts further to the right. The New Orleans-based fifth circuit, the most hard-right appeals court in the country, already has six Trump appointees among its 17 active judges, and a second Trump term will aim to enhance that figure. Waldman pointed out that the most ideologically driven judges appointed by Trump came towards the end of his presidency, indicating the increasingly radical direction in which he was moving. Those later appointments included Matthew Kacsmaryk, appointed as a federal district court judge in Texas in June 2019. Some of the most controversial cases to reach the supreme court in recent months were initiated by Kacsmaryk in his northern district of Texas court. That included the ban on the abortion medication mifepristone (the supreme court restored access to the drug this summer). Cannon, the judge who threw out the classified documents case, was also a late Trump appointment. She took up her federal position just two months before he left the White House. Extreme judge appointments would be just one side of the coin. There are indications that Trump might go on the offensive in a second term to take on troublesome federal judges who put loyalty to constitution before loyalty to Trump. One of the big frustrations of his four years in the White House was that federal judges repeatedly refused to allow him to act in unconstitutional ways. The courts blocked his initial Muslim travel ban, border asylum restrictions and attempt to allow healthcare discrimination against transgender patients, among many other actions. In a second term, Trump is likely to toughen his approach. John Eastman, the lawyer who was central to the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 presidential election, has called for the removal of sitting judges. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start impeaching these judges for acting in such an unbelievably partisan way from the bench,\u201d Eastman told a national conservative conference recently. Waldman has detected another legal strategy that Trump could pursue in a second term as a way of bypassing constitutional objections to his most egregious policies. It is based on identifying relatively obscure federal statutes that were framed decades or even centuries ago and are written in such a loose way that they would give him substantial leeway. For instance, Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, originally enacted in 1792, which would allow him to deploy the US military domestically against Americans. The law is so broadly cast that it gives a president wide powers to decide when it could be activated, and Waldman\u2019s Brennan Center has called for the statute to be tightened up to prevent abuse. At his Madison Square Garden rally last week, Trump also name-checked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, a federal statute that was used to intern Japanese nationals in the second world war. The law, which allows citizens of foreign countries to be rounded up and removed in case of war, \u201cinvasion or predatory incursion\u201d, could be used as legal justification for his plans to mass-deport millions of undocumented immigrants. \u201cEven a diligent judge would have a hard time imposing limits on some of these statutes that have very few guardrails and give presidents an awful lot of power,\u201d Waldman said. \u201cIt turns out that it has been self-restraint, more than anything else, that has stopped these powers from being abused.\u201d Even Trump invoking vast powers vested in him by vague ancient laws pales beside Vladeck\u2019s worst fear. What if Trump dares to flout the rule of law itself? \u201cMy biggest concern is the very real specter that the courts rule against him, and he tells the courts to pound sand,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cWhat if he tells his supporters that the supreme court justices are a bunch of Rinos [Republicans in name only] and tries to defy them?

      "body": "<p>Deborah Levy is a presence, entering a cafe in north London with slightly wild hair, a large brooch at her throat and a Lime bike parked across the street, ready to convey her back up the hill after our interview. At 65, she has an appeal that is both literary and popular, with an intensity matched only by the devotion of her readers. In the first moments of our interview, Levy whips out her phone to show me a photo of a woman she met in Italy who, to Levy\u2019s delight, had a tattoo on her upper arm of the French writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/08/the-easy-life-by-marguerite-duras-review-experiments-of-youth\">Marguerite Duras</a>. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d do it,\u201d she says thoughtfully of the tattoo, but it seems to me there are women out there for whom a tattoo of Levy wouldn\u2019t be a gesture too far.</p> <p>Levy has written about Duras in a new collection, The Position of Spoons, a series of short (in some cases, very short) pieces in which the title essay refers to a line delivered to Levy back in her 20s by a creepy, voyeuristic neighbour. She also writes of her early passion for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/colette\">Colette</a>, a woman who \u201chad a self-possessed kind of beauty\u201d and, importantly for the teenage Levy, was \u201ca writer who looked like a movie star\u201d. She identifies with Duras as someone who \u201cwas a reckless thinker, an egomaniac, a bit preposterous really\u201d, which is as close as Levy will get to sending herself up. There is a long, interesting piece about Elizabeth Hardwick\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1972/05/04/working-girls-the-brontes/\">essay on the Bront\u00eb sisters</a> and an essay on Lee Miller. Most of the pieces are culled from book introductions or periodicals and journals, but there are a few new additions, and Levy is keen to make the case that, in collected form, these pieces offer a portrait of the artist, as well as a continuation of themes started elsewhere. \u201cIn the years I was writing and wasn\u2019t being published,\u201d she says, \u201cmy preoccupations weren\u2019t the preoccupations of a generation of editors. So you just keep going! You are what you are.\u201d The book is, she says, \u201ca conversation with readers, and with myself\u201d.</p>    <p>It is also Levy\u2019s first volume of nonfiction to be published since her tremendous success with what she calls \u201cliving autobiographies\u201d, a trilogy of indeterminate genre in which she passionately and fiercely invests the details of her life with a real and rare luminosity. Taken as a whole, these books \u2013 Things I Don\u2019t Want to Know, The Cost of Living and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/may/03/real-estate-by-deborah-levy-review-a-dialogue-between-art-and-life\">Real Estate</a> \u2013 offer an outline of Levy\u2019s life, from her childhood in South Africa as the daughter of an anti-apartheid activist father who went to jail, to the end of her marriage in north London. More broadly, they serve as a corrective to the dismissal of women\u2019s lives in general and of middle-aged women in particular. Rightly, they have made Levy\u2019s name, although one gets the impression she is rather bored of talking about them now. Levy has written nine novels, two of which have been shortlisted for the Booker prize, and is clearly of the view that fiction is the real art. Nonetheless, it is her nonfiction, or her sort-of-nonfiction, that has won her legions of fans, and no matter how firmly she insists that \u201cthey\u2019re obsessed with the writing\u201d, what I think they are obsessed with is the model she offers of someone who dares to take herself completely, utterly seriously.</p>    <p>What those readers will make of the new book may be a test of how far that fanship goes. All writers are permitted a water-treading volume after a big success, but the slightness of some of the pieces in The Position of Spoons gives an impression of Levy as casting about somewhat wildly for material. Shoes \u2026 what about shoes? Or shoes and socks? (\u201cSockless people have a kind of abandon in their body. They walk with zip.\u201d) Or how about electricity pylons as a governing image for the transmission of thought? (\u201cYou stand like a dancer, like an ogre, like a shaman, like a child in a rage. You are certain of your gravity.\u201d) These observations are intended to be playful, of course, but in spite of her relish for the avant garde, I suspect playfulness may not be Levy\u2019s natural idiom.</p> <p>But why shouldn\u2019t Levy range up and down the creative spectrum? Those idols about whom she writes in the book have all made similar journeys, and Levy is at her most thrilling when defending their right, and the right of female artists more generally, to change direction without getting it in the neck. Take Lee Miller, the Vogue model turned war photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/15/lee-review-kate-winslet-remarkable-portrait-of-war-photographer-lee-miller-ellen-kuras\">recently depicted by Kate Winslet</a>. Endless words have been spent trying to understand what Miller thought she was up to, and yet, says Levy, \u201cyou don\u2019t really ask how Cocteau put himself together. Cocteau, who I\u2019m very fond of as an artist, could be a director and a critic and a novelist and a film-maker and a poet and a visual artist and a designer. No one\u2019s saying: Jean Cocteau, how did you fit together?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Part of the writing journey is to escape from my mother \u2013 you have to become someone else</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Or how about Federico<strong> </strong>Fellini? \u201cWho\u2019s asking how do we put Fellini together?\u201d This question of limitations is one Levy herself has been plagued by and is why she gets so annoyed when people mistake the living autobiographies for nonfiction, pure and simple. Asked how she succeeds in transforming the e-bikes and garden sheds and pot plants of the trilogy into such vessels of emotional and literary meaning, she points to the double standard. \u201cNo one is asking Fellini about how he includes the everyday in his films, which he kind of does. And we have to remember that Virginia Woolf, when To the Lighthouse was first published in America, I think it was described as \u2018domestic psychology\u2019. So this idea that material space, spaces for living \u2013 we call them domestic spaces, but let\u2019s call them living spaces \u2013 why would they not be important?\u201d Under the blowtorch of Levy\u2019s attention, domestic space and everything in it is transformed into something radically meaningful.</p> <p>Really, what Levy is writing about in this mode is delight and the joy contained within small things. The Cost of Living, for example, considers the possibility of creating \u201ca utopia in a modest way. When you say that word utopia, it sounds so grand and unobtainable. But in the most modest living space, you know, you can put a table down, and place some chairs around it, and curate the table. Who are you going to invite to that table? And in this arrangement of space, you\u2019re creating something like the life you want. No matter how modest. No matter how grand. The light\u2019s coming in this way, the chairs are arranged this way. This is a small, utopian gesture. But because it\u2019s supposed to be domestic \u2013 oh no!\u201d</p> <p>This is why people love Levy: she has an uncanny ability to honour and redeem aspects of experience routinely dismissed as trivial. In her fiction, meanwhile, characters are inclined to undertake sudden, sometimes dizzying, often baffling changes of direction. In her 2012 Booker shortlisted novel, Swimming Home, this entailed Kitty Finch, a terrible driver, tearing around a bunch of hairpin bends while the man she is with clings on for dear life. Levy has always been bold, she says; there was no sudden midlife change in outlook. When she wrote her first novel, Beautiful Mutants, on a typewriter in the late 1980s, \u201cI had a very particular black eyeliner, silver platform boots, a lot of mascara and a cigarette,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing that isn\u2019t bold about that book. There\u2019s even a long conversation with a llama in London zoo. That book is about a female banker who feels so powerful and invincible \u2026 It\u2019s a kind of state of the nation book, written in the Thatcher years. And you could say that women weren\u2019t allowed to write state of the nation books, and how that book was read then and how it might be read now is different.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My brief was to write a play about contemporary anxiety. Well, I mean, how many do you want?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Levy\u2019s self-belief had to be solid, given the years of obscurity and low income. \u201cA writer\u2019s career is always choppy. Not every writer, but most.\u201d As a result, she says, it is important to make a distinction between stamina and endurance, the former a necessary characteristic for any writer in it for the long haul (\u201cI\u2019ve been writing since my 20s, and I was 50 when I had some commercial success and became better known\u201d), the latter a reductive and unhelpful female aspiration. We talk about the Bront\u00eb sisters, whose plaque in Westminster Abbey is inscribed with the epigraph \u201cWith Courage to Endure\u201d. Levy rolls her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m most against it,\u201d she says. \u201cEndurance, sacrifice, cheerful forbearance: it\u2019s supposed to be a talent. Our talent. And we have so many other talents. I mean, the Bront\u00ebs; what makes me so sad about that is what those Bront\u00eb women were really good at was writing. What about that feeling where you\u2019ve finished a book, and you\u2019ve gone far away to reach it? They would have had those feelings, that feeling of elation.<strong> </strong>Not just endurance.\u201d</p> <p>Among the best and most tender of Levy\u2019s writing is Letter to a Stranger, a piece in the new collection in which she recalls visiting her mother in hospital during the last days of her life. Giving her mother a set of headphones and a radio programme to listen to about crows, Levy nestled beside her on the hospital bed. \u201cI thought she would like it,\u201d she says, of the radio programme. \u201cIt would take her out of the hospital bed where she had lots of tubes in her body. I wanted to take her right out into the woods. And there it was: crows.\u201d In the piece, her mother turns to her daughter and says: \u201cCrows have brains that are as big as a gorilla\u2019s.\u201d Levy smiles. \u201cIt was one of the happiest memories, really, of that terrible time. I\u2019ve written quite a lot about my mother now. Who would have thought?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/aug/25/best-of-2023-so-far-how-deborah-levy-can-change-your-life-podcast\">Best of 2023 \u2026 so far: How Deborah Levy can change your life \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why the surprise? \u201cI suppose because part of the writing journey is to escape from my mother. You have to become someone else.

Recently, she was commissioned to write a play for a theatre in Zurich. Her background as a writer is theatrical; in her 20s, Levy was a writer and director for the Man Act theatre company and she has written scores of plays. \u201cMy brief was to write a play about contemporary anxiety,\u201d she says. \u201cWell, I mean, how many do you want?\u201d The<strong> </strong>first play she has written in 25 years, it is due to open in January next year. \u201cHere\u2019s the title \u2013 are you ready?: 50 Minutes, the War War Jaw Jaw Bunny Play.\u201d It takes a moment to process this, and Levy revels in the confusion before explaining what it means. \u201cFifty minutes refers to the psychoanalytic hour, right?

      "bodyText": "Deborah Levy is a presence, entering a cafe in north London with slightly wild hair, a large brooch at her throat and a Lime bike parked across the street, ready to convey her back up the hill after our interview. At 65, she has an appeal that is both literary and popular, with an intensity matched only by the devotion of her readers. In the first moments of our interview, Levy whips out her phone to show me a photo of a woman she met in Italy who, to Levy\u2019s delight, had a tattoo on her upper arm of the French writer Marguerite Duras. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d do it,\u201d she says thoughtfully of the tattoo, but it seems to me there are women out there for whom a tattoo of Levy wouldn\u2019t be a gesture too far. Levy has written about Duras in a new collection, The Position of Spoons, a series of short (in some cases, very short) pieces in which the title essay refers to a line delivered to Levy back in her 20s by a creepy, voyeuristic neighbour. She also writes of her early passion for Colette, a woman who \u201chad a self-possessed kind of beauty\u201d and, importantly for the teenage Levy, was \u201ca writer who looked like a movie star\u201d. She identifies with Duras as someone who \u201cwas a reckless thinker, an egomaniac, a bit preposterous really\u201d, which is as close as Levy will get to sending herself up. There is a long, interesting piece about Elizabeth Hardwick\u2019s essay on the Bront\u00eb sisters and an essay on Lee Miller. Most of the pieces are culled from book introductions or periodicals and journals, but there are a few new additions, and Levy is keen to make the case that, in collected form, these pieces offer a portrait of the artist, as well as a continuation of themes started elsewhere. \u201cIn the years I was writing and wasn\u2019t being published,\u201d she says, \u201cmy preoccupations weren\u2019t the preoccupations of a generation of editors. So you just keep going! You are what you are.\u201d The book is, she says, \u201ca conversation with readers, and with myself\u201d. It is also Levy\u2019s first volume of nonfiction to be published since her tremendous success with what she calls \u201cliving autobiographies\u201d, a trilogy of indeterminate genre in which she passionately and fiercely invests the details of her life with a real and rare luminosity. Taken as a whole, these books \u2013 Things I Don\u2019t Want to Know, The Cost of Living and Real Estate \u2013 offer an outline of Levy\u2019s life, from her childhood in South Africa as the daughter of an anti-apartheid activist father who went to jail, to the end of her marriage in north London. More broadly, they serve as a corrective to the dismissal of women\u2019s lives in general and of middle-aged women in particular. Rightly, they have made Levy\u2019s name, although one gets the impression she is rather bored of talking about them now. Levy has written nine novels, two of which have been shortlisted for the Booker prize, and is clearly of the view that fiction is the real art. Nonetheless, it is her nonfiction, or her sort-of-nonfiction, that has won her legions of fans, and no matter how firmly she insists that \u201cthey\u2019re obsessed with the writing\u201d, what I think they are obsessed with is the model she offers of someone who dares to take herself completely, utterly seriously. What those readers will make of the new book may be a test of how far that fanship goes. All writers are permitted a water-treading volume after a big success, but the slightness of some of the pieces in The Position of Spoons gives an impression of Levy as casting about somewhat wildly for material. Shoes \u2026 what about shoes? Or shoes and socks? (\u201cSockless people have a kind of abandon in their body. They walk with zip.\u201d) Or how about electricity pylons as a governing image for the transmission of thought? (\u201cYou stand like a dancer, like an ogre, like a shaman, like a child in a rage. You are certain of your gravity.\u201d) These observations are intended to be playful, of course, but in spite of her relish for the avant garde, I suspect playfulness may not be Levy\u2019s natural idiom. But why shouldn\u2019t Levy range up and down the creative spectrum? Those idols about whom she writes in the book have all made similar journeys, and Levy is at her most thrilling when defending their right, and the right of female artists more generally, to change direction without getting it in the neck. Take Lee Miller, the Vogue model turned war photographer recently depicted by Kate Winslet. Endless words have been spent trying to understand what Miller thought she was up to, and yet, says Levy, \u201cyou don\u2019t really ask how Cocteau put himself together. Cocteau, who I\u2019m very fond of as an artist, could be a director and a critic and a novelist and a film-maker and a poet and a visual artist and a designer. No one\u2019s saying: Jean Cocteau, how did you fit together?\u201d Or how about Federico Fellini? \u201cWho\u2019s asking how do we put Fellini together?\u201d This question of limitations is one Levy herself has been plagued by and is why she gets so annoyed when people mistake the living autobiographies for nonfiction, pure and simple. Asked how she succeeds in transforming the e-bikes and garden sheds and pot plants of the trilogy into such vessels of emotional and literary meaning, she points to the double standard. \u201cNo one is asking Fellini about how he includes the everyday in his films, which he kind of does. And we have to remember that Virginia Woolf, when To the Lighthouse was first published in America, I think it was described as \u2018domestic psychology\u2019. So this idea that material space, spaces for living \u2013 we call them domestic spaces, but let\u2019s call them living spaces \u2013 why would they not be important?\u201d Under the blowtorch of Levy\u2019s attention, domestic space and everything in it is transformed into something radically meaningful. Really, what Levy is writing about in this mode is delight and the joy contained within small things. The Cost of Living, for example, considers the possibility of creating \u201ca utopia in a modest way. When you say that word utopia, it sounds so grand and unobtainable. But in the most modest living space, you know, you can put a table down, and place some chairs around it, and curate the table. Who are you going to invite to that table? And in this arrangement of space, you\u2019re creating something like the life you want. No matter how modest. No matter how grand. The light\u2019s coming in this way, the chairs are arranged this way. This is a small, utopian gesture. But because it\u2019s supposed to be domestic \u2013 oh no!\u201d This is why people love Levy: she has an uncanny ability to honour and redeem aspects of experience routinely dismissed as trivial. In her fiction, meanwhile, characters are inclined to undertake sudden, sometimes dizzying, often baffling changes of direction. In her 2012 Booker shortlisted novel, Swimming Home, this entailed Kitty Finch, a terrible driver, tearing around a bunch of hairpin bends while the man she is with clings on for dear life. Levy has always been bold, she says; there was no sudden midlife change in outlook. When she wrote her first novel, Beautiful Mutants, on a typewriter in the late 1980s, \u201cI had a very particular black eyeliner, silver platform boots, a lot of mascara and a cigarette,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing that isn\u2019t bold about that book. There\u2019s even a long conversation with a llama in London zoo. That book is about a female banker who feels so powerful and invincible \u2026 It\u2019s a kind of state of the nation book, written in the Thatcher years. And you could say that women weren\u2019t allowed to write state of the nation books, and how that book was read then and how it might be read now is different.\u201d Levy\u2019s self-belief had to be solid, given the years of obscurity and low income. \u201cA writer\u2019s career is always choppy. Not every writer, but most.\u201d As a result, she says, it is important to make a distinction between stamina and endurance, the former a necessary characteristic for any writer in it for the long haul (\u201cI\u2019ve been writing since my 20s, and I was 50 when I had some commercial success and became better known\u201d), the latter a reductive and unhelpful female aspiration. We talk about the Bront\u00eb sisters, whose plaque in Westminster Abbey is inscribed with the epigraph \u201cWith Courage to Endure\u201d. Levy rolls her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m most against it,\u201d she says. \u201cEndurance, sacrifice, cheerful forbearance: it\u2019s supposed to be a talent. Our talent. And we have so many other talents. I mean, the Bront\u00ebs; what makes me so sad about that is what those Bront\u00eb women were really good at was writing. What about that feeling where you\u2019ve finished a book, and you\u2019ve gone far away to reach it? They would have had those feelings, that feeling of elation. Not just endurance.\u201d Among the best and most tender of Levy\u2019s writing is Letter to a Stranger, a piece in the new collection in which she recalls visiting her mother in hospital during the last days of her life. Giving her mother a set of headphones and a radio programme to listen to about crows, Levy nestled beside her on the hospital bed. \u201cI thought she would like it,\u201d she says, of the radio programme. \u201cIt would take her out of the hospital bed where she had lots of tubes in her body. I wanted to take her right out into the woods. And there it was: crows.\u201d In the piece, her mother turns to her daughter and says: \u201cCrows have brains that are as big as a gorilla\u2019s.\u201d Levy smiles. \u201cIt was one of the happiest memories, really, of that terrible time. I\u2019ve written quite a lot about my mother now. Who would have thought?\u201d Why the surprise? \u201cI suppose because part of the writing journey is to escape from my mother. You have to become someone else. Unless you\u2019re going to be De Beauvoir and write Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter.\u201d She pauses. \u201cWe have to remember De Beauvoir\u2019s really good statement from that book, something like: \u2018Be loved, be admired, be necessary, be somebody.\u2019\u201d None of Levy\u2019s boldness has waned. Recently, she was commissioned to write a play for a theatre in Zurich. Her background as a writer is theatrical; in her 20s, Levy was a writer and director for the Man Act theatre company and she has written scores of plays. \u201cMy brief was to write a play about contemporary anxiety,\u201d she says. \u201cWell, I mean, how many do you want?\u201d The first play she has written in 25 years, it is due to open in January next year. \u201cHere\u2019s the title \u2013 are you ready?: 50 Minutes, the War War Jaw Jaw Bunny Play.\u201d It takes a moment to process this, and Levy revels in the confusion before explaining what it means. \u201cFifty minutes refers to the psychoanalytic hour, right? And war war jaw jaw speaks for itself. And the bunny play refers to the fact that this is a two-hander, a conversation between a Freud-like character and a rabbit.\u201d Levy grins. \u201cSo this beautiful rabbit mask is being made in a workshop in Zurich as we speak. I very much enjoyed writing that.\u201d She found it empowering to put words into someone else\u2019s mouth, she says. \u201cExhilarating.\u201d She also loved having a chance to work on the fly. \u201cDuring rehearsals, if you wrote a dud line and it died in the actor\u2019s mouth, you quickly learned \u2013 oh, excuse me, let\u2019s just change that now! I\u2019d have the pencil in my hand and reshape it. And then it would work.\u201d It sounds like a great antidote to perfectionism, I suggest, and Levy looks fleetingly indignant. \u201cIt absolutely has to be perfect, but \u2026\u201d OK: to preciousness, then. \u201cOh, yes. You\u2019re not going to land a bad line. You just think: this poor skilled actor, this line isn\u2019t good enough, so I\u2019m a quite brutal editor.\u201d Levy is, equally brutal as an editor of her prose, she says, \u201cand honestly, I don\u2019t know to this day if that\u2019s a blessing or a flaw.\u201d Perhaps, she wonders, she should unclench a bit.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s one story of the 2024 presidential contest that says that this election is all about men, and their anger. Men, in this account, have gotten a raw deal: the decline of the industrial economy in the years since the postwar boom means that many of the jobs that gave dignity, structure, and steady paychecks to their fathers are now gone, and some men, especially those without college degrees, have fallen into a cycle of desperation and despair, unable to make the kind of living for which they could respect themselves. </p> <p>This economic argument about men is usually followed by a cultural one: that women aren\u2019t as nice to men as they should be, or maybe not as nice to men as they used to be. On one end of this conversation, there are paeans to male loneliness and discussions of the male suicide rate, quasi-poetic odes to their depths of despair and acute feeling: women just don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to be sad the way that men are sad. </p> <p>On the other end, writers and commentators point to more recent cultural trends that they say have alienated men, making them feel attacked or unnecessary. They point, apparently seriously, to the fact that some young feminists online have used the term \u201ctoxic masculinity,\u201d which they say makes men feel bad, bad enough that their feelings are an emergency for the nation. They point to those t-shirts that were popular in 2017 that said, \u201cThe Future Is Female.\u201d This, too, is reflective of a great social pathology, a sign that we as a nation have failed men and boys. Why, they plead, can\u2019t the future be male?</p> <p>Those who worry for the state of men may be right that young men and boys feel this way.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s one story of the 2024 presidential contest that says that this election is all about men, and their anger. Men, in this account, have gotten a raw deal: the decline of the industrial economy in the years since the postwar boom means that many of the jobs that gave dignity, structure, and steady paychecks to their fathers are now gone, and some men, especially those without college degrees, have fallen into a cycle of desperation and despair, unable to make the kind of living for which they could respect themselves. This economic argument about men is usually followed by a cultural one: that women aren\u2019t as nice to men as they should be, or maybe not as nice to men as they used to be. On one end of this conversation, there are paeans to male loneliness and discussions of the male suicide rate, quasi-poetic odes to their depths of despair and acute feeling: women just don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to be sad the way that men are sad. On the other end, writers and commentators point to more recent cultural trends that they say have alienated men, making them feel attacked or unnecessary. They point, apparently seriously, to the fact that some young feminists online have used the term \u201ctoxic masculinity,\u201d which they say makes men feel bad, bad enough that their feelings are an emergency for the nation. They point to those t-shirts that were popular in 2017 that said, \u201cThe Future Is Female.\u201d This, too, is reflective of a great social pathology, a sign that we as a nation have failed men and boys. Why, they plead, can\u2019t the future be male? Those who worry for the state of men may be right that young men and boys feel this way. They may be right that the men of America are small-minded and narcissistic enough that they can be driven to depression and self-doubt by the sight of a novelty t-shirt that doesn\u2019t defer to them sufficiently. They may be right that women\u2019s modest but real gains over the past decades \u2013 their surge into the paid workforce in the decades since the second wave era, their more modest efforts to encourage a more egalitarian realignment of their private heterosexual relationships \u2013 have driven men to the brink.

      "body": "<p>The 2024 presidential election is, as best as anyone can tell from the inexact art of polling, essentially a toss-up. No one knows who is going to win on Tuesday (and we probably won\u2019t know for a while afterwards, for that matter). In lieu of any definitive edge in numbers, both prognosticators and casual observers are resorting to vibes \u2013 that amorphous, indefinable and personal sense of who has the momentum, where the energy is shifting, what <em>feels </em>true. And for the candidates, one guaranteed way to assert a vibe \u2013 albeit maybe not the one they intended \u2013 is to recruit arguably the defining element of modern American politics: celebrity.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/01/us-election-avengers-cast-kamala-harris-endorsement\">Avengers stars assemble to endorse Kamala Harris \u2013 by brainstorming an election catchphrase</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In the past two weeks alone, both Trump and Harris have assembled their respective famous avengers (including in Harris\u2019s case, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/01/us-election-avengers-cast-kamala-harris-endorsement\">the actual Avengers</a>), to stump for their campaign. Harris, unsurprisingly, boasts far more and higher-profile endorsements, including but not limited to: Taylor Swift, LeBron James, George Clooney, Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Marc Anthony, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tyler Perry, Usher, Lizzo, Eminem and the Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, who released a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBtmbHquuhb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=c614dd04-f65a-4a24-82cd-fe3fa4a83347\">video</a> this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/27/bad-bunny-supports-kamala-harris\">rebuking the racist comments</a> made by the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/27/trump-madison-square-garden-rally\">rally at Madison Square Garden</a>. During the final weeks of the campaign, Harris was joined on the trail by Beyonc\u00e9, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, Maggie Rogers, Willie Nelson, Jennifer Lopez and Oprah, among others.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"679fcf94-edfe-4814-a368-e1b197a8da86\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GdM83aAiQrI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>What to make of the roster? On the one hand, it suggests a level of popular enthusiasm for Harris in strong contrast to Trump, who has trotted out his usual stable of ex-wrestlers and a handful of actors. Celebrities joining the Trump campaign in the past month include Kid Rock, Elon Musk, Hulk Hogan, Dennis Quaid, Zachary Levi, the rapper Kodak Black, Dr Phil, the former NFL quarterback Brett Favre and country singer Jason Aldean. Celebrity endorsements are one way to measure the vibes in an election whose polls are too close \u2013 and, for a large swath of the electorate either scarred or delighted by 2016, too untrustworthy \u2013 to reasonably make out the frontrunner, and on the level of star power, Harris certainly has the edge.</p> \n<p>But a bulwark of celebrity support also presents what Shamira Ibrahim, writing for the Guardian just after Swift\u2019s much-coveted endorsement in September, called a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/14/harris-celebrity-support-useful\">\u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d</a> of Hollywood glitz. Endorsements may gin up enthusiasm among a star\u2019s fanbase, but they also play into Republicans\u2019 arguments that Democrats are the party of the coastal elites. (It should be noted, however, that Trump, a celebrity by trade, has not shied away from any semi-famous endorsement, even posting an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/24/trump-taylor-swift-deepfakes-ai\">AI deepfake Swift endorsement</a> that she later condemned.)</p> \n<p>It also gives the impression of desperation \u2013 either on behalf of the campaign or the celebrities \u2013 for relevancy in an election that has been relatively light on substantive issues (again, an unfair double standard for the Trump campaign, but a complaint lodged by many in Harris\u2019s own party). As Harris has stumped for her expanded child tax credit, building back the middle class, restoring reproductive freedoms and \u201cnot going back\u201d, many headlines have focused on her guests \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/beyonce-brings-star-power-to-harris-rally-in-texas-with-abortion-law-in-the-spotlight\">beatific presence of Beyonc\u00e9</a> chief among them, giving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/im-with-her-beyonce-and-jay-z-back-hillary-clinton-in-battleground-state-of-ohio\">uncanny flashbacks</a> to the final self-satisfied days of Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016.</p> \n<p>All this celebrity speechifying, while there is still little evidence to support the notion that celebrity endorsements make much of a difference. The gold standard example of celebrity influence remains Oprah supporting Barack Obama in 2008 \u2013 her first presidential endorsement, <a href=\"https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/the_oprah_effect\">credited</a> with bringing in about 1m votes for the then-Illinois senator. But that was during the Democratic primary, when engaged Democratic voters were largely deciding between Obama and Clinton, not the general election between Obama and John McCain. For general elections, celebrity effect remains difficult to quantify, and more or less minor. According to a recent <a href=\"https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/documents/Celebrity_Political_Influence_poll_results.pdf\">YouGov survey</a>, only 11% of Americans report that a celebrity has caused them to reconsider their stance on a political issue, and only 7% say an endorsement has led them to vote for a certain candidate.

      "bodyText": "The 2024 presidential election is, as best as anyone can tell from the inexact art of polling, essentially a toss-up. No one knows who is going to win on Tuesday (and we probably won\u2019t know for a while afterwards, for that matter). In lieu of any definitive edge in numbers, both prognosticators and casual observers are resorting to vibes \u2013 that amorphous, indefinable and personal sense of who has the momentum, where the energy is shifting, what feels true. And for the candidates, one guaranteed way to assert a vibe \u2013 albeit maybe not the one they intended \u2013 is to recruit arguably the defining element of modern American politics: celebrity. In the past two weeks alone, both Trump and Harris have assembled their respective famous avengers (including in Harris\u2019s case, the actual Avengers), to stump for their campaign. Harris, unsurprisingly, boasts far more and higher-profile endorsements, including but not limited to: Taylor Swift, LeBron James, George Clooney, Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Marc Anthony, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tyler Perry, Usher, Lizzo, Eminem and the Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, who released a video this week rebuking the racist comments made by the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during Trump\u2019s rally at Madison Square Garden. During the final weeks of the campaign, Harris was joined on the trail by Beyonc\u00e9, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, Maggie Rogers, Willie Nelson, Jennifer Lopez and Oprah, among others. What to make of the roster? On the one hand, it suggests a level of popular enthusiasm for Harris in strong contrast to Trump, who has trotted out his usual stable of ex-wrestlers and a handful of actors. Celebrities joining the Trump campaign in the past month include Kid Rock, Elon Musk, Hulk Hogan, Dennis Quaid, Zachary Levi, the rapper Kodak Black, Dr Phil, the former NFL quarterback Brett Favre and country singer Jason Aldean. Celebrity endorsements are one way to measure the vibes in an election whose polls are too close \u2013 and, for a large swath of the electorate either scarred or delighted by 2016, too untrustworthy \u2013 to reasonably make out the frontrunner, and on the level of star power, Harris certainly has the edge. But a bulwark of celebrity support also presents what Shamira Ibrahim, writing for the Guardian just after Swift\u2019s much-coveted endorsement in September, called a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d of Hollywood glitz. Endorsements may gin up enthusiasm among a star\u2019s fanbase, but they also play into Republicans\u2019 arguments that Democrats are the party of the coastal elites. (It should be noted, however, that Trump, a celebrity by trade, has not shied away from any semi-famous endorsement, even posting an AI deepfake Swift endorsement that she later condemned.) It also gives the impression of desperation \u2013 either on behalf of the campaign or the celebrities \u2013 for relevancy in an election that has been relatively light on substantive issues (again, an unfair double standard for the Trump campaign, but a complaint lodged by many in Harris\u2019s own party). As Harris has stumped for her expanded child tax credit, building back the middle class, restoring reproductive freedoms and \u201cnot going back\u201d, many headlines have focused on her guests \u2013 the beatific presence of Beyonc\u00e9 chief among them, giving uncanny flashbacks to the final self-satisfied days of Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016. All this celebrity speechifying, while there is still little evidence to support the notion that celebrity endorsements make much of a difference. The gold standard example of celebrity influence remains Oprah supporting Barack Obama in 2008 \u2013 her first presidential endorsement, credited with bringing in about 1m votes for the then-Illinois senator. But that was during the Democratic primary, when engaged Democratic voters were largely deciding between Obama and Clinton, not the general election between Obama and John McCain. For general elections, celebrity effect remains difficult to quantify, and more or less minor. According to a recent YouGov survey, only 11% of Americans report that a celebrity has caused them to reconsider their stance on a political issue, and only 7% say an endorsement has led them to vote for a certain candidate. Democrats are far more likely to say that celebrities weighing in on politics helps democracy, though still less than half of them do \u2013 41% compared with 12% for independents and 7% for Republicans. Where celebrities can make a difference is in attracting fundraising, attention and participation, if not necessarily shifting a vote. After Swift posted her endorsement of Harris in September, 406,000 people clicked her link to Vote.gov, which directs people to state voting websites (though it\u2019s unknown how many followed through and actually registered). A 2024 study by the Harvard Kennedy School found that celebrities can increase voter registration or poll worker signups with their platforms, particularly for younger voters disillusioned with older voices or institutions. One cited example was when Kylie Jenner posted a non-partisan voter registration link in 2020; the site later reported a 1,500% increase in traffic compared with the day before and an 80% increase in total users registering to vote. As David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, put it to CBS 58: \u201cOverall, celebrities would like to think they could influence voter behavior, but they are more valuable as fundraising tools and door-opening opportunities to their followers.\u201d Registering to vote is, while not nothing, also not the same as actually going to vote, let alone voting for a celebrity\u2019s preferred candidate. But when the election may come down to a handful of counties in a few states, in an election projected to feature record voter turnout from gen Z, the vibe is urgent. There\u2019s a sense of desperation, trying to get every single voter over the finish line \u2013 maybe a Maggie Rogers fan in Michigan, or a Beyonc\u00e9 fan in Houston, or a secretly Harris-leaning woman moved by Julia Roberts\u2019s ad, although it\u2019s admittedly hard to fathom how a voter either undecided or tuned out would 1) pay attention to just the rally with said celebrity or 2) seriously reconsider not voting for Trump because of it.

His two-year-old buzzes around as we speak.</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m also enjoying the role of trying to be an assistant coach \u2026 it\u2019s a time to give back, to shape the next generation.\u201d</p> <p>Baker is assisting Simon Amor, the new USA men\u2019s sevens coach, at the Olympic training center at Chula Vista near San Diego. But \u201cit\u2019s just until January. I\u2019m praying to God that I can land something that\u2019s permanent.\u201d</p> <p>It seems remarkable that such a talent \u2013 tall and rangy like the wide receiver he was, briefly signed by the Philadelphia Eagles, fast as the wind, trickier than Bill McLaren\u2019s proverbial <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/sport/rugby/rugby-union/news-comment/classic-phrases-from-commentator-bill-mclaren-1545616.html\">bag of weasels</a> \u2013 should be left looking for work. But in the US, where rugby\u2019s roots are shallow and coaching and media gigs few, so it often goes.</p> <p>Baker thought about playing on, for at least another year on the sevens circuit. But the end of the Olympic cycle brought changes \u2013 Amor replacing another Englishman, Mike Friday, as coach, players changing too \u2013 and Baker could \u201csee it\u2019s just time to move on. Just knowing your time is over.</p> <p>\u201cI enjoy playing, and I will still play sevens at some point, but on an international level, doing that day in day out, and traveling, it just came to be a lot on the body. Now I think I\u2019m ready to transition for something else and find happiness somewhere else. I thought about playing 15s. Like, if things don\u2019t go as well as I want being an assistant coach at the national level, then I\u2019ll definitely consider pursuing the MLR.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/03/new-england-seattle-major-league-rugby-mlr\">Major League Rugby</a>, the US professional men\u2019s 15s competition, will play its eighth season next year. The league is experiencing its usual ferment \u2013 the Dallas Jackals <a href=\"https://www.si.com/onsi/rugby/dallas-jackals-withdraw-from-major-league-rugby-2025-season-01j8amcempz2\">will not compete</a> in 2025 \u2013 but Baker would bring serious star power.</p> <p>\u201cI know that my age is a factor for a lot of people,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m not old on playing rugby body-wise.\u201d</p> <p>Baker found rugby young, in Florida with the imperishably named <a href=\"https://daytonabeachrugby.org/\">Daytona Beach Coconuts</a>, but only took to it full-time at 27, in 2013 with Tiger Rugby in Ohio. He was soon a USA regular and though a decade on the sevens world circuit would test anyone physically, Baker is a wing, not a forward constantly taking and dealing hits, and he hasn\u2019t done too badly for injuries. Tom Brady won a seventh Super Bowl at 43. Aaron Rodgers is seeking a second at 40. Baker could surely shine in MLR.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an IQ issue for me. I\u2019m smart enough, I know how to play the game, understand the game, I read the field different, I\u2019m still athletic enough to play, I can still jump, I can still definitely run and do those good things. So I definitely wouldn\u2019t mind to go to 15s for a little while, just to have that under my belt as well, and maybe even help bring exposure on that end too. Because being on a national level, playing sevens for so long, I think I have a fanbase.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH34BruV7Tc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AH34BruV7Tc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Perry Baker scores against Fiji in 2018.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He does. He continues to light up the internet, particularly with what World Rugby <a href=\"https://www.world.rugby/news/607222/hsbc-world-rugby-sevens-series-greatest-moments\">called</a> \u201ca try from the gods\u201d, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH34BruV7Tc\">100-meter special</a> against Fiji in Las Vegas in 2018, a flurry of steps and swerves to beat four men in no space before a racehorse dash for the line.</p> <p>Baker\u2019s Eagles won that tournament, beating Samoa, Australia, Spain, England, Fiji and Argentina. They won other titles too but when it came to the Olympics, Rio 2016, Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024, they fell short each time.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Olympic glory wasn\u2019t always the plan. As Baker says, that \u201cwas to finish college [Fairmont State, in West Virginia], go to the NFL, and play in the NFL for like eight to 10 years, and then be retired by the time I\u2019m 32 years old.\u201d A knee injury, detected after he <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/sports/columnists/philadelphia-eagles-perry-baker-olympics-us-rugby-sevens-20240726.html\">signed</a> for Philadelphia, scotched that. There were a couple of seasons of arena football, then Baker switched to rugby. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, OK, now I go to the Olympic Games. I\u2019ll be 28, I\u2019ll play for a couple years, do a World Cup [Sevens], I\u2019ll be done by the time I\u2019m 32. Didn\u2019t work that way either.\u201d</p>    <p>Asked about high points of his sevens career, Baker offers a hymn to squad spirit.</p> <p>\u201cStuff with the boys, that\u2019s what I miss the most, to be honest. The good times with the boys. I was with those guys so much and it\u2019s like, now everyone\u2019s just gone, doing their own thing. People are married now. People have kids now. You talk about it so much, but you don\u2019t realize until you\u2019re not in it anymore. Watching this new group that\u2019s in, it\u2019s like, man \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>Asked for low points, Baker goes to a similarly wistful place. And keeps going.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not doing what we set out to do \u2013 not finishing the job at the Olympic Games. The first one [Rio] was like the unknown kind of deal. Tokyo was the one that we knew we could win, and we didn\u2019t get the job done. And then I was the same on the last one, [in Paris] for sure, but the medal wasn\u2019t for me.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the day, I felt like I\u2019ve let so many people down who supported me over these 10 years. And why I say that is, like, I have nothing for them, nothing for those people whose support has been behind us, who believed in us. I played this thing for 10 years. My wife sacrificed so much for 10 years for me, and I just wanted to let her hold up a freaking medal from the Olympic Games. To have my kids brag about it. Like, my two-year-old, I don\u2019t even know if they still do show and tell at school, but it\u2019d be something cool he could take. To give to my family, my parents, the supporters, my mate who introduced me to rugby, let him put the medal around his neck and hold it, just to see their reactions.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why this last one, I wanted it the most \u2026 Oh, man. It\u2019s just \u2026 I don\u2019t know. Like, something I feel I will never get over. When you look at sports, you\u2019ll always have highs and lows. But I feel the Olympics is the pinnacle of it all, and that was the main reason why I chose to come play rugby, was to be an Olympian, was to chase a gold medal, and to do it three times is not easy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/article/2024/aug/29/us-rugby-star-ilona-maher-feminist-trailblazer-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-shoot\">US rugby star Ilona Maher hailed as \u2018feminist trailblazer\u2019 for swimsuit shoot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Baker chased a dream, and missed. It\u2019s a stark contrast to the sheer joy of the USA women\u2019s team after they won bronze in Paris with a last-second defeat of Australia. As Baker speaks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/article/2024/aug/29/us-rugby-star-ilona-maher-feminist-trailblazer-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-shoot\">Ilona Maher, the women\u2019s star player</a>, is shining on Dancing with the Stars on ABC, Olympic success stoking internet fame. Baker salutes the women\u2019s achievement \u2026 and watches, wistful for what might have been.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>If the women\u2019s success is not to be a blip, if American rugby is to flourish before hosting 15s World Cups in 2031 (men) and 2033 (women), there is work to do. Players must be found and funneled into the national teams, as Baker was himself.</p> <p>To that end, Baker has partnered with Dallen Stanford, a sevens Eagle turned commentator, and Steve Lewis, a mainstay of the sevens game based in New York, to launch <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rugbytenschampionship/p/DBTy40TMgeX/?img_index=1\">FlagX</a>: a US iteration of a touch rugby organization born in Australia that provides competition for men and women, emphasizing attacking skills and fitness, the better to boost tackle teams in sevens and 15s all the way to national level.</p> <p>Baker has already run <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/perrybakerrugbycamps\">Perry Baker Rugby Camps</a>, \u201cbecause I want to introduce rugby and get rugby to grow. If you think about rugby in America, one of the biggest things is our skill level, our rugby IQ level, is so low. You can watch a million videos and start to process it but you are not practicing skills at all, and so we\u2019re always behind the top 10 nations. So with [<a href=\"https://thednvr.com/dnvr-rugby-podcast-flag-rugby-x-with-world-rugby-commentator-dallen-stanford/\">FlagX</a>] we\u2019re going to take a step further. It\u2019s a way of introducing a sport to newcomers who are afraid of the contact. So you get rid of the contact, you have flags, and then you\u2019re still implementing the skill levels. But not only that, now it can be a fundraising tool. You\u2019re raising money, and it\u2019s staying in the club, so now your club can be sustainable.\u201d</p>    <p>The idea is to make FlagX \u201ckinda like CrossFit\u201d \u2013 a franchise model, clubs posting scores and competing virtually, a community committed to its game as well as having fun and keeping in shape. The effort will keep Baker busy. But as he says more than once, he\u2019s still trying to figure out precisely what the rest of his working life will hold.</p> <p>\u201cHeck, I\u2019m all over the place. I\u2019m trying to laugh. My main thing I want to do is be an assistant coach and also do my FlagX rugby. Those are my two things I really want to do.\u201d But he also harbors a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/28/sport/perry-baker-rugby-sevens-usa-eagles-intl/index.html\">vivid dream</a> of a complete career switch \u2013 to law enforcement.</p> <p>Years ago, Baker <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/28/sport/perry-baker-rugby-sevens-usa-eagles-intl/index.html\">interned</a> with the New York Police Department.

      "bodyText": "Perry Baker is a three-time Olympian and two-time World Rugby Men\u2019s Sevens Player of the Year, second for all-time tries scored on the sevens circuit. He has a live claim to be not just the greatest American sevens player of all time but one of the greatest rugby players of all time \u2013 from any country, in any form of the game. Right now, though, he just needs a full-time job. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying retirement a lot,\u201d Baker says, not long after confirming his decision to stop playing at 38. \u201cBeing around the kids more, being at home more.\u201d Baker has three sons, aged two to 20. His two-year-old buzzes around as we speak. \u201cBut I\u2019m also enjoying the role of trying to be an assistant coach \u2026 it\u2019s a time to give back, to shape the next generation.\u201d Baker is assisting Simon Amor, the new USA men\u2019s sevens coach, at the Olympic training center at Chula Vista near San Diego. But \u201cit\u2019s just until January. I\u2019m praying to God that I can land something that\u2019s permanent.\u201d It seems remarkable that such a talent \u2013 tall and rangy like the wide receiver he was, briefly signed by the Philadelphia Eagles, fast as the wind, trickier than Bill McLaren\u2019s proverbial bag of weasels \u2013 should be left looking for work. But in the US, where rugby\u2019s roots are shallow and coaching and media gigs few, so it often goes. Baker thought about playing on, for at least another year on the sevens circuit. But the end of the Olympic cycle brought changes \u2013 Amor replacing another Englishman, Mike Friday, as coach, players changing too \u2013 and Baker could \u201csee it\u2019s just time to move on. Just knowing your time is over. \u201cI enjoy playing, and I will still play sevens at some point, but on an international level, doing that day in day out, and traveling, it just came to be a lot on the body. Now I think I\u2019m ready to transition for something else and find happiness somewhere else. I thought about playing 15s. Like, if things don\u2019t go as well as I want being an assistant coach at the national level, then I\u2019ll definitely consider pursuing the MLR.\u201d Major League Rugby, the US professional men\u2019s 15s competition, will play its eighth season next year. The league is experiencing its usual ferment \u2013 the Dallas Jackals will not compete in 2025 \u2013 but Baker would bring serious star power. \u201cI know that my age is a factor for a lot of people,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m not old on playing rugby body-wise.\u201d Baker found rugby young, in Florida with the imperishably named Daytona Beach Coconuts, but only took to it full-time at 27, in 2013 with Tiger Rugby in Ohio. He was soon a USA regular and though a decade on the sevens world circuit would test anyone physically, Baker is a wing, not a forward constantly taking and dealing hits, and he hasn\u2019t done too badly for injuries. Tom Brady won a seventh Super Bowl at 43. Aaron Rodgers is seeking a second at 40. Baker could surely shine in MLR. \u201cIt\u2019s an IQ issue for me. I\u2019m smart enough, I know how to play the game, understand the game, I read the field different, I\u2019m still athletic enough to play, I can still jump, I can still definitely run and do those good things. So I definitely wouldn\u2019t mind to go to 15s for a little while, just to have that under my belt as well, and maybe even help bring exposure on that end too. Because being on a national level, playing sevens for so long, I think I have a fanbase.\u201d He does. He continues to light up the internet, particularly with what World Rugby called \u201ca try from the gods\u201d, a 100-meter special against Fiji in Las Vegas in 2018, a flurry of steps and swerves to beat four men in no space before a racehorse dash for the line. Baker\u2019s Eagles won that tournament, beating Samoa, Australia, Spain, England, Fiji and Argentina. They won other titles too but when it came to the Olympics, Rio 2016, Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024, they fell short each time. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Olympic glory wasn\u2019t always the plan. As Baker says, that \u201cwas to finish college [Fairmont State, in West Virginia], go to the NFL, and play in the NFL for like eight to 10 years, and then be retired by the time I\u2019m 32 years old.\u201d A knee injury, detected after he signed for Philadelphia, scotched that. There were a couple of seasons of arena football, then Baker switched to rugby. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, OK, now I go to the Olympic Games. I\u2019ll be 28, I\u2019ll play for a couple years, do a World Cup [Sevens], I\u2019ll be done by the time I\u2019m 32. Didn\u2019t work that way either.\u201d Asked about high points of his sevens career, Baker offers a hymn to squad spirit. \u201cStuff with the boys, that\u2019s what I miss the most, to be honest. The good times with the boys. I was with those guys so much and it\u2019s like, now everyone\u2019s just gone, doing their own thing. People are married now. People have kids now. You talk about it so much, but you don\u2019t realize until you\u2019re not in it anymore. Watching this new group that\u2019s in, it\u2019s like, man \u2026 \u201d Asked for low points, Baker goes to a similarly wistful place. And keeps going. \u201cIt\u2019s just not doing what we set out to do \u2013 not finishing the job at the Olympic Games. The first one [Rio] was like the unknown kind of deal. Tokyo was the one that we knew we could win, and we didn\u2019t get the job done. And then I was the same on the last one, [in Paris] for sure, but the medal wasn\u2019t for me. \u201cAt the end of the day, I felt like I\u2019ve let so many people down who supported me over these 10 years. And why I say that is, like, I have nothing for them, nothing for those people whose support has been behind us, who believed in us. I played this thing for 10 years. My wife sacrificed so much for 10 years for me, and I just wanted to let her hold up a freaking medal from the Olympic Games. To have my kids brag about it. Like, my two-year-old, I don\u2019t even know if they still do show and tell at school, but it\u2019d be something cool he could take. To give to my family, my parents, the supporters, my mate who introduced me to rugby, let him put the medal around his neck and hold it, just to see their reactions. \u201cThat\u2019s why this last one, I wanted it the most \u2026 Oh, man. It\u2019s just \u2026 I don\u2019t know. Like, something I feel I will never get over. When you look at sports, you\u2019ll always have highs and lows. But I feel the Olympics is the pinnacle of it all, and that was the main reason why I chose to come play rugby, was to be an Olympian, was to chase a gold medal, and to do it three times is not easy.\u201d Baker chased a dream, and missed. It\u2019s a stark contrast to the sheer joy of the USA women\u2019s team after they won bronze in Paris with a last-second defeat of Australia. As Baker speaks, Ilona Maher, the women\u2019s star player, is shining on Dancing with the Stars on ABC, Olympic success stoking internet fame. Baker salutes the women\u2019s achievement \u2026 and watches, wistful for what might have been. \u2022\u2022\u2022 If the women\u2019s success is not to be a blip, if American rugby is to flourish before hosting 15s World Cups in 2031 (men) and 2033 (women), there is work to do. Players must be found and funneled into the national teams, as Baker was himself. To that end, Baker has partnered with Dallen Stanford, a sevens Eagle turned commentator, and Steve Lewis, a mainstay of the sevens game based in New York, to launch FlagX: a US iteration of a touch rugby organization born in Australia that provides competition for men and women, emphasizing attacking skills and fitness, the better to boost tackle teams in sevens and 15s all the way to national level. Baker has already run Perry Baker Rugby Camps, \u201cbecause I want to introduce rugby and get rugby to grow. If you think about rugby in America, one of the biggest things is our skill level, our rugby IQ level, is so low. You can watch a million videos and start to process it but you are not practicing skills at all, and so we\u2019re always behind the top 10 nations. So with [FlagX] we\u2019re going to take a step further. It\u2019s a way of introducing a sport to newcomers who are afraid of the contact. So you get rid of the contact, you have flags, and then you\u2019re still implementing the skill levels. But not only that, now it can be a fundraising tool. You\u2019re raising money, and it\u2019s staying in the club, so now your club can be sustainable.\u201d The idea is to make FlagX \u201ckinda like CrossFit\u201d \u2013 a franchise model, clubs posting scores and competing virtually, a community committed to its game as well as having fun and keeping in shape. The effort will keep Baker busy. But as he says more than once, he\u2019s still trying to figure out precisely what the rest of his working life will hold. \u201cHeck, I\u2019m all over the place. I\u2019m trying to laugh. My main thing I want to do is be an assistant coach and also do my FlagX rugby. Those are my two things I really want to do.\u201d But he also harbors a vivid dream of a complete career switch \u2013 to law enforcement. Years ago, Baker interned with the New York Police Department. Now he says: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a police officer. What I want to do? I want to become a homicide detective. I don\u2019t know, I feel like my calling is about helping others. If you can and you\u2019re in a position to help others, that\u2019s life. \u201cSo for me, being a homicide detective is about solving cases, giving people closure and things like that, just trying to bring some type of peace to a family. Because I remember being a kid and one of my best friends [Dimitric Moore] was murdered. The case was never solved, but I just remember the detective being so close to my grandma, being there for us, my little close group of friends. He was so cool, and it was just a little bit of peace. He brought happiness around. He almost became like family to us. And I just feel like that\u2019s me, where I am with my life, where I\u2019ve always wanted to be was just helping others, giving back. \u201cRugby changed my life. I can\u2019t tell you. I never thought I would be in freaking Hong Kong. I\u2019d be in China. I\u2019ve been in Japan. I never thought of being able to do that without rugby. My mom used to be like, \u2018Why you don\u2019t send pictures?\u2019 I said, \u2018You know why, mom? Because I want you to experience it for yourself.\u2019 My mom has been over there now. She\u2019s been to Hong Kong, you know. My mom came to a few stops. That\u2019s what I wanted her to experience for herself. \u201cI\u2019m forever grateful to rugby. I want to give that back to other kids. Man, rugby is such a cool sport. The values that rugby offers, just being able to play and throw this footy around and have fun and enjoyment? Like, dope, man. I love it.\u201d Alas, for now, it\u2019s over. So is our time. Laughing, Baker says: \u201cPut a PS message in there too. Tell them I need a six-figure job.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Alan Bennett never expected to be writing in his 90s, with a novella published next week and a film in post-production. There was a time when he didn\u2019t expect to reach 70. In 1997, a cancerous growth was found in his colon that had already begun to spread. \u201cThe surgeon didn\u2019t think I\u2019d got a chance, really,\u201d recalls Bennett, 27 years on. \u201cSo yes, it is a slight surprise that I\u2019m 90.\u201d</p> <p>He attributes these bonus decades to two younger men: his partner, the magazine journalist Rupert Thomas, 58, and the director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/nicholas-hytner\">Nicholas Hytner</a>, 68, with whom he has worked on 11 theatre and screen projects. \u201cIt was luck that I met Rupert \u2013 over a shared taste in paintings, really \u2013 and also that I met Nick, more or less at the same time, around 30 years ago. It\u2019s been the best period of my life. Without Rupert and Nick, I\u2019d be nothing, I think.\u201d</p> <p>Although Bennett and Hytner had already collaborated on The Madness of George III, which premiered at the National Theatre in 1991, Bennett dates his creative renaissance to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/may/19/theatre1\">The History Boys </a>(2004), his most commercially and critically successful work, about a group of Sheffield sixth formers and their eccentric teacher, Hector. \u201cI\u2019d long given up hope of writing anything really fresh, but it was so enjoyable. The actors treated me as part of the cast. The first preview was my 70th birthday and I couldn\u2019t believe I was still going at&nbsp;that age.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty birthdays later, he still is. The only concession to the decades is that he apologises for not getting up from the sofa to greet me at his north London home, where Kate, a friend of the couple, is on hand while Rupert is at work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The first preview of the History Boys was my 70th birthday and I couldn\u2019t believe I was still going at\u00a0that age</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is a recent development,\u201d Bennett explains. \u201cI\u2019ve fallen once and that totally altered Rupert\u2019s approach. He doesn\u2019t like to leave me on my own for long, and so we have people who come in.\u201d Health-wise, he says, \u201cthe main problem is I can only walk a short distance. Since I had cancer, I\u2019ve been regularly in hospital one way and another for other things.\u201d</p> <p>The poet Philip Larkin, about whom Bennett has written, thought about death and illness a lot. \u201cAll the time!\u201d Bennett agrees. But that\u2019s not his attitude? \u201cNo.&nbsp;I&nbsp;think I was more of a hypochondriac before I had cancer. And then that trumped everything else really. I\u2019m not in the least bit worried about people knowing I\u2019ve had cancer, but you don\u2019t like to flaunt it because of a superstition, in my case, of thinking it will come back. But the \u2018good thing\u2019 about cancer is that you have regular checkups, so you can ask straight away about anything. Except I then had an aneurysm and then open&nbsp;heart surgery. Although I was encouraged that, on one consultation, in the waiting room was Michael Palin, who I had always regarded as the picture of health and&nbsp;energy.\u201d</p> <p>Palin has spoken publicly of his cardiac surgery. For medical professionals who were fans of English comedy, it must have been extraordinary to have on the same clinical list members of both Monty Python and Beyond the Fringe, in which Bennett\u2019s career began, with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Jonathan&nbsp;Miller.</p> <p>Bennett has come to accept that \u201cold age is a subject. You write about what you\u2019re given. And I hadn\u2019t expected to have anything to write about by now.\u201d Killing Time is set in a home for the elderly. He started it a few years ago but set it aside because Allelujah! (2018), his most recent stage play, was set in a hospital elderly care ward: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to become the bard of geriatric medicine!\u201d</p> <p>On the cover of Killing Time is a scent bottle with a hammer and sickle logo. One care home resident, who worked in Whitehall during the second world war, met the Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov at a peace conference and received a bottle of scent made by Madame Molotov, a top Russian perfumier.</p>    <p>Bennett stresses that her career is not a comic flight: \u201cI read about her by accident \u2013 in the Guardian, actually. And I thought it was too extraordinary to miss: that\u2019s one of those things a proper writer uses.\u201d (Interviewing Bennett across three decades \u2013 and despite his accelerating success during that period \u2013 he has never lost this trope of differentiating himself from real authors.) \u201cI remembered Molotov from newsreels. But didn\u2019t know anything about him apart from the Molotov Cocktail.\u201d [A petrol bomb named after a politician who, ironically, was professionally a diplomat.]</p> <p>As research, he secured a less incendiary Molotov bottle, a scent called Red October: \u201cI couldn\u2019t smell it at all. It got through to Rupert but he hated it! There had been some notion of bringing out a limited edition of Killing Time, impregnated with the perfume. But that plan was abandoned.\u201d</p> <p>There is a lot in the novella of what might be called sunset sex; a handyman meets male and female residents by arrangement in a garden shed. This extends an increasing emphasis in the work of Bennett\u2019s bonus decades, indicated by the title of the 2011 volume of short fiction, Smut: Two Unseemly Stories, in which middle-class women have striking secret erotic lives. The Laying on of Hands, a 2001 novella, follows an escort worker, while The Shrine and An Ordinary Woman \u2013 two new monologues added to the BBC\u2019s pandemic lockdown remakes of the Talking Heads soliloquies from the 80s \u2013 also feature transgressive sex within families.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very forgiving,\u201d the writer admits. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have anything to write about if I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s partly that I can\u2019t take sexual scandal quite seriously, I suppose. Being gay, and not feeling any need to hide it now, I&nbsp;think it makes you more generous about what people&nbsp;want.\u201d</p> <p>This year\u2019s Theatre Royal, Bath <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/aug/29/the-history-boys-review-theatre-royal-bath\">revival of The History Boys</a> met criticism for the character of Hector (a role created on stage and screen by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/richard-griffiths\">Richard Griffiths</a>), whose&nbsp;clear pederastic interest in his students goes unrebuked.&nbsp;In interviews over the years, Bennett has always refused to censure Hector, but now goes further.</p> <p>\u201cPartly because I was so tentative myself about sex, and scared really, I saw Hector as reflecting that. But \u2013 we could never really talk about this \u2013 Richard Griffiths\u2019s size, in a way, solved the problem, really, because the boys were so unlikely to be interested in him. You couldn\u2019t voice that even at the time, but he wasn\u2019t threatening. Once, when the understudy went on for him, he <em>was</em> threatening. So you realised, in a way, we\u2019d been lucky with Richard.\u201d</p>    <p>But when people now suggest, about other productions, that Bennett is too tolerant of Hector? \u201cMy attitude was and is that the boys were so sophisticated that they were more alert to the world than he was. I can\u2019t defend it other than that.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, in Killing Time, a male resident, Woodruff, is always exposing himself to women in the home, who either close their eyes or roll them.</p> <p>\u201cExactly. The same as the pupils in The History Boys. And I\u2019m sure that is as true sometimes to what happens as the harmful interpretation is. Maybe I\u2019d feel differently if I\u2019d been abused myself, but I never was.\u201d</p> <p>In Killing Time, the world wars are important reference points for the care home residents. Does that reflect Bennett\u2019s own life? \u201cYes. The second war \u2013 Dad was exempt, as a butcher, from serving. It\u2019s quite funny that butchers were exempt while slaughterers weren\u2019t. Not surprisingly, really, they just carried on by other means. The first war I simply knew from the photo on the piano of my Uncle Clarence, my mother\u2019s brother, who had died in it.\u201d</p> <p>Bennett wrote a radio feature, Uncle Clarence, about this unknown soldier, and the conflict that claimed him inspired his first screenplay, A Day Out (1972), directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/stephen-frears\">Stephen Frears</a>, in which a Sunday jaunt for Halifax factory workers in 1911 is clearly a pre\u2011war idyll for a doomed generation. It is intriguingly book-ended by Bennett\u2019s new film, The Choral, which Hytner is currently completing, in which, in 1916, a Yorkshire choral society, due to perform Elgar\u2019s The Dream of Gerontius, loses its male voices to military conscription and replaces them with younger boys who also sense that this may be their swansong. \u201cI was fascinated by the fact that, if all the men went to war and they were replaced by children, the whole sound of the choir would suddenly change. We just saw a rough cut and what surprised me is that it\u2019s a bit of a tear-jerker, really. Unusually for me.\u201d</p> <p>When Bennett did national service after school, was there any risk of seeing active service? \u201cWell, there was. In the sense that, after basic training, you were then sent wherever you were going to go. And everyone had told me when I went in that you had to ask to do the Russian translation course in Pontefract, which was officially secret, but you had to keep asking until they took you. I got on it but the rest of my squad was transferred to Korea and some of them were killed.\u201d</p>    <p>Was Bennett a good soldier? \u201cNo! Though I wasn\u2019t fazed by having to be neat and kit inspection and so on. I could do all that. And I enjoyed parade-ground drill. I could see why people liked dancing; I could sway along with it.\u201d On the Russian course, intended to provide interpreters or spies for the cold war, Bennett met another future author and playwright, Michael Frayn, who put his schooling to use with Chekhov translations \u2013 \u201cI always say Michael drew the cheque on Chekhov,\u201d says Bennett. The lessons may, more tangentially, have seeded Bennett\u2019s works about the Cambridge double agents: the stage play The Old Country (1977) and the TV film An Englishman Abroad (1983).</p> <p>\u201cIt was like university before university,\u201d Bennett remembers. He went to an Oxbridge college as did Frayn and he says that the Russian course was like a more carefree version of it.</p> <p>Does Bennett still remember his Russian? \u201cNo! I used to be able to speak bits because Rupert liked hearing it. But it\u2019s gone.\u201d</p> <p>Was he ever tapped up to be a spy? \u201cNo! I don\u2019t know if Michael was. He\u2019d have been much better material than me. There might have been people in our year who were. Probably the ones we didn\u2019t like.\u201d</p> <p>Bennett and Rupert still regularly go to their house in Yorkshire, the most frequent setting for his work, including Killing Time, in which the language, as often in Bennett\u2019s work, is stamped with the vocabulary of his home county: \u201cchumping\u201d for chopping wood, \u201cclap cold\u201d for freezing. \u201cThe one that I get credited with by [author and lexicographer] Ferdinand Mount is \u2018splother\u2019. Anything overdone or too much fuss, my Dad would say: \u2018It\u2019s a lot of splother!\u2019 Mount says he\u2019d never come across that one before my work.\u201d</p> <p>Does he tend to hear dialogue in a Yorkshire accent? \u201cYes. I often don\u2019t know whether an expression is Yorkshire or standard English,\u201d he says. \u201cI wish I\u2019d paid more attention to my dad. He\u2019d say things like, if you asked him where something was, \u2018I\u2019ll ascertain!\u2019 And that, more than anything, is northern. A slightly piss-taking, archaic way of talking. The person I think got that best was Victoria Wood. She caught that idiom in a way no one else did.\u201d</p> <p>Apart from you? \u201cNo. She was better than me. And made me realise I should have listened harder. I went to her memorial service. And they must have made it ticket only, because there were very few people there. Whereas if they\u2019d had open house, as it were, it&nbsp;would&nbsp;have been packed out because she was wonderful and could fill the Albert Hall.\u201d</p>    <p>The big stylistic shift in Bennett\u2019s extra writing time has been the move from drama to fiction. His first novella, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/sep/15/the-clothes-they-stood-up-in-review-alan-bennett-nottingham-playhouse\">The Clothes They Stood Up In,</a> was written and published either side of cancer surgery and chemotherapy. Killing Time is his eighth prose fiction. So why did he start&nbsp;writing for page rather than stage and screen?</p> <p>\u201cI think it was finding that whereas, if you do something on the stage, there\u2019s all this scene-setting, in prose you can do it in a sentence.\u201d The Clothes They Stood Up In opens: \u201cThe Ransomes had been burgled\u201d. \u201cThe title led it to write itself.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/29/uncommon-reader-alan-bennett-review\">The Uncommon Reader</a> (2006), in which Queen Elizabeth II becomes a voracious consumer of literature, is a favourite of many Bennett fans. \u201cYes. I enjoyed writing that more than anything else ever. Once I had the idea, I didn\u2019t have to do much. I knew how the Queen spoke. It was such a gift.\u201d</p> <p>The late Queen was also a character in A Question of Attribution (1988), in which Prunella Scales as \u201cHMQ\u201d elegantly interrogated her surveyor of pictures, recently revealed as a Soviet double agent, Sir Anthony Blunt. The durable impact of these works comes from her being a huge historical figure, yet also somehow unknown.</p> <p>\u201cYes. She came to Leeds once and Dad and I went out to watch her. As she came by, Dad suddenly took off his hat, and I found this immensely moving. I don\u2019t know where it came from. Any kind of formal behaviour was \u2018splother\u2019. But it made me realise he was a loyal subject, as I suppose I was. She was so easy to write about. You had to just touch her and she became dramatic.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I was once asked to lunch with the Queen and didn\u2019t go. I would have been so shy. And I\u2019m not sorry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Did Bennett meet her? \u201cI shook hands in a line once. That\u2019s all it was. I was once asked to lunch and didn\u2019t go. I apologised. Because I would have been so shy. And I\u2019m not sorry, because it would have got in the way of anything I wanted to write about her. Nick Hytner met her once or twice and hearing his accounts was just as good from my point of view.\u201d</p> <p>Yet despite this reverence, he declined a CBE and a knighthood? \u201cYes. I have a complicated relation to this. Last night, I watched a documentary about Maggie Smith and they showed her being given the CH.\u201d (Companion of Honour, one of the highest prizes of the British state.) \u201cAnd I \u2026 I was very upset when she died, and suddenly it all came back and I cried, which I don\u2019t normally do. The whole relationship between the state and people is very difficult. When I was offered things a couple of times, there was always something that had just happened \u2013 usually a war. And you just felt you were being used as laundering somehow. And that\u2019s probably a conceited way of looking at it, but anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Bennett\u2019s Yorkshire near-contemporary, the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/hockney\">David Hockney</a> (the two, to their bemusement, are often confused due to late-age thick hair and spectacles) now holds both a CH and also the establishment silver medal, the Order of Merit. Wouldn\u2019t Whitehall say the nation was simply honouring its creative talent?</p> <p>\u201cWell, I think there\u2019s a sense in which honours are not trinkets, they\u2019re shackles. Even when I took an honorary degree from Leeds University, there\u2019s no formal obligation, but you\u2019re automatically the first person they ask to come to talk. And I\u2019m no good at that. So, after Leeds had asked me once or twice and I said no, I thought I really don\u2019t want to do this. It\u2019s not modesty, it\u2019s laziness.\u201d</p> <p>The evening before we meet was Maggie Smith Night on BBC Four, including a repeat of A Bed Among the Lentils, the Talking Head monologue that Bennett also directed, in which she played the unhappy alcoholic wife of a vicar, recalling the brief release of an affair.</p> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t need any direction. I think the only \u2018note\u2019 I gave her was \u2018champion!\u2019, my father\u2019s favourite term of praise. There was a bit that completely took me by surprise, even though I\u2019d written it and was directing it. She\u2019s talking about her [secret lover] Mr Ramesh having moved on and her voice breaks but she doesn\u2019t cry. She just edged that emotion in. And I found it so upsetting. She could somehow be funny and sad in the same sentence.\u201d</p> <p>Smith brought this bittersweet technique to the film A Private Function (1984), inspired by Bennett\u2019s father\u2019s experience as a butcher in the second world war, and The Lady in the Van (stage 1999, film 2015), in which she played Miss Shepherd, a vagrant evangelist who parked her caravan on Bennett\u2019s drive and lived there for 15 years. The character could have been played as grotesque, but Smith somehow made her seem likable and even justified.</p>    <p>\u201cYes. And also replaced her in my memory. When I think of Miss Shepherd, I think of Maggie, really.\u201d He points across the room. \u201cStand up and look in the hall. On the wall.\u201d</p> <p>Above the door to the downstairs lavatory is an English Heritage blue plaque inscribed: \u201cMiss MT Shepherd, The Lady in the Van, Lived Here 1974-1989\u201d<em>.</em></p> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d glosses Bennett from the sofa. \u201cIt was the other house.\u201d (In one of the shortest ever relocations, they moved from one Camden Town street to the next.) \u201cBut Rupert had it made up for my 90th birthday.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In Beyond the Fringe, Peter and Dudley could always make the band laugh. And I never did ever... but I\u2019ve made the camera crew cry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then, perhaps surprisingly, he reveals of Dame Maggie: \u201cI didn\u2019t know her outside work. I made her nervous and she made me nervous, so we kept our distance.\u201d He agrees, though, that she was one of two natural interpreters of his work, the other being Dame Thora Hird. A story about Hird recording the 1998 Talking Head Waiting for the Telegram, in which an old lady remembers the death of her sweetheart in the first world war, may be the perfect Bennett anecdote \u2013 going off in unexpected directions but coming home to a neat autobiographical pay-off: \u201cThora Hird had in common with John Gielgud \u2013 probably the only thing they did share \u2013 an ability to access tears at will. In Waiting for the Telegram she cries for a long time and talks through the tears. And, when we\u2019d done it in the studio, nobody said anything for a long time and it was because the camera crew were crying. It made me think of when we were in Beyond the Fringe, we often did cabaret nights and Peter and Dudley could always make the band laugh. And I never did ever. Anyway, after Thora, I thought well, I couldn\u2019t make the band laugh but I\u2019ve made the camera crew cry.\u201d</p> <p>He politely excuses himself to go for a wee \u2013 \u201cmy age,\u201d he says, although we have been talking for 90 minutes \u2013 and returns with a very Bennettian piece of literary criticism: \u201cSamuel Beckett makes out old age is a kind of drying up, going to dust. In fact, getting old&nbsp;is more <em>liquid </em>than that. You\u2019re always being taken&nbsp;short.\u201d</p> <p>When his legs permit, he gets to revivals of earlier plays: \u201cI\u2019m glad they want to do them. But I dread it. Normally, when we\u2019ve got something on for the first time, it\u2019s how I wanted it. It\u2019s as near perfection as we can manage. And the second time round, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He reveals that he hasn\u2019t seen the 2022 movie version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/10/allelujah-review-judi-dench-stars-in-sweet-but-slight-alan-bennett-hospital-drama\">Allelujah!</a>, starring Jennifer Saunders and directed by Richard Eyre rather than Hytner.</p> <p>\u201cI thought I might get upset by it. I liked my original play. I like Richard Eyre, and I didn\u2019t want to be upset by feeling he\u2019d got it wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Does Bennett have a sense of his development in his later work? \u201cWhat late style means for me is being able to dispense with self-consciousness and, as my mother would have said: \u2018What will people think of you?\u2019 You don\u2019t care any more. For example, Smut wasn\u2019t particularly liked. And it didn\u2019t matter. You just think: well, at least I\u2019ve got them down on paper.\u201d</p> <p>As for even later work, \u201clost\u201d Bennett works occasionally come to light. Denmark Hill, an unmade screenplay, was produced on Radio 4. Hytner found the two extra Talking Heads in a drawer. Might there be more finds from the archive?</p> <p>\u201cNo. There may be stuff lying round but even I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worthwhile. There\u2019ll be bits. I haven\u2019t stopped. If I didn\u2019t write, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do. So I\u2019m always making notes for things.\u201d</p> <p>Could there be another stage play? \u201cI\u2019d never like to say no. What I\u2019d be flattered by is if the Hall\u00e9 orchestra could somehow do a concert version of The Choral, with either me or someone else doing the adaptation. It\u2019s a good idea. But I\u2019m no good at pitching things.\u201d</p> <p>After three hefty volumes of diaries and miscellaneous prose \u2013 Writing Home (1994), Untold Stories (2005) and Keeping On Keeping On (2016) \u2013 his publishing rhythm suggests that another collection is due around 2025-26.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be. I\u2019d always kept diaries but in a haphazard fashion on scraps of paper. So they resembled a heron\u2019s nest. When I gave them to Faber, they were amazed this kind of performance still went on and it wasn\u2019t electronic in any way. So now we again have the problem of sorting out these scraps and putting them in an accessible form.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019d have to be insane to want Trump as president. But I\u2019m dreading it happening \u2013 he makes me thankful I\u2019m not young</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That volume \u2013 working title The Far End \u2013 will include his diaries since 2016, a signal political period. He was a Corbynista once. \u201cWas I?\u201d He said he \u201cwholly approved\u201d of Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cI did. He seemed more sympathetic than most and was demonised. But really what I want politically is for the Labour party to be in government so that I can stop thinking about politics. I know they can be foolish, but they\u2019re not wrongheaded in the way the Conservatives are. I\u2019ve voted Liberal Democrat sometimes, so I\u2019m not&nbsp;hidebound.\u201d</p> <p>In July, he was one of the 18,884 residents of the Holborn and St Pancras constituency who voted directly for the prime minister and, despite Keir Starmer\u2019s bumpy first 100-plus days, does not regret it: \u201cThere\u2019s always this. Blair had all this fuss about Peter Mandelson when he came in.\u201d The politician resigned from Blair\u2019s first cabinet amid controversy about a loan to buy a house. \u201cSo they were bound to go after him for a while. But we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p>As next Tory leader, Robert Jenrick or Kemi Badenoch or neither? \u201cWell, certainly not Jenrick. James Cleverly seemed more acceptable but he dropped out.\u201d</p> <p>Donald Trump or Kamala Harris as president? \u201cOh. Goodness me. You\u2019d have to be insane to want him. But I\u2019m dreading it happening, just the tension of it. I\u2019m afraid he makes me thankful that I\u2019m 90, not young. But, with Rupert being much younger than me, I\u2019m more in touch with younger people than I expected to be, so I do worry for them.\u201d</p> <p>Killing Time, in common with many Bennett works, features a vicar. Is his interest in religion only literary? \u201cInto my 20s, I was still saying my prayers. Rupert is a militant atheist. In the days when I could walk, we liked going to old churches. But any sign of religious activity \u2013 even a children\u2019s corner \u2013 the less he liked it.\u201d Does Bennett have any residual feeling for the faith? \u201cI suppose so. I\u2019m a lapsed Anglican.\u201d</p> <p>Since Beyond the Fringe, he has maintained a side career as a performer and is recording the audiobook of Killing Time, although he is concerned by the character of Zulema, a carer in the home. \u201cReally, I should do her in what I\u2019d like to be a good African accent. But, at the same time, if you do that, it\u2019s prejudiced.\u201d So what will he do? \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s next week.\u201d</p> <p>Apart from such self-interpretation, he considers himself retired as an actor. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thankful. I wouldn\u2019t be able to appear on stage. I\u2019d be terrified of forgetting the lines. It\u2019s bad enough in conversation; I forget things. The last time I was on stage was at a National Theatre gala two or three years ago. Richard Griffiths had died and I played Hector in The History Boys. And I was so nervous. Helen Mirren was backstage and I told her how scared I was of the audience and she said, \u2018Fuck \u2018em\u2019. I wished I\u2019d been given that advice much earlier.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Killing Time is published by Faber and Profile on 7&nbsp;November. The Choral will be released next year.

      "bodyText": "Alan Bennett never expected to be writing in his 90s, with a novella published next week and a film in post-production. There was a time when he didn\u2019t expect to reach 70. In 1997, a cancerous growth was found in his colon that had already begun to spread. \u201cThe surgeon didn\u2019t think I\u2019d got a chance, really,\u201d recalls Bennett, 27 years on. \u201cSo yes, it is a slight surprise that I\u2019m 90.\u201d He attributes these bonus decades to two younger men: his partner, the magazine journalist Rupert Thomas, 58, and the director Nicholas Hytner, 68, with whom he has worked on 11 theatre and screen projects. \u201cIt was luck that I met Rupert \u2013 over a shared taste in paintings, really \u2013 and also that I met Nick, more or less at the same time, around 30 years ago. It\u2019s been the best period of my life. Without Rupert and Nick, I\u2019d be nothing, I think.\u201d Although Bennett and Hytner had already collaborated on The Madness of George III, which premiered at the National Theatre in 1991, Bennett dates his creative renaissance to The History Boys (2004), his most commercially and critically successful work, about a group of Sheffield sixth formers and their eccentric teacher, Hector. \u201cI\u2019d long given up hope of writing anything really fresh, but it was so enjoyable. The actors treated me as part of the cast. The first preview was my 70th birthday and I couldn\u2019t believe I was still going at that age.\u201d Twenty birthdays later, he still is. The only concession to the decades is that he apologises for not getting up from the sofa to greet me at his north London home, where Kate, a friend of the couple, is on hand while Rupert is at work. \u201cThis is a recent development,\u201d Bennett explains. \u201cI\u2019ve fallen once and that totally altered Rupert\u2019s approach. He doesn\u2019t like to leave me on my own for long, and so we have people who come in.\u201d Health-wise, he says, \u201cthe main problem is I can only walk a short distance. Since I had cancer, I\u2019ve been regularly in hospital one way and another for other things.\u201d The poet Philip Larkin, about whom Bennett has written, thought about death and illness a lot. \u201cAll the time!\u201d Bennett agrees. But that\u2019s not his attitude? \u201cNo. I think I was more of a hypochondriac before I had cancer. And then that trumped everything else really. I\u2019m not in the least bit worried about people knowing I\u2019ve had cancer, but you don\u2019t like to flaunt it because of a superstition, in my case, of thinking it will come back. But the \u2018good thing\u2019 about cancer is that you have regular checkups, so you can ask straight away about anything. Except I then had an aneurysm and then open heart surgery. Although I was encouraged that, on one consultation, in the waiting room was Michael Palin, who I had always regarded as the picture of health and energy.\u201d Palin has spoken publicly of his cardiac surgery. For medical professionals who were fans of English comedy, it must have been extraordinary to have on the same clinical list members of both Monty Python and Beyond the Fringe, in which Bennett\u2019s career began, with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Jonathan Miller. Bennett has come to accept that \u201cold age is a subject. You write about what you\u2019re given. And I hadn\u2019t expected to have anything to write about by now.\u201d Killing Time is set in a home for the elderly. He started it a few years ago but set it aside because Allelujah! (2018), his most recent stage play, was set in a hospital elderly care ward: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to become the bard of geriatric medicine!\u201d On the cover of Killing Time is a scent bottle with a hammer and sickle logo. One care home resident, who worked in Whitehall during the second world war, met the Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov at a peace conference and received a bottle of scent made by Madame Molotov, a top Russian perfumier. Bennett stresses that her career is not a comic flight: \u201cI read about her by accident \u2013 in the Guardian, actually. And I thought it was too extraordinary to miss: that\u2019s one of those things a proper writer uses.\u201d (Interviewing Bennett across three decades \u2013 and despite his accelerating success during that period \u2013 he has never lost this trope of differentiating himself from real authors.) \u201cI remembered Molotov from newsreels. But didn\u2019t know anything about him apart from the Molotov Cocktail.\u201d [A petrol bomb named after a politician who, ironically, was professionally a diplomat.] As research, he secured a less incendiary Molotov bottle, a scent called Red October: \u201cI couldn\u2019t smell it at all. It got through to Rupert but he hated it! There had been some notion of bringing out a limited edition of Killing Time, impregnated with the perfume. But that plan was abandoned.\u201d There is a lot in the novella of what might be called sunset sex; a handyman meets male and female residents by arrangement in a garden shed. This extends an increasing emphasis in the work of Bennett\u2019s bonus decades, indicated by the title of the 2011 volume of short fiction, Smut: Two Unseemly Stories, in which middle-class women have striking secret erotic lives. The Laying on of Hands, a 2001 novella, follows an escort worker, while The Shrine and An Ordinary Woman \u2013 two new monologues added to the BBC\u2019s pandemic lockdown remakes of the Talking Heads soliloquies from the 80s \u2013 also feature transgressive sex within families. \u201cI\u2019m very forgiving,\u201d the writer admits. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have anything to write about if I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s partly that I can\u2019t take sexual scandal quite seriously, I suppose. Being gay, and not feeling any need to hide it now, I think it makes you more generous about what people want.\u201d This year\u2019s Theatre Royal, Bath revival of The History Boys met criticism for the character of Hector (a role created on stage and screen by Richard Griffiths), whose clear pederastic interest in his students goes unrebuked. In interviews over the years, Bennett has always refused to censure Hector, but now goes further. \u201cPartly because I was so tentative myself about sex, and scared really, I saw Hector as reflecting that. But \u2013 we could never really talk about this \u2013 Richard Griffiths\u2019s size, in a way, solved the problem, really, because the boys were so unlikely to be interested in him. You couldn\u2019t voice that even at the time, but he wasn\u2019t threatening. Once, when the understudy went on for him, he was threatening. So you realised, in a way, we\u2019d been lucky with Richard.\u201d But when people now suggest, about other productions, that Bennett is too tolerant of Hector? \u201cMy attitude was and is that the boys were so sophisticated that they were more alert to the world than he was. I can\u2019t defend it other than that.\u201d Similarly, in Killing Time, a male resident, Woodruff, is always exposing himself to women in the home, who either close their eyes or roll them. \u201cExactly. The same as the pupils in The History Boys. And I\u2019m sure that is as true sometimes to what happens as the harmful interpretation is. Maybe I\u2019d feel differently if I\u2019d been abused myself, but I never was.\u201d In Killing Time, the world wars are important reference points for the care home residents. Does that reflect Bennett\u2019s own life? \u201cYes. The second war \u2013 Dad was exempt, as a butcher, from serving. It\u2019s quite funny that butchers were exempt while slaughterers weren\u2019t. Not surprisingly, really, they just carried on by other means. The first war I simply knew from the photo on the piano of my Uncle Clarence, my mother\u2019s brother, who had died in it.\u201d Bennett wrote a radio feature, Uncle Clarence, about this unknown soldier, and the conflict that claimed him inspired his first screenplay, A Day Out (1972), directed by Stephen Frears, in which a Sunday jaunt for Halifax factory workers in 1911 is clearly a pre\u2011war idyll for a doomed generation. It is intriguingly book-ended by Bennett\u2019s new film, The Choral, which Hytner is currently completing, in which, in 1916, a Yorkshire choral society, due to perform Elgar\u2019s The Dream of Gerontius, loses its male voices to military conscription and replaces them with younger boys who also sense that this may be their swansong. \u201cI was fascinated by the fact that, if all the men went to war and they were replaced by children, the whole sound of the choir would suddenly change. We just saw a rough cut and what surprised me is that it\u2019s a bit of a tear-jerker, really. Unusually for me.\u201d When Bennett did national service after school, was there any risk of seeing active service? \u201cWell, there was. In the sense that, after basic training, you were then sent wherever you were going to go. And everyone had told me when I went in that you had to ask to do the Russian translation course in Pontefract, which was officially secret, but you had to keep asking until they took you. I got on it but the rest of my squad was transferred to Korea and some of them were killed.\u201d Was Bennett a good soldier? \u201cNo! Though I wasn\u2019t fazed by having to be neat and kit inspection and so on. I could do all that. And I enjoyed parade-ground drill. I could see why people liked dancing; I could sway along with it.\u201d On the Russian course, intended to provide interpreters or spies for the cold war, Bennett met another future author and playwright, Michael Frayn, who put his schooling to use with Chekhov translations \u2013 \u201cI always say Michael drew the cheque on Chekhov,\u201d says Bennett. The lessons may, more tangentially, have seeded Bennett\u2019s works about the Cambridge double agents: the stage play The Old Country (1977) and the TV film An Englishman Abroad (1983). \u201cIt was like university before university,\u201d Bennett remembers. He went to an Oxbridge college as did Frayn and he says that the Russian course was like a more carefree version of it. Does Bennett still remember his Russian? \u201cNo! I used to be able to speak bits because Rupert liked hearing it. But it\u2019s gone.\u201d Was he ever tapped up to be a spy? \u201cNo! I don\u2019t know if Michael was. He\u2019d have been much better material than me. There might have been people in our year who were. Probably the ones we didn\u2019t like.\u201d Bennett and Rupert still regularly go to their house in Yorkshire, the most frequent setting for his work, including Killing Time, in which the language, as often in Bennett\u2019s work, is stamped with the vocabulary of his home county: \u201cchumping\u201d for chopping wood, \u201cclap cold\u201d for freezing. \u201cThe one that I get credited with by [author and lexicographer] Ferdinand Mount is \u2018splother\u2019. Anything overdone or too much fuss, my Dad would say: \u2018It\u2019s a lot of splother!\u2019 Mount says he\u2019d never come across that one before my work.\u201d Does he tend to hear dialogue in a Yorkshire accent? \u201cYes. I often don\u2019t know whether an expression is Yorkshire or standard English,\u201d he says. \u201cI wish I\u2019d paid more attention to my dad. He\u2019d say things like, if you asked him where something was, \u2018I\u2019ll ascertain!\u2019 And that, more than anything, is northern. A slightly piss-taking, archaic way of talking. The person I think got that best was Victoria Wood. She caught that idiom in a way no one else did.\u201d Apart from you? \u201cNo. She was better than me. And made me realise I should have listened harder. I went to her memorial service. And they must have made it ticket only, because there were very few people there. Whereas if they\u2019d had open house, as it were, it would have been packed out because she was wonderful and could fill the Albert Hall.\u201d The big stylistic shift in Bennett\u2019s extra writing time has been the move from drama to fiction. His first novella, The Clothes They Stood Up In, was written and published either side of cancer surgery and chemotherapy. Killing Time is his eighth prose fiction. So why did he start writing for page rather than stage and screen? \u201cI think it was finding that whereas, if you do something on the stage, there\u2019s all this scene-setting, in prose you can do it in a sentence.\u201d The Clothes They Stood Up In opens: \u201cThe Ransomes had been burgled\u201d. \u201cThe title led it to write itself.\u201d The Uncommon Reader (2006), in which Queen Elizabeth II becomes a voracious consumer of literature, is a favourite of many Bennett fans. \u201cYes. I enjoyed writing that more than anything else ever. Once I had the idea, I didn\u2019t have to do much. I knew how the Queen spoke. It was such a gift.\u201d The late Queen was also a character in A Question of Attribution (1988), in which Prunella Scales as \u201cHMQ\u201d elegantly interrogated her surveyor of pictures, recently revealed as a Soviet double agent, Sir Anthony Blunt. The durable impact of these works comes from her being a huge historical figure, yet also somehow unknown. \u201cYes. She came to Leeds once and Dad and I went out to watch her. As she came by, Dad suddenly took off his hat, and I found this immensely moving. I don\u2019t know where it came from. Any kind of formal behaviour was \u2018splother\u2019. But it made me realise he was a loyal subject, as I suppose I was. She was so easy to write about. You had to just touch her and she became dramatic.\u201d Did Bennett meet her? \u201cI shook hands in a line once. That\u2019s all it was. I was once asked to lunch and didn\u2019t go. I apologised. Because I would have been so shy. And I\u2019m not sorry, because it would have got in the way of anything I wanted to write about her. Nick Hytner met her once or twice and hearing his accounts was just as good from my point of view.\u201d Yet despite this reverence, he declined a CBE and a knighthood? \u201cYes. I have a complicated relation to this. Last night, I watched a documentary about Maggie Smith and they showed her being given the CH.\u201d (Companion of Honour, one of the highest prizes of the British state.) \u201cAnd I \u2026 I was very upset when she died, and suddenly it all came back and I cried, which I don\u2019t normally do. The whole relationship between the state and people is very difficult. When I was offered things a couple of times, there was always something that had just happened \u2013 usually a war. And you just felt you were being used as laundering somehow. And that\u2019s probably a conceited way of looking at it, but anyway.\u201d Bennett\u2019s Yorkshire near-contemporary, the artist David Hockney (the two, to their bemusement, are often confused due to late-age thick hair and spectacles) now holds both a CH and also the establishment silver medal, the Order of Merit. Wouldn\u2019t Whitehall say the nation was simply honouring its creative talent? \u201cWell, I think there\u2019s a sense in which honours are not trinkets, they\u2019re shackles. Even when I took an honorary degree from Leeds University, there\u2019s no formal obligation, but you\u2019re automatically the first person they ask to come to talk. And I\u2019m no good at that. So, after Leeds had asked me once or twice and I said no, I thought I really don\u2019t want to do this. It\u2019s not modesty, it\u2019s laziness.\u201d The evening before we meet was Maggie Smith Night on BBC Four, including a repeat of A Bed Among the Lentils, the Talking Head monologue that Bennett also directed, in which she played the unhappy alcoholic wife of a vicar, recalling the brief release of an affair. \u201cShe didn\u2019t need any direction. I think the only \u2018note\u2019 I gave her was \u2018champion!\u2019, my father\u2019s favourite term of praise. There was a bit that completely took me by surprise, even though I\u2019d written it and was directing it. She\u2019s talking about her [secret lover] Mr Ramesh having moved on and her voice breaks but she doesn\u2019t cry. She just edged that emotion in. And I found it so upsetting. She could somehow be funny and sad in the same sentence.\u201d Smith brought this bittersweet technique to the film A Private Function (1984), inspired by Bennett\u2019s father\u2019s experience as a butcher in the second world war, and The Lady in the Van (stage 1999, film 2015), in which she played Miss Shepherd, a vagrant evangelist who parked her caravan on Bennett\u2019s drive and lived there for 15 years. The character could have been played as grotesque, but Smith somehow made her seem likable and even justified. \u201cYes. And also replaced her in my memory. When I think of Miss Shepherd, I think of Maggie, really.\u201d He points across the room. \u201cStand up and look in the hall. On the wall.\u201d Above the door to the downstairs lavatory is an English Heritage blue plaque inscribed: \u201cMiss MT Shepherd, The Lady in the Van, Lived Here 1974-1989\u201d. \u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d glosses Bennett from the sofa. \u201cIt was the other house.\u201d (In one of the shortest ever relocations, they moved from one Camden Town street to the next.) \u201cBut Rupert had it made up for my 90th birthday.\u201d Then, perhaps surprisingly, he reveals of Dame Maggie: \u201cI didn\u2019t know her outside work. I made her nervous and she made me nervous, so we kept our distance.\u201d He agrees, though, that she was one of two natural interpreters of his work, the other being Dame Thora Hird. A story about Hird recording the 1998 Talking Head Waiting for the Telegram, in which an old lady remembers the death of her sweetheart in the first world war, may be the perfect Bennett anecdote \u2013 going off in unexpected directions but coming home to a neat autobiographical pay-off: \u201cThora Hird had in common with John Gielgud \u2013 probably the only thing they did share \u2013 an ability to access tears at will. In Waiting for the Telegram she cries for a long time and talks through the tears. And, when we\u2019d done it in the studio, nobody said anything for a long time and it was because the camera crew were crying. It made me think of when we were in Beyond the Fringe, we often did cabaret nights and Peter and Dudley could always make the band laugh. And I never did ever. Anyway, after Thora, I thought well, I couldn\u2019t make the band laugh but I\u2019ve made the camera crew cry.\u201d He politely excuses himself to go for a wee \u2013 \u201cmy age,\u201d he says, although we have been talking for 90 minutes \u2013 and returns with a very Bennettian piece of literary criticism: \u201cSamuel Beckett makes out old age is a kind of drying up, going to dust. In fact, getting old is more liquid than that. You\u2019re always being taken short.\u201d When his legs permit, he gets to revivals of earlier plays: \u201cI\u2019m glad they want to do them. But I dread it. Normally, when we\u2019ve got something on for the first time, it\u2019s how I wanted it. It\u2019s as near perfection as we can manage. And the second time round, it isn\u2019t.\u201d He reveals that he hasn\u2019t seen the 2022 movie version of Allelujah!, starring Jennifer Saunders and directed by Richard Eyre rather than Hytner. \u201cI thought I might get upset by it. I liked my original play. I like Richard Eyre, and I didn\u2019t want to be upset by feeling he\u2019d got it wrong.\u201d Does Bennett have a sense of his development in his later work? \u201cWhat late style means for me is being able to dispense with self-consciousness and, as my mother would have said: \u2018What will people think of you?\u2019 You don\u2019t care any more. For example, Smut wasn\u2019t particularly liked. And it didn\u2019t matter. You just think: well, at least I\u2019ve got them down on paper.\u201d As for even later work, \u201clost\u201d Bennett works occasionally come to light. Denmark Hill, an unmade screenplay, was produced on Radio 4. Hytner found the two extra Talking Heads in a drawer. Might there be more finds from the archive? \u201cNo. There may be stuff lying round but even I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worthwhile. There\u2019ll be bits. I haven\u2019t stopped. If I didn\u2019t write, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do. So I\u2019m always making notes for things.\u201d Could there be another stage play? \u201cI\u2019d never like to say no. What I\u2019d be flattered by is if the Hall\u00e9 orchestra could somehow do a concert version of The Choral, with either me or someone else doing the adaptation. It\u2019s a good idea. But I\u2019m no good at pitching things.\u201d After three hefty volumes of diaries and miscellaneous prose \u2013 Writing Home (1994), Untold Stories (2005) and Keeping On Keeping On (2016) \u2013 his publishing rhythm suggests that another collection is due around 2025-26. \u201cThere will be. I\u2019d always kept diaries but in a haphazard fashion on scraps of paper. So they resembled a heron\u2019s nest. When I gave them to Faber, they were amazed this kind of performance still went on and it wasn\u2019t electronic in any way. So now we again have the problem of sorting out these scraps and putting them in an accessible form.\u201d That volume \u2013 working title The Far End \u2013 will include his diaries since 2016, a signal political period. He was a Corbynista once. \u201cWas I?\u201d He said he \u201cwholly approved\u201d of Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cI did. He seemed more sympathetic than most and was demonised. But really what I want politically is for the Labour party to be in government so that I can stop thinking about politics. I know they can be foolish, but they\u2019re not wrongheaded in the way the Conservatives are. I\u2019ve voted Liberal Democrat sometimes, so I\u2019m not hidebound.\u201d In July, he was one of the 18,884 residents of the Holborn and St Pancras constituency who voted directly for the prime minister and, despite Keir Starmer\u2019s bumpy first 100-plus days, does not regret it: \u201cThere\u2019s always this. Blair had all this fuss about Peter Mandelson when he came in.\u201d The politician resigned from Blair\u2019s first cabinet amid controversy about a loan to buy a house. \u201cSo they were bound to go after him for a while. But we\u2019ll see.\u201d As next Tory leader, Robert Jenrick or Kemi Badenoch or neither? \u201cWell, certainly not Jenrick. James Cleverly seemed more acceptable but he dropped out.\u201d Donald Trump or Kamala Harris as president? \u201cOh. Goodness me. You\u2019d have to be insane to want him. But I\u2019m dreading it happening, just the tension of it. I\u2019m afraid he makes me thankful that I\u2019m 90, not young. But, with Rupert being much younger than me, I\u2019m more in touch with younger people than I expected to be, so I do worry for them.\u201d Killing Time, in common with many Bennett works, features a vicar. Is his interest in religion only literary? \u201cInto my 20s, I was still saying my prayers. Rupert is a militant atheist. In the days when I could walk, we liked going to old churches. But any sign of religious activity \u2013 even a children\u2019s corner \u2013 the less he liked it.\u201d Does Bennett have any residual feeling for the faith? \u201cI suppose so. I\u2019m a lapsed Anglican.\u201d Since Beyond the Fringe, he has maintained a side career as a performer and is recording the audiobook of Killing Time, although he is concerned by the character of Zulema, a carer in the home. \u201cReally, I should do her in what I\u2019d like to be a good African accent. But, at the same time, if you do that, it\u2019s prejudiced.\u201d So what will he do? \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s next week.\u201d Apart from such self-interpretation, he considers himself retired as an actor. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thankful. I wouldn\u2019t be able to appear on stage. I\u2019d be terrified of forgetting the lines. It\u2019s bad enough in conversation; I forget things. The last time I was on stage was at a National Theatre gala two or three years ago. Richard Griffiths had died and I played Hector in The History Boys. And I was so nervous. Helen Mirren was backstage and I told her how scared I was of the audience and she said, \u2018Fuck \u2018em\u2019. I wished I\u2019d been given that advice much earlier.\u201d \u2022 Killing Time is published by Faber and Profile on 7 November. The Choral will be released next year.

Blair added: \u201cHis early realisation was that if you get famous, if you get large, people will get out of the way. He spent the first part of his career as a real estate developer, making himself seem the embodiment of enormous tycoon-level success even though, in fact, many things he did weren\u2019t successful and his father kept bailing him out.</p> <p>\u201cBut he put across that impression and he rode that fame express that he had created for himself over a remarkable number of obstacles all the way to The Apprentice, which set him up permanently as the image of this unstoppable always-on-top tycoon and people are in awe of that. All of which could be described as branding.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s private life is no more savoury. Trump has reportedly cheated on all three of his wives. More than two dozen women have come forward with accusations of sexual misconduct against him, most recently the former model Stacey Williams, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/donald-trump-accuser-stacey-williams-jeffrey-epstein\">who told the Guardian</a> that Trump groped her in 1993 as Jeffrey Epstein watched in what felt like a \u201ctwisted game\u201d between the two men.</p> <p>During the 2016 election campaign, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html\">an Access Hollywood tape</a> emerged in which Trump could be heard bragging about grabbing women by their private parts. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it,\u201d he said. \u201cGrab \u2019em by the pussy.

      "bodyText": "Losing an election for the highest office is a crushing blow that no candidate forgets. But when the American electorate delivers its verdict next week, the personal stakes for Donald Trump will be uniquely high. His fate will hover between the presidency and the threat of prison. If he claims victory, Trump will be the first convicted criminal to win the White House and gain access to the nuclear codes. If he falls short, the 78-year-old faces more humiliating courtroom trials and potentially even time behind bars. It would be the end of a charmed life in which he has somehow always managed to outrun the law and duck accountability. For Trump, Tuesday is judgment day. \u201cHe branded himself as the guy who gets away with it,\u201d said Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer, adding that, should he lose, \u201che is facing a lot of moments of reckoning. He could go to jail. He could end up considerably less wealthy than he is. No matter what happens, and no matter whether he wins or loses, there will be a reckoning over his health. Death, ill health, dementia \u2013 those are things even he can\u2019t escape.\u201d The property developer and reality TV star has spent his career pushing ethical and legal boundaries to the limit, facing countless investigations, court battles and hefty fines. Worthy of a novel, his has been a life of scandal on a gargantuan scale. In the 1970s Trump and his father were sued by the justice department for racial discrimination after refusing to rent apartments to Black people in predominantly white buildings. His property and casino businesses, including the Taj Mahal and Trump Plaza, filed for bankruptcy several times in the 1990s and early 2000s. Trump University, a business offering property training courses, faced multiple lawsuits for fraud, misleading marketing and false claims about the quality of its programmes. In 2016 Trump settled for $25m without admitting wrongdoing. The Donald J Trump Foundation, a charitable organisation, was investigated and sued for allegedly using charitable funds for personal and business expenses. Trump eventually agreed to dissolve the foundation with remaining funds going to charity. Trump and his company were ordered to pay more than $350m in a New York civil fraud trial for artificially inflating his net worth to secure favourable loan terms. He is also known to have paid little to no federal income taxes in specific years which, although technically legal, was seen by some as bordering on unethical. But Trump became a fixture of the New York tabloids and hosted his own reality TV show, The Apprentice. Blair added: \u201cHis early realisation was that if you get famous, if you get large, people will get out of the way. He spent the first part of his career as a real estate developer, making himself seem the embodiment of enormous tycoon-level success even though, in fact, many things he did weren\u2019t successful and his father kept bailing him out. \u201cBut he put across that impression and he rode that fame express that he had created for himself over a remarkable number of obstacles all the way to The Apprentice, which set him up permanently as the image of this unstoppable always-on-top tycoon and people are in awe of that. All of which could be described as branding.\u201d Trump\u2019s private life is no more savoury. Trump has reportedly cheated on all three of his wives. More than two dozen women have come forward with accusations of sexual misconduct against him, most recently the former model Stacey Williams, who told the Guardian that Trump groped her in 1993 as Jeffrey Epstein watched in what felt like a \u201ctwisted game\u201d between the two men. During the 2016 election campaign, an Access Hollywood tape emerged in which Trump could be heard bragging about grabbing women by their private parts. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it,\u201d he said. \u201cGrab \u2019em by the pussy. You can do anything.\u201d Then last year a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing the columnist E Jean Carroll in 1996, awarding her $5m. Trump\u2019s presidency and its aftermath were no less morally compromised. He made more than 30,000 false or misleading claims over four years, according to a count by the Washington Post newspaper, spanning everything from the crowd size at his inauguration to the result of the 2020 election. He became the first president to be impeached twice, first for withholding military aid to pressure Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate his political opponents, then for instigating a coup on 6 January 2021 following his defeat. He also became the subject of not one but four criminal cases, any one of which would have been enough to scuttle the chances of any other White House hopeful. In May Trump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records relating to a hush-money payment to the adult film performer Stormy Daniels, making him the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes. Sentencing is scheduled for 26 November (the judge delayed it from 18 September after the Republican nominee asked that it wait until after the election). What was billed as the trial of the century has already begun to fade from public consciousness and played a relatively modest role in the election campaign.

Trains are now announced earlier, and a giant digital billboard that once beamed adverts at the tired eyes of angry passengers has been turned off.</p> <p>Now, there is a calm in the air. A dozen or so minutes before rush hour, commuters saunter leisurely while carol singers perform to a growing crowd of jovial admirers. A steady stream of passengers walk to their trains with ample time. Some even manage to grab a drink on the way.</p>    <p>Have the changes transformed the station into a tranquil terminus? \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a lot more chill that it was the last few times I\u2019ve been here,\u201d said Helen, 43, who works in pensions.

      "bodyText": "Waiting for her train home to Glasgow, Beth Johnston expressed a sentiment familiar to those who regularly travel north out of the capital: \u201cEuston is hell.\u201d The station, a dreaded entry and departure point to and from London, is synonymous with nightmarish scenes of overcrowding and passenger crushes caused by last-minute train announcements. But after a clamour of protest that reverberated from the run-down concourse of Euston all the way to the desk of the transport secretary in Westminster, action has been taken. Trains are now announced earlier, and a giant digital billboard that once beamed adverts at the tired eyes of angry passengers has been turned off. Now, there is a calm in the air. A dozen or so minutes before rush hour, commuters saunter leisurely while carol singers perform to a growing crowd of jovial admirers. A steady stream of passengers walk to their trains with ample time. Some even manage to grab a drink on the way. Have the changes transformed the station into a tranquil terminus? \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a lot more chill that it was the last few times I\u2019ve been here,\u201d said Helen, 43, who works in pensions. She travelled into London from the Midlands with her mum to watch a play. Euston is the station Helen has to battle through to travel back home after visiting the capital \u2013 and Thursday marked her sixth visit to the capital this year. Both her mum and uncle struggle with their mobility. She called her previous trips a \u201cnightmare\u201d. \u201cEven if you\u2019ve got your seats booked, everybody just rushes as soon as the platform is announced. If they give us more time, it would definitely be a good thing.

For months, she has been training for the 45th.</p> <p>She remembers finishing for the first time in tears, as her hope that she could do it gave way to the realization that she had. She remembers the live bands, witty signs and kind words which have helped her get to Central Park so many times since.</p> <p>And she remembers celebrating the early years by dancing the night away, including one post-race party at a Broadway nightclub.</p>    <p>Brown has run New York through heatwaves and showers, under sunshine and lightning \u2013 the latter would more likely hit a building than a person, she told herself as it cracked overhead \u2013 and past throngs of cheering spectators.</p> <p>Days before she had been due to fly up for this weekend\u2019s race, personal circumstances forced Brown to stay home. in Sarasota, Florida. She still plans to run a marathon on Sunday, heading out at around 3am to beat the heat.</p> <p>At this stage, the endeavor is \u201cpart of who I think I am,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m the person who runs at least one marathon a year.\u201d</p> <p>Over the decades, running \u201chas given me a confidence\u201d, says Brown. \u201cAnything you put your mind to \u2013 make a goal, make a plan, follow it through \u2013 you can do. If you can do this, you can do anything.\u201d</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>Thousands of runners travel across the world to take on New York. Nate Kahaiali\u2019i, 33, has flown nearly 5,000 miles from Hawaii.</p> <p>When the teacher and his neighbors were evacuated as wildfires <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/08/maui-wildfire-six-months-later-housing\">swept Maui last summer</a>, he figured he would return soon enough. Kahaiali\u2019i picked up a few bits and pieces, not realizing what he chose would become all he had left from his house.</p> <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/15/maui-wildfires-community-land-trust\">so many others</a>, he lost his home.</p> <p>Among the small collection he had salvaged were his trusted pair of bright orange Nike Vaporfly running shoes. To him they have become \u201csymbolic, in a way,\u201d of his hometown of<em><strong> </strong></em>L\u0101hain\u0101.</p>    <p>Wearing them, as he will on Sunday, is \u201ca way for me to honor, but also represent, the community,\u201d says Kahaiali\u2019i, who has raised almost $7,000 (and <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/runforlahaina\">counting</a>) for the reconstruction effort by selling T-shirts with the words \u201cL\u0101hain\u0101 Strong\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe main hope \u2013 whether they buy the shirt, or not \u2013 is just to keep Maui in people\u2019s minds,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a year, but there\u2019s still a lot of work for a lot of families out here in L\u0101hain\u0101.\u201d</p> <p>Kahaiali\u2019i, who teaches health, also hopes his marathons will inspire his students, who call him Mr K. \u201cEvery time I come back, they\u2019re like: \u2018Did you win?

She is about to run her first marathon.</p> <p>For years, Gonzalez \u2013 who has lived in New York for more than three decades \u2013 has sat in the grandstand cheering on her daughter, Teresita, and son, Luis.</p> <p>She watched as hundreds of people, of all abilities, and from all walks of life, crossed the finish line. \u201cI saw people who look like me, and I thought I could do it, one day.\u201d</p> <p>Gonzalez is under no illusions that it will be easy. \u201cEverybody goes through tough times,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople fall down. They can get up. I, too, can embark on this journey.\u201d</p> <p>For many who tackle it, this course is less a race than it is a feat of resilience; more a test of perseverance than pace. But she is prepared.</p> <p>Gonzalez, who will run alongside Teresita, 29, and Luis, 32, on Sunday, is excited to see her city from a new angle. \u201cI feel a sense of pride, being from New York City,\u201d she says, \u201cin being able to represent New York City\u201d.</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>Brown, who first ran New York in 1978, has plenty of advice for first-timers. \u201cDon\u2019t eat anything you haven\u2019t eaten before\u201d the night before, for starters. Don\u2019t fret too much about sleeping well, either. And if one of your knees starts feeling dodgy, \u201cthink about your other knee\u201d.</p> <p>Linden recommends treating the first two miles \u2013 a steep uphill climb on the Verrazzano, setting up a sharp downhill descent \u2013 as a warm-up, and not worrying too much about pace. \u201cReally, it\u2019s great,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause New York\u2019s only a 24-mile marathon when you take those two out.\u201d</p> <p>Conversely, once you reach Manhattan in the second half, try not to push too hard. The crowd is \u201cjust electric\u201d, says Linden, \u201cand you\u2019re going to feel like \u2018I must be winning,\u2019 cause they\u2019re going so nuts. But you\u2019ve still got a long ways to go.\u201d</p> <p>Just soak it all up, adds Brown. \u201cDon\u2019t miss things,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t be so into yourself and focused on your running that you\u2019re not seeing the neighborhoods, that you\u2019re not seeing the people that are there.\u201d</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>Some people run New York to show the world. Others are out to show themselves.</p> <p>As elite marathon times get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/13/womens-world-record-marathon-ruth-chepngetich-chicago-marathon\">faster</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/08/kelvin-kiptum-sets-new-marathon-world-record-of-just-over-two-hours\">faster</a>, those at the very front are running against the clock. But the majority of runners who stride through<em><strong> </strong></em>the five boroughs are running <em>for</em> something.</p> <p>For some, this marathon amounts to a grueling physical test. Others will encounter the mental challenges that materialize when your body is pushed to its limits. Many, if not most, will be forced to grapple with both.</p> <p>No matter the journey that led them here; whether it\u2019s their first time, or 45th; whether they\u2019re a few thousand miles, or a stone\u2019s throw, from home; some 50,000 will gather in Sunday\u2019s early hours with the same fundamental goal.</p> <p>Central Park is waiting.</p>",

The hot favorites, including some of the dominant performers in Paris this summer, may be \u201ca little bit too rich for me, at this point in my career\u201d, she admits. \u201cI\u2019m still enjoying and loving racing, but I don\u2019t have anything to prove, necessarily, at this point.\u201d But you never know how the race will unfold. \u201cAnything can happen,\u201d says Linden. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it plays out.\u201d *** Connie Brown, 80, has run this race more than any other woman: 44 times. For months, she has been training for the 45th. She remembers finishing for the first time in tears, as her hope that she could do it gave way to the realization that she had. She remembers the live bands, witty signs and kind words which have helped her get to Central Park so many times since. And she remembers celebrating the early years by dancing the night away, including one post-race party at a Broadway nightclub. Brown has run New York through heatwaves and showers, under sunshine and lightning \u2013 the latter would more likely hit a building than a person, she told herself as it cracked overhead \u2013 and past throngs of cheering spectators. Days before she had been due to fly up for this weekend\u2019s race, personal circumstances forced Brown to stay home. in Sarasota, Florida. She still plans to run a marathon on Sunday, heading out at around 3am to beat the heat. At this stage, the endeavor is \u201cpart of who I think I am,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m the person who runs at least one marathon a year.\u201d Over the decades, running \u201chas given me a confidence\u201d, says Brown. \u201cAnything you put your mind to \u2013 make a goal, make a plan, follow it through \u2013 you can do. If you can do this, you can do anything.\u201d *** Thousands of runners travel across the world to take on New York. Nate Kahaiali\u2019i, 33, has flown nearly 5,000 miles from Hawaii. When the teacher and his neighbors were evacuated as wildfires swept Maui last summer, he figured he would return soon enough. Kahaiali\u2019i picked up a few bits and pieces, not realizing what he chose would become all he had left from his house. Like so many others, he lost his home. Among the small collection he had salvaged were his trusted pair of bright orange Nike Vaporfly running shoes. To him they have become \u201csymbolic, in a way,\u201d of his hometown of L\u0101hain\u0101. Wearing them, as he will on Sunday, is \u201ca way for me to honor, but also represent, the community,\u201d says Kahaiali\u2019i, who has raised almost $7,000 (and counting) for the reconstruction effort by selling T-shirts with the words \u201cL\u0101hain\u0101 Strong\u201d. \u201cThe main hope \u2013 whether they buy the shirt, or not \u2013 is just to keep Maui in people\u2019s minds,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a year, but there\u2019s still a lot of work for a lot of families out here in L\u0101hain\u0101.\u201d Kahaiali\u2019i, who teaches health, also hopes his marathons will inspire his students, who call him Mr K. \u201cEvery time I come back, they\u2019re like: \u2018Did you win? Did you win?\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m like \u2018No, I\u2019m not that fast\u2019.\u201d He is planning to wear his Vaporflys at all six of the world major marathons. With four to go, \u201cthey\u2019re still in pretty good shape.\u201d *** Concepcion Gonzalez, 65, had not run \u201ceven a mile\u201d before this summer. She is about to run her first marathon. For years, Gonzalez \u2013 who has lived in New York for more than three decades \u2013 has sat in the grandstand cheering on her daughter, Teresita, and son, Luis. She watched as hundreds of people, of all abilities, and from all walks of life, crossed the finish line. \u201cI saw people who look like me, and I thought I could do it, one day.\u201d Gonzalez is under no illusions that it will be easy. \u201cEverybody goes through tough times,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople fall down. They can get up. I, too, can embark on this journey.\u201d For many who tackle it, this course is less a race than it is a feat of resilience; more a test of perseverance than pace. But she is prepared. Gonzalez, who will run alongside Teresita, 29, and Luis, 32, on Sunday, is excited to see her city from a new angle. \u201cI feel a sense of pride, being from New York City,\u201d she says, \u201cin being able to represent New York City\u201d. *** Brown, who first ran New York in 1978, has plenty of advice for first-timers. \u201cDon\u2019t eat anything you haven\u2019t eaten before\u201d the night before, for starters. Don\u2019t fret too much about sleeping well, either. And if one of your knees starts feeling dodgy, \u201cthink about your other knee\u201d. Linden recommends treating the first two miles \u2013 a steep uphill climb on the Verrazzano, setting up a sharp downhill descent \u2013 as a warm-up, and not worrying too much about pace. \u201cReally, it\u2019s great,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause New York\u2019s only a 24-mile marathon when you take those two out.\u201d Conversely, once you reach Manhattan in the second half, try not to push too hard. The crowd is \u201cjust electric\u201d, says Linden, \u201cand you\u2019re going to feel like \u2018I must be winning,\u2019 cause they\u2019re going so nuts. But you\u2019ve still got a long ways to go.\u201d Just soak it all up, adds Brown. \u201cDon\u2019t miss things,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t be so into yourself and focused on your running that you\u2019re not seeing the neighborhoods, that you\u2019re not seeing the people that are there.\u201d *** Some people run New York to show the world. Others are out to show themselves. As elite marathon times get faster and faster, those at the very front are running against the clock. But the majority of runners who stride through the five boroughs are running for something. For some, this marathon amounts to a grueling physical test. Others will encounter the mental challenges that materialize when your body is pushed to its limits. Many, if not most, will be forced to grapple with both. No matter the journey that led them here; whether it\u2019s their first time, or 45th; whether they\u2019re a few thousand miles, or a stone\u2019s throw, from home; some 50,000 will gather in Sunday\u2019s early hours with the same fundamental goal. Central Park is waiting.",

She initially told Glenn she would \u201cdo a few days a week and be gone in a couple of years\u201d but soon found herself immersed in the job full time. \u201cOne of the good decisions we made, I think, was, he [Glenn] asked: \u2018Did we want a women\u2019s department?\u2019 And I said: \u2018No, I want someone in every division of the FA who has the women\u2019s game as their No&nbsp;1 priority, and then I\u2019ll pull them together as a women\u2019s unit, a sort of matrix management system, so that everybody in the FA buys into the women\u2019s game.\u2019 That\u2019s where it started. I\u2019ve been grateful to work with tremendous people.\u201d</p> <p>Listening to Campbell in a changing room at St George\u2019s Park it is evident her passion for girls\u2019 participation is as strong, if not stronger, than her joy at the Lionesses\u2019 Euro 2022 success, and she feels the latter \u201cadded rocket fuel\u201d to the former. She can point to recent figures such as a 56% increase in women and girls playing football since 2020 and an 88% rise in female coaches in the same period. Yet perhaps the decision to appoint Sarina Wiegman as England\u2019s head coach \u2013 a recruitment process carried out with the chief executive, Mark Bullingham, and technical director, Kay Cossington \u2013 will prove to be the most crucial taken since Campbell arrived.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we realised Phil [Neville]was going, we started that search, and Kay said to me: \u2018There\u2019s this brilliant woman called Sarina Wiegman \u2026\u2019 We knew we needed <em>the</em> best coach. The players were ready. They wanted so much to win. We wanted to enable them to do that. Technically, tactically, she was a proven winner.</p>    <p>\u201cOne of the first things we said to each other when we first talked was, we\u2019d both been PE teachers. She realised how important school was and the bigger picture. We had a shared belief that, if we could create success at the top, we could generate something really exciting.\u201d</p> <p>On 31 July 2022, a nervous Campbell could not stomach food before England\u2019s Euros final meeting with Germany. It is noticeable after open training sessions that the Lionesses often line up for a hug with Campbell if they see her pitchside, and her bond with the squad added to her matchday anxiety. \u201cPeople have often asked me: \u2018Was it enjoyable?\u2019 And my answer is: \u2018No.\u2019 It was absolute agony!\u201d Campbell recalls. \u201cWhen Chloe [Kelly] scored that goal I did have a temptation to take my top off and run around the royal box doing the same thing but I thought it might not go down too well!</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a picture of me sitting on the podium [after the game] and I was thinking: \u2018There\u2019s 87,000 people in here and God knows how many are watching on television \u2013 I wonder how many lives we\u2019ve changed today? I wonder how many girls we\u2019ve lit a light in today?\u2019 It was like watching Super Saturday at the Olympics.\u201d</p>    <p>A year later, England\u2019s next major tournament would be a rather different experience for Campbell. Shortly before the Lionesses travelled to Australia, where they reached a first World Cup final, she found out she had cancer. She is in remission and in good health, but talks here publicly for the first time about what she endured then. </p> <p>\u201cThey discovered I had cancer cells on my face and my back. I either had to delay treatment or start treatment and not go \u2013 that was the choice, and I chose to delay it. Mentally you start to think of the worst possible outcome. We all do it, don\u2019t we? So I was beginning to feel very vulnerable and very unwell. The hard bit was not knowing what was going to happen to me. Everybody who gets any treatment or prognosis that has the \u2018C\u2019 word in it has the same reaction. You immediately think you\u2019re going to die. You think: \u2018How long have I got?\u2019 I was listening to Chris Hoy recently, the way he spoke about stage 4 cancer and how courageous he is. I wasn\u2019t that courageous. I wasn\u2019t that strong. I found it hard.</p> <p>\u201cBut all of us have massive challenges in our lives at different points and what brings you through in the end is your sheer determination that you just want to live a little longer to do more. It feels like I\u2019ve been given another chance to do more.</p> <p>\u201cWatching the World Cup, I loved their [the England team\u2019s] grit. That will to win, that defiance, it was there in abundance, sheer grit. I was proud of them and it was great to watch them, but I was a little bit introverted in the sense that I just wanted to get home and get sorted. So when I got home [from Australia], I went straight for treatment and \u2013 touching everything around me \u2013 I seem to be on top of it. For the moment, it\u2019s clear, I just have to have it checked every couple of years, but I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell says she doesn\u2019t mind little changes such as having to wear a hat when gardening even in the winter, or tweaking her diet slightly \u2013 smiling, she insists she will still eat her favourite food, chips \u2013 and is looking forward to more walks with her playful dog, a German wirehaired pointer, among the deer and woodland in rural Leicestershire.</p>    <p>However, even aged 76, she says: \u201cI\u2019m not finished. I think I\u2019ve still got too much energy to just park myself somewhere. [But] I wouldn\u2019t step away if I didn\u2019t think it [women\u2019s football] was in great shape. I\u2019m proud of the team I\u2019m leaving behind and I\u2019m really excited about Sue Day as my successor; she\u2019s fantastic, she\u2019s going to be awesome.</p> <p>\u201cIs there more to do in the women\u2019s game? Massively. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to think: \u2018It\u2019s done.\u2019 We\u2019ve made a great start. If it was a 400m race, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve got out the blocks well, we\u2019ve got up the back straight and we\u2019ve still got the top bend and the home straight to do, because that feels like where we are. We can contribute so much to girls\u2019 and women\u2019s happiness, let alone their physical and mental wellness, through sport.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell says there are dozens of people she would like to thank&nbsp;at the FA, and cannot speak highly enough of the team behind the scenes trying to change the game. \u201cI never understood that inbuilt&nbsp;thing in society that constrains girls into thinking they can\u2019t rather than they can. I hope I\u2019ve changed a bit of that for some girls. They can be whatever they want to be. Why can\u2019t girls play football? We\u2019re here. Now help us be as good as we can be.\u201d</p>",

If it was a 400m race, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve got out the blocks well, we\u2019ve got up the back straight and we\u2019ve still got the top bend and the home straight to do, because that feels like where we are. We can contribute so much to girls\u2019 and women\u2019s happiness, let alone their physical and mental wellness, through sport.\u201d Campbell says there are dozens of people she would like to thank at the FA, and cannot speak highly enough of the team behind the scenes trying to change the game. \u201cI never understood that inbuilt thing in society that constrains girls into thinking they can\u2019t rather than they can. I hope I\u2019ve changed a bit of that for some girls. They can be whatever they want to be. Why can\u2019t girls play football? We\u2019re here. Now help us be as good as we can be.\u201d",

The comedian, and frontman of the Horne Section, did not know when he scheduled the tour that his football team would be playing a first-round FA Cup match on ITV.</p> <p>With Chesham United kicking off against League One Lincoln half an hour before his own show begins, he is pondering how to keep up with the score. \u201cElton John apparently watched Watford\u2019s FA Cup final on an iPad on his piano during a gig in Copenhagen,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s mainly about the occasion, so it\u2019s gutting I\u2019m not there.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/01/tamworth-huddersfield-fa-cup-match-report\">Tamworth stun Huddersfield in FA Cup upset after Tom Tonks causes chaos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a club director Horne has, however, been helping to prepare the tiny ground for its closeup. The past week has been a busy one: TV gantries had to be built from scratch and additional toilets installed. Horne\u2019s contribution was to shoot an intro for the broadcasters, \u201cwhich was weird, because you\u2019re trying to be a comedian, and it\u2019s very easy to take the piss out of a non-league football club. But you also want to show that it\u2019s genuine and, you know, I really love the place\u201d.</p> <p>The team\u2019s profile has rocketed since Taskmaster, Horne\u2019s global TV hit, became their shirt sponsor. Attendances have climbed from a few hundred two years ago to an average of 1,000, although the comic refuses to take credit. \u201cLast season we won the first seven matches in the league and we\u2019ve had that momentum ever since, because people suddenly realised we\u2019re quite good.\u201d</p> <p>They are expecting 4,000 for Monday\u2019s game, although Horne is less worried about crowd numbers than the fact they\u2019ll be turned away from the bar. \u201cThe FA Cup\u2019s weird because you can\u2019t drink in the stands,\u201d he says \u2013 most non-league supporters are used to being allowed to drink as they watch a game. He once found himself on the wrong end of the Football Association\u2019s rules, turned away from the directors\u2019 box for not wearing a tie.</p> <p>Do Chesham have a rowdy end? \u201cThere\u2019s about 50 rowdy-ish people who stand behind the opposition goal.\u201d Horne enjoys the good-natured banter with the opposition goalkeeper \u201cwho can hear every word you\u2019re saying\u201d, and the fact the two sets of fans have to shuffle past each other at half-time. He compares the atmosphere to that at cricket, another sport he loves.</p> <p>\u201cThe main thing is, you don\u2019t have to sit down. If you\u2019re going to watch a Premier League team, you can\u2019t move, that\u2019s it, you have to watch the football. At Chesham you see someone over there, go and chat to them for a bit, it\u2019s really sociable.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a good time to be a Chesham supporter. Promoted last season, they are 10th in the National League South. They lost their top scorer, Ricardo German<strong>, </strong>to Hemel Hempstead in May but have a new centre-forward in Nathan Minhas, and the engine room is provided by the long-serving midfielder Lewis Rolfe and captain, Steve Brown. They also have two managers \u2013 helpful, because one was required to spend the past half-term week at Disneyland Paris with his family.</p> <p>This will be the 10th time Chesham have competed in the FA Cup proper \u2013 their best result is a third-round defeat by Cambridge United in 1980, although eight years ago they won the Giant-Killing Award for their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/08/fa-cup-first-round-roundup-chesham-bristol-rovers\">first-round defeat of Bristol Rovers</a>.

      "bodyText": "Ticket-holders to Alex Horne\u2019s gig in Edinburgh on Monday evening be warned \u2013 there may be a very long interval. The comedian, and frontman of the Horne Section, did not know when he scheduled the tour that his football team would be playing a first-round FA Cup match on ITV. With Chesham United kicking off against League One Lincoln half an hour before his own show begins, he is pondering how to keep up with the score. \u201cElton John apparently watched Watford\u2019s FA Cup final on an iPad on his piano during a gig in Copenhagen,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s mainly about the occasion, so it\u2019s gutting I\u2019m not there.\u201d As a club director Horne has, however, been helping to prepare the tiny ground for its closeup. The past week has been a busy one: TV gantries had to be built from scratch and additional toilets installed. Horne\u2019s contribution was to shoot an intro for the broadcasters, \u201cwhich was weird, because you\u2019re trying to be a comedian, and it\u2019s very easy to take the piss out of a non-league football club. But you also want to show that it\u2019s genuine and, you know, I really love the place\u201d. The team\u2019s profile has rocketed since Taskmaster, Horne\u2019s global TV hit, became their shirt sponsor. Attendances have climbed from a few hundred two years ago to an average of 1,000, although the comic refuses to take credit. \u201cLast season we won the first seven matches in the league and we\u2019ve had that momentum ever since, because people suddenly realised we\u2019re quite good.\u201d They are expecting 4,000 for Monday\u2019s game, although Horne is less worried about crowd numbers than the fact they\u2019ll be turned away from the bar. \u201cThe FA Cup\u2019s weird because you can\u2019t drink in the stands,\u201d he says \u2013 most non-league supporters are used to being allowed to drink as they watch a game. He once found himself on the wrong end of the Football Association\u2019s rules, turned away from the directors\u2019 box for not wearing a tie. Do Chesham have a rowdy end? \u201cThere\u2019s about 50 rowdy-ish people who stand behind the opposition goal.\u201d Horne enjoys the good-natured banter with the opposition goalkeeper \u201cwho can hear every word you\u2019re saying\u201d, and the fact the two sets of fans have to shuffle past each other at half-time. He compares the atmosphere to that at cricket, another sport he loves. \u201cThe main thing is, you don\u2019t have to sit down. If you\u2019re going to watch a Premier League team, you can\u2019t move, that\u2019s it, you have to watch the football. At Chesham you see someone over there, go and chat to them for a bit, it\u2019s really sociable.\u201d It\u2019s a good time to be a Chesham supporter. Promoted last season, they are 10th in the National League South. They lost their top scorer, Ricardo German, to Hemel Hempstead in May but have a new centre-forward in Nathan Minhas, and the engine room is provided by the long-serving midfielder Lewis Rolfe and captain, Steve Brown. They also have two managers \u2013 helpful, because one was required to spend the past half-term week at Disneyland Paris with his family. This will be the 10th time Chesham have competed in the FA Cup proper \u2013 their best result is a third-round defeat by Cambridge United in 1980, although eight years ago they won the Giant-Killing Award for their first-round defeat of Bristol Rovers. Last year they lost 2-0 to Maidstone in the first round, and this season\u2019s qualifying run has earned them a reputation for late drama, including a stoppage-time header in the previous round against Yeovil. \u201cWhich is great,\u201d says Horne, \u201cbecause it\u2019s helped the psychology of the players, and people have stopped leaving early.\u201d Chesham Women, meanwhile, play their own FA Cup first-round match against Fulham on Sunday. One of the players goes to the same school as Horne\u2019s children and he is keen to note that the women\u2019s side play fourth-tier football, which is higher than the men. They don\u2019t yet get the same support, but the club are hoping to install a 4G pitch so the two teams can play their matches on the same day and share the crowd.

But the Tokyo Games, delayed by a year owing to the coronavirus pandemic, also marked Daley\u2019s debut as an equally accomplished knitter and crocheter \u2013 a hitherto semi-hidden side to his life that continued through to his valedictory, silver medal-winning appearance in Paris this summer, and now into retirement. No one was more surprised than the man himself by the reaction to the sight of Daley, seated on a blue plastic seat in the near-empty Tokyo Aquatics Centre, painstakingly creating what would become his personal tribute to the host city. In a way, that white cardigan, embellished with the union flag, the Team GB logo and the Olympic rings, the kanji characters for \u201cTokyo\u201d embroidered on the front, was symbolic of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the Games. Spectators were banned from all but a handful of venues, including the main stadium, while daily medal counts were accompanied by a running total of new Covid-19 infections in the Olympic village \u2013 the only neighbourhood in the city athletes were permitted to set foot in when they weren\u2019t competing. Knitting, Daley explained after the images of him mid-purl went viral, had been a distraction from the intense pressure of competition, and from the tedium of life in the pandemic-hit Games bubble. Three years later, Daley is poised to revisit the city that cemented his association with yarn in the minds of the public, with his first knitted art exhibition, at Parco Museum Tokyo in the Japanese capital\u2019s Shibuya district. The event, that runs for 18 days from 8-25 November and with Daley in attendance on the opening day to give a live knitting workshop, will include personally selected pieces under the theme Made With Love \u2013 also the name given to his range of yarns and an Instagram account that has traced his second career in wool since it began a year before the Tokyo Olympics. \u201cI\u2019d been knitting since March 2020, but no one really cared until they saw me do it at the Olympics,\u201d Daley told the Guardian from his home in California, where he lives with his husband, the film-maker Dustin Lance Black, and their two young children. \u201cI think some people thought I didn\u2019t care about the Olympics, that I was just knitting.

      "body": "<p>When I was a late teenager I went to my mate\u2019s house to pick him up, which you just don\u2019t do as an adult, do you? I feel like for a 24-month period in my teens, all I did was go to mates\u2019 houses to pick them up: hands in my hoodie pockets and kicking my feet on the carpet, making an agonising attempt at polite conversation with a series of uninterested parents while a friend of mine, upstairs, frantically turned his bedroom over to find a sort-of-clean pair of jeans.</p> <p>One of these times, I was isolated with a friend\u2019s dad who, on the best day of his life, probably said 10 full words out loud. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/14/the-bourne-identity-surprise-hit-changed-action-film-making#:~:text=Guardian%20Pick&amp;text=Damon%20is%20perfect%20as%20the,up%20and%20down%20the%20backstreets.\">The Bourne Identity</a> boomed out of the TV and we both stared at it, me standing, him sitting, complete silence. Matt Damon shot a man in the head, then another man, then drove a car over a bridge, then shot another man. The camera moved around frenetically; the room flickered with light. And my friend\u2019s dad, for the first time in his life, said a sentence to me unprompted. And it was: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be ace to just wake up and be <em>that good</em>?\u201d</p> <p>I was reminded of that this week when watching the Eddie Redmayne-led remake of The Day of the Jackal (7 November, 9pm, Sky Atlantic), where Redmayne is the Jackal, and he has woken up <em>that good</em>. He is a master of disguise and an even greater master of a sniper rifle. He is careful and considered and doesn\u2019t make mistakes. He folds his gun away and leaves a bomb under the bed for any riot police who can figure out where the shot came from. He switches cars between Munich and Paris and disappears like a wisp of smoke. He can speak in any language and any accent and, for some reason, collects old chess pieces. He wears a suede jacket in episode two that is so beautiful it made me want to bite my own hands off. He stands in an internet cafe with a hand on his hip and drinks a swampy vending machine espresso and even makes that look cool. I can\u2019t get over it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUb_04MdnMI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EUb_04MdnMI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>We all agree, obviously, that assassins are cool, and TV and film sequences where someone plans a high-stakes, impossible-angled shot (then actually pulls it off!) are really cool, too. The problem with assassin stories is, necessarily, they kind of have to be about the downfall of the assassin. They are plunged into a mess, or a disaster, or a pulse point of family is pressed upon, and they have to think on their feet for as long as we can hold our breath until, ultimately, they are caught. And as soon as that starts happening, they are immediately less cool. Watching a guy make a shot from a mile away is amazing; watching him run into an obvious trap because they used a voice recording of his wife is lame. Many assassin stories speed through the good bit (cool kills!) to&nbsp;race to the more boring and rubbish bit (badly written scenes where a small child says: \u201cDaddy,&nbsp;are you going away?\u201d).</p> <p>Thankfully, The Day of the Jackal has avoided all that, and it is amazing for it. I, like you, wondered whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/27/eddie-redmayne-until-theres-a-levelling-there-are-certain-parts-i-wouldnt-play\">Eddie Redmayne</a> \u2013 an astonishing actor who nevertheless feels as if he still wears a prefect badge \u2013 had it in him to play a calculated, controlled, elegant weapon of astounding horror, but he really, really does. His Jackal is chameleonic and ice-cold, a different man from scene to scene, never really knowing who he is and how he ended up here but seeing that he is doing a thousand calculations at once while he\u2019s doing it. Redmayne doesn\u2019t actually have much dialogue, and he doesn\u2019t move his face much either, but somehow he conveys all this by stalking around the screen in a turtleneck: it\u2019s as if he\u2019s secretly uncovered a new way of acting.</p> <p>A cat-and-mouse chase wouldn\u2019t work, though, if the cat weren\u2019t as compelling as the mouse, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/jan/27/actor-lashana-lynch-interview-007-bond-bob-marley-rita-marley-marvel\">Lashana Lynch</a>\u2019s Bianca is a wonderful foil. A slightly annoying co-worker at MI6, a stretched-too-thin mum at home, a double agent when the need arises, she\u2019s grabbed on to a few grainy CCTV screenshots of Eddie Redmayne running away from Germany with both hands and all her teeth. The pair haven\u2019t even met in the episodes I\u2019ve seen \u2013 I\u2019m sure their \u201cHeat<em> </em>diner scene\u201d is in the post, and I personally can\u2019t wait \u2013 but they somehow manage to play off each other anyway. Hey: wouldn\u2019t it be ace to wake up and make a TV&nbsp;show <em>that good</em>?</p>",

      "bodyText": "When I was a late teenager I went to my mate\u2019s house to pick him up, which you just don\u2019t do as an adult, do you? I feel like for a 24-month period in my teens, all I did was go to mates\u2019 houses to pick them up: hands in my hoodie pockets and kicking my feet on the carpet, making an agonising attempt at polite conversation with a series of uninterested parents while a friend of mine, upstairs, frantically turned his bedroom over to find a sort-of-clean pair of jeans. One of these times, I was isolated with a friend\u2019s dad who, on the best day of his life, probably said 10 full words out loud. The Bourne Identity boomed out of the TV and we both stared at it, me standing, him sitting, complete silence. Matt Damon shot a man in the head, then another man, then drove a car over a bridge, then shot another man. The camera moved around frenetically; the room flickered with light. And my friend\u2019s dad, for the first time in his life, said a sentence to me unprompted. And it was: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be ace to just wake up and be that good?\u201d I was reminded of that this week when watching the Eddie Redmayne-led remake of The Day of the Jackal (7 November, 9pm, Sky Atlantic), where Redmayne is the Jackal, and he has woken up that good. He is a master of disguise and an even greater master of a sniper rifle. He is careful and considered and doesn\u2019t make mistakes. He folds his gun away and leaves a bomb under the bed for any riot police who can figure out where the shot came from. He switches cars between Munich and Paris and disappears like a wisp of smoke. He can speak in any language and any accent and, for some reason, collects old chess pieces. He wears a suede jacket in episode two that is so beautiful it made me want to bite my own hands off. He stands in an internet cafe with a hand on his hip and drinks a swampy vending machine espresso and even makes that look cool. I can\u2019t get over it. We all agree, obviously, that assassins are cool, and TV and film sequences where someone plans a high-stakes, impossible-angled shot (then actually pulls it off!) are really cool, too. The problem with assassin stories is, necessarily, they kind of have to be about the downfall of the assassin. They are plunged into a mess, or a disaster, or a pulse point of family is pressed upon, and they have to think on their feet for as long as we can hold our breath until, ultimately, they are caught. And as soon as that starts happening, they are immediately less cool. Watching a guy make a shot from a mile away is amazing; watching him run into an obvious trap because they used a voice recording of his wife is lame. Many assassin stories speed through the good bit (cool kills!) to race to the more boring and rubbish bit (badly written scenes where a small child says: \u201cDaddy, are you going away?\u201d). Thankfully, The Day of the Jackal has avoided all that, and it is amazing for it. I, like you, wondered whether Eddie Redmayne \u2013 an astonishing actor who nevertheless feels as if he still wears a prefect badge \u2013 had it in him to play a calculated, controlled, elegant weapon of astounding horror, but he really, really does. His Jackal is chameleonic and ice-cold, a different man from scene to scene, never really knowing who he is and how he ended up here but seeing that he is doing a thousand calculations at once while he\u2019s doing it. Redmayne doesn\u2019t actually have much dialogue, and he doesn\u2019t move his face much either, but somehow he conveys all this by stalking around the screen in a turtleneck: it\u2019s as if he\u2019s secretly uncovered a new way of acting. A cat-and-mouse chase wouldn\u2019t work, though, if the cat weren\u2019t as compelling as the mouse, and Lashana Lynch\u2019s Bianca is a wonderful foil. A slightly annoying co-worker at MI6, a stretched-too-thin mum at home, a double agent when the need arises, she\u2019s grabbed on to a few grainy CCTV screenshots of Eddie Redmayne running away from Germany with both hands and all her teeth. The pair haven\u2019t even met in the episodes I\u2019ve seen \u2013 I\u2019m sure their \u201cHeat diner scene\u201d is in the post, and I personally can\u2019t wait \u2013 but they somehow manage to play off each other anyway. Hey: wouldn\u2019t it be ace to wake up and make a TV show that good?",

Poor sanitation is just one of the UN-administered Palestinian camp\u2019s problems \u2013 but things will get much worse.</p> <p>Despite huge international pressure not to jeopardise the work of Unrwa, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/28/israeli-lawmakers-pass-bill-that-could-halt-unwra-relief-work-in-gaza\">Israeli parliament voted this week to ban the organisation</a> from operating on its soil. It also declared it a terror group, in effect severing all cooperation and communication between the UN agency and the Jewish state.</p> <p>At present it is unclear how the new laws, which are supposed to come into effect in 90 days, will affect aid in Gaza, where UN officials say humanitarian efforts for 2.3 million people are \u201ccompletely dependent\u201d on Unrwa staff, facilities and logistical capabilities. Another 900,000 Palestinians in the West Bank rely on the organisation for basic services, which the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority does not have the capacity to take over, leading to fears <a href=\"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1w4981zke\">it could collapse</a> altogether.</p> <p>\u201cI have studied Unrwa for many years; I can emphatically say there is no alternative. It is not like other UN agencies in terms of the scope and scale of what the international community and Israel has asked it to provide while there is no solution to the conflict,\u201d said Dr Maya Rosenfeld, a sociologist and anthropologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p> <p>\u201cEmergency providers can step in for a short time, but they cannot replace what Unrwa does long-term. It is too big to fail,\u201d she added.</p> <p>The new bills could yet be vetoed by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, if he can be persuaded to by western allies who support Unrwa\u2019s activities. The legislation will also be challenged in petitions made by human rights groups to Israel\u2019s supreme court.</p> <p>At stake are 96 schools in the West Bank serving 45,000 students, as well as 43 health centres, food distribution services for refugee families, and psychological support services, according to the agency\u2019s website. Before the war in Gaza, Unrwa operated 278 schools for 290,000 students, ran 22 medical centres, and distributed food packages to 1.1 million people.

      "bodyText": "Bin bags were piling up at one end of the chaotic main thoroughfare in Shuafat refugee camp on Friday morning as shoppers walked by, stepping over a stream of wastewater trickling from a nearby drainpipe. Poor sanitation is just one of the UN-administered Palestinian camp\u2019s problems \u2013 but things will get much worse. Despite huge international pressure not to jeopardise the work of Unrwa, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, the Israeli parliament voted this week to ban the organisation from operating on its soil. It also declared it a terror group, in effect severing all cooperation and communication between the UN agency and the Jewish state. At present it is unclear how the new laws, which are supposed to come into effect in 90 days, will affect aid in Gaza, where UN officials say humanitarian efforts for 2.3 million people are \u201ccompletely dependent\u201d on Unrwa staff, facilities and logistical capabilities. Another 900,000 Palestinians in the West Bank rely on the organisation for basic services, which the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority does not have the capacity to take over, leading to fears it could collapse altogether. \u201cI have studied Unrwa for many years; I can emphatically say there is no alternative. It is not like other UN agencies in terms of the scope and scale of what the international community and Israel has asked it to provide while there is no solution to the conflict,\u201d said Dr Maya Rosenfeld, a sociologist and anthropologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \u201cEmergency providers can step in for a short time, but they cannot replace what Unrwa does long-term. It is too big to fail,\u201d she added. The new bills could yet be vetoed by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, if he can be persuaded to by western allies who support Unrwa\u2019s activities. The legislation will also be challenged in petitions made by human rights groups to Israel\u2019s supreme court. At stake are 96 schools in the West Bank serving 45,000 students, as well as 43 health centres, food distribution services for refugee families, and psychological support services, according to the agency\u2019s website. Before the war in Gaza, Unrwa operated 278 schools for 290,000 students, ran 22 medical centres, and distributed food packages to 1.1 million people. It now serves as a crucial emergency lifeline. The anti-Unrwa legislation, passed by a 92-10 vote in the Knesset late on Monday evening, marks an all-time low in Israel\u2019s relationship with the UN, which it has long accused of bias. Decades of friction came to a head in the aftermath of Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack last year, in which Israel alleged 12 Unrwa employees took part. The agency fired several staff members as a result of an independent inquiry but says that Israel\u2019s wider accusations that as many as 10% of its 13,000 staff in Gaza support the Palestinian militant group are unfounded. If the ban is operationalised, Israel would stop issuing entry and work permits to foreign Unrwa staff, and would end coordination with the Israeli military to permit aid shipments into Gaza, in effect blocking aid delivery into the beleaguered territory. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people will slip from acute food insecurity into mass starvation,\u201d said Chris Gunness, who was an Unrwa spokesperson from 2007 to 2020. In besieged northern Gaza, where Israel last month renewed a ferocious aerial and ground offensive critics say is designed to force the estimated 400,000 remaining people to leave for the relative safety of the south, conditions are already the worst of the war to date. On Friday, the heads of UN agencies described the situation as \u201capocalyptic\u201d. Banning Unrwa would mean the humanitarian response everywhere else in the strip would also fail, Gunness added. \u201cThere will be no one to receive them, put shelter over their heads, provide food, water, medicine and sanitation products for women and girls. In the longer term, the children Unrwa educates in Gaza \u2013 already deep in trauma after the most brutal civilian bombardment since the second world war \u2013 will become a lost generation \u2026 This will seriously undermine the prospects of peace in the Middle East for many years,\u201d he said. Israel has said it will work with international partners \u2013 who have heavily criticised the anti-Unrwa move \u2013 to \u201cfacilitate humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not threaten Israel\u2019s security\u201d, but is yet to propose an alternative aid structure. In Jerusalem, if the ban went ahead, Unrwa would have to shutter its headquarters in the half of the city annexed by Israel, effectively ending its presence there.

      "body": "<p>Around a month before the US elections, in the Kharkiv region, I sat down with a group of Ukrainian infantry soldiers together with the American historian Timothy Snyder. I suggested they ask questions of him not only as an American historian, but also as an American citizen.</p> \n<p>The servicemen were curious about the upcoming election, but mainly the chances of receiving significant military aid any time soon. They expressed pity that many Americans still don\u2019t understand that the Ukrainian fight is not just about us. It\u2019s in the world\u2019s interests to support the fight against blatant breaches of the international order.</p> \n<p>The anxiety of the American elections is felt more strongly in Kyiv among Ukrainian officials and civil society leaders because Ukraine has become a partisan issue, and part of US domestic politics. These groups have been trying for years to be on good terms with both Democrats and Republicans in the US. This was especially true during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/20/us-house-vote-foreign-aid-ukraine-support\">long delays in Congress</a> over the vote for security assistance to Ukraine. But engaging with the Maga camp has become difficult. This only got worse when it was revealed what Donald Trump\u2019s vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, said in 2022: \u201cI gotta be honest with you, I don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d During the race, Vance has characterised Vladimir Putin as an \u201cadversary\u201d and \u201ccompetitor\u201d, rather than an enemy, and has generally argued that the US should be focusing on China, not Russia.</p> \n<p>Then there are the claims from Trump that he could end the war in \u201c24 hours\u201d, presumably with a phone call to Putin. To be honest, these sort of statements don\u2019t worry Ukrainians that much since they don\u2019t sound remotely realistic. There are no signs the Russian president is changing his goal to destroy Ukraine as a state. What people are really worried about is the slowing down, or even stopping, of US military assistance.</p> \n<p>In Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, one of the most important battleground states, I had a chance to talk to various Ukrainian Americans, including those from the older, more conservative diaspora, who have traditionally voted Republican. They shared strong anti-communist sentiment in the past but today are more united around ideas of faith and family values. Some of them told me they were worried by Vance\u2019s remarks. Still, their arguments would alight elsewhere: it was the Democrat Barack Obama who didn\u2019t firmly react to the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014 and refused to provide military aid. Some of those narratives can be heard among conservative Ukrainians back home, too.</p> \n<p>Ukrainians often ask me what exactly the candidates are saying about our country on the campaign trail. I had to reply that, honestly, Ukraine wasn\u2019t being explicitly mentioned at the rallies, at least the ones I attended. In Saginaw, Michigan, a manufacturing town, Vance didn\u2019t mention Ukraine even once, mainly warning about the risks of local workers losing their jobs because of Chinese electric vehicles. Kamala Harris, at a campaign rally in the university town of Ann Arbor, spoke of Trump\u2019s fascination with authoritarian leaders like Putin.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a084303-0ae9-46d8-be1a-9e41a4a096a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lGhbEbCa32w?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump himself, speaking in Pennsylvania, did say at least three times that he wouldn\u2019t spend taxpayers\u2019 money on wars \u201cin countries you have never heard of and don\u2019t want to hear of\u201d. The audience loudly cheered.</p> \n<p>After Joe Biden dropped out of the race, some people in Kyiv hoped that he could now afford to be less cautious and use his remaining time in office to accelerate support for Ukraine. The speculation was that he would want a positive foreign policy legacy to leave behind, amid the retreat from Afghanistan and tragedy unfolding in the Middle East. By October, it became clear that the current US administration wasn\u2019t planning on doing anything big before the election.</p> \n<p>Some measures were taken. On 23 October, Washington finalised its $20bn portion of a $50bn loan to Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets. This will be placed alongside a separate $20bn EU commitment and $10bn split between Britain, Japan and Canada. It is supposed to be repaid with the earnings from the more than $300bn in sovereign Russian assets that were immobilised in February 2022 and are mostly held in Europe.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/23/west-ukraine-escalation-vladimir-putin\">The west\u2019s cautious approach seeks to avoid escalation in Ukraine. It may have opposite effect | Andriy Zagorodnyuk</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But in the long run, the lives of Ukrainian soldiers depend not just on the funds for military aid but on specific types of weapons. President Zelenskyy has spent recent months lobbying in the west for his \u201cvictory plan\u201d, which would involve the US providing long-range missiles to Ukraine, which could strike deep inside Russia \u2013 something western powers have been reluctant to approve. His argument is that this may not just turn the tide on the battlefield, but take away the burden from those suffering the most \u2013 Ukrainian infantry. Without that, the Ukrainian army is left to rely on exhausted footsoldiers. Whether or not this plan has any chance of progressing will depend in large part on who wins next week.</p> \n<p>Right after landing in New York, a US colleague asked me if \u201cit was all over for Ukraine if it didn\u2019t receive US assistance after the elections\u201d. I was puzzled by the way the question was asked. I explained that it might be extremely difficult to preserve the lives of Ukrainians if, say, Trump is elected, but it wouldn\u2019t mean the Ukrainian army will stop trying to defend its fellow citizens or simply give up.</p> \n<p>Travelling from one swing state to another, I detected an extreme sense of anxiety among many Americans. It was so palpable, I felt the need to comfort them. Whatever happens, on the morning of 6 November, life in Ukraine will go on. The same will be true in the US. But it doesn\u2019t mean things will be easy. Ukrainians have learned in recent years that worrying can be a luxury; the best option is to commit yourself to working hard to avoid the worst-case scenario, and fighting for what\u2019s right.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Nataliya Gumenyuk is a Ukrainian journalist and CEO of the Public Interest Journalism Lab</p></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Trump himself, speaking in Pennsylvania, did say at least three times that he wouldn\u2019t spend taxpayers\u2019 money on wars \u201cin countries you have never heard of and don\u2019t want to hear of\u201d. The audience loudly cheered. After Joe Biden dropped out of the race, some people in Kyiv hoped that he could now afford to be less cautious and use his remaining time in office to accelerate support for Ukraine. The speculation was that he would want a positive foreign policy legacy to leave behind, amid the retreat from Afghanistan and tragedy unfolding in the Middle East. By October, it became clear that the current US administration wasn\u2019t planning on doing anything big before the election. Some measures were taken. On 23 October, Washington finalised its $20bn portion of a $50bn loan to Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets. This will be placed alongside a separate $20bn EU commitment and $10bn split between Britain, Japan and Canada. It is supposed to be repaid with the earnings from the more than $300bn in sovereign Russian assets that were immobilised in February 2022 and are mostly held in Europe. But in the long run, the lives of Ukrainian soldiers depend not just on the funds for military aid but on specific types of weapons. President Zelenskyy has spent recent months lobbying in the west for his \u201cvictory plan\u201d, which would involve the US providing long-range missiles to Ukraine, which could strike deep inside Russia \u2013 something western powers have been reluctant to approve. His argument is that this may not just turn the tide on the battlefield, but take away the burden from those suffering the most \u2013 Ukrainian infantry. Without that, the Ukrainian army is left to rely on exhausted footsoldiers. Whether or not this plan has any chance of progressing will depend in large part on who wins next week. Right after landing in New York, a US colleague asked me if \u201cit was all over for Ukraine if it didn\u2019t receive US assistance after the elections\u201d. I was puzzled by the way the question was asked. I explained that it might be extremely difficult to preserve the lives of Ukrainians if, say, Trump is elected, but it wouldn\u2019t mean the Ukrainian army will stop trying to defend its fellow citizens or simply give up. Travelling from one swing state to another, I detected an extreme sense of anxiety among many Americans. It was so palpable, I felt the need to comfort them. Whatever happens, on the morning of 6 November, life in Ukraine will go on. The same will be true in the US. But it doesn\u2019t mean things will be easy. Ukrainians have learned in recent years that worrying can be a luxury; the best option is to commit yourself to working hard to avoid the worst-case scenario, and fighting for what\u2019s right.

Sweet, salty, sour, bitter and umami (or savoury) are five taste elements that build our overall perception of flavour. However, the colour of food and drink packaging can mean we expect things to taste a certain way \u2013 purple is sometimes used to signify the taste of blackcurrant or blueberries., 3:A - Sound is a mechanical wave that travels through gases (such as air), liquids (such as water) or solids. Light travels in waves, too, but these are electromagnetic waves. Our eyes are equipped to detect a small proportion of the electromagnetic spectrum., 4:D - Octopuses don\u2019t have ears but they use two small, pouch-like organs behind their eyes, called statocysts, that are lined with sensory hairs. These can pick up some soundwaves that travel through the water., 5:A - Volcano originates from the name of the Roman god of fire, Vulcan, one of ancient Rome's oldest gods.</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"6\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"5\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">5 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"4\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">4 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"3\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">3 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"2\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">2 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"0\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">0 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"1\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">1 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n    </ol>\n   </div> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.mollyoldfield.co.uk/\">Molly Oldfield</a> hosts <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/everything-under-the-sun/id1442273607?mt=2\">Everything Under the Sun</a>, a podcast answering children\u2019s questions.

There\u2019s a regal air about this venerable ski resort in the Veneto region\u2019s north-west, epitomised by its classy Corso Italia, a pedestrianised thoroughfare and favourite <em>passeggiata</em> meeting place.</p> <p>But it\u2019s those massive Dolomites that get me every time \u2013 hulking great chunks of limestone and sedimentary rocks streaked with snow and rising through the Ampezzo valley that turn a delicate shade of pink when the sun goes down.</p> <p>Many people drawn to Cortina\u2019s old\u2011school chic and glamour come here to shop, eat, drink and stroll the pretty streets. That leaves more room on the mountains for people like me to ski, snowshoe and hike amid the beauty of these peaks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Those massive Dolomites rise through the Ampezzo valley and turn a delicate shade of pink when the sun goes down</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cable cars and gondolas run up to several of Cortina\u2019s highest peaks, including 3,244-metre Tofana di Mezzo (featured in the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only), with its fabulous views from the observation deck. I jumped off at <a href=\"https://www.italia.it/en/veneto/belluno/ra-valles\">Ra Valles</a>, the penultimate stop on the cable car, for a hot chocolate at what was billed as the highest pizzeria in Europe (2,470 metres) with a vantage point of the towering peaks.</p> <p>For skiers, the <a href=\"https://cortinadelicious.it/EN/p47-Super8\">Super 8</a> is a top draw. The figure-of-eight circuit is definitely for intermediates and above, but non-skiers can get a taste of its stupendous scenery by taking a chairlift from Bai de Dones to Cinque Torri \u2013 not just five towers, as the name suggests, but 11 rocky columns in the midst of a snowy expanse \u2013 where there\u2019s a snowshoe trail and <a href=\"https://www.rifugioscoiattoli.it/eng/\">Rifugio Scoiattoli</a> has an outdoor hot tub (beds from \u20ac85pp).</p> <p>For more wellness in the mountains <a href=\"https://rifugiolagazuoi.com/EN/p2-Overnight-stay-in-the-Rifugio\">Rifugio Lagazuoi</a> at Lagazuoi (reached by gondola, \u20ac150 B&amp;B) has one of the highest outdoor saunas (\u20ac25pp) in Europe. Like Cinque Torri, Lagazuoi and its surrounding peaks were the scenes of first world war battles between the Austro-Hungarian and Italian armies, and the tunnels and trenches have been restored to create evocative <a href=\"https://cortinadelicious.it/EN/p55-The-WW1-OpenAir-Museums\">open-air museums</a>.<br><em>Doubles at Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hcolumbia.it/en/\">Hotel Columbia</a></em><em> from \u20ac175 B&amp;B</em><br><strong>Mary Novakovich</strong></p> <h2><strong>A spa with a view in Austria</strong></h2>    <p>As the sun creeps over the shoulder of the <a href=\"https://hohetauern.at/en/\">Hohe Tauern</a> mountains, the Gastein valley shimmers under a fresh blanket of snow. Wisps of cloud lift from dark veins of spruce forest to reveal a day like cut crystal. And I can see the whole lovely lot through the picture windows of my room at Haus Hirt in <strong>Bad Gastein</strong>, while wrapped in a robe, sipping coffee. Breakfast is until 11am. Let it wait.</p> <p>On an eyrie-like perch above the treetops, Haus Hirt\u2019s riveting views inspired writers Thomas Mann and Stefan Zweig in the 1930s. A cool revamp of an Alpine lodge, this intimate hotel brings together natural materials like larch wood and granite with a clean, modern aesthetic (courtesy of co-owner architect Ike Ikrath and Japanese interior designer Elma Choung). My days are happily spent between yoga, mood-boosting dips in the mountain-facing Aveda spa, and softly lit dinners.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>On an eyrie-like perch above the treetops, Haus Hirt\u2019s riveting views inspired writers Thomas Mann and Stefan Zweig in the 1930s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clinging to sheer, wooded cliffs, splashed by a raging waterfall with a vertical drop of 341 metres and peering up at some of Austria\u2019s highest peaks, this spa town shot to fame in the 19th century for the healing powers of its radon-laced waters. Over three millennia, water has filtered through the deep rock layers of <a href=\"https://hohetauern.at/en/\">Hohe Tauern</a> and now five million litres of it gush up from 17 springs every day. Schubert, Empress Elisabeth, Klimt and German painter Max Liebermann came here for the cure during the town\u2019s belle epoque heyday. </p> <p>I can see why Bad Gastein touched so many as I pad in quiet exhilaration through the Angertal valley on snowshoes, listen to snow fall softly from the trees, and float silently in the bath-warm thermal pools of <a href=\"https://www.felsentherme.com/\">Felsentherme Gastein</a> as steam rises in the blue dusk and the mountains glow pearl white. Bad Gastein might be sky-high in the Alps, but you don\u2019t have to whack on skis to enjoy its beauty \u2013 just tune into the peace of the winter landscape and let those miracle waters work their magic.<br><em>Accommodation was provided by Haus Hirt. Small doubles from \u20ac2</em><em>20 </em><em>a night, full-board, <a href=\"https://www.haus-hirt.com/\">haus-hirt.com</a></em><br><strong>Kerry Walker</strong></p> <h2><strong>Sledging and snowshoeing in Switzerland</strong></h2>    <p>The <strong>Alpstein</strong> massif in the <a href=\"https://appenzell.ch/en\">Appenzell Alps</a> is where Switzerland most looks like a child\u2019s drawing. In this region, 40 miles east of Zurich, steeple-like peaks and snow-brimmed barns are everywhere, and ghostly footprints disappear over snowbanks. </p> <p>Every winter, I come here to ski, snowshoe, and eat meat and raclette cooked on a stone-slab steingrill, moving from <strong>Appenzell</strong>, the region\u2019s main town, up into the mountains. Something about the place lends itself to micro adventures, and the Alpstein, topped out by S\u00e4ntis at 2,501m, is a piece of pure Alpine theatre.</p> <p>I\u2019d recommend staying in a mountain guesthouse like <a href=\"https://hoherhirschberg.ch/\">Hoher Hirschberg</a>, a cosy wooden place that looks like it hasn\u2019t changed for centuries. Inside, above the pine-clad restaurant (the veal sausage with fried-onion-topped cheese <em>sp\u00e4tzle</em> is particularly good), are bright, simply furnished rooms. From the windows, you can see the ridged horns of the Alpstein, white in the distance, punching out of the valleys below. In deep snow, the last stretch of road to the guesthouse is closed, meaning a 150-metre uphill snowshoe is all part of check-in.</p> <p>For a longer caper, a four-mile trail leads from near Appenzell through wooded foothills right to the guesthouse; the trick is to take a sledge with you to whizz back down again. Equally worthwhile from the valley floor is the two-mile snowshoe for lunch at <a href=\"https://eggli-appenzell.ch/\">Eggli</a>, a historical working farm. If you\u2019re having what I\u2019m having, then it\u2019s a Qu\u00f6llfrisch Hell lager and wurst-k\u00e4se salad, mixed with Appenzeller cheese and sausage.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>At\u00a0the lakeview restaurant, tuck into\u00a0frying pan-sized r\u00f6sti and chocolate cake doused in S\u00e4ntis Malt whisky</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Seven miles south of Hoher Hirschberg is the cable car to <a href=\"https://ebenalp.ch/\">Ebenalp</a>, the valley\u2019s main ski area (return ticket \u00a334). To the east, another cable car takes visitors to the summit of <a href=\"https://hoherkasten.ch/\">Hoher Kasten</a>, which has a terrific revolving restaurant (\u00a336 return). The summit path can be looped in half an hour, but I think it\u2019s better to snowshoe the out-and-back four-mile circuit from the cable car base station to <a href=\"https://plattenboedeli.ch/\">Plattenb\u00f6deli</a> mountain guesthouse, which overlooks blue-grey S\u00e4mtisersee Lake, at 1,209m. The view, I think, is more beautiful than that of the Matterhorn.</p> <p>Like most places in the Alpstein, you\u2019ll be alone in the Plattenb\u00f6deli. At the lakeview restaurant, tuck into frying pan-sized <em>r\u00f6sti</em> and chocolate cake doused in <a href=\"https://saentismalt.com/\">S\u00e4ntis Malt</a> whisky. Happily, that\u2019s tapped from a muscatel barrel and made by Brauerei Locher, from where your adventure first began, down in the valley below, under the twinkling lights of Appenzell.<br><em><a href=\"https://plattenboedeli.ch/\">Plattenb\u00f6deli</a> has doubles from \u00a3134 </em><em>B&amp;B, weekends only in January, February and April. <a href=\"https://hoherhirschberg.ch/\">Hoher Hirschberg</a> has doubles from \u00a3134 </em><em>B&amp;B</em><br><strong>Mike MacEacheran</strong><br></p> <h2><strong>The magic of winter in the Arctic Circle, Norway</strong></h2>    <p>I was cocooned in the hot embrace of a wood barrel sauna, the silence punctuated solely by the crackle and hiss of logs. From its glass-fronted end, I looked across the pewter shimmer of a freezing fjord. On the far side, afternoon light gilded the ridges of the snow-covered mountains. Later, I told myself, I would dip into that large ice bath and let the cold pinch my body pink and awake. But for now I would linger a while longer, revelling in that quiet hunkering down that belongs only to winter, and which Norwegians call <em>kos</em>.</p> <p>Similar to the Danish concept of <em>hygge</em>, this ethos embraces the contrast of coldness and cosiness, of snowy romps followed by retreats around the fire. Both are on offer at Vester\u00e5len Apartments, a trio of fjord-side self-catering houses offering \u201ccalm luxury in the wilderness\u201d near Klakksjorda, a hamlet on the wild <strong>Vester\u00e5len archipelago</strong>.</p> <p>Located just north of the <strong>Lofoten</strong> islands, Vester\u00e5len is far less visited but excels at winter magic. Up here, 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle, the polar night, from late November to late January, creates a lavender-hued daylight under which to try snowshoeing, a moose safari or kayaking. Plus, there\u2019s a very good chance of seeing the aurora.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Guests go out\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0rigid inflatable boat to feed\u00a0mackerel to the five pairs of\u00a0white\u2011tailed sea eagles that nest in\u00a0the inlet</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Henrik Hvash\u00f8j, the owner of the apartments, and his wildlife guide Ian Robins also take guests (dressed in windproof onesies) out on a rigid inflatable boat to feed mackerel to the five pairs of white\u2011tailed sea eagles that nest along this inlet.

Thirty years ago, this former fishing outpost was a ghost town. A band of 22 residents have slowly revived the car-free village, which is shared with a gaggle of kittiwakes and only has one lamp-post, so expect spectacular aurora displays.</p> <p>In summer, there are day visitors, but coming in winter allows you to spend real time with locals and soak up the kos.

There were few tracks in the snow and the only other sign of life was a wisp of smoke escaping from its chimney. I noted there was a large wood-fired hot tub, its top and steps covered by a fresh coat of snow. My pulse quickened.

You can rise early, then ski or snowshoe before even the cockerels have begun to stir. Later, there is time for little else but a soak in the Nordic tub and stargazing while looking over the valley to the ridges beyond. </p> <p>The idea, said owner Vivian Hudry, was to turn what was once a family cottage into something that would give her a renewed sense of purpose. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of selfishness about what I do,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter I lost my husband, it was very difficult to have this place with nothing in it. It was for us, then it was empty. I lost all sense of my life. Now people who come to stay are bringing that life back.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, it\u2019s a fun place to be. At lunch, a plate of <em>diots aux crozets</em> (buckwheat pasta topped with wine-boiled sausage) arrived and Vivian turned entertainer, handing out lyric sheets like a Sunday School minister and beginning with a rousing rendition of popular 1930s song \u00c9toile des Neiges on her accordion. Soon, the little refuge was full of song from French skiers and holidaymakers. La Vie en Rose followed, then several shots of <em>g\u00e9n\u00e9pi</em>, a herb-based Savoie aperitif. After that and a starlit soak in the tub, dinner is a similar, if far sleepier, affair. Next time, I\u2019ll remember to drink more water, less wine.</p> <p>In this supernova of a valley, with every kind of stylish hotel, self-catering apartment, ski package and swanky nightclub, it felt to me as though this was the Tarentaise on rewind.

      "bodyText": "Old-school glamour in Italy Marketing slogans usually leave me cold, but even I can\u2019t argue with \u201cQueen of the Dolomites\u201d, the sobriquet given to Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo. There\u2019s a regal air about this venerable ski resort in the Veneto region\u2019s north-west, epitomised by its classy Corso Italia, a pedestrianised thoroughfare and favourite passeggiata meeting place. But it\u2019s those massive Dolomites that get me every time \u2013 hulking great chunks of limestone and sedimentary rocks streaked with snow and rising through the Ampezzo valley that turn a delicate shade of pink when the sun goes down. Many people drawn to Cortina\u2019s old\u2011school chic and glamour come here to shop, eat, drink and stroll the pretty streets. That leaves more room on the mountains for people like me to ski, snowshoe and hike amid the beauty of these peaks. Cable cars and gondolas run up to several of Cortina\u2019s highest peaks, including 3,244-metre Tofana di Mezzo (featured in the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only), with its fabulous views from the observation deck. I jumped off at Ra Valles, the penultimate stop on the cable car, for a hot chocolate at what was billed as the highest pizzeria in Europe (2,470 metres) with a vantage point of the towering peaks. For skiers, the Super 8 is a top draw. The figure-of-eight circuit is definitely for intermediates and above, but non-skiers can get a taste of its stupendous scenery by taking a chairlift from Bai de Dones to Cinque Torri \u2013 not just five towers, as the name suggests, but 11 rocky columns in the midst of a snowy expanse \u2013 where there\u2019s a snowshoe trail and Rifugio Scoiattoli has an outdoor hot tub (beds from \u20ac85pp). For more wellness in the mountains Rifugio Lagazuoi at Lagazuoi (reached by gondola, \u20ac150 B&amp;B) has one of the highest outdoor saunas (\u20ac25pp) in Europe. Like Cinque Torri, Lagazuoi and its surrounding peaks were the scenes of first world war battles between the Austro-Hungarian and Italian armies, and the tunnels and trenches have been restored to create evocative open-air museums. Doubles at Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo\u2019s Hotel Columbia from \u20ac175 B&amp;B Mary Novakovich A spa with a view in Austria As the sun creeps over the shoulder of the Hohe Tauern mountains, the Gastein valley shimmers under a fresh blanket of snow. Wisps of cloud lift from dark veins of spruce forest to reveal a day like cut crystal. And I can see the whole lovely lot through the picture windows of my room at Haus Hirt in Bad Gastein, while wrapped in a robe, sipping coffee. Breakfast is until 11am. Let it wait. On an eyrie-like perch above the treetops, Haus Hirt\u2019s riveting views inspired writers Thomas Mann and Stefan Zweig in the 1930s. A cool revamp of an Alpine lodge, this intimate hotel brings together natural materials like larch wood and granite with a clean, modern aesthetic (courtesy of co-owner architect Ike Ikrath and Japanese interior designer Elma Choung). My days are happily spent between yoga, mood-boosting dips in the mountain-facing Aveda spa, and softly lit dinners. Clinging to sheer, wooded cliffs, splashed by a raging waterfall with a vertical drop of 341 metres and peering up at some of Austria\u2019s highest peaks, this spa town shot to fame in the 19th century for the healing powers of its radon-laced waters. Over three millennia, water has filtered through the deep rock layers of Hohe Tauern and now five million litres of it gush up from 17 springs every day. Schubert, Empress Elisabeth, Klimt and German painter Max Liebermann came here for the cure during the town\u2019s belle epoque heyday. I can see why Bad Gastein touched so many as I pad in quiet exhilaration through the Angertal valley on snowshoes, listen to snow fall softly from the trees, and float silently in the bath-warm thermal pools of Felsentherme Gastein as steam rises in the blue dusk and the mountains glow pearl white. Bad Gastein might be sky-high in the Alps, but you don\u2019t have to whack on skis to enjoy its beauty \u2013 just tune into the peace of the winter landscape and let those miracle waters work their magic. Accommodation was provided by Haus Hirt. Small doubles from \u20ac220 a night, full-board, haus-hirt.com Kerry Walker Sledging and snowshoeing in Switzerland The Alpstein massif in the Appenzell Alps is where Switzerland most looks like a child\u2019s drawing. In this region, 40 miles east of Zurich, steeple-like peaks and snow-brimmed barns are everywhere, and ghostly footprints disappear over snowbanks. Every winter, I come here to ski, snowshoe, and eat meat and raclette cooked on a stone-slab steingrill, moving from Appenzell, the region\u2019s main town, up into the mountains. Something about the place lends itself to micro adventures, and the Alpstein, topped out by S\u00e4ntis at 2,501m, is a piece of pure Alpine theatre. I\u2019d recommend staying in a mountain guesthouse like Hoher Hirschberg, a cosy wooden place that looks like it hasn\u2019t changed for centuries. Inside, above the pine-clad restaurant (the veal sausage with fried-onion-topped cheese sp\u00e4tzle is particularly good), are bright, simply furnished rooms. From the windows, you can see the ridged horns of the Alpstein, white in the distance, punching out of the valleys below. In deep snow, the last stretch of road to the guesthouse is closed, meaning a 150-metre uphill snowshoe is all part of check-in. For a longer caper, a four-mile trail leads from near Appenzell through wooded foothills right to the guesthouse; the trick is to take a sledge with you to whizz back down again. Equally worthwhile from the valley floor is the two-mile snowshoe for lunch at Eggli, a historical working farm. If you\u2019re having what I\u2019m having, then it\u2019s a Qu\u00f6llfrisch Hell lager and wurst-k\u00e4se salad, mixed with Appenzeller cheese and sausage. Seven miles south of Hoher Hirschberg is the cable car to Ebenalp, the valley\u2019s main ski area (return ticket \u00a334). To the east, another cable car takes visitors to the summit of Hoher Kasten, which has a terrific revolving restaurant (\u00a336 return). The summit path can be looped in half an hour, but I think it\u2019s better to snowshoe the out-and-back four-mile circuit from the cable car base station to Plattenb\u00f6deli mountain guesthouse, which overlooks blue-grey S\u00e4mtisersee Lake, at 1,209m. The view, I think, is more beautiful than that of the Matterhorn. Like most places in the Alpstein, you\u2019ll be alone in the Plattenb\u00f6deli. At the lakeview restaurant, tuck into frying pan-sized r\u00f6sti and chocolate cake doused in S\u00e4ntis Malt whisky. Happily, that\u2019s tapped from a muscatel barrel and made by Brauerei Locher, from where your adventure first began, down in the valley below, under the twinkling lights of Appenzell. Plattenb\u00f6deli has doubles from \u00a3134 B&amp;B, weekends only in January, February and April. Hoher Hirschberg has doubles from \u00a3134 B&amp;B Mike MacEacheran The magic of winter in the Arctic Circle, Norway I was cocooned in the hot embrace of a wood barrel sauna, the silence punctuated solely by the crackle and hiss of logs. From its glass-fronted end, I looked across the pewter shimmer of a freezing fjord. On the far side, afternoon light gilded the ridges of the snow-covered mountains. Later, I told myself, I would dip into that large ice bath and let the cold pinch my body pink and awake. But for now I would linger a while longer, revelling in that quiet hunkering down that belongs only to winter, and which Norwegians call kos. Similar to the Danish concept of hygge, this ethos embraces the contrast of coldness and cosiness, of snowy romps followed by retreats around the fire. Both are on offer at Vester\u00e5len Apartments, a trio of fjord-side self-catering houses offering \u201ccalm luxury in the wilderness\u201d near Klakksjorda, a hamlet on the wild Vester\u00e5len archipelago. Located just north of the Lofoten islands, Vester\u00e5len is far less visited but excels at winter magic. Up here, 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle, the polar night, from late November to late January, creates a lavender-hued daylight under which to try snowshoeing, a moose safari or kayaking. Plus, there\u2019s a very good chance of seeing the aurora. Henrik Hvash\u00f8j, the owner of the apartments, and his wildlife guide Ian Robins also take guests (dressed in windproof onesies) out on a rigid inflatable boat to feed mackerel to the five pairs of white\u2011tailed sea eagles that nest along this inlet. This parcel of shoreline has been in Henrik\u2019s family for three generations; his mother\u2019s photographs decorate the walls of the apartments. I was exploring on a new trip with Discover the World and combined a stay here with an 80-minute drive north to the hamlet of Nyksund, which nestles at the bottom of Nyken mountain. Thirty years ago, this former fishing outpost was a ghost town. A band of 22 residents have slowly revived the car-free village, which is shared with a gaggle of kittiwakes and only has one lamp-post, so expect spectacular aurora displays. In summer, there are day visitors, but coming in winter allows you to spend real time with locals and soak up the kos. I sipped coffee and snacked on hot waffles in the homely antiques cafe, Delpen, learned about two local female artists in the bijou Nyksund Art Gallery, joined a seal safari and did some spectacular hiking along a portion of the Queen\u2019s Trail, a challenging nine-mile route through the M\u00f8kland mountains. The trip was provided by Discover the World; the 7-night Around Vester\u00e5len trip staying in Nyksund and Vesteralen Apartments costs from \u00a31,451 per person Emma Thomson Skiing and song in the French Alps It was a powder-soft descent to the glade looking down towards the Les Bellevilles valley, and I arrived outside the off-piste stone hut to find no one else around. There were few tracks in the snow and the only other sign of life was a wisp of smoke escaping from its chimney. I noted there was a large wood-fired hot tub, its top and steps covered by a fresh coat of snow. My pulse quickened. Next to it, hammered on to a handmade ornamental archway made from birch was a sign bearing one word. \u201cRefuge\u201d. I was told about Le Trait d\u2019Union refuge above Saint-Martin-de-Belleville a few years ago by a mountain guide who had lived in the Savoie all his life. Incredibly, tucked away in a forest at 1,725 metres, it is in the midst of Les 3 Vall\u00e9es, the world\u2019s largest ski area. Mega resorts Les Menuires and Val Thorens are further up the Tarentaise valley. Meribel is up-and-over the Roc de Fer, the \u201ciron rock\u201d col, with a downhill piste roller coasting down the opposite side. All of this explosive topography means there are winter activities galore, for all ages and abilities. Cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, dog-sledding, tobogganing, ice climbing and ski touring are sacred native rituals here. Inside the refuge there are three cosy bedrooms up a tight staircase above the counter-bar and tiny restaurant, both of which are open to non-guests, too. You can rise early, then ski or snowshoe before even the cockerels have begun to stir. Later, there is time for little else but a soak in the Nordic tub and stargazing while looking over the valley to the ridges beyond. The idea, said owner Vivian Hudry, was to turn what was once a family cottage into something that would give her a renewed sense of purpose. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of selfishness about what I do,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter I lost my husband, it was very difficult to have this place with nothing in it. It was for us, then it was empty. I lost all sense of my life. Now people who come to stay are bringing that life back.\u201d Indeed, it\u2019s a fun place to be. At lunch, a plate of diots aux crozets (buckwheat pasta topped with wine-boiled sausage) arrived and Vivian turned entertainer, handing out lyric sheets like a Sunday School minister and beginning with a rousing rendition of popular 1930s song \u00c9toile des Neiges on her accordion. Soon, the little refuge was full of song from French skiers and holidaymakers. La Vie en Rose followed, then several shots of g\u00e9n\u00e9pi, a herb-based Savoie aperitif.

Around me the Julian Alps soared upwards, their snow-covered peaks reflected below us in the glacial lake. Icelandic horses are incredibly sure-footed, perfect for exploring this mountainous terrain. Based at Lake Bohinj, about 50 miles from the capital Ljubljana, I\u2019d come here for a reset. I\u2019d chosen well: this is where Slovenians holiday, and it\u2019s particularly lovely in winter. We had been riding for a couple of hours across the valley and up into the mountains, and paused to give the horses a rest, although my pony, Lila, showed no signs of fatigue. The Vogel resort is nearby, reached by cable car from the lake, and one of the more affordable places to ski in Europe, but for non-skiers there are magical snowy hikes to be had. The forests surrounding the huge glacial lake are home to bears, wolves and lynx, and local guide Grega \u0160ilc took me out as fresh snow was falling. We walked for hours, following the course of the River Mostnica to the waterfall at the end of the Voje valley, stopping on the way back at a mountain hut for coffee and a slice of blackberry pie. The snow muffled all noise in these ancient woods. Although we didn\u2019t glimpse any spectacular wildlife, it was one of the loveliest hikes I\u2019ve been on. In the distance I could see 2,243-metre Dra\u0161ki Vrh peak. As Grega said: \u201cIt looks like a mountain children would draw.\u201d He also said that for cross-country skiing, Pokljuka plateau, just above Bohinj valley, is the place to go.

But, it has since emerged that this stat came from a study of cows published in 1976. Newer (yet still unpublished) research suggests it could be closer to 10,000. Among the experts, the jury\u2019s still out over whether clitorises or penises win this particular competition. \u201cThe density of nerves in the clitoris and penis isn\u2019t uniform across either organ,\u201d says Prause. Not to mention that \u201cthe area of nerve density can vary between individuals\u201d, too. However, Whelihan reckons it\u2019s a tie. \u201cThe number of nerve endings are the same in both but sensitivity differs depending on whether the penis is exposed [circumcised] or not.\u201d Perhaps Ekechi sums it up best: \u201cThe clitoris is believed to contain more, but it\u2019s notoriously understudied and researched compared with the penis.\u201d",

It was inevitable that one of them \u2013 now the richest man on Earth \u2013 would launch what looks like a bid for world domination.</p> \n<p>A vote for Donald Trump next week is a vote for Elon Musk. Just as Trump is using Musk, Musk could be using Trump as a springboard to perhaps even greater power than the US president can wield. Musk\u2019s secret conversations with Vladimir Putin, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/musk-putin-secret-conversations-37e1c187\">reported by the Wall Street Journal</a> last week, and his contacts with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/18/elon-musk-trump-election-influence\">other extremist world leaders</a>, suggest a pattern of power-seeking that could be even more alarming than the prospect of a second Trump presidency.</p> \n<p>Trump, if he wins, will do to the nation what Musk did to Twitter: the US will be e-Muskulated. What this means is that those with the power to swarm, harass and crush people who do not share their noxious ideology will be unleashed.</p> \n<p>Elon Musk claims to be a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d. But his absolutism seems to extend only to his allies. Since he bought Twitter and renamed it X, the platform has complied with <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2023/elon-musk-twitter-government-orders/\">83% of requests by governments</a> for the censorship or surveillance of accounts.

But now, though drawing on both those ideologies, it reverts to an older and cruder mode: oligarchy. Why, the billionaires might wonder, should they rely on intermediaries to wield political power?

      "bodyText": "This is what happens when successive US governments fail to tackle inequality. While millions of people live in poverty, a handful grow unimaginably rich. Wealth begets wealth, and they acquire political power to match. It was inevitable that one of them \u2013 now the richest man on Earth \u2013 would launch what looks like a bid for world domination. A vote for Donald Trump next week is a vote for Elon Musk. Just as Trump is using Musk, Musk could be using Trump as a springboard to perhaps even greater power than the US president can wield. Musk\u2019s secret conversations with Vladimir Putin, reported by the Wall Street Journal last week, and his contacts with other extremist world leaders, suggest a pattern of power-seeking that could be even more alarming than the prospect of a second Trump presidency. Trump, if he wins, will do to the nation what Musk did to Twitter: the US will be e-Muskulated. What this means is that those with the power to swarm, harass and crush people who do not share their noxious ideology will be unleashed. Elon Musk claims to be a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d. But his absolutism seems to extend only to his allies. Since he bought Twitter and renamed it X, the platform has complied with 83% of requests by governments for the censorship or surveillance of accounts. When the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, demanded the censorship of his opponents before the last general election, the platform obliged. When Indian government officials asked it to remove a hostile BBC documentary, X did as they asked, and later deleted the accounts of many critics of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. Last month, X blocked links to a dossier about Trump\u2019s running mate, JD Vance, and suspended the account of the journalist who revealed it. Musk has sued organisations that criticise him. Because the most vicious and antisocial people \u2013 racists, antisemites, misogynists, homophobes, even outright Nazis \u2013 have been reinstated and often boosted, millions of other users have been driven from the platform, their own free speech diminished. Musk\u2019s own posts are reportedly amplified a thousandfold by a boutique algorithm. Free speech absolutism? My left foot. Now he has bent his immense wealth, power and blatant double standards to a frantic effort to get Trump elected. Some of his tactics \u2013 cash rewards and cash prizes \u2013 look to me like attempts to buy votes and interfere in an election. His lawyers were able to prevent him having to attend court this week for a hearing challenging these tactics: another privilege of wealth. He has used his X account to spread rampant misinformation on Trump\u2019s behalf, giving him many millions of dollars\u2019 worth of advertising. He has poured $118m into his pro-Trump super Pac (political action committee). What would the world\u2019s richest man gain from the e-Muskulation of US \u2013 and perhaps global \u2013 politics? He would gain what capital has sought since workers acquired the vote: the truncation of democracy. Democracy is the problem capital keeps trying to solve. Why?

A film that plays with perception, and rewards the listener as much as the viewer. Simon Wardell Live sport Premier League Football: Newcastle v Arsenal, 11am, TNT Sports 1 From St James\u2019 Park.

      "body": "<p>The Rhine overflowed last winter, covering fields miles from the river and in some places leaving just the tops of trees visible. </p> <p>But Thomas Bollig, who farms just a few miles from the banks of the Rhine, was not worried. Even as floods inundated the fields of his neighbours, making sowing impossible, his holdings were largely unaffected. Bollig farms organically, and the natural methods he uses to improve his soil allow his fields to hold more water when it rains, and release it gradually, coping well with floods and droughts.</p>    <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a sponge,\u201d he says, pointing across largely flat fields by Wachtberg village, near the city of Bonn. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the problems that many farmers did.\u201d</p> <p>That is not the only advantage he sees in having switched his arable and livestock farm from conventional intensive farming to fully organic farming. Around him, in the summer sunlight, bees are buzzing and the air is full of insects, alighting on the flowers that speckle his crops of beans and grain, the song of birds a cheerful background.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a farm full of life today,\u201d he says. \u201cWildflowers, insects, pollinators \u2013 it\u2019s a perfect symbiosis, as they feed on the pests on the crops. And the soil is full of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/08/uk-earthworm-population-in-decline\">worms</a>.\u201d Out of 75 hectares (185 acres) on his farm, about eight hectares are wildflower meadows. In the middle of some of his cropping fields, tangled areas are left untouched for flowers and animals, a riot of colour \u2013 red, blue and gold \u2013 amid the green.</p>    <p>A recent pest infestation in his beanfield illustrates the point. \u201cIt was so bad, that we considered spraying,\u201d Bollig says.

The CAP represents a third of the EU budget, coming to about \u20ac55bn (\u00a346bn) a year and in return for that largesse, farmers are supposed to meet a minimum level of environmental protection. Taking additional measures such as growing more trees or conserving wetlands can net them extra support.</p>    <p>But so far at least, the environmental aspects of the CAP changes have not worked. The European court of auditors in 2020 found <a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/webpub/eca/special-reports/biodiversity-13-2020/en/\">little evidence of a positive impact on biodiversity from the CAP</a>.

De Pous says farmers capitalised onthe European Commission\u2019s fear of a backlash against green policies and green parties in the parliamentary elections this June. \u201cThis is political opportunism, it\u2019s tactical on the part of the farmers who are protesting.\u201d He believes the farmers were simply going after a larger slice of the European budget.</p> <p>Whatever the causes, the results for nature are likely to be dire. And ironically, given the fervour of the protests, any hoped-for boon to small farmers is unlikely to materialise \u2013 it will be big farmers who benefit from less stringent regulation, as they do from the CAP overall. As payments to farmers under the CAP are based on the amount of land they farm, the CAP favours size above everything else. That means the squeeze on traditional small-scale family farms will continue, with the biggest farmers continuing to scoop up the lion\u2019s share of the cash, and the poorest forced further to the margins.</p> <p>How did we get into this mess? And is there a way out?</p> <h2>A focus on food security above all</h2> <p>In the early years of what became the EU, the focus of European agricultural policy was on food security above all. When the CAP was conceived, in the early 1960s, farmers were encouraged to increase yields by adopting more efficient machinery and the new fertilisers and pesticides. They were given quotas to supply certain amounts of food, and guaranteed prices for their produce. These were seen as ways to provide stability to farmers, and food security to consumers.</p> <p>In the late 1980s, when it became clear the quotas were distorting the market and leading to surpluses of some products \u2013 the EU\u2019s famous \u201cbutter mountain\u201d and \u201cwine lake\u201d \u2013 overhaul of the CAP led to more direct payments to farmers. Then, from 2003 to 2012, farm payments were \u201cdecoupled\u201d entirely from production and based instead on the amount of land farmed, with extra payments available for farmers who could exhibit good stewardship of the environment. While that has simplified the payment system and removed many of the distortions, it also means the biggest farmers reap the biggest rewards.</p> <p>\u201cCAP is just welfare for the rich,\u201d is how Ariel Brunner, the director of BirdLife Europe, termed it, on the social media platform X. \u201cWith symbolic consolation for smaller farmers to muddy the water. It doesn\u2019t serve any social purpose. And it favours the destruction of the resources farming depends on.\u201d</p> <p>But it is also still a lifeline for poor farmers. The problem is that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/02/uk-farmers-making-tiny-profits-as-supermarkets-boast-record-takings\">supermarkets that buy the farmers\u2019 produce</a>, and the suppliers of farm inputs such as fertiliser and pesticides, also count on the subsidy payments. \u201cYou have the retailers and middlemen sucking out all of the margin, and farmers being left with very little,\u201d says Will White, the sustainable farming coordinator at the UK-based Sustain coalition of farming and food organisations. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that locks us into a cycle of highly intensive farming. The status quo is not a good option for anyone.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/02/uk-farmers-making-tiny-profits-as-supermarkets-boast-record-takings\">farmers make less than a penny in profit</a> from selling a loaf of bread or an average-sized block of cheese. (Although the UK is no longer under the CAP, the government still provides equivalent subsidies under a separate support scheme, so the mechanism is broadly similar.) On each kilo of apples, the farmer makes just 3p. Martin Lines, the chief executive of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, says \u201cnone of the payment really <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/06/farmers-should-stand-their-ground-with-supermarkets-on-fair-prices-minister-says\">reaches the farmer</a>. The payments go to the value chain. Their profits have mushroomed.\u201d </p> <p>So a system that was meant to help farmers, keep Europeans fed and the land well cared for, has turned into one that trashes the environment; enriches big landowners and leaves poor farmers struggling; delights retailers but costs money for consumers; and causes headaches for politicians of all stripes because they know they can be held to ransom by cavalcades of tractors and burning haybales.</p> <p>In Britain, the post-Brexit farming system is tied up in similar muddles. The Conservative government vowed in 2017 to move away from area-based payments to \u201cpublic money for public goods\u201d, but that has proved easier in principle than practice, as environmental land management schemes have come under fire, with accusations of landowners forcing struggling tenants off their land so they can rewild it or grow trees for carbon offsets, and a renewed feeling that small farmers are still at the bottom of the heap.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the climate crisis is gathering pace, and the effects are being felt on food and farming, sometimes quite brutally. Agriculture and land use change contribute at least a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions, so the effects of farming on the climate need to be tackled at the same time as the effects of the climate on farming, but so far there is little sign of that happening.</p> <p>To bring farmers round to the benefits of farming in a more environmentally sustainable manner, they need to be shown that green regulations ultimately benefit them, says Sustain\u2019s White. \u201cFarmers care about the bottom line \u2013 if they can make money from environmental schemes, I think most farmers will listen. Farmers should be working together with governments more \u2013 it\u2019s not in their interests to be at the political extremes.\u201d</p> <p>There are encouraging signs of possible reform. In September, farmers, retailers, consumer groups and environmentalists held strategic dialogues, at the suggestion of the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and put together a proposal that calls for \u201curgent, ambitious and feasible\u201d change in farm and food systems, with financial support to help farmers get there. It also acknowledges that Europeans eat more animal protein than doctors and scientists recommend, and calls for a shift toward plant-based diets supported by better education, stricter marketing and voluntary buyouts of farms in regions that intensively rear livestock.</p>    <p>There is plenty of scope for redirecting payments to farmers so that they reward greener and less intensive farming, argues Richard Benwell, the chief executive of the Wildlife and Countryside Link charity. \u201cThe environmental work that farmers do has been chronically undervalued for a very long time,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to recognise those public goods that traditional small farmers have long been expected to do for free. And on the other side, where harm occurs they should have to pay.\u201d</p> <p>Bollig believes the CAP could be better targeted, to benefit farmers who follow organic or less demanding \u201cnature-friendly\u201d practices. There are some schemes within the CAP to encourage sustainable farming, but they do not go far enough to help reduce inputs instead of seeking higher yields, he says.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t give farmers a motivation to change,\u201d says Bollig. \u201cBad farms with better yields make more money, and good farms [with sustainable practices] are left to struggle.\u201d</p> <p>Building a sustainable global food system, in Europe and across the world, in which greenhouse gas emissions are low, in which biodiversity flourishes, in which the impacts of extreme weather are minimised using natural means, is difficult but possible, according to Ed Davey, of the World Resources Institute. \u201cFarming can work in harmony with nature,\u201d he says. \u201cSustainable farming techniques are there.\u201d</p> <p>Crucial to any successful reform will be separating out the interests of big farms and small ones, says De Pous. While big farmers benefit from intensification, with more fertiliser, more pesticide, more concentrated animal feed lots, small farmers could benefit from the opposite, with more emphasis on quality and organic production. \u201cSmall farmers should not give up, but they need to question who is representing them, and what they are asking for. The interests of small farmers are not necessarily the interests of big farmers. There are huge differences,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Consumers will also have to adjust. In the EU, about 80% of farm subsidy goes towards animal products, which means it has an outsize impact on greenhouse gas emissions. In some European countries, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/19/fears-environment-spain-pigs-outnumber-humans-pork-industry\">livestock now outnumber people</a>. Changing this will be painful \u2013 the farmers of the Netherlands objected to proposals to start to limit the national herd, to cut down on pollution, and at recent polls it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/16/nitrogen-wars-the-dutch-farmers-revolt-that-turned-a-nation-upside-down\">one of the issues that pushed the far right to electoral success</a> in the country. Yet if consumers in developed countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/27/flexitarian-diets-global-warming-climate-change#:~:text=Reducing%20meat%20consumption%20can%20free,other%20animals%20raised%20for%20livestock.\">change their diet to eat more healthily</a> \u2013 which means less ultra-processed food and less meat \u2013 there will be less demand for intensively farmed meat products, and the burden on the land will reduce markedly.</p> <p>Hopes of reaching the point where farm subsidy systems around the world are dismantled or redirected towards providing the kind of planet we need to feed 8 billion people \u2013 or in future 10 billion, or even 12 billion \u2013 without destroying what remains of the wildlife, and permanently disabling the climate, may seem utopian. But there is no law of nature that says farming must kill off the natural environment it depends on; many small-scale farmers around the world, and for previous centuries, have worked in harmony with nature and other species. Farm subsidy regimes are economic systems that were drawn up by bureaucrats within the last half-century, and they can be redrawn, despite short-term pressure to the contrary. What that takes is political courage.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Rhine overflowed last winter, covering fields miles from the river and in some places leaving just the tops of trees visible. But Thomas Bollig, who farms just a few miles from the banks of the Rhine, was not worried. Even as floods inundated the fields of his neighbours, making sowing impossible, his holdings were largely unaffected. Bollig farms organically, and the natural methods he uses to improve his soil allow his fields to hold more water when it rains, and release it gradually, coping well with floods and droughts. \u201cIt\u2019s like a sponge,\u201d he says, pointing across largely flat fields by Wachtberg village, near the city of Bonn. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the problems that many farmers did.\u201d That is not the only advantage he sees in having switched his arable and livestock farm from conventional intensive farming to fully organic farming. Around him, in the summer sunlight, bees are buzzing and the air is full of insects, alighting on the flowers that speckle his crops of beans and grain, the song of birds a cheerful background. \u201cWe have a farm full of life today,\u201d he says. \u201cWildflowers, insects, pollinators \u2013 it\u2019s a perfect symbiosis, as they feed on the pests on the crops. And the soil is full of worms.\u201d Out of 75 hectares (185 acres) on his farm, about eight hectares are wildflower meadows. In the middle of some of his cropping fields, tangled areas are left untouched for flowers and animals, a riot of colour \u2013 red, blue and gold \u2013 amid the green. A recent pest infestation in his beanfield illustrates the point. \u201cIt was so bad, that we considered spraying,\u201d Bollig says. But he kept faith in the organic process, and two weeks later the pests were gone and the fields \u201cfull of ladybirds\u201d. But the wildlife that abounds on Bollig\u2019s farm is no longer typical for western European farms. About a quarter of Europe\u2019s bird population has been wiped out in the last four decades \u2013 that is half a billion fewer birds in the sky today compared with 1980. Four in 10 European tree species are classed as threatened, butterfly numbers are down by about a third, one in 10 bee species are dying out, and two-thirds of the habitats of ecological importance are in an unfavourable condition. A fifth of European species face extinction. Everywhere you look, the richness and abundance of European nature is under threat. Since the 1970s and 80s, even while many environmental indicators in Europe have improved \u2013 cleaner air in cities, less industrial pollution, less sewage in waterways (outside the UK) \u2013 the story of nature is one of steep and stark decline. Wildlife, trees, plants, fish and insects \u2013 the picture is bleak. It is not possible to lay all of this destruction at the door of intensive farming, as urbanisation, invasive species and pollution from industry have their own impacts, but the figures clearly suggest farming has played a big role. Amid the overall decline in bird numbers, the ones making their home in farmland had it by far the worst, with numbers down by 57%, and separate research suggests steeper declines of insects in farmed areas. Brian MacSharry, the head of the nature and biodiversity group at the European Environment Agency, says: \u201cThe habitat situation is pretty bad, the species little better, and there is a time lag between [the destruction of habitats and decline in] species. Overall, we know it is bad and that the trend is deteriorating. Agriculture is by far the biggest pressure.\u201d It was not supposed to be this way. Since the early 2000s, changes to Europe\u2019s farming practices and subsidy regime \u2013 the common agricultural policy (CAP) \u2013 have been geared explicitly towards protecting the environment, as well as supporting farmers and food production. The CAP represents a third of the EU budget, coming to about \u20ac55bn (\u00a346bn) a year and in return for that largesse, farmers are supposed to meet a minimum level of environmental protection. Taking additional measures such as growing more trees or conserving wetlands can net them extra support. But so far at least, the environmental aspects of the CAP changes have not worked. The European court of auditors in 2020 found little evidence of a positive impact on biodiversity from the CAP. The European Environment Agency, in its State of Nature report in 2023, found that the EU\u2019s farmed environment had continued to decline, with the health of only 14% of habitats and about a quarter of non-bird species classed as \u201cgood\u201d. The CAP is also making the climate worse: about 80% of the budget goes to support carbon-intensive animal food products, according to a paper published this month in Nature. \u201cThe CAP has become a monster,\u201d says Faustine Bas-Defossez, the director of nature, health and environment at the European Environmental Bureau, a network of citizens\u2019 organisations. \u201cIt is not helping farmers in the mainstream to adopt more sustainable practices. It\u2019s driving the intensification of farming, and increasing the pressure on natural resources.

Whatever the causes, the results for nature are likely to be dire.

It also acknowledges that Europeans eat more animal protein than doctors and scientists recommend, and calls for a shift toward plant-based diets supported by better education, stricter marketing and voluntary buyouts of farms in regions that intensively rear livestock. There is plenty of scope for redirecting payments to farmers so that they reward greener and less intensive farming, argues Richard Benwell, the chief executive of the Wildlife and Countryside Link charity. \u201cThe environmental work that farmers do has been chronically undervalued for a very long time,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to recognise those public goods that traditional small farmers have long been expected to do for free. And on the other side, where harm occurs they should have to pay.\u201d Bollig believes the CAP could be better targeted, to benefit farmers who follow organic or less demanding \u201cnature-friendly\u201d practices. There are some schemes within the CAP to encourage sustainable farming, but they do not go far enough to help reduce inputs instead of seeking higher yields, he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t give farmers a motivation to change,\u201d says Bollig. \u201cBad farms with better yields make more money, and good farms [with sustainable practices] are left to struggle.\u201d Building a sustainable global food system, in Europe and across the world, in which greenhouse gas emissions are low, in which biodiversity flourishes, in which the impacts of extreme weather are minimised using natural means, is difficult but possible, according to Ed Davey, of the World Resources Institute. \u201cFarming can work in harmony with nature,\u201d he says. \u201cSustainable farming techniques are there.\u201d Crucial to any successful reform will be separating out the interests of big farms and small ones, says De Pous. While big farmers benefit from intensification, with more fertiliser, more pesticide, more concentrated animal feed lots, small farmers could benefit from the opposite, with more emphasis on quality and organic production. \u201cSmall farmers should not give up, but they need to question who is representing them, and what they are asking for. The interests of small farmers are not necessarily the interests of big farmers. There are huge differences,\u201d he said. Consumers will also have to adjust. In the EU, about 80% of farm subsidy goes towards animal products, which means it has an outsize impact on greenhouse gas emissions. In some European countries, livestock now outnumber people. Changing this will be painful \u2013 the farmers of the Netherlands objected to proposals to start to limit the national herd, to cut down on pollution, and at recent polls it was one of the issues that pushed the far right to electoral success in the country. Yet if consumers in developed countries change their diet to eat more healthily \u2013 which means less ultra-processed food and less meat \u2013 there will be less demand for intensively farmed meat products, and the burden on the land will reduce markedly. Hopes of reaching the point where farm subsidy systems around the world are dismantled or redirected towards providing the kind of planet we need to feed 8 billion people \u2013 or in future 10 billion, or even 12 billion \u2013 without destroying what remains of the wildlife, and permanently disabling the climate, may seem utopian. But there is no law of nature that says farming must kill off the natural environment it depends on; many small-scale farmers around the world, and for previous centuries, have worked in harmony with nature and other species. Farm subsidy regimes are economic systems that were drawn up by bureaucrats within the last half-century, and they can be redrawn, despite short-term pressure to the contrary. What that takes is political courage.",

      "bodyText": "Kamala Harris and Donald Trump held duelling rallies within miles of each other in swing state Wisconsin\u2019s largest city, Milwaukee, on Friday night. Milwaukee is home to the most Democratic votes in Wisconsin, but its conservative Republican suburbs are a critical area for Trump as he tries to reclaim the state he narrowly won in 2016 but lost in 2020. Earlier, Trump continued to attack Liz Cheney at a rally in Warren, Michigan, where he also lamented the state of his hair. \u201cIt looks not so good today \u2026 not a good hair day for me, ay ay ay.\u201d After his campaign rhetoric earlier tipped over from hateful to violent \u2013 when he suggested Cheney should be shot at with \u201cnine barrels\u201d and the guns \u201ctrained on her face\u201d \u2013 the attorney general\u2019s office in Arizona, where Trump made the remark, opened a \u201cdeath threat investigation\u201d. In Pennsylvania, a neck-and-neck race is hurtling toward the finish line of the 2024 election with no clear frontrunner. The victor of Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, the most of any battleground state, will probably win the electoral college and determine the trajectory of the country for the next four years. Here\u2019s what else happened on Friday: Kamala Harris election news and updates Harris told her crowd at the Wisconsin State Fair Park Exposition Center that with four days to go, there was still work to do, but \u201cwe like hard work\u201d. Minutes beforehand, during a raucous warmup, the rapper Cardi B referred to Trump as \u201cDonnie Dunk\u201d and told the crowd: \u201cTrump says he\u2019s going to protect women whether they like it or not. Well, if his definition of protection is not the freedom of choice, if his definition of protection is making sure our daughters have fewer rights than our mothers, then I don\u2019t want it! I don\u2019t want it! I don\u2019t want it!\u201d Earlier, Harris said Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric about Cheney \u201cmust be disqualifying\u201d as far as his suitability for the presidency is concerned. \u201cRepresentative Cheney is a true patriot who has shown extraordinary courage in putting country above party.\u201d Cheney for her part warned the public against dictatorship and a presidential candidate who \u201cwants to be a tyrant\u201d. Republicans\u2019 latest offensive and misogynistic comments have boosted Democratic hopes of turning out women on election day in a contest where the rights of women have been a central issue for the Harris campaign. Donald Trump election news and updates At his Milwaukee rally on Friday, Trump called Harris a \u201clow-IQ person\u201d and vowed to save the economy \u201cfrom total obliteration\u201d in a 1.5-hour-long meandering speech that touched on the economy and foreign policy but also featured threats to curb press freedoms and a lengthy discussion of his own rhetorical style. \u201cI will stop the criminal invasion of this country,\u201d said Trump, promising to usher in a new \u201cgolden age\u201d. \u201cCan you imagine if Kamala won? You would go down to a 1929-style depression.\u201d Trump\u2019s supporters are laying the ground for rejecting the result of the election if he loses, according to warnings from Democrats as well as anti-Maga Republicans. As well as baseless and/or failed lawsuits, suspicions have been voiced over partisan polls run by groups with Republican links in battleground states that mainly show Trump leading \u2013 the idea being that if Trump loses, the polls can be proferred as \u201cevidence\u201d that he was cheated out of the win. The New York author and journalist Michael Wolff has released audio tapes that appear to detail how Trump had a close social relationship with the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein that he has long denied. Wolff says the recordings were made during a 2017 discussion with Epstein about writing his biography. Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges two years later. Trump\u2019s campaign said the claims, made on Wolff\u2019s podcast Fire and Fury, amounted to \u201coutlandish false smears\u201d. Elsewhere on the campaign trail A federal judge rejected an attempt by Elon Musk\u2019s America Pac to have charges of running an illegal lottery heard in federal court, instead of the courts of Pennsylvania, where Musk is running the sweepstakes to help Trump get re-elected. The case has been sent back to the Pennsylvania state court for a further hearing on Monday. Racism and misogyny; a firing squad death threat to a former congresswoman; the Republican candidate for president dressing up as a sanitation worker in the cab of a garbage truck. Donald Trump\u2019s final full week on the campaign trail was as unedifying as it was bizarre \u2013 Richard Luscombe sums it up. A valuable Republican voting bloc in Arizona is seeing a shift of its members towards Harris in numbers that Democrats believe could make the difference for them in an election where the latest polls have Trump slightly ahead. That bloc is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u2013 the Mormons.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigned in midwest swing states today, ending with dueling rallies in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, seen as a crucial state to win. Here are some of today\u2019s key updates from myself and my colleagues: Cardi B spoke at Harris\u2019 Milwaukee rally, saying that she had not been planning to vote in this presidential election, but that Harris convinced her to do so. She called Harris an \u201cunderdog\u201d whose accomplishments as a woman have been repeatedly demeaned and underestimated. Despite facing criticism over saying yesterday that his prominent Republican critic Liz Cheney should have rifles shooting at her, Trump revisited his remarks about Cheney and her father Dick Cheney, calling her a war hawk and a coward. Harris had called Trump\u2019s rhetoric about Cheney \u201cdisqualifying\u201d. The supreme court rejected an emergency appeal from Republicans that could have led to thousands of provisional ballots not being counted in Pennsylvania, and left in place a state supreme court ruling that election officials must count provisional ballots cast by voters whose mail-in ballots were rejected. Trump visited Dearborn, Michigan, to tout his support among Arab Americans and Muslim Americans who are angry with the Biden Harris administration over their support for Israel and the human death toll in Gaza and Lebanon. While key Arab American leaders chose not to meet with Trump, some called his in-person visit important, and criticized Harris and the Democratic party. Dearborn\u2019s Democratic mayor, Abdullah Hammoud, posted on X, \u201cThe architect of the Muslim Ban is making a campaign stop in Dearborn\u2026To the Dems - your unwillingness to stop funding &amp; enabling a genocide created the space for Trump to infiltrate our communities. Remember that.\u201d The prominent vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr campaigned for Trump in Michigan and Wisconsin, earning big cheers from Trump supporters as the former third-party candidate reportedly is aiming for a major healthcare role in Trump\u2019s White House. A federal judge on Friday denied an attempt by America Pac \u2013 the political action committee founded by Elon Musk to support Donald Trump\u2019s campaign for a second presidency \u2013 to move to federal court a civil suit brought by the Philadelphia district attorney over a daily $1m prize draw for registered voters. A hearing was scheduled in Pennsylvania state court on Monday, the day before the election. Arizona\u2019s attorney general has launched an investigation into whether Donald Trump violated state law through his violent rhetoric against Liz Cheney. In a statement to 12News on Friday, attorney general Kris Mayes said: \u201cI have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under Arizona\u2019s laws.\u201d The justice department announced on Friday it is deploying election monitors in 86 jurisdictions in 27 states for the general election on 5 November. \u201cThe Justice Department enforces federal voting rights laws that protect the rights of all eligible citizens to access the ballot,\u201d an official statement said. \u201cThe department regularly deploys its staff to monitor for compliance with federal civil rights laws in elections in communities all across the country.\u201d Trump has wrapped up his Milwaukee rally, not long before 11 pm local time. Despite the late hour, the crowd in Milwaukee rose to its feet to give him a standing ovation as Donald Trump listed off the actions he would take against migrants who commit crimes, the Associated Press reports. Trump has centered his campaign on hardline tactics to stop illegal immigration, including the death penalty for migrants who are in the country illegally and kill an American citizen. We are counting down to just three days and a few hours before the 2024 election, and Donald Trump is still riffing to a crowd of supporters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as Kamala Harris has already arrived at her hotel for the night, according to the White House pool reporter. Harris\u2019 Milwaukee speech tonight was short, peppy, and relentlessly on message. Trump, as is his style, is rambling, hitting his attack lines on the economy and immigration, but also making extraneous attacks, such as criticizing the hair of ABC anchor David Muir, saying 60 Minutes should be shut down, and complaining that he is not allowed to call the Democratic governor of Illinois fat. (Again, he is in Wisconsin.) \u201cIs there a chance she would resign before the election? Three days?\u201d Trump asks of his Democratic competitor, Kamala Harris. It\u2019s not clear why Trump is airing this idea, other than as part of his claim that Harris looks \u201crattled\u201d. \u201cI actually think they should have left Joe, he would have done just as well, maybe better,\u201d Trump says. Now Trump, speaking in Wisconsin, is attacking the Democratic governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker. \u201cI am not allowed to use the fat word. That\u2019s the other word you cannot use,\u201d Trump says, to some laughter from the crowd. \u201cYou are not allowed to use the fat word so I will not do it, but that guy is disgusting.\u201d \u201cI took a lot of heat about two months ago because I said, \u2018I think women like me, I do, I think the suburban housewives like me,\u201d Trump said. There are high-pitched cheers from the audience. \u201cI think they like me because they know I\u2019m going to protect them,\u201d Trump says. Talking about his plans for mass deportation of migrants, and expediting deportation of gang members, Trump says that he will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, and said that it\u2019s \u201cincredible\u201d that \u201cwe had to go back so far\u201d to find the law he needed. \u201cThat\u2019s when we ran a tough country,\u201d he says, of the year 1798. It is past 10pm in Milwaukee and Donald Trump is still talking. He is riffing freely, criticizing journalist David Muir\u2019s hair, and revisiting what he saw as the unfairness of his debate against Kamala Harris, which Muir moderated. Then he spoke about his lawsuit against CBS News and 60 Minutes, saying it \u201cshould be forced to close\u201d. Trump sounds a bit tired, and he is delivering his attack lines in a gentler tone that he did earlier in the day in Michigan. \u201cYou were a very difficult state,\u201d Trump says of Wisconsin, talking about how hard the state was for him to win in 2016, and then falsely claiming that he actually won the state again in 2020. (He did not.) The AP has a fact check of Trump\u2019s comments just now on the economy, and what his comments leave out: two major hurricanes as well as big strikes. Donald Trump is saying that the US jobs report today, which showed that employers added 12,000 jobs in October, showed that the Biden-Harris administration is failing on the economy. Last month\u2019s hiring gain was down significantly from the 223,000 jobs that were added in September. \u201cThis is like a depression,\u201d Trump said of the numbers as he heaped insults on Harris. Economists estimate that Hurricanes Helene and Milton, combined with strikes at Boeing and elsewhere, pushed down net job growth by tens of thousands of jobs in October. Kamala Harris appears to be wrapping up her speech, urging her supporters to remind everyone they know to vote, and to reach out to people through text and conversation. \u201cLet\u2019s please be intentional about building community,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere\u2019s something intentional about this whole Trump era. It\u2019s been powered by this idea that Americans should be pointing fingers at each other, and to make people feel alone and to make people feel small, when we all know we have so much more in common than what separates us.\u201d \u201cI love Gen Z. I really do,\u201d Kamala Harris laughs, talking about \u201call the younger leaders I see who are voting for the very first time.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s what I love about you guys. You are rightly impatient for change. I love that about you. You are determined to live free from gun violence. You are going to take on the climate crisis. You are going to shape the world you inherit. I know that. I know that.\u201d \u201cAnd here\u2019s the thing about our young leaders. None of this is theoretical for them. None of this is political for them. It\u2019s their lived experience. It\u2019s your lived experience, and I see your power, I see your power, and I am so proud of you.\u201d \u201cI see her today \u2026 she\u2019s exhausted. She looks like \u2026 she\u2019s exhausted,\u201d Trump says of Kamala Harris, at his Milwaukee rally. Harris is simultaneously speaking very energetically to her cheering crowd a few miles away. Both Trump and Harris are performing with a surprising deal of energy tonight after a long day of travel and multiple swing state events. The crowd at Trump\u2019s rally has been frustrated with the sound levels in the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, even chanting earlier, \u201cFix the mic!\u201d the Associated Press reports. Trump eventually got the message and ripped the microphone from the podium to hold it closer to his mouth. \u201cI think this mic stinks,\u201d Trump said. Trump has been jumping from topic to topic, mentioning that this is his third campaign rally today, then referencing his rally at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden nearly a week ago, and then hurling insults at his Democratic rival. In two different venues across Milwaukee and its suburbs, both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris\u2019 Wisconsin crowds have been waiting hours to hear the candidates speak, and both crowds sound fired up and enthusiastic. \u201cWhen I win \u2026 you are four days away from the best jobs, the biggest paychecks, and the brightest economic future the world has ever seen,\u201d Trump tells his Milwaukee crowd, to big cheers. He said that if Harris wins, the country will sink into a \u201c1929-style depression.\u201d \u201cI love Wisconsin,\u201d Kamala Harris says, praising the state\u2019s motto, \u201cForward.\u201d Kamala Harris is now speaking at her Milwaukee rally, while Donald Trump is also addressing his supporters there. \u201cI\u2019m not giving Donald Trump a second chance,\u201d Cardi B says. \u201cI am not taking any chances with my future, and I damn sure ain\u2019t taking no chances with the future of my children. \u201cI\u2019m with Kamala.\u201d \u201cWe all knew Trump was a hustler \u2026 but hustling women out of their rights to their body is nasty work. Hustling Americans out of their hard-earned money by selling Trump watches, Trump sneakers, Trump Bibles \u2026 is nasty too,\u201d Cardi B says. \u201cDo we really trust this man with our economy?\u201d Cardi B asks. \u201cToday it\u2019s your wallet, tomorrow it will be your healthcare rights.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of healthcare, let\u2019s talk about it \u2026 Did you hear what Donnie Trump said the other day?\u201d Cardi B asks. \u201cHe said he\u2019s going to protect women whether they like it or not.\u201d \u201cDonnie don\u2019t, please. Protection for women, especially if we\u2019re talking about maternal and mental healthcare, isn\u2019t telling them what to do with their bodies. It\u2019s supporting and giving them the care they need for what they choose to do with their bodies.\u201d \u201cPeople like Donald Trump don\u2019t believe women deserve rights. And when those rights are taken away, they are nowhere to be found.\u201d \u201cWhen a mother\u2019s doing through postpartum, he\u2019s not there to hold her hand. When a child is in foster care or in a shelter because their mother is not mentally stable or financially stable to take care of them, they\u2019re not there \u2026 they\u2019re all gone.\u201d \u201cTrump says he\u2019s going to protect women whether they like it or not. Well, if his definition of protection is not the freedom of choice, if his definition of protection is making sure our daughters have fewer rights than our mothers, then I don\u2019t want it! I don\u2019t want it! I don\u2019t want it.\u201d More from Cardi B\u2019s speech about Kamala Harris: \u201cI believe in every word that comes out of her mouth. She\u2019s passionate. She\u2019s compassionate. She shows empathy, and most of all she is not delusional.\u201d \u201cJust like Kamala Harris, I, too, have been the underdog, I\u2019ve been underestimated. My success belittled and discredited,\u201d Cardi B says. \u201cLet me tell you something: women have to work ten times harder, perform ten times better, and still people question us, how we got to the top. They\u2019ll be like: how she got there?\u201d \u201cLet me tell you something: I can\u2019t stand a bully. But just like Kamala, I always stand up to one. All the time, I\u2019m ready for them.\u201d \u201cIma be real with you all. I wasn\u2019t going to vote this year. I wasn\u2019t. But Kamala Harris joining the race, she changed my mind. Completely. I did not have faith on any candidate until she joined the race and said the things that I wanted to hear.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this moment my whole life,\u201d Cardi B tells Harris supporters in Milwaukee. \u201cAre we ready to make history?\u201d she asks. The crowd cheers. Reading off a cellphone, Cardi B says, \u201cI do not take lightly the call to show up. The call to speak up. The call to deliver a message that\u2019s been on my heart for a hot minute now.\u201d As Robert F Kennedy Jr is speaking at Trump\u2019s Milwaukee rally, Cardi B has taken the stage at Harris\u2019 rally. Robert F Kennedy Jr has once again taken the stage for Donald Trump, this time at a Trump rally today in Milwaukee. RFK Jr, who called an end to his third-party presidential bid to endorse Trump, is a popular figure at Trump rallies: the crowd is chanting \u201cBobby! Bobby! Bobby!\u201d in response to his comments. Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic who is now aiming for a major healthcare role in Trump\u2019s administration, just said that Trump \u201cnever said anything nasty about me. He was always very civil.\u201d This is simply untrue: Kennedy also fired back at Trump when they sparred quite uncivilly this spring: As we wait for Trump and Harris to take the stage at their respective Milwaukee rallies, here\u2019s some insight from Washington Post reporter Matt Viser, reporting earlier today on why the Harris campaign is feeling more optimistic in recent days: Viser\u2019s reporting inspired some quips about Tony Hinchcliffe, the pro-Trump comedian who called Puerto Rico \u201ca floating island of garbage\u201d at the Madison Square Garden rally. My colleague Alice Herman is reporting from the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, where Trump is scheduled to speak tonight: I just spoke with Jason Tyler, a dedicated Republican activist who has canvassed for Trump with Turning Point Action, the GOP of Rock county and other conservative organizations. He told me he\u2019s apprehensive about the 2024 election and worries about non-citizens voting illegally in the presidential election \u2013 a key talking point among Trump\u2019s allies, who have highlighted rare instances of voter fraud by non-US citizens, stoking anxieties on the right about election fraud. Tyler will be volunteering as a poll observer in Rock county on election day, where he told me he will be looking for non-US citizens. \u201cMy biggest thing I would be looking for is if somebody can\u2019t speak English and start there,\u201d said Tyler, who acknowledged that the bar for challenging a ballot is high enough in Wisconsin that he would not likely succeed in preventing a voter from casting a ballot. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult \u2013 the only thing that I can really do is I can ask for their information, you know, find out who they are, and I can report that, if I felt that there was something weird about it,\u201d said Tyler. \u201cI can\u2019t really tell that person not to vote.\u201d After we spoke, Tyler tracked me down to add that he\u2019s frustrated with the idea that Trump\u2019s inflammatory comments about immigrants are racist. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Tyler, adding that his wife emigrated to the US from the Philippines. \u201cShe loves Donald Trump.\u201d Kamala Harris\u2019s motorcade arrived about half an hour ago at the Wisconsin State Fair Park Exposition Center, per the White House pool report. Crowds in two locations in Milwaukee are still waiting for Trump and Harris to speak, in dueling rallies in the key midwest swing state. The Democrats have a more dynamic rally line-up tonight, with multiple celebrity performers. Grammy-nominated GloRilla is on stage right now at the Harris rally. At the Trump rally, supporters are listening to the campaign\u2019s traditional and sometimes strange mix of recorded tunes. \u201cShoutout to Kamala Harris!\u201d Flo Milli tells the crowd in Milwaukee after performing two of her songs. The artist urges them to vote. She is followed by Wisconsin senator Tammy Baldwin. In his remarks at a Kamala Harris rally, comedian Keegan-Michael Key said he does not like public speaking and finds it uncomfortable, but that he thinks everyone should do what they can in the last days of this important election. The United States is pretty big, but the Harris and Trump campaigns are frequently in the same swing state locations in these final days of the campaign. That includes tonight, when both Trump and Harris are rallying voters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. From the Associated Press tonight: As Election Day nears and the electoral math to secure a presidential victory comes down to seven states, Trump and Harris are scheduling more stops and their travel itineraries are coinciding in time and place. Harris\u2019 Air Force Two landed a bit ahead of Trump with members of the media following Trump seeing the motorcade after arriving at the Milwaukee airport. Walz\u2019s plane was on the tarmac as Trump landed earlier Friday in Detroit. Speaking in Milwaukee, comedian Keegan-Michael Key is comparing the \u201cchoice\u201d between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump as a choice between driving a car to cross the US-Canadian border, and taking a barrel over Niagara Falls. Kamala Harris\u2019s rally tonight in Milwaukee is also a concert, which is slated to feature Cardi B as a speaker, and a number of other musicians. My colleague Victoria Bekiempis has the full recap of Trump\u2019s Michigan rally earlier today. Trump is scheduled to rally again tonight in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A Wisconsin man who has been volunteering as a door-to-door canvasser says it\u2019s been \u201cunsettling\u201d to discover how many voters are still undecided between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. John Cassanos, 63, of Milwaukee, told the Associated Press \u201ca surprising number of people are still undecided\u201d. Cassanos cast his ballot for Harris Wednesday in one of the nation\u2019s key swing states. What\u2019s the view from Michigan journalists on Trump\u2019s visit to Dearborn today? I\u2019ve been following Niraj Warikoo, a Detroit Free Press reporter who has been covering Arab American and Muslim American issues for the past two decades. Some of the angles he\u2019s highlighted this week: The Trump campaign\u2019s outreach to local Arab American and Muslim voters is the \u201cmost extensive\u201d of any Republican presidential nominee in almost a quarter century. \u201cThe outreach also reflects the political rise of Michigan\u2019s Yemeni American community, which has struggled for years to gain recognition by Democrats, and at times facing discrimination,\u201d Warikoo reported, noting: \u201cMany of the imams and groups who have endorsed Trump are of Yemeni descent, though he has gained support from others as well.\u201d The governor of Washington says he has activated some national guard members prior to next week\u2019s election, the Associated Press reports: Washington state Gov Jay Inslee has activated some Washington National Guard members to be on standby in the event they are asked to support local law enforcement and the Washington State Patrol during election week. Inslee said in a news release on Friday that the activation is a precautionary measure taken in response to incidents in October in which incendiary devices were set off on ballot drop boxes in Vancouver, Washington, and in Portland, Oregon. He also cited US Department of Homeland Security warnings of threats to election infrastructure during the 2024 election cycle as a reason for the measure. His order activates as many members of the Washington National Guard as determined necessary for up to four days, beginning Monday and ending at 12.01am on 8 November. The Democratic mayor of Dearborn, Michigan, posted on social media about his decision not to meet with Donald Trump today. He also had a message to members of his own party, as did the representative Rashida Tlaib: Why did Arab Americans in Dearborn want to host Trump in their community? The Associated Press spoke with Albert Abbas, one of the locals who hosted Trump there, and who said the Biden-Harris administration \u201chas failed miserably in all aspects of humanity\u201d. \u201cWe look to a Trump presidency with hope and envisioning a time where peace flourishes, particularly in Lebanon and Palestine,\u201d Abbas said today. He told the Associated Press that Trump allies had reached out to him several weeks ago about hosting Trump in Dearborn. Before hosting Trump, Abbas said he wanted to see a statement from Trump that he said showed Trump \u201chas the intentions of ending the war and helping us rebuild Lebanon and helping the displaced and the injured\u201d. That statement came Wednesday, when Trump posted on X that he wanted to \u201cstop the suffering and destruction in Lebanon.\u201d \u201cI will preserve the equal partnership among all Lebanese communities,\u201d Trump said on X. \u201cYour friends and family in Lebanon deserve to live in peace, prosperity, and harmony with their neighbors, and that can only happen with peace and stability in the Middle East.\u201d Once Trump put out the statement, Abbas said he agreed to host the event. Top Arab American community leaders declined to meet Donald Trump during his trip to Dearborn, Michigan, today, the Associated Press reports. But even some of those who declined to meet the Republican candidate said his visit was important. More from the Associated Press: Donald Trump on Friday met with Arab Americans in Dearborn, Michigan \u2013 the nation\u2019s largest Arab-majority city \u2013 as the Republican presidential nominee works to court the potentially decisive group despite his history of Islamophobic rhetoric and policy. Trump\u2019s visit marked the first by either candidate, according to a local leader, Osama Siblani. Top community leaders in Dearborn, including the city\u2019s Democratic mayor, Abdullah Hammoud, declined an invitation to meet with Trump while he was in town. Many community leaders say that while Harris has never earned their endorsement, they are still overwhelmingly opposed to Trump. Siblani, a prominent figure in the community who has engaged with Democratic leaders about ongoing tensions, noted that many \u2018do not trust\u2019 Trump because of his past policies and remarks. However, he emphasized the significance of Trump\u2019s visit to Dearborn. \u2018Kamala should have done this months ago,\u2019 Siblani said. A federal judge on Friday denied an attempt by America Pac \u2013 the political action committee founded by Elon Musk to support Donald Trump\u2019s campaign for a second presidency \u2013 to move to federal court a civil suit brought by the Philadelphia district attorney over a daily $1m prize draw for registered voters. The lawyers for Musk and his America Pac had argued that the lawsuit, which is seeking to halt the sweepstakes in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, needed to be resolved in federal court as it referenced the 5 November presidential election. But the presiding US district judge Gerald Pappert disagreed with that contention in a five-page opinion, writing that the motivations of the Philadelphia district attorney, Larry Krasner, were irrelevant \u2013 and that his office had the power to bring the case in state court. A hearing was scheduled in Pennsylvania state court on Monday, the day before the election. It\u2019s been a busy day of campaigning across the US, but Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are not done yet. Both candidates will be holding evening rallies in and around Milwaukee tonight, Trump at the downtown Fiserv Forum, and Harris at the Wisconsin State Fair Park Exposition Center in the Milwaukee suburbs. \u201cIf voters in Wisconsin had any doubt about the state\u2019s importance in the road to the White House, the candidates\u2019 nearly constant visits to the state should put those to rest,\u201d Wisconsin Public Radio reported. Meanwhile, in Traverse City, Michigan, Tim Walz is hammering home that same message of unity \u2013 appealing to independent and Republican voters. \u201cWe\u2019ve got independents and Republicans coming over to this campaign. People who are adhering to the old Republican party values that added to this country. That\u2019s not Donald Trump,\u201d he said. When Kamala Harris asked the rally crowd how many of them had voted already, she heard a roar of cheers and applause in response. \u201cOh, my goodness, that\u2019s great! Thank you,\u201d she said. Wisconsin has seen a record number of people voting early this year, with officials in some municipalities already reporting that more than 50% of registered voters in their region have cast early ballots. In her closing pitch, Harris is once again emphasizing that she is looking to be a political consensus builder. \u201cHere is my pledge to you. Here is my pledge to you as president. I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face,\u201d she said. \u201cI pledge to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. I will listen to experts. I will listen to the people who disagree with me. Because, you see, unlike Donald Trump, I don\u2019t believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy.\u201d Repeating a line she\u2019s been using often lately, she added: \u201cHe wants to put them in jail. I\u2019ll give them a seat at the table.\u201d Kamala Harris is taking the stage in Little Chute, Wisconsin. She was introduced by the senator Tammy Baldwin, who told the crowd: \u201cWe are the battleground state in this election.\u201d Here\u2019s footage of the line of people before the event: The supreme court on Friday rejected an emergency appeal from Republicans that could have led to thousands of provisional ballots not being counted in Pennsylvania, the Associated Press reports. The justices left in place a state supreme court ruling that elections officials must count provisional ballots cast by voters whose mail-in ballots were rejected. As of Thursday, about 9,000 ballots out of more than 1.6 million returned have arrived at elections offices around Pennsylvania lacking a secrecy envelope, a signature or a date, according to state records. Pennsylvania is the biggest presidential election battleground this year, with 19 electoral votes. Donald Trump won the state in 2016, then lost it in 2020. \u201cNovember 5 will be the most important day in the history of the country,\u201d Trump says, leading the crowd as they shout together: \u201cWe will make America great again.\u201d The rally has concluded. Trump spoke for about two hours, with some brief pauses for videos and cameos from other speakers. \u201cI will prevent world war three from happening,\u201d Trump tells a Michigan audience, as he appears to be wrapping up his closing arguments here. He is due to speak at another rally a few hours from now in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. \u201cWe will teach our children to love our country and to honor our history and to always respect our great American flag,\u201d Trump says. He says he will support legislation that would impose a penalty of one year in prison for burning the American flag. (The US supreme court ruled in 1989 that flag-burning is constitutionally protected speech under the first amendment.) \u201cWe will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools,\u201d Trump adds. As Trump is still speaking in Michigan, Kamala Harris will be speaking again soon in Little Chute, Wisconsin. You can watch here: After facing intense criticism for suggesting at an Arizona rally that Liz Cheney, a former Wyoming representative and major Republican critic, should have guns firing at her, Trump talked about her again at his rally in Warren, Michigan, calling her a warmonger who was not brave enough to fight herself, and accusing her father, Dick Cheney, of being responsible for massive losses of live across the Middle East when he was George W Bush\u2019s vice-president and one of the major architects of the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cKamala is campaigning with warmongers like Liz Cheney \u2026 she picks Liz Cheney, whose father virtually destroyed the Middle East,\u201d Trump said. In his first term, Trump said, Cheney was always telling him: \u201cWe should attack this nation, that nation, nations that people have never even heard of we should attack \u2026 but if you give Liz Cheney a gun and put her into battle facing the other side with guns facing at her, she wouldn\u2019t have the courage or the strength \u2026 to even look the enemy in the eye: \u2018Oh, we ought to go attack Iran, Iraq, everybody.\u2019 That\u2019s why I broke up with her. All she wanted to do is to go to war with everybody \u2026 .\u201d Despite advocating for other people to go to war, Trump said, Cheney herself stays comfortably at home, or at \u201cher father\u2019s lavish home, he got from killing a large portion of the Middle East \u2026 these war hawks, they want to draft your kids to fight in wars, and they will never fight themselves.\u201d The Michigan pro-Trump audience was largely silent during these remarks about Cheney, which are strikingly more in line with leftist criticism of the Bush-Cheney administration, and the aftermath of the Iraq war, than typical Republican views on these conflicts. Trump himself, as the child of a wealthy New York family, famously got a deferment for bone spurs that allowed him to avoid serving in the Vietnam war. As he approaches the end of his speech in Warren, Michigan, Trump is touting his support from Muslims and Arab Americans in Michigan. \u201cNow the most amazing thing is happening, we\u2019re also wining overwhelming support from your Muslim community right here in Michigan. Muslim and Arab right here in Michigan, that\u2019s something, that\u2019s progress,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I just came from an incredible meeting with the Lebanese community in Dearborn. Last week I was honored to be endorsed by a group of some of the most important imams and Muslim leaders in your state.\u201d Trump also talks about being grateful to Bill Bazzi, the mayor of Dearborn Heights, and Dr Amer Ghalib, the mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, who have both endorsed Trump, and says Bazzi is in the audience at the rally. \u201cI need every Muslim American in Michigan to get the hell out and vote, please, Mr mayors,\u201d Trump says. \u201cKamala\u2019s closing message to the American people is that she hates you,\u201d Trump says. \u201cShe\u2019s from San Francisco, she\u2019s a Marxist.\u201d (Harris did serve as district attorney of San Francisco, but is definitely not a Marxist.) \u201cMy closing message is that I love America.\u201d Big cheers and whistles from the Michigan audience as Trump once again promises to carry out the largest deportation in American history. Even bigger cheers as Trump promises the death penalty for any immigrant who kills a US citizen or a law enforcement officer. Here\u2019s an in-depth look by my colleague Lauren Gambino about how Trump\u2019s mass deportation plan would affect immigrants across the US: An editor at the Huffington Post is highlighting a story out of Oklahoma, about a 109-year-old woman\u2019s choice for president: In Michigan, Trump is now riffing on the sacrifices he says he has made for his political movement: \u201cSomebody said to me: \u2018Are you glad you did it?\u2019 I said, absolutely. But I could have been on the best beaches in the world. I own the best beaches in the world,\u201d Trump says, to laughs from the crowd. \u201c \u2026 I could have had those waves smacking me in the face. That white, beautiful white skin that I have would be nice and tan. I got the whitest skin \u2019cause I never have time to go out in the sun. But I have that beautiful white, and you know what, it could have been beautiful, tan, beautiful. But you know what, if I had the choice, I wouldn\u2019t even think about it, I would do exactly what I\u2019ve done, because we\u2019re going to make America great again.\u201d As Trump is still speaking in Michigan, JD Vance addresses a crowd in North Carolina, assisted by Donald Trump Jr: Harris supporters are sharing a clip of Donald Trump speaking in Warren, Michigan, just now, when he praised a book by Steven Moore, one of the co-authors of Project 2025. More on Moore here: Trump is now criticizing \u201cShawn Fain or whatever the hell his name is\u201d, the president of the United Auto Workers, who is campaigning for Kamala Harris. The crowd boos. Trump says he can\u2019t sleep easily and that he\u2019s \u201calways tossing and turning\u201d thinking about China and the \u201cRussia hoax\u201d and how to make money for the American people. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like a senior. Does anybody feel like a senior?\u201d Trump, 78, says, to some cheers. \u201cI feel better \u2013 I think I\u2019m sharper and better now than I was 25, 30 years ago. I do, I swear. I\u2019ll let you know when I don\u2019t.\u201d Trump gives an update on sales of \u201cDark Maga\u201d merchandise: Trump was talking about Elon Musk, and what role the billionaire will play in cutting government spending in a Trump administration. \u201cYou know where he is right now? He\u2019s campaigning in Pennsylvania for Donald Trump. How cool is that,\u201d Trump said. At one rally, Musk appeared and wore a \u201cDark Maga\u201d black hat, Trump said, that the Republican candidate hadn\u2019t even been aware his campaign made. That hat hadn\u2019t sold well, maybe two hats, Trump said, until Musk wore it. Then the campaign sales of those hats took off. \u201cThey sold 71,000 black hats, can you believe it?\u201d Trump says. \u201cYou make money with money, that\u2019s how it is.\u201d \u201cBut now that very low-IQ person who wants to be \u2013 have we ever had a low-IQ president before?\u201d Trump asks of Kamala Harris. \u201cIt\u2019s like your high school football team playing \u2026 what\u2019s a good team today \u2026 oh, the Detroit Lions,\u201d Trump tells his Michigan audience. He tells them Kamala Harris wouldn\u2019t have been able to figure out which local sports team to reference. In a post on Truth Social, Trump appeared to be trying to walk back his comments about how Liz Cheney, one of his most prominent Republican critics, should face having rifles \u201cshooting at her\u201d. His comments yesterday have been widely condemned, including by Cheney and Kamala Harris, and are also under investigation by Arizona\u2019s attorney general. \u201cShe\u2019s a radical war hawk,\u201d Trump said of Liz Cheney at an event in Arizona. Then said: \u201cLet\u2019s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. Let\u2019s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.\u201d \u201cWe love everybody right?\u201d Trump says. He drops his voice. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d Then Trump launches into an attack on Kamala Harris\u2019s message of unity, a central part of her approach. \u201cWhat about her, she\u2019s always talking about, \u2018You know I want to bring the country together, Trump is Hitler, ah, excuse me I shouldn\u2019t have said that,\u2019\u201d Trump says, in a voice imitating Harris. He goes on with the imitation. \u201c\u2018We want to get together as a country,\u2019 \u2018They\u2019re all racists, they\u2019re all this, they\u2019re all that, but we want to have peace, and we want to get along.\u2019\u201d Trump tells his supporters that \u201cthe fake news\u201d won\u2019t even report on the bad jobs numbers. If you\u2019re curious how just how false that claim is, you can Google it: Trump is now discussing the underwhelming economic numbers for last month. \u201cThis is not good news for them,\u201d he says, of Harris and the Democrats. \u201cHow would you like to have an election in four days?\u201d Some experts agree with Trump on this one: \u201cYou know, there are those that say that if we don\u2019t win this election you may never have another election in this country \u2026 with these radical left lunatics that we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d Trump says. As you recall, Trump himself actually sparked this conversation over whether there might not be elections in the future, because of what he said to Christian voters earlier this year: Trump is now talking about the 2020 Democratic primary, talking about how early Kamala Harris dropped out and revisiting his rude nicknames for various Democratic presidential candidates from the previous election cycle, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. \u201cThis will be America\u2019s new golden age,\u201d Trump pledges. \u201cEvery problem facing us can be solved, and it\u2019s going to be solved quickly.\u201d Abortion rights advocates are mourning the loss of Nevaeh Crain, an 18-year-old pregnant teenager from Texas who died in October 2023 after three emergency room visits as she sought care for intense abdominal pain. ProPublica\u2019s reporting on Crain, who would have turned 20 today, underscored the potentially fatal threat posed by abortion bans, argued Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All. \u201cPregnancy should not be a death sentence. Nevaeh Crain should be here, celebrating her 20th birthday today,\u201d Timmaraju said in a statement. Timmaraju placed the blame for abortion bans on the shoulders of Republican politicians like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, the incumbent senator who is facing a tough re-election fight against Democrat Collin Allred in Texas. \u201cThis has to stop,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd our best chance to do that is to vote for reproductive freedom, from vice-president Harris to Colin Allred and all the way down the ticket, so we can restore the right to abortion and end these bans.\u201d \u201cIt seems so poignant,\u201d Trump says, of the question he keeps asking, \u201cAre you better off now than you were four years ago?\u201d The crowd roars: \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to miss these rallies aren\u2019t we?\u201d Trump says onstage in Michigan, but promises his supporters that when he is back in the White House, the spirit of the rallies will continue in a different form. His supporters will someday look back and realize, \u201cthere was something very, very, special about what we all did together,\u201d Trump says, speaking of his rallies. He also speculates about few people future presidential candidates will draw to their rallies. \u201cThis has been the thrill of a lifetime for me, and for you, and for everybody,\u201d Trump says. The White House pool report has an amusing detail from Janesville for the punctuation nerds: Someone behind Harris on the stage was holding a \u201c,la\u201d sign (comma \u201cla\u201d), which is the proper pronunciation of her name. Donald Trump is now taking the stage in a rally in Warren, Michigan. Robert F Kennedy Jr says that he prayed to God every day to help him find a way to resolve America\u2019s chronic disease crisis, and that he considers Donald Trump the answer to that prayer. Kennedy also embraced an anti-trans talking point, talking about how Democrats are \u201cdestroying women\u2019s sports\u201d and how Trump will protect women. Talking about how he is still on the ballot in many states after ending his third-party presidential bid, Robert F Kennedy Jr urges people not to vote for him. \u201cI do not want you to vote for me,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cIf you want to see me go to Washington, you better vote for Donald Trump. Robert F Kennedy Jr is taking the stage at a Donald Trump rally in Warren, Michigan, to huge cheers. More background from Mother Jones on RFK Jr\u2019s current \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement: From NBC News\u2019s Yamiche Alcindor: \u201cDo we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity?\u201d Harris asks in Janesville, as the crowd cheers. Her voice sounds a little more strained than usual, as if the nonstop campaign speeches are catching up with her. \u201cFive days from now you don\u2019t want to look back on these four days and regret what you might have done,\u201d Harris says, urging her supporters in Wisconsin to keep organizing, keep knocking on doors, texting, calling, reaching out to friends and neighbors, and keep urging people to vote right through to election day. In Janesville, Harris calls Trump \u201can existential threat to America\u2019s labor movement\u201d and says that \u201che will appoint a union buster to run the Department of Labor.\u201d The audience boos as Kamala Harris says that Donald Trump promised that the Chinese company Foxconn was going to invest billions of dollars and create manufacturing jobs in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, which were promises that did not come true, she says. \u201cMadame president! Madame president!\u201d the union crowd in Janesville chants, briefly interrupting Kamala Harris\u2019s speech. In Janesville, Harris is preaching to the union choir on the benefits of collective bargaining, saying \u201cit\u2019s about basic fairness, but sometimes we have to fight for fairness. \u201cWhen unions are strong, America is strong,\u201d she adds. \u201cFolks are exhausted with this stuff,\u201d Harris says, of what she calls Donald Trump\u2019s past decade of encouraging people to \u201cpoint fingers at each other\u201d. The audience cheers. \u201cThat\u2019s who he is. That\u2019s not who we are.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s great to be in the house of labor,\u201d Kamala Harris says as she arrives to speak at an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union hall in Janesville, Wisconsin. \u201cYou are building America and America\u2019s future,\u201d she tells the union workers, adding she hopes to eventually visit every IBEW local hall in the US. Kamala Harris is just now arriving at a campaign event in Janesville, Wisconsin. Here\u2019s a look at where things stand: Kamala Harris spoke of Donald Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric about Liz Cheney in which he suggested Cheney be shot with \u201cguns trained on her face\u201d. Harris said: \u201cHe has increased his violent rhetoric, Donald Trump has, about political opponents and in great detail suggested rifles should be trained on former representative Liz Cheney. This must be disqualifying.\u201d Arizona\u2019s attorney general has launched an investigation into whether Donald Trump violated state law through his violent rhetoric against Liz Cheney. In a statement to 12News on Friday, attorney general Kris Mayes said: \u201cI have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under Arizona\u2019s laws.\u201d The justice department announced on Friday it is deploying election monitors in 86 jurisdictions in 27 states for the general election on 5 November. \u201cThe Justice Department enforces federal voting rights laws that protect the rights of all eligible citizens to access the ballot,\u201d an official statement said. \u201cThe department regularly deploys its staff to monitor for compliance with federal civil rights laws in elections in communities all across the country.\u201d The NAACP is condemning participants of a Halloween costume in Mt Pleasant, Pennsylvania, that showed a person acting as \u201cKamala Harris\u201d chained up and walking behind a vehicle that appeared to have someone dressed up as Donald Trump. In a statement reported by CBS, Daylon A Davis, the president of the NAACP Pittsburgh branch, said: \u201cThis appalling portrayal goes beyond the realm of Halloween satire or free expression; it is a harmful symbol that evokes a painful history of violence, oppression, and racism that Black and Brown communities have long endured here in America.\u201d Donald Trump has sued CBS News for $10bn, alleging an interview with Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes was doctored to cast her in a positive light and amounted to \u201celection interference\u201d. The lawsuit seeking damages was filed in a US district court in Amarillo, northern Texas, which is presided over by a judge, Matthew Kacsmaryk, who has a track record of friendly rulings to rightwing legal filings. Several House representatives have penned a letter to Joe Biden, requiring a \u201cdetailed account of US involvement with Israeli forces in Gaza, Lebanon, Iran, Yemen and Syria\u201d, as stated by the Michigan representative Rashida Tlaib. The letter, signed by Tlaib, along with Ilhan Omar, Andr\u00e9 Carson, Cori Bush and Summer L Lee asks Biden, \u201cIs the United States providing military services of any nature to \u2018command, coordinate, participate in the movement of, or accompany\u2019 Israeli forces which themselves are imminently engaged in hostilities in Gaza, Lebanon, Iran, Yemen, the West Bank, Syria or elsewhere?\u201d Greta Thunberg, the 21-year old Swedish climate activist who has frequently criticized the US\u2019s fossil fuels policies, has released her latest statement on Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. In a post on X, Thunberg, who has also been a vocal critic of the US\u2019s military support towards Israel amid its deadly war in Gaza, said: \u201cIt is probably impossible to overestimate the consequences this specific election will have for the world and for the future of humanity.\u201d Arizona\u2019s attorney general has launched an investigation into whether Donald Trump violated state law through his violent rhetoric against Liz Cheney who he said should be shot with \u201cguns trained on her face\u201d. In a statement to 12News on Friday, attorney general Kris Mayes said: \u201cI have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under Arizona\u2019s laws.\u201d In an interview with the former Fox host Tucker Carlson on Thursday evening in Arizona, Trump spoke of Cheney, a former Republican House representative of Wyoming and vocal critic of Trump. \u201cShe\u2019s a radical war hawk. Let\u2019s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let\u2019s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face,\u201d Trump said. In response, Cheney took to X and wrote: \u201cThis is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant. #Womenwillnotbesilenced #VoteKamala.\u201d Kamala Harris appeared to avoid directly answering questions on what her response is to demonstrators protesting Israel\u2019s wars in the Middle East, what she would do to \u201csatisfy\u201d the anti-war protestors and whether she is concerned about how she will perform in the polls across college towns and in Michigan in particular \u2013 home to the largest Arab American community in the US. Harris, who is facing criticism from numerous Arab Americans over her continued support towards Israel, said: \u201cI\u2019m very proud to have a significant amount of support from the Arab American community, both because of my position about what we need to do in Gaza and in the region to end the war and bring the hostages home, and my commitment to a two-state solution.\u201d Harris appeared to then redirect her response to living costs, saying: \u201cBut also because within that community, there are many issues that challenge folks that they want to hear about, including what we\u2019re going to do to make housing affordable, what we\u2019re going to do to bring down the cost of groceries, what we\u2019re going to do to invest in small businesses. I have a plan for all of those things, and that is something that resonates within that community and with all Americans.\u201d Kamala Harris spoke of Donald Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric about Liz Cheney in which he suggested Cheney be shot with \u201cguns trained on her face\u201d. Harris said: \u201cHe has increased his violent rhetoric, Donald Trump has, about political opponents and in great detail suggested rifles should be trained on former representative Liz Cheney. This must be disqualifying.\u201d Hailing Cheney as a \u201ccourageous\u201d and \u201cincredible American\u201d, Harris added: \u201cI will tell you, I know Liz Cheney well enough to know that she is tough, she is incredibly courageous, and has shown herself to be a true patriot at a very difficult time in our country \u2026 We see this kind of rhetoric that is violent in nature, where we see this kind of spirit coming from Donald Trump that is so laden with the desire for revenge and retribution \u2026 I think that Liz Cheney is courageous and that we will always make sure that we are all fighting against and speaking out against any form of political violence.\u201d Kamala Harris went on to reiterate her pledge to have a Republican member in her cabinet, saying: \u201cOne of the reasons I am going to have a Republican in my cabinet is because I want different views. I enjoy and benefit from the diverse views from different perspectives that allow me then to make the best decisions I can make. That\u2019s a big difference between me and Donald Trump, and that\u2019s a big difference between someone who truly is a leader, and someone who\u2019s in it for themselves, and wants unchecked power.\u201d Kamala Harris was just speaking to the press on the tarmac ahead of a campaign stop in Wisconsin. Speaking of Donald Trump, Harris said: \u201cHe talks in a way that suggests that there should be retribution and severe consequences just because people disagree with him. My point is very clear. I believe in our democracy, democracies are complicated in a wonderful way, because we like debate. We accept and receive differences of opinion, and we work them out.\u201d The justice department announced on Friday it is deploying election monitors in 86 jurisdictions in 27 states for the general election on 5 November. \u201cThe Justice Department enforces federal voting rights laws that protect the rights of all eligible citizens to access the ballot,\u201d an official statement said. \u201cThe department regularly deploys its staff to monitor for compliance with federal civil rights laws in elections in communities all across the country.\u201d Two of the 86 jurisdictions include Maricopa county in Arizona and Fulton county in Georgia, where Trump loyalists questioned the results of the 2020 election and pushed for vote recounts. Another hotly contested race is taking place in Texas right now. Ted Cruz, the state\u2019s Republican senator, is facing off against his Democratic opponent, Colin Allred, in historically red Texas. A new University of Texas \u2013 Tyler poll found Cruz has 47% support from likely voters while Allred has 45%, which is within the margin of error. The two candidates have been neck and neck in this election, and if Allred pulls ahead, he will help democrats maintain their narrow Senate majority and make history as the state\u2019s first Black US senator. Cruz has been challenged in a tight race before. In 2018, he narrowly won over the Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke. Kamala Harris stood before a cheering crowd of hundreds of her supporters in Philadelphia and promised that she would deliver in Pennsylvania, a battleground state considered a must-win in the electoral college. \u201cNine days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we know this is going to be a tight race until the very end,\u201d the vice-president told supporters in Philadelphia last weekend. \u201cAnd make no mistake: we will win.\u201d And yet, just a day earlier at a rally in State College, Donald Trump declared: \u201cWe\u2019re going to pull this off. It\u2019ll be the greatest victory in the history of our country for all of us \u2013 not for me, for all of us.\u201d The dueling comments reflect a neck-and-neck race in Pennsylvania that is hurtling toward the finish line with no clear frontrunner. The victor of Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, the most of any battleground state, will probably win the electoral college and determine the trajectory of the country for the next four years.

Marina Dunbar reports for the Guardian: A video circulating on social media purporting to show Haitians voting illegally for Kamala Harris is fake, according to the secretary of state in Georgia. Brad Raffensperger said in a statement that the video had likely been created and spread by Russian government actors trying to interfere in the US election. \u201cThis is obviously fake, and likely it is a production of Russian troll farms,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs Americans we can\u2019t let our enemies use lies to divide us and undermine faith in our institutions \u2013 or each other.\u201d For the full story, click here: The NAACP is condemning participants of a Halloween costume in Mt Pleasant, Pennsylvania, that showed a person acting as \u201cKamala Harris\u201d chained up and walking behind a vehicle that appeared to have someone dressed up as Donald Trump. In a statement reported by CBS, Daylon A Davis, the president of the NAACP Pittsburgh branch, said: \u201cThis appalling portrayal goes beyond the realm of Halloween satire or free expression; it is a harmful symbol that evokes a painful history of violence, oppression, and racism that Black and Brown communities have long endured here in America.\u201d Mt Pleasant mayor, Diane Bailey, also condemned the Halloween costume which showed \u201cDonald Trump\u201d flanked by people dressed as Secret Service agents as \u201cHarri\u201d walked behind the vehicle with her hands bound. \u201cI was appalled, angered, upset,\u201d she said on Thursday. \u201cThis does not belong in this parade or in this town,\u201d Bailey said. The displayed had been allowed by the local volunteer fire department. In a statement, the fire department later apologized for \u201callowing the offensive participants to take part\u201d. The volunteer fire department added that it would review its processes for future Halloween parades. Kamala Harris has taken another jab at Donald Trump over his promises to improve the lives of working class communities across the US, saying: \u201cDonald Trump pretends to understand workers and the battles they face every day. Let\u2019s not fall for the okey-doke: He was handed $400 million on a silver platter.\u201d Donald Trump has sued CBS News for $10bn, claiming its interview with Kamala Harris was edited. Robert Tait reports for the Guardian: Donald Trump has sued CBS News for $10bn, alleging an interview with Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes was doctored to cast her in a positive light and amounted to \u201celection interference\u201d. The lawsuit seeking damages was filed in a US district court in Amarillo, northern Texas, which is presided over by a judge, Matthew Kacsmaryk, who has a track record of friendly rulings to rightwing legal filings. It came after Trump said that CBS should lose its license to broadcast news over the interview. Several House representatives have penned a letter to Joe Biden, requiring a \u201cdetailed account of US involvement with Israeli forces in Gaza, Lebanon, Iran, Yemen and Syria\u201d, as stated by the Michigan representative Rashida Tlaib. The letter, signed by Tlaib, along with Ilhan Omar, Andr\u00e9 Carson, Cori Bush and Summer L Lee asks Biden, among other questions: \u201cIs the United States providing military services of any nature to \u2018command, coordinate, participate in the movement of, or accompany\u2019 Israeli forces which themselves are imminently engaged in hostilities in Gaza, Lebanon, Iran, Yemen, the West Bank, Syria or elsewhere? In the months of September and October, have US forces been deployed \u2018into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities are clearly indicated by the circumstances\u2019 in the region, how many times, and when will members of Congress receive reports pursuant to Section 4 of the War Powers Resolution? What is the legal basis for any such deployments?\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s comments suggesting that Liz Cheney, a former Republican congresswoman and one of his most outspoken critics, should be shot at sparked outrage among gun safety advocates. During an appearance with the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in the battleground state of Arizona yesterday, Trump said: \u201cLet\u2019s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. Let\u2019s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.\u201d John Feinblatt, president of the group Everytown for Gun Safety, pointed to Trump\u2019s remarks as further evidence of why he cannot be trusted to lead the country. \u201cTime and time again, Donald Trump has used violent rhetoric and threats against his fellow Americans,\u201d Feinblatt said in a statement. \u201cPolitical violence does not represent the values of our country and has no place in our democracy, and this will be front of mind for voters at the ballot box.\u201d Cheney herself also responded to Trump\u2019s comments, saying on X: \u201cThis is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant.\u201d Joe Biden has released the following statement on the latest job report: In October, unemployment was unchanged at 4.1%, but the devastation from Hurricanes Helene and Milton, and new strike activity, lowered job growth. Job growth is expected to rebound in November as our hurricane recovery and rebuilding efforts continue. In addition, I want to congratulate the leadership of the Machinists and Boeing for negotiating a new contract proposal that will be voted on by union members. Machinists at Boeing have sacrificed over the years and deserve a strong contract. America\u2019s economy remains strong, with 16m jobs created since I took office, including an average 180,000 jobs created each month over the last year \u2013 more than the year before the pandemic. We have the lowest average unemployment rate of any administration in 50 years, our economy has grown more than any presidential term this century, incomes are up $4,000 over prices, and inflation has fallen nearly to its 2% target. He added that the national sales tax being proposed by congressional Republicans \u201cwould cost families nearly $4,000 a year, hurt American manufacturing and cut hundreds of thousands of jobs\u201d. Republicans are preparing to reject US election result if Trump loses, warn strategists. Robert Tait reports for the Guardian: Republicans are already laying the ground for rejecting the result of next week\u2019s US presidential election in the event Donald Trump loses, with early lawsuits baselessly alleging fraud and partisan polls exaggerating his popularity to make it harder for his supporters to accept that he did not win, veteran strategists say. The warnings \u2013 from Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans \u2013 come as Americans prepare to vote on Tuesday in the most consequential presidential contest in generations. Most polls show Trump running neck and neck with Kamala Harris, the vice-president and Democratic nominee, with the two candidates seemingly evenly matched in seven key swing states. But suspicions have been voiced over a spate of recent polls, mostly commissioned in battleground states from groups with Republican links, that mainly show Trump leading. The projection of surging Trump support as election day nears has drawn confident predictions from him and his supporters. For the full story, click here: Greta Thunberg, the 21-year old Swedish climate activist who has frequently criticized the US\u2019s fossil fuels policies, has released her latest statement on Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. In a post on X, Thunberg, who has also been a vocal critic of the US\u2019s military support towards Israel amid its deadly war in Gaza, said: It is probably impossible to overestimate the consequences this specific election will have for the world and for the future of humanity. There is no doubt that one of the candidates \u2013 Trump \u2013 is way more dangerous than the other. But no matter if Trump or Harris wins, the USA \u2013 a country built on stolen land and genocide on indigenous people \u2013 will still be an imperialist, hyper-capitalist world power that will ultimately continue to lead the world further into a racist, unequal world with an ever increasingly escalating climate \u2013 and environmental emergency. With this in mind, my main message to Americans is to remember that you cannot only settle for the least worst option. Democracy is not only every four years on election day, but also every hour of every day in between. You cannot think you have done \u2018enough\u2019 only by voting, especially when both those candidates have blood on their hands. The US unemployment rate remained steady, despite the disappointing jobs pressed downwards by hurricanes and strikes. Here\u2019s reaction from Steven Rattner, who previously led Barack Obama\u2019s auto industry task force. He\u2019s also a Wall Streeter, economics analyst and columnist. The US dollar has weakened after the shock drop in non-farm payrolls, with data released as part of the monthly jobs report half an hour ago. The dollar is down by 0.3% against a trade-weighted basket of currencies after initially climbing earlier in the day. The British pound, for example, is now up 0.5% today against the greenback, while the European Union\u2019s euro currency is up 0.1%. There is a lot of incoming reaction from economics experts to the latest US jobs figures. We are covering reaction and analysis and you can follow a lot of the responses in our business live blog that\u2019s being run out of our London headquarters. You can follow that here. A Washington Post columnist noted: \u201cThe US economy has gained 16.1 million jobs since President Biden took office in January 2021.\u201d The US has added only 12,000 jobs in October in the final report before the presidential election. The Guardian\u2019s Michael Sainato reports: The US added just 12,000 jobs in October, the last snapshot of the employment market before election day, in a report heavily impacted by the strike at Boeing and two recent hurricanes. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1%. Temporary impacts from Hurricane Helene, Hurricane Milton and the ongoing strike by 33,000 Boeing workers in the Pacific north-west had been expected to reduce job growth numbers in October. Economists estimated 120,000 jobs would be added for the month and the unemployment rate would remain steady at 4.1%. Job creation accelerated unexpectedly in September as the US added a revised 223,000 jobs, in the strongest month of jobs growth since March 2024. Until October the average number of jobs gained per month in 2024 has been about 200,000. For the full story, click here: With the election just days away, here\u2019s a look at today\u2019s schedules of the Harris-Walz and Trump-Vance campaigns, as reported by Politico: Kamala Harris will speak at a union hall in Janesville, Wisconsin, at 3.40pm ET. She will then attend a GOTV event in Little Chute at 7.05pm before heading to West Allis for a rally and concert at 10.20pm ET. Tim Walz will participate in campaign events in Detroit, Michigan, this afternoon. He will then hold rallies in Flint, Michigan, at 3.25pm ET and then Traverse City at 6.45pm ET. Donald Trump will rally in Warren, Michigan, at 4.30pm ET and then Milwaukee at 9pm ET. He may also be the first major 2024 presidential candidate to visit the Arab-majority city of Dearborn, the Associated Press reports. JD Vance will hold rallies in Portage, Michigan, at 1pm ET and then Selma, North Carolina, at 5pm ET. On Thursday, Donald Trump called former representative Liz Cheney \u201ca very dumb individual\u201d, and added: \u201cShe\u2019s a radical war hawk. Let\u2019s put her with the rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK, let\u2019s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.\u201d Cheney has vocally opposed Trump since the January 6 2021 attack on the US Capitol and has become a surrogate for his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. Cheney responded to Trump\u2019s threatening comments on Friday morning. \u201cThis is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death,\u201d Cheney wrote on X. \u201cWe cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant. #Womenwillnotbesilenced #VoteKamala\u201d Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will host dueling rallies within seven miles of each other on Friday night in the Milwaukee area as part of a final push for votes in swing-state Wisconsin\u2019s largest county. Milwaukee is home to the most Democratic votes in Wisconsin, but its conservative suburbs are where most Republicans live and are a critical area for Trump as he tries to reclaim the state he narrowly won in 2016 and lost in 2020. It was absentee votes from Milwaukee, which typically are reported early in the morning after Election Day, that tipped Wisconsin for President Joe Biden in 2020. \u201cBoth candidates recognise that the road to the White House runs directly through Milwaukee County,\u201d said Hilario Deleon, chair of the county\u2019s Republican Party. The dueling rallies \u2013 Trump is in downtown Milwaukee and Harris is in a suburb \u2013 may be the candidates\u2019 last appearances in battleground Wisconsin before Election Day. Both sides say the race is once again razor tight for the state\u2019s 10 electoral votes. Four of the past six presidential elections in Wisconsin have been decided by less than a point, or fewer than 23,000 votes. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the US election. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are locked in a nail-bitingly close US presidential election race. Harris maintains a single point advantage over her Republican rival. As of 30 October, the latest polls put Harris at 47%, and Trump at 46%. Read more from the Guardian\u2019s poll tracker: There are four days left until the election. Here are the key recent developments: Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigned in the western part of the US, namely the key swing states of Arizona and Nevada. In her speech, Harris told Nevada: \u201cMake no mistake: we will win.\u201d Adding, \u201cIt is time for a new generation of leadership in America \u2026 And I am ready to offer that leadership.\u201d During her appearances, Harris repeatedly criticised Trump\u2019s \u201cvery offensive\u201d remarks about being the \u201cprotector\u201d of women \u201cwhether they like it or not\u201d. Harris\u2019s speech was followed by a performance by Jennifer Lopez in Las Vegas, as she seeks to connect with Latino voters in the final days of the race. Trump, meanwhile, appeared with far-right media personality Tucker Carlson in Phoenix, Arizona. Former president Donald Trump launched another attack on former Rep Liz Cheney late Thursday, calling the Republican former Wyoming congresswoman a \u201cwar hawk\u201d and suggesting she might not be as willing to send troops to fight if she had guns pointed at her. Cheney has vocally opposed Trump since the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol and has become a surrogate for his Democratic opponent, vice-president Kamala Harris. After calling Cheney \u201ca very dumb individual\u201d, he said: \u201cShe\u2019s a radical war hawk. Let\u2019s put her with the rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK, let\u2019s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.\u201d More than 65 million people have cast their ballots in the race, as of 31 October at 11pm EST.",

      "bodyText": "The winds of typhoon Kong-rey howled through the streets of the Taiwanese capital, Taipei, on Thursday afternoon. Meanwhile, inside a brick and glass building people similarly wailed down the corridors of a branch of the Partyworld karaoke chain. Through the poorly soundproofed door of one room voices warbled a song by the Taiwanese rock band Mayday, and through another came the sounds of a song by Coldplay. In room 330, someone made an exasperated search through the song list \u2013 \u201cwhere is Kylie? What the hell! \u201d \u2013 as friends screamed lyrics from a Linkin Park track. In the street the winds that would later bring down thousands of trees grew stronger, driven by the typhoon\u2019s central vortex hundreds of miles to the south. But the treacherous weather did not stop what has become a modern day tradition in Taiwan\u2019s cities: typhoon karaoke. Kong-rey was the largest-sized typhoon to hit Taiwan in decades when it made landfall on Thursday and wreaked havoc on the island\u2019s south. County governments nationwide had announced a \u201ctyphoon day\u201d late on Wednesday night, closing schools and most businesses for Thursday and giving people a day off, ostensibly to shelter at home. But for city people without other commitments, a typhoon day has come to mean one thing: KTV, as karaoke is known in Taiwan. And the karaoke joints, which unlike most hospitality venues will stay open during a typhoon, often book out within minutes. Taiwan loves to sing. Its cities have hundreds, if not thousands, of KTV options. There are hundreds of venues like those in the Partyworld chain, two-person karaoke booths in metro stations, and at least a couple of karaoke taxis driving around. In 2023, more than half of Taiwanese respondents told a survey they had been to KTV in the past year, according to Statista. Jean, Mana, Jimmy and Sarah spent most of Thursday afternoon inside a room with other friends, eating drinking and singing their favourite songs. Jean, a lawyer, does not get many days off \u2013 few people do in Taiwan, where workers are entitled to a minimum of three annual leave days in their first year, rising progressively to 15 after five years in a job. \u201cLast night, maybe about 9pm, we decided to have KTV time today, because we just heard about the typhoon day off,\u201d said Jean. \u201cYou have to spend quite a long time to find an available KTV room today.\u201d On Thursday afternoon staff at the Zhongxiao Dunhua branch of Partyworld rushed to keep up with endless orders for dumplings, beef noodle soup and beer for the dozens of fully booked rooms. A-han, a waiter who has worked at Partyworld for three years, said: \u201cPeople are more relaxed and they order much more food and alcohol because they\u2019re supposed to be at work, but they aren\u2019t today.\u201d A-han says typhoon days are always packed and he is run off his feet. But his employers provide a meal and a taxi to and from home and, as a student, he is grateful for the work. When typhoon days are declared, people are supposed to stay at home, but some recent \u201ctyphoon days\u201d in Taiwan\u2019s north have brought only mild weather, prompting accusations that local officials are chasing popularity. There is also concern that people in Taiwan may become complacent about the threat posed by typhoons. Kong-rey was the real deal, as groups like Jean and her friends discovered when they left Partyworld on Thursday evening. As they descended the stairs and left the venue \u2013 some staggering a little \u2013 the warblers found that the weather had taken a dramatic turn, with fierce winds blowing debris dangerously along footpaths.

Voters in Pennsylvania must place their ballots in two envelopes: an inner envelope that ensures its secrecy, and an outer envelope that they mail.</p> <p>Pennsylvania law does not allow for a voter to cast a provisional ballot \u2013 an emergency vote at the polls \u2013 if they have cast a timely mail-in vote. But a majority of justices on the state supreme court said that a ballot that was rejected because it lacked a secrecy envelope did not count as a cast ballot. \u201cBecause electors failed to comply with the mandatory secrecy envelope requirement, they failed to cast a ballot,\u201d the state supreme court wrote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/trump-final-week-campaign-election\">Threats, racism, misogyny: Trump\u2019s disturbing final week of campaigning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The scope of the ruling is not immediately clear. As of Thursday, nearly 9,000 out of 1.6m mail-in ballots returned had arrived without a secrecy envelope, the Associated Press reported. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/thousands-ballots-stake-supreme-court-pennsylvania-rcna178231\">The NBC News decision desk</a> estimated that thousands of votes could be affected in a state that could come down to extremely fine margins.</p> <p>\u201cIn Pennsylvania and across the country, Trump and his allies are trying to make it harder for your vote to count, but our institutions are stronger than his shameful attacks. Today\u2019s decision confirms that, for every eligible voter, the right to vote means the right to have your vote counted,\u201d read a joint statement from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a>\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p>Pennsylvania adopted a law in 2019 that allows all voters to cast a mail-in ballot. But the law is not clear when it comes to whether officials should be required to notify the voter of technical errors on their ballots \u2013 a missing secrecy envelope, signature or date \u2013 and help them fix them.</p> <p>Thirty-eight counties in the state notify voters of errors and give them the opportunity to fix it, according to an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m5zknFAvvX55Ln1csrG6SqE85Lfjq5LmHV8eZ7UtGXU/edit?tab=t.0\">analysis by Votebeat</a>.

      "bodyText": "Pennsylvania voters will be able to cast a provisional vote if they make an error and forget to put their mail-in vote in a required secrecy envelope, the US supreme court ruled on Friday, a decision that could lead to thousands more votes being counted in a key battleground state where the presidential race is extremely tight. The supreme court announced its decision on Friday on its emergency docket, giving no reasoning for its ruling, which is customary in emergency cases. Republicans had asked the court to intervene after the Pennsylvania supreme court ruled 4-3 earlier this week that voters should not be disenfranchised if they forget the secrecy envelope. Voters in Pennsylvania must place their ballots in two envelopes: an inner envelope that ensures its secrecy, and an outer envelope that they mail. Pennsylvania law does not allow for a voter to cast a provisional ballot \u2013 an emergency vote at the polls \u2013 if they have cast a timely mail-in vote. But a majority of justices on the state supreme court said that a ballot that was rejected because it lacked a secrecy envelope did not count as a cast ballot. \u201cBecause electors failed to comply with the mandatory secrecy envelope requirement, they failed to cast a ballot,\u201d the state supreme court wrote. The scope of the ruling is not immediately clear. As of Thursday, nearly 9,000 out of 1.6m mail-in ballots returned had arrived without a secrecy envelope, the Associated Press reported. The NBC News decision desk estimated that thousands of votes could be affected in a state that could come down to extremely fine margins. \u201cIn Pennsylvania and across the country, Trump and his allies are trying to make it harder for your vote to count, but our institutions are stronger than his shameful attacks. Today\u2019s decision confirms that, for every eligible voter, the right to vote means the right to have your vote counted,\u201d read a joint statement from Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Pennsylvania adopted a law in 2019 that allows all voters to cast a mail-in ballot. But the law is not clear when it comes to whether officials should be required to notify the voter of technical errors on their ballots \u2013 a missing secrecy envelope, signature or date \u2013 and help them fix them. Thirty-eight counties in the state notify voters of errors and give them the opportunity to fix it, according to an analysis by Votebeat. But the court\u2019s decision on Friday means that any voter in Pennsylvania who has a ballot rejected on a technicality will have the chance to cast a provisional ballot on election day to be counted. The dispute stemmed from a special election earlier this year in which two voters in Butler county, near Pittsburgh, had their mail-in ballots rejected, were invited to cast a provisional ballot, and then had their provisional ballots rejected. Justice Samuel Alito wrote on Friday that the case before the court was relatively narrow, and that the court\u2019s intervention at this stage would not prohibit any other Pennsylvania county from prohibit provisional voting. Still, he expressed openness to the argument from Republicans that the state supreme court may have exceeded its authority. Alito\u2019s statement, joined by Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, was significant because he seemed to suggest that the court could use the case to revisit the question of how far state supreme courts can go in policing election laws. The supreme court said last year that state courts can police election rules, but that sometimes they can go too far. It has declined to clarify the ambiguity of its ruling. Pennsylvania is the biggest presidential election battleground this year, with 19 electoral votes. Donald Trump won the state in 2016, then lost it in 2020. A judge in Erie county, in Pennsylvania\u2019s north-western corner, ruled on Friday in a lawsuit brought by the Democratic party that about 15,000 people who applied for a mail ballot but did not receive it may go to the county elections office and get a replacement through Monday. The deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot has passed in Pennsylvania, the biggest presidential battleground this year and a state that has hosted far more visits by Trump and Harris, his Democratic rival, than any other. The ruling means that Erie county\u2019s elections office will be open every day through Monday for voters to go in, cancel the mail-in ballot they did not receive in the mail, and get another one over the counter, said Cliff Levine, a lawyer for the state Democratic party. In suburban Philadelphia\u2019s Bucks county, a court set a deadline of 5pm for voters there to apply for and receive a mail-in ballot. Lines outside the elections office in Doylestown were long throughout the day \u2013 snaking down the sidewalk \u2013 with the process taking about two hours by Friday afternoon. A Bucks county judge had ordered the three-day extension in response to a Trump campaign lawsuit alleging voters faced disenfranchisement when they were turned away by county application-processing offices that had struggled to keep up with demand, leading to frustration and anger among voters. The Trump campaign lawsuit said people who were in line by Tuesday\u2019s 5pm deadline to apply in person for a mail ballot should have been allowed to get a ballot, even after the deadline. However, Bucks county\u2019s election office denied voters that right and ordered them to leave, the lawsuit said. Bucks county judge Jeffrey Trauger ruled that the board of elections violated the state election code and ordered an extension through Friday. Unlike other states, Pennsylvania does not have true early in-person voting. Voters can apply early for mail ballots online or in person at county election buildings. Doing so in person can take about 12 minutes and requires applying for a mail ballot, waiting for a bar-coded envelope to be printed and then, if voters wish, they can cast the ballot on the spot. Or they can put it in a drop box or a mailbox. Election offices must receive the ballots by 8pm on Tuesday.",

Joshua Creamer, a Waanyi and Kalkadoon man, told reporters on Friday he had still received no communication from Crisafulli or any member of the new LNP government.

Moore had few options from his draw in stall one against the rail and stoked Lake Victoria towards the lead on the run to the first turn. The favourite suffered significant interference on the bend, however, as Totally Justified moved across from Moore\u2019s right, and she exited into the back stretch in seventh place. Moore took his time to work his way back into the race, confident that Lake Victoria\u2019s turn of foot would still prove decisive.

Earlier on the card, Magnum Force was a first Breeders\u2019 Cup winner for Ger Lyons in the Juvenile Turf Sprint, the first of 14 Breeders\u2019 Cup races this weekend. Magnum Force had seven rivals in front of him with just over a furlong to run, around a turf track that is tight even by American standards and tends to favour horses ridden prominently. Colin Keane, though, managed to thread Magnum Force up the inside rail before switching outside the front-running Governor Sam as another Irish-trained runner, Arizona Blaze, stayed on into second. Governor Sam took third with the fast-finishing Big Mojo, attempting to give Mick Appleby a second successive win in the race, a nose away in fourth.

Supporters argued that he had become a role model behind bars. His two children, who remained close to him during his incarceration, also pleaded for mercy.</p> <p>The execution began at 6.01pm, the Associated Press reported. Moore\u2019s breathing became shallow and stopped around 6.04pm, and he was pronounced dead at 6.24pm. Moore\u2019s longtime lawyer, who was in the room, could not fight back tears.</p> <p>A prison spokesperson shared Moore\u2019s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-carolina-execution-richard-moore-clemency-e3e74f9309ec23eab220d93b7b0dfc29\">final words</a>, which included a message to the relatives of the man he killed: \u201cTo the family of Mr James Mahoney, I am deeply sorry for the pain and sorrow I caused you all. To my children and granddaughters, I love you and am so proud of you. Thank you for the joy you have brought to my life. To all of my family and friends, new and old, thank you for your love and support.\u201d</p> <p>Justice 360, the non-profit that represented Moore, condemned the execution in a statement, saying it \u201cunderscores the flaws in South Carolina\u2019s death penalty system\u201d: \u201cWho is executed versus who is allowed to live out their lives in prison appears to be based on no more than chance, race, or status. It is intolerable that our State metes out the ultimate punishment in such a haphazard way \u2026 By killing Richard, the State also created more victims. Richard\u2019s children are now fatherless, and his grandchildren will have to grow up without their \u2018Pa Pa\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Moore was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/20/south-carolina-death-row-prisoner-execution\">second person</a> put to death this year in South Carolina, which recently revived executions and is pursuing a rapid spree of killings.</p> <p>The case drew widespread scrutiny over racial bias and doubts about the validity of Moore\u2019s sentence.</p> <p>An all-white jury convicted Moore, who is Black, of an armed robbery and the murder of Mahoney, a white convenience store clerk, 25 years ago. Moore has said the killing was in self-defense.</p> <p>On 16 September 1999, Moore was unarmed when he entered the store where Mahoney was working the counter. There was no footage, so the exact circumstances of the incident are unclear. Moore has said they got into an argument because he was short on change, prompting Mahoney to pull a gun on him.</p> <p>In their scuffle, both men were shot \u2013 Moore in the arm and Mahoney fatally in the chest. Moore took cash from the store.</p>    <p>There is no dispute that Moore was unarmed when he arrived. Mahoney carried a gun, and there were two weapons behind the counter. A store witness said he overheard an argument, and then saw Moore with his hands on the clerk\u2019s hands and that Moore fired in his direction. The witness wasn\u2019t hit and said he played dead and didn\u2019t see the rest of the encounter.</p> <p>A forensic investigator hired by Moore\u2019s lawyers reviewed crime scene evidence in 2017 and concluded the first shot had been fired while the two men were fighting over the gun.</p> <p>Moore\u2019s lawyers argued that, regardless of the details of the shootout, he shouldn\u2019t be eligible for capital punishment, reserved for the \u201cworst of the worst\u201d murders, since he entered unarmed and had no premeditated plans for an armed robbery or homicide. In 2022, Kaye Hearn, a state supreme court justice, agreed, writing in a dissenting opinion that the death sentence was \u201cinvalid\u201d, \u201cdisproportionate\u201d and a \u201crelic of a bygone era\u201d.</p> <p>Hearn said it was \u201cstunning\u201d prosecutors couldn\u2019t identify a comparable death penalty case involving a robbery that began unarmed and noted that Spartanburg county, where Moore was prosecuted, had a history of \u201calarming\u201d racial disparities in the death penalty; all but one of 21 cases from 1985 to 2001 involved white victims.</p> <p>Moore\u2019s team had also made a final appeal to the US supreme court, arguing that prosecutors had unlawfully removed two qualified Black jurors, but the court declined to stop the execution on Thursday.</p> <p>In a clemency <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L48I3-56_xeuVM-G5xRhiK4K80nzi1I6\">video</a> submitted with Moore\u2019s application this week, Jon Ozmint, former head of South Carolina\u2019s corrections department, said he hoped the governor would \u201cgive Richard the rest of his life to continue to pour into the lives of others\u201d. In an earlier letter, Ozmint said he was a proponent of capital punishment and had never recommended reversing a death sentence, but said staff \u201ctrusted\u201d Moore as a \u201creliable and respected\u201d man on death row.</p> <p>\u201cCommutation would have a positive influence on hundreds of offenders who would be impacted by Richard\u2019s story of redemption and his positive example,\u201d Ozmint wrote.</p> <p>Gary Clary, the former circuit judge who imposed Moore\u2019s death sentence, wrote to McMaster on Wednesday, saying he\u2019d \u201cstudied the case of each person who resides on death row in South Carolina\u201d and that Moore\u2019s case was \u201cunique\u201d: \u201cAfter years of thought and reflection, I humbly ask that you grant executive clemency to Mr Moore as an act of grace and mercy.\u201d</p> <p>Three jurors wrote that they supported commutation based on Moore\u2019s rehabilitation. Thousands signed <a href=\"https://scheerpost.com/2024/10/27/richard-moore-is-to-be-executed-nov-1-a-former-state-supreme-court-justice-former-corrections-department-chief-and-jurors-are-among-thousands-advocating-for-his-clemency/\">petitions</a> to halt the execution.</p> <p>Lindsey Vann, Moore\u2019s attorney of 10 years, said she wasn\u2019t aware of any other South Carolina case under the modern death penalty in which a judge who imposed the sentence backed clemency. She said on Thursday that Moore had tried to remain optimistic: \u201cHe\u2019s grateful for all of the support, so that brings him some hope \u2026 but there are obviously difficult conversations, talking to people for what might be the last time.\u201d</p> <p>Moore had<strong> </strong>remained close to his two children, who had been visiting him behind glass since they were young. His daughter, Alexandria Moore, 31, recalled him teaching Spanish and creating puzzles through letters when she was a kid and said he\u2019d become a beloved grandfather to her two daughters, telling the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/richard-moore-south-carolina-execution\">Guardian</a> last week: \u201cI will always be a daddy\u2019s girl \u2026 Even with the physical distance, he is very much here and a part of my girls\u2019 lives and my life.\u201d</p> <p>During his incarceration, Moore had<strong> </strong>leaned into faith, focused on painting and become friends with penpals, his lawyers said. His clemency video included a clip of an earlier interview, in which Moore expressed remorse: \u201cThis is definitely a part of my life I wish I could change, because I took a life \u2026 I broke the family of the deceased. I pray for the forgiveness of that particular family.\u201d</p> <p>Protesters gathered outside the Broad River prison in Columbia, leading prayers and <a href=\"https://x.com/PCGreenville/status/1852473564592513118\">holding</a> \u201cSave Richard Moore\u201d and \u201cExecute justice not people\u201d signs.</p> <p>\u201cSouth Carolina\u2019s elected officials do not care about the racism in the death penalty. They are more interested in using the system to win elections,\u201d the Rev Hillary Taylor, director of South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, told the crowd after his execution. </p> <p>South Carolina recently resumed executions after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/18/freddie-owens-south-carolina-execution\">13-year pause</a> due to a lack of lethal injection supplies and challenges to its other proposed methods: electrocution and firing squads. The state restocked pentobarbital, a sedative, after it passed a law to shield the identities of companies supplying the drug, which had feared public backlash.</p> <p>The state supreme court has authorized the scheduling of executions roughly every five weeks, an extraordinary pace that lawyers have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-carolina-executions-pause-death-penalty-0f93ee35d3ccce47e36cf2c6203f6d7f\">argued</a> would strain attorneys representing multiple defendants and risk botched executions due to the rushed process.</p> <p>The first defendant executed last month was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/20/south-carolina-death-row-prisoner-execution\">Khalil Divine Black Sun Allah</a>, 46, who was put to death days after a central witness came forward to say he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/19/south-carolina-execution-freddie-owens\">lied at trial</a> and that Allah was innocent.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like an assembly line. The state is motivated to kill condemned people as quickly as possible, and they do that despite evidence that might change their minds,\u201d said Paul Bowers of the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina.</p>",

To all of my family and friends, new and old, thank you for your love and support.\u201d Justice 360, the non-profit that represented Moore, condemned the execution in a statement, saying it \u201cunderscores the flaws in South Carolina\u2019s death penalty system\u201d: \u201cWho is executed versus who is allowed to live out their lives in prison appears to be based on no more than chance, race, or status. It is intolerable that our State metes out the ultimate punishment in such a haphazard way \u2026 By killing Richard, the State also created more victims. Richard\u2019s children are now fatherless, and his grandchildren will have to grow up without their \u2018Pa Pa\u2019.\u201d Moore was the second person put to death this year in South Carolina, which recently revived executions and is pursuing a rapid spree of killings. The case drew widespread scrutiny over racial bias and doubts about the validity of Moore\u2019s sentence. An all-white jury convicted Moore, who is Black, of an armed robbery and the murder of Mahoney, a white convenience store clerk, 25 years ago. Moore has said the killing was in self-defense. On 16 September 1999, Moore was unarmed when he entered the store where Mahoney was working the counter. There was no footage, so the exact circumstances of the incident are unclear. Moore has said they got into an argument because he was short on change, prompting Mahoney to pull a gun on him. In their scuffle, both men were shot \u2013 Moore in the arm and Mahoney fatally in the chest. Moore took cash from the store. There is no dispute that Moore was unarmed when he arrived. Mahoney carried a gun, and there were two weapons behind the counter. A store witness said he overheard an argument, and then saw Moore with his hands on the clerk\u2019s hands and that Moore fired in his direction. The witness wasn\u2019t hit and said he played dead and didn\u2019t see the rest of the encounter. A forensic investigator hired by Moore\u2019s lawyers reviewed crime scene evidence in 2017 and concluded the first shot had been fired while the two men were fighting over the gun. Moore\u2019s lawyers argued that, regardless of the details of the shootout, he shouldn\u2019t be eligible for capital punishment, reserved for the \u201cworst of the worst\u201d murders, since he entered unarmed and had no premeditated plans for an armed robbery or homicide. In 2022, Kaye Hearn, a state supreme court justice, agreed, writing in a dissenting opinion that the death sentence was \u201cinvalid\u201d, \u201cdisproportionate\u201d and a \u201crelic of a bygone era\u201d. Hearn said it was \u201cstunning\u201d prosecutors couldn\u2019t identify a comparable death penalty case involving a robbery that began unarmed and noted that Spartanburg county, where Moore was prosecuted, had a history of \u201calarming\u201d racial disparities in the death penalty; all but one of 21 cases from 1985 to 2001 involved white victims. Moore\u2019s team had also made a final appeal to the US supreme court, arguing that prosecutors had unlawfully removed two qualified Black jurors, but the court declined to stop the execution on Thursday. In a clemency video submitted with Moore\u2019s application this week, Jon Ozmint, former head of South Carolina\u2019s corrections department, said he hoped the governor would \u201cgive Richard the rest of his life to continue to pour into the lives of others\u201d. In an earlier letter, Ozmint said he was a proponent of capital punishment and had never recommended reversing a death sentence, but said staff \u201ctrusted\u201d Moore as a \u201creliable and respected\u201d man on death row. \u201cCommutation would have a positive influence on hundreds of offenders who would be impacted by Richard\u2019s story of redemption and his positive example,\u201d Ozmint wrote. Gary Clary, the former circuit judge who imposed Moore\u2019s death sentence, wrote to McMaster on Wednesday, saying he\u2019d \u201cstudied the case of each person who resides on death row in South Carolina\u201d and that Moore\u2019s case was \u201cunique\u201d: \u201cAfter years of thought and reflection, I humbly ask that you grant executive clemency to Mr Moore as an act of grace and mercy.\u201d Three jurors wrote that they supported commutation based on Moore\u2019s rehabilitation. Thousands signed petitions to halt the execution. Lindsey Vann, Moore\u2019s attorney of 10 years, said she wasn\u2019t aware of any other South Carolina case under the modern death penalty in which a judge who imposed the sentence backed clemency. She said on Thursday that Moore had tried to remain optimistic: \u201cHe\u2019s grateful for all of the support, so that brings him some hope \u2026 but there are obviously difficult conversations, talking to people for what might be the last time.\u201d Moore had remained close to his two children, who had been visiting him behind glass since they were young. His daughter, Alexandria Moore, 31, recalled him teaching Spanish and creating puzzles through letters when she was a kid and said he\u2019d become a beloved grandfather to her two daughters, telling the Guardian last week: \u201cI will always be a daddy\u2019s girl \u2026 Even with the physical distance, he is very much here and a part of my girls\u2019 lives and my life.\u201d During his incarceration, Moore had leaned into faith, focused on painting and become friends with penpals, his lawyers said. His clemency video included a clip of an earlier interview, in which Moore expressed remorse: \u201cThis is definitely a part of my life I wish I could change, because I took a life \u2026 I broke the family of the deceased. I pray for the forgiveness of that particular family.\u201d Protesters gathered outside the Broad River prison in Columbia, leading prayers and holding \u201cSave Richard Moore\u201d and \u201cExecute justice not people\u201d signs. \u201cSouth Carolina\u2019s elected officials do not care about the racism in the death penalty. They are more interested in using the system to win elections,\u201d the Rev Hillary Taylor, director of South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, told the crowd after his execution. South Carolina recently resumed executions after a 13-year pause due to a lack of lethal injection supplies and challenges to its other proposed methods: electrocution and firing squads. The state restocked pentobarbital, a sedative, after it passed a law to shield the identities of companies supplying the drug, which had feared public backlash. The state supreme court has authorized the scheduling of executions roughly every five weeks, an extraordinary pace that lawyers have argued would strain attorneys representing multiple defendants and risk botched executions due to the rushed process. The first defendant executed last month was Khalil Divine Black Sun Allah, 46, who was put to death days after a central witness came forward to say he had lied at trial and that Allah was innocent. \u201cIt\u2019s like an assembly line. The state is motivated to kill condemned people as quickly as possible, and they do that despite evidence that might change their minds,\u201d said Paul Bowers of the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina.",
