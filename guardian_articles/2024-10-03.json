It\u2019s something we\u2019ll keep a close eye on .\u201d</p> <p>Carbon capture technology works by trapping emissions from power plants or factories before the emissions enter the atmosphere and contribute to the climate crisis. The emissions will be transported via gas pipes to be stored beneath the seabed.</p> <p>Keir Starmer said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement will give industry the certainty it needs \u2013 committing to 25 years of funding in this groundbreaking technology \u2013 to help deliver jobs, kickstart growth, and repair this country once and for all.\u201d</p> <p>Officials expect the projects to attract private sector investment of about \u00a38bn while directly creating 4,000 jobs and supporting 50,000 jobs in the long term.</p> <p>The East Coast Cluster is backed by oil companies including BP and Equinor. The HyNet North West project is being developed by the Italian oil company Eni.</p> <p>Using CCS to produce \u201cblue hydrogen\u201d or to run gas power plants is controversial among green groups <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/25/climate-scientists-call-on-labour-to-pause-1bn-investment-plans-carbon-capture-blue-hydrogen\">and some climate researchers</a> because it requires a steady supply of fossil gas, which produces emissions that are not captured when it is extracted and transported.</p> <p>Instead, the government should invest more in clean power sources and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/27/the-guardian-view-on-hydrogen-hype-its-perhaps-not-as-green-as-you-think\">green hydrogen</a>\u201d, which is made from water and renewable electricity using a device called an electrolyser, according to campaigners.</p> <p>Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cFor a government that is committed to tackling the climate crisis, \u00a322bn is a lot of money to spend on something that is going to extend the life of planet-heating oil and gas production.</p> <p>\u201cCarbon capture may be needed for hard-to-abate sectors, such as cement production, however, hydrogen derived from gas is not low-carbon and there is a risk of locking ourselves into second-rate solutions.\u201d </p> <p>Lorenzo Sani, an analyst at Carbon Tracker, a climate thinktank, told the Guardian the government\u2019s decision \u201crepeats the mistakes of the previous administration\u201d by committing new funding without first reassessing its CCS strategy.</p> <p>Sani said the plan \u201cremains anchored in outdated and overly optimistic [cost] assumptions\u201d, which risk \u201csquandering even more taxpayer money on carbon capture projects that are both high risk and not future proof\u201d.</p> <p>Dr Andrew Boswell, an independent researcher into the CCS industry, dismissed the investment as a \u201cmassive giveaway to the fossil fuel industry\u201d and a \u201cbad decision\u201d for bills, energy security and the planet.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s initial attempt to establish a carbon capture industry began in 2009 under a Labour government. But after the Conservative victory in 2010 the \u00a31bn funding plan faltered and was scrapped in 2015. The Conservatives went on to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/19/two-north-of-england-sites-selected-uk-carbon-capture-plan\">shortlist the two CCS projects</a> for funding in 2021 but did not commit to the investment before they were voted out of power in July.</p> <p>Miliband said: \u201cI was proud to kickstart the industry in 2009, and I am even prouder today to turn it into reality.</p> <p>\u201cOn Monday, 150 years of coal in this country came to an end. Today, a new era begins. By securing this investment, we pave the way for securing the clean energy revolution that will rebuild Britain\u2019s industrial heartlands.\u201d</p>",

The government hopes the investment will reignite Britain\u2019s struggling heavy industry by funding two major carbon capture and storage (CCS) clusters; one in Teesside in north east England, and a second in north-west England and north Wales. The technology is controversial because it has never been used at commercial scale in the UK before, while environmental campaigners have warned big energy firms could use it to extend the life of their fossil fuel assets. Greenpeace said there was a danger the government was \u201clocking ourselves into second-rate solutions\u201d. However, ministers and officials expect it to play a major role in the government\u2019s climate ambitions as a vital way to reach net zero. The prime minister will say the commitment had helped to bring in an expected \u00a38bn of private investment by some of the world\u2019s biggest energy companies, including BP and Norwegian energy company Equinor. Reeves\u2019 comments come after she hinted in her speech to Labour\u2019s party conference in Liverpool last week that she would change the government\u2019s fiscal rules to allow billions of pounds more in capital spending. \u201cWe\u2019ll set out details of the fiscal rules at the budget, but we have got to make sure we unlock that space for capital investment,\u201d she told journalists ahead of Friday\u2019s announcement. Friday\u2019s announcement comes amid fears of a fresh energy price shock triggered by an escalating Middle East conflict. Reeves issued a warning that Britain would not be immune to the fallout from spiralling oil prices, which rose 5% on Thursday, although cautioned that the response so far on financial markets had been muted. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk both on inflation and on GDP. It\u2019s something we\u2019ll keep a close eye on .\u201d Carbon capture technology works by trapping emissions from power plants or factories before the emissions enter the atmosphere and contribute to the climate crisis. The emissions will be transported via gas pipes to be stored beneath the seabed. Keir Starmer said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement will give industry the certainty it needs \u2013 committing to 25 years of funding in this groundbreaking technology \u2013 to help deliver jobs, kickstart growth, and repair this country once and for all.\u201d Officials expect the projects to attract private sector investment of about \u00a38bn while directly creating 4,000 jobs and supporting 50,000 jobs in the long term. The East Coast Cluster is backed by oil companies including BP and Equinor. The HyNet North West project is being developed by the Italian oil company Eni. Using CCS to produce \u201cblue hydrogen\u201d or to run gas power plants is controversial among green groups and some climate researchers because it requires a steady supply of fossil gas, which produces emissions that are not captured when it is extracted and transported. Instead, the government should invest more in clean power sources and \u201cgreen hydrogen\u201d, which is made from water and renewable electricity using a device called an electrolyser, according to campaigners. Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cFor a government that is committed to tackling the climate crisis, \u00a322bn is a lot of money to spend on something that is going to extend the life of planet-heating oil and gas production. \u201cCarbon capture may be needed for hard-to-abate sectors, such as cement production, however, hydrogen derived from gas is not low-carbon and there is a risk of locking ourselves into second-rate solutions.\u201d Lorenzo Sani, an analyst at Carbon Tracker, a climate thinktank, told the Guardian the government\u2019s decision \u201crepeats the mistakes of the previous administration\u201d by committing new funding without first reassessing its CCS strategy. Sani said the plan \u201cremains anchored in outdated and overly optimistic [cost] assumptions\u201d, which risk \u201csquandering even more taxpayer money on carbon capture projects that are both high risk and not future proof\u201d. Dr Andrew Boswell, an independent researcher into the CCS industry, dismissed the investment as a \u201cmassive giveaway to the fossil fuel industry\u201d and a \u201cbad decision\u201d for bills, energy security and the planet. Britain\u2019s initial attempt to establish a carbon capture industry began in 2009 under a Labour government. But after the Conservative victory in 2010 the \u00a31bn funding plan faltered and was scrapped in 2015. The Conservatives went on to shortlist the two CCS projects for funding in 2021 but did not commit to the investment before they were voted out of power in July. Miliband said: \u201cI was proud to kickstart the industry in 2009, and I am even prouder today to turn it into reality. \u201cOn Monday, 150 years of coal in this country came to an end. Today, a new era begins. By securing this investment, we pave the way for securing the clean energy revolution that will rebuild Britain\u2019s industrial heartlands.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Salah sizes up new-look Palace defence</h2> <p>Liverpool have not lost at Selhurst Park since November 2014, when Dwight Gayle opened the scoring in a 3-1 win for a side then managed by Neil Warnock. But their title challenge under J\u00fcrgen Klopp wavered last season after losing at Anfield in April to a goal from Eberechi Eze, so Arne Slot will be wary of facing a Crystal Palace team that have yet to record a victory in the Premier League this season. Fresh from his brilliant goal against Bologna in the Champions League, Mohamed Salah will be licking his lips at the prospect of facing a new-look Palace defence that has not looked convincing this season despite a 0-0 draw against Manchester United in their last home match. The Egyptian scored his 200th Liverpool goal against them in December to take his tally to eight in just 11 appearances, not to mention seven assists. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Crystal Palace v Liverpool, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Havertz aiming for Van Persie\u2019s record</h2> <p>At least Kai Havertz is honest. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice feeling but it would be even nicer if I can do it with Arsenal and it would mean a lot more,\u201d said the Germany forward when asked about winning the Champions League during his stint at Chelsea. After his goal against Paris Saint-Germain in midweek set up a comfortable win, Havertz has the perfect opportunity to match Robin van Persie\u2019s record of scoring in seven successive games at the Emirates Stadium when Arsenal face struggling Southampton on Saturday. His burgeoning partnership with Leandro Trossard has made up for the absence of Martin \u00d8degaard in recent weeks as Mikel Arteta\u2019s team have shown their adaptability during a testing run of fixtures at home and in Europe. <strong>EA</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Arsenal v Southampton, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>O\u2019Neil finds himself in another dogfight</h2> <p>Wolves\u2019s rock-bottom start can be seen in both a positive and negative light. The sight of an aghast Gary O\u2019Neil has become a meme but, beyond the results, his team have often played well. Even in the 6-2 defeat by Chelsea, Wolves entered the break level at 2-2 having been the better and more dangerous team. After that \u2013 and here\u2019s where the negatives start \u2013 the individual mistakes began to multiply. A similar pattern followed against Liverpool last Saturday. The new league leaders escaped Molineux with no little relief, thankful that N\u00e9lson Semedo pulled down Diogo Jota in the box straight after Rayan A\u00eft-Nouri\u2019s well-earned equaliser. O\u2019Neil\u2019s reputation was won in pulling Bournemouth and then Wolves from relegation dogfights but he is now attempting to refine his approach. His current team, shorn of Max Kilman and Pedro Neto, try to play the ball out from defence. It\u2019s there the repeated mistakes have been made. Would a more direct approach work against Brentford? Thomas Frank\u2019s team regularly delight in pressing high to pick dallying defenders\u2019 pockets. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Brentford v Wolves, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Hermansen needs help in Foxes goal</h2> <p>After they let Everton shoot 17 times at goal a fortnight ago, Leicester allowed 36 shots to rain down on their goalkeeper, Mads Hermansen, at the Emirates last week. Yes, it was away at title-contending Arsenal; yes, the visitors nearly clinched an unlikely point regardless; but Steve Cooper\u2019s winless side must ensure this isn\u2019t a blueprint for their season. \u201cI must admit, it was a bit too much,\u201d said Hermansen after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/28/arsenal-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">the Arsenal defeat</a>. \u201cNo matter who you play, [36 shots] is simply too much. We have to look at what we can improve and try to do better for the future.\u201d As they welcome Bournemouth, and the red-hot Antoine Semenyo in particular, this weekend, they must tighten up. The match kicks off a vital period for Leicester, who also face Southampton, Nottingham Forest and Ipswich in the next month. <strong>Dominic Booth</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Leicester v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Who next in the Rodri role?</h2> <p>To fill the Rodri void Pep Guardiola has so far chosen Nico O\u2019Reilly, in the Carabao Cup versus Watford, and the double pivots of Rico Lewis and Mateo Kovacic (Premier League, Newcastle) and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Matheus Nunes (Champions League, Slovan Bratislava). For Fulham\u2019s visit we will see part four of the manager\u2019s solution to the one position for which he has failed to find a natural high-class deputy. Perhaps John Stones will get the chance he declared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/30/john-stones-100-ready-to-take-rodris-midfield-spot-in-manchester-city-team\">being \u201c100% ready\u201d</a> to take should his manager so choose, though stepping into midfield from defence when in possession is a different game to being Guardiola\u2019s on-field general. Phil Foden was the player of the match in Tuesday\u2019s 4-0 win in Bratislava in a first start of the campaign and showed both understandable rustiness and enduring class. Unlike the Rodri conundrum, Foden is as natural a playmaker as Kevin De Bruyne so, while the Belgian remains an injury doubt, the younger man\u2019s presence means no loss of quality. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Manchester City v Fulham, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Lopetegui must iron out Hammers\u2019 issues</h2> <p>A fourth straight home defeat would go a considerable distance to condemning Julen Lopetegui\u2019s West Ham regime. Adventurous, exciting yet porous Ipswich, meanwhile, seek to end their winless run since they returned to the top division; none of the promoted teams has secured a win. The East End grapevine has been hot this week with talk of a dispute between Lopetegui and Mohammed Kudus, hooked at half-time at Brentford last week. If West Ham tradition dictates flair players ought to be handed freedom, Lopetegui is not such a coach. Lucas Paquet\u00e1 has been similarly lacking in influence and application, so too Jarrod Bowen. The Hammers were much more effective at Brentford once Lopetegui added defensive muscle, Konstantinos Mavropanos delivering a barnstorming showing at full-back. Max Kilman, the defender Lopetegui demanded his new club sign from his former club Wolves, still has some bedding in to do, but retains the confidence of his manager. Lopetegui will not be panicking yet but the lack of flair in his go-to footballing style is where long-term trouble may lie. <strong>JB</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>West Ham v Ipswich, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>All eyes on Gordon at old stomping ground</h2> <p>The spotlight remains on Anthony Gordon not simply because the pantomime villain role awaits on his return to Goodison Park. The jeers would have been much louder had the former Everton winger returned in the red of Liverpool, as was discussed briefly this summer. Gordon embodied the improvement that Eddie Howe had called for when Newcastle produced their best display of the season in last weekend\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/28/newcastle-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">draw with Manchester City</a>, looking fitter, pressing high to telling effect and, as Pep Guardiola put it, being part of a team that were \u201cimpossible to contain\u201d for 90 minutes. And doing so in an unaccustomed centre-forward role. With Alexander Isak still doubtful for the trip to Goodison the 23-year-old may be tasked with those duties again against his former club. His impact against an Everton defence that may again be missing the influential Jarrad Branthwaite through injury could prove instrumental in Newcastle\u2019s mission to build on the City performance and atone for their last away outing at Fulham. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Everton v Newcastle, Saturday 5.30pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>United visit Villa Park in need of solace</h2> <p>Great terabytes of internet wailing followed Manchester United\u2019s latest Sunday of shame. How to fix the unfixable theatre of (still) broken dreams? Ad infinitum. This week has allowed them to return to places that recall happier days in the club\u2019s history: Porto, where they just about managed a draw, and Villa Park. On Sunday, they face Unai Emery, a manager who has beaten them with three different clubs. Most famously, Emery\u2019s Villarreal denied Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r in the 2021 Europa League final, and there was a 2-0 win for Arsenal in March 2019. His first game in charge of Villa, in November 2022, was a 3-1 victory to prelude the fine job he has done since. And yet, since then, while other opponents\u2019 taming of United is no longer shocking, Villa have lost their past four matches to Erik ten Hag\u2019s side. United\u2019s 3-2 Boxing Day win last season, a dramatic comeback, was their first under the co-ownership of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, a new dawn that has already faded into the latest long, dark United night. Their 2-1 win at Villa Park in February came via the now discarded rescue specialist Scott McTominay. <strong>JB</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Aston Villa v Manchester United, Sunday 2pm</em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Chelsea\u2019s English trio can boost Carsley</h2> <p>While criticism of Todd Boehly\u2019s chaotic running of Chelsea was (and still is) certainly not without warrant \u2013 and praise for Enzo Maresca\u2019s in-form team remains a tad premature \u2013 the Blues are fast becoming one of the Premier League\u2019s must-watch sides. A key reason for that is the exciting all-English attacking midfield trio that is steadily flourishing under Maresca. To have Cole Palmer flanked by Jadon Sancho and Noni Madueke is to boast an enviable triumvirate, blessed with a near-perfect blend of pace, poise and unfathomable talent. With nine goals and seven assists between them in the league this season, the numbers bode well for Boehly, as well as for the interim England manager, Lee Carsley. Maresca\u2019s main problem could be keeping his other attacking players happy while they huddle together on the bench. <strong>DB</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Chelsea v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>H\u00fcrzeler puzzles over defensive riddle</h2> <p>Confirmation that Jan Paul van Hecke is facing an extended period on the sidelines was the news Brighton didn\u2019t want to hear after their defensive problems against Chelsea last week. The Netherlands international had been called up by Ronald Koeman for the Nations League but withdrew owing to a groin problem that may keep him out until the end of November. That means Fabian H\u00fcrzeler must decide whether to stick with Adam Webster \u2013 who was badly at fault for Cole Palmer\u2019s first goal at Stamford Bridge \u2013 or turn to Igor to partner Lewis Dunk at the back against Tottenham. With Ange Postecoglou\u2019s side also renowned for their tendency to play with a high defensive line, there should be plenty of goals at the Amex. <strong>EA</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Brighton v Tottenham, Sunday 4.30pm</em></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/100\"> <table

      "bodyText": "Salah sizes up new-look Palace defence Liverpool have not lost at Selhurst Park since November 2014, when Dwight Gayle opened the scoring in a 3-1 win for a side then managed by Neil Warnock. But their title challenge under J\u00fcrgen Klopp wavered last season after losing at Anfield in April to a goal from Eberechi Eze, so Arne Slot will be wary of facing a Crystal Palace team that have yet to record a victory in the Premier League this season. Fresh from his brilliant goal against Bologna in the Champions League, Mohamed Salah will be licking his lips at the prospect of facing a new-look Palace defence that has not looked convincing this season despite a 0-0 draw against Manchester United in their last home match. The Egyptian scored his 200th Liverpool goal against them in December to take his tally to eight in just 11 appearances, not to mention seven assists. Ed Aarons Crystal Palace v Liverpool, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST) Havertz aiming for Van Persie\u2019s record At least Kai Havertz is honest. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice feeling but it would be even nicer if I can do it with Arsenal and it would mean a lot more,\u201d said the Germany forward when asked about winning the Champions League during his stint at Chelsea. After his goal against Paris Saint-Germain in midweek set up a comfortable win, Havertz has the perfect opportunity to match Robin van Persie\u2019s record of scoring in seven successive games at the Emirates Stadium when Arsenal face struggling Southampton on Saturday. His burgeoning partnership with Leandro Trossard has made up for the absence of Martin \u00d8degaard in recent weeks as Mikel Arteta\u2019s team have shown their adaptability during a testing run of fixtures at home and in Europe. EA Arsenal v Southampton, Saturday 3pm O\u2019Neil finds himself in another dogfight Wolves\u2019s rock-bottom start can be seen in both a positive and negative light. The sight of an aghast Gary O\u2019Neil has become a meme but, beyond the results, his team have often played well. Even in the 6-2 defeat by Chelsea, Wolves entered the break level at 2-2 having been the better and more dangerous team. After that \u2013 and here\u2019s where the negatives start \u2013 the individual mistakes began to multiply. A similar pattern followed against Liverpool last Saturday. The new league leaders escaped Molineux with no little relief, thankful that N\u00e9lson Semedo pulled down Diogo Jota in the box straight after Rayan A\u00eft-Nouri\u2019s well-earned equaliser. O\u2019Neil\u2019s reputation was won in pulling Bournemouth and then Wolves from relegation dogfights but he is now attempting to refine his approach. His current team, shorn of Max Kilman and Pedro Neto, try to play the ball out from defence. It\u2019s there the repeated mistakes have been made. Would a more direct approach work against Brentford? Thomas Frank\u2019s team regularly delight in pressing high to pick dallying defenders\u2019 pockets. John Brewin Brentford v Wolves, Saturday 3pm Hermansen needs help in Foxes goal After they let Everton shoot 17 times at goal a fortnight ago, Leicester allowed 36 shots to rain down on their goalkeeper, Mads Hermansen, at the Emirates last week. Yes, it was away at title-contending Arsenal; yes, the visitors nearly clinched an unlikely point regardless; but Steve Cooper\u2019s winless side must ensure this isn\u2019t a blueprint for their season. \u201cI must admit, it was a bit too much,\u201d said Hermansen after the Arsenal defeat. \u201cNo matter who you play, [36 shots] is simply too much. We have to look at what we can improve and try to do better for the future.\u201d As they welcome Bournemouth, and the red-hot Antoine Semenyo in particular, this weekend, they must tighten up. The match kicks off a vital period for Leicester, who also face Southampton, Nottingham Forest and Ipswich in the next month. Dominic Booth Leicester v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm Who next in the Rodri role? To fill the Rodri void Pep Guardiola has so far chosen Nico O\u2019Reilly, in the Carabao Cup versus Watford, and the double pivots of Rico Lewis and Mateo Kovacic (Premier League, Newcastle) and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Matheus Nunes (Champions League, Slovan Bratislava). For Fulham\u2019s visit we will see part four of the manager\u2019s solution to the one position for which he has failed to find a natural high-class deputy. Perhaps John Stones will get the chance he declared being \u201c100% ready\u201d to take should his manager so choose, though stepping into midfield from defence when in possession is a different game to being Guardiola\u2019s on-field general. Phil Foden was the player of the match in Tuesday\u2019s 4-0 win in Bratislava in a first start of the campaign and showed both understandable rustiness and enduring class. Unlike the Rodri conundrum, Foden is as natural a playmaker as Kevin De Bruyne so, while the Belgian remains an injury doubt, the younger man\u2019s presence means no loss of quality. Jamie Jackson Manchester City v Fulham, Saturday 3pm Lopetegui must iron out Hammers\u2019 issues A fourth straight home defeat would go a considerable distance to condemning Julen Lopetegui\u2019s West Ham regime. Adventurous, exciting yet porous Ipswich, meanwhile, seek to end their winless run since they returned to the top division; none of the promoted teams has secured a win. The East End grapevine has been hot this week with talk of a dispute between Lopetegui and Mohammed Kudus, hooked at half-time at Brentford last week. If West Ham tradition dictates flair players ought to be handed freedom, Lopetegui is not such a coach. Lucas Paquet\u00e1 has been similarly lacking in influence and application, so too Jarrod Bowen. The Hammers were much more effective at Brentford once Lopetegui added defensive muscle, Konstantinos Mavropanos delivering a barnstorming showing at full-back. Max Kilman, the defender Lopetegui demanded his new club sign from his former club Wolves, still has some bedding in to do, but retains the confidence of his manager. Lopetegui will not be panicking yet but the lack of flair in his go-to footballing style is where long-term trouble may lie. JB West Ham v Ipswich, Saturday 3pm All eyes on Gordon at old stomping ground The spotlight remains on Anthony Gordon not simply because the pantomime villain role awaits on his return to Goodison Park. The jeers would have been much louder had the former Everton winger returned in the red of Liverpool, as was discussed briefly this summer. Gordon embodied the improvement that Eddie Howe had called for when Newcastle produced their best display of the season in last weekend\u2019s draw with Manchester City, looking fitter, pressing high to telling effect and, as Pep Guardiola put it, being part of a team that were \u201cimpossible to contain\u201d for 90 minutes. And doing so in an unaccustomed centre-forward role. With Alexander Isak still doubtful for the trip to Goodison the 23-year-old may be tasked with those duties again against his former club. His impact against an Everton defence that may again be missing the influential Jarrad Branthwaite through injury could prove instrumental in Newcastle\u2019s mission to build on the City performance and atone for their last away outing at Fulham. Andy Hunter Everton v Newcastle, Saturday 5.30pm United visit Villa Park in need of solace Great terabytes of internet wailing followed Manchester United\u2019s latest Sunday of shame. How to fix the unfixable theatre of (still) broken dreams? Ad infinitum. This week has allowed them to return to places that recall happier days in the club\u2019s history: Porto, where they just about managed a draw, and Villa Park. On Sunday, they face Unai Emery, a manager who has beaten them with three different clubs. Most famously, Emery\u2019s Villarreal denied Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r in the 2021 Europa League final, and there was a 2-0 win for Arsenal in March 2019. His first game in charge of Villa, in November 2022, was a 3-1 victory to prelude the fine job he has done since. And yet, since then, while other opponents\u2019 taming of United is no longer shocking, Villa have lost their past four matches to Erik ten Hag\u2019s side. United\u2019s 3-2 Boxing Day win last season, a dramatic comeback, was their first under the co-ownership of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, a new dawn that has already faded into the latest long, dark United night. Their 2-1 win at Villa Park in February came via the now discarded rescue specialist Scott McTominay. JB Aston Villa v Manchester United, Sunday 2pm Chelsea\u2019s English trio can boost Carsley While criticism of Todd Boehly\u2019s chaotic running of Chelsea was (and still is) certainly not without warrant \u2013 and praise for Enzo Maresca\u2019s in-form team remains a tad premature \u2013 the Blues are fast becoming one of the Premier League\u2019s must-watch sides. A key reason for that is the exciting all-English attacking midfield trio that is steadily flourishing under Maresca. To have Cole Palmer flanked by Jadon Sancho and Noni Madueke is to boast an enviable triumvirate, blessed with a near-perfect blend of pace, poise and unfathomable talent. With nine goals and seven assists between them in the league this season, the numbers bode well for Boehly, as well as for the interim England manager, Lee Carsley. Maresca\u2019s main problem could be keeping his other attacking players happy while they huddle together on the bench. DB Chelsea v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm H\u00fcrzeler puzzles over defensive riddle Confirmation that Jan Paul van Hecke is facing an extended period on the sidelines was the news Brighton didn\u2019t want to hear after their defensive problems against Chelsea last week. The Netherlands international had been called up by Ronald Koeman for the Nations League but withdrew owing to a groin problem that may keep him out until the end of November. That means Fabian H\u00fcrzeler must decide whether to stick with Adam Webster \u2013 who was badly at fault for Cole Palmer\u2019s first goal at Stamford Bridge \u2013 or turn to Igor to partner Lewis Dunk at the back against Tottenham. With Ange Postecoglou\u2019s side also renowned for their tendency to play with a high defensive line, there should be plenty of goals at the Amex. EA Brighton v Tottenham, Sunday 4.30pm",

      "body": "<p>The Israeli military has ordered evacuations of a Lebanese city and other communities north of a UN-declared buffer zone, signalling that it may widen a ground operation launched earlier this week against Hezbollah.</p> <p>On Thursday, Israel told people to leave Nabatieh, a provincial capital in southern Lebanon, and several towns and villages north of the Litani River, which formed the northern edge of the border zone established by the UN security council after the 2006 war in a resolution that both sides have accused the other of violating.</p> <p>Some zones slated for evacuation are as far as 36 miles (60km) from the contested boundary between Israel and Lebanon, where there have been fierce clashes in recent days. The newly displaced will join more than a million people already on the move, further straining the Lebanese government\u2019s limited resources and contributing to what aid agencies say is an acute humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>The evacuation order came amid rapidly escalating tensions in the north as Hezbollah launched 200 missiles and drones at northern Israel in the space of a day, one of the highest totals of recent days.</p>    <p>While a significant proportion of the munitions appeared to be aimed at areas right on the boundary being used by Israeli troops as gathering points for cross-boundary incursions, Israel\u2019s home command issued new instructions late on Thursday to towns and cities further south into the Galilee to stay close to shelters amid fears of a widening barrage.</p> <p>Israel also continued its air offensive against the militant group, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/israel-strikes-beirut-lebanon-death-toll-hezbollah-war\">hitting targets in Beirut</a> and elsewhere in Lebanon. Multiple airstrikes were heard in the capital from Thursday afternoon until late into the evening, with one reportedly hitting the office of Hezbollah\u2019s media department in Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut.</p> <p>A source close to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah\">Hezbollah</a> told the AFP news agency that Israel had conducted 11 consecutive strikes on the group\u2019s stronghold in the capital\u2019s south on Thursday evening, in one of the most violent raids since Israel intensified its bombardment campaign last week.</p> <p>According to Israeli media, Hachem Safieddine, the presumed next leader of Hezbollah, was the target of the airstrikes on Dahiyeh.</p> <p>On Thursday evening the Israeli military ordered Lebanese civilians near two buildings in Dahiyeh, in the southern suburb of Beirut, to evacuate immediately ahead of airstrikes.</p> <p>Elsewhere, at least 18 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike on the Tulkarm refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said.</p> <p>The Israeli military said in a statement that its air force had killed the head of Hamas\u2019s network in Tulkarm in a strike. It identified him as Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/beirut-zip/giv-4559ucZcDoFPcnzO\" data-alt=\"Beirut map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/beirut-zip/giv-4559ucZcDoFPcnzO\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Earlier, Hezbollah said seven paramedics and rescue workers from its medical arm, the Islamic Health Committee, were killed in a strike on its office in Bashoura. The health ministry said 14 others were wounded.</p> <p>The Lebanese Red Cross said an Israeli strike wounded four of its paramedics as they were evacuating wounded people from the south. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. </p> <p>The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described a dire situation for medics treating casualties, with three dozen health facilities closed in southern Lebanon and five hospitals either partly or fully evacuated in Beirut.</p> <p>\u201cWHO calls for a de-escalation of the conflict, for health care to be protected and not attacked, for access routes to be secured and supplies delivered,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for a ceasefire, a political solution and peace. The best medicine is peace.\u201d</p> <p>The Israeli military said on Thursday that it had struck about 200 Hezbollah targets across Lebanon, including weapons storage facilities and observation posts. It said the strikes killed at least 15 Hezbollah fighters.</p>    <p>Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah after nearly a year of rocket attacks that began on 8 October and that have displaced 60,000 Israelis from communities in the north. </p> <p>There were also reports of strikes by Israeli warplanes in Syria. One in the capital, Damascus, reportedly killed the son-in-law of Hassan Nasrallah, the veteran leader of Hezbollah assassinated in Beirut by an Israeli airstrike on Friday. </p> <p>Israel has struck scores of targets in Syria in recent months, most associated with Hezbollah or Iran. There are reports of a further recent strike by Israel against what may have been a store of weapons destined for Hezbollah in a warehouse near the port of Latakia.</p> <p>Hezbollah is the cornerstone of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/irans-axis-of-resistance-call-for-further-attacks-on-israel\">regional coalition of like-minded armed groups</a> including Hamas, Syrian militias and others. All have launched attacks on Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians, drawing retaliation in a cycle that has repeatedly threatened to set off a wider war.</p> <p>Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen said they had launched two drones at Tel Aviv overnight. The Israeli military said it identified two drones off the coast of the bustling metropolitan area, shooting one of them down, and that the other fell in the Mediterranean Sea.</p> <p>Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles against Israel on Tuesday.

      "bodyText": "The Israeli military has ordered evacuations of a Lebanese city and other communities north of a UN-declared buffer zone, signalling that it may widen a ground operation launched earlier this week against Hezbollah. On Thursday, Israel told people to leave Nabatieh, a provincial capital in southern Lebanon, and several towns and villages north of the Litani River, which formed the northern edge of the border zone established by the UN security council after the 2006 war in a resolution that both sides have accused the other of violating. Some zones slated for evacuation are as far as 36 miles (60km) from the contested boundary between Israel and Lebanon, where there have been fierce clashes in recent days. The newly displaced will join more than a million people already on the move, further straining the Lebanese government\u2019s limited resources and contributing to what aid agencies say is an acute humanitarian crisis. The evacuation order came amid rapidly escalating tensions in the north as Hezbollah launched 200 missiles and drones at northern Israel in the space of a day, one of the highest totals of recent days. While a significant proportion of the munitions appeared to be aimed at areas right on the boundary being used by Israeli troops as gathering points for cross-boundary incursions, Israel\u2019s home command issued new instructions late on Thursday to towns and cities further south into the Galilee to stay close to shelters amid fears of a widening barrage. Israel also continued its air offensive against the militant group, hitting targets in Beirut and elsewhere in Lebanon. Multiple airstrikes were heard in the capital from Thursday afternoon until late into the evening, with one reportedly hitting the office of Hezbollah\u2019s media department in Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut. A source close to Hezbollah told the AFP news agency that Israel had conducted 11 consecutive strikes on the group\u2019s stronghold in the capital\u2019s south on Thursday evening, in one of the most violent raids since Israel intensified its bombardment campaign last week. According to Israeli media, Hachem Safieddine, the presumed next leader of Hezbollah, was the target of the airstrikes on Dahiyeh. On Thursday evening the Israeli military ordered Lebanese civilians near two buildings in Dahiyeh, in the southern suburb of Beirut, to evacuate immediately ahead of airstrikes. Elsewhere, at least 18 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike on the Tulkarm refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said. The Israeli military said in a statement that its air force had killed the head of Hamas\u2019s network in Tulkarm in a strike. It identified him as Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi. Earlier, Hezbollah said seven paramedics and rescue workers from its medical arm, the Islamic Health Committee, were killed in a strike on its office in Bashoura. The health ministry said 14 others were wounded. The Lebanese Red Cross said an Israeli strike wounded four of its paramedics as they were evacuating wounded people from the south. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described a dire situation for medics treating casualties, with three dozen health facilities closed in southern Lebanon and five hospitals either partly or fully evacuated in Beirut. \u201cWHO calls for a de-escalation of the conflict, for health care to be protected and not attacked, for access routes to be secured and supplies delivered,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for a ceasefire, a political solution and peace. The best medicine is peace.\u201d The Israeli military said on Thursday that it had struck about 200 Hezbollah targets across Lebanon, including weapons storage facilities and observation posts. It said the strikes killed at least 15 Hezbollah fighters. Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah after nearly a year of rocket attacks that began on 8 October and that have displaced 60,000 Israelis from communities in the north. There were also reports of strikes by Israeli warplanes in Syria. One in the capital, Damascus, reportedly killed the son-in-law of Hassan Nasrallah, the veteran leader of Hezbollah assassinated in Beirut by an Israeli airstrike on Friday. Israel has struck scores of targets in Syria in recent months, most associated with Hezbollah or Iran. There are reports of a further recent strike by Israel against what may have been a store of weapons destined for Hezbollah in a warehouse near the port of Latakia. Hezbollah is the cornerstone of a regional coalition of like-minded armed groups including Hamas, Syrian militias and others. All have launched attacks on Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians, drawing retaliation in a cycle that has repeatedly threatened to set off a wider war. Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen said they had launched two drones at Tel Aviv overnight. The Israeli military said it identified two drones off the coast of the bustling metropolitan area, shooting one of them down, and that the other fell in the Mediterranean Sea. Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles against Israel on Tuesday. Tehran said the attack was a response the killings of Nasrallah, an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general who was with him, and Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who was killed in an explosion in Tehran in July that was widely blamed on Israel. The Lebanese army said it returned fire after another Lebanese soldier was killed by Israeli artillery fire, marking the first time that the Lebanese army has clashed directly with Israel. Analysts say it is unlikely the incident will lead to further fighting between Israel and the Lebanese army. In recent weeks, Israeli strikes in Lebanon have killed at least 1,276 people, according to Lebanon\u2019s health ministry. Firass Abiad, Lebanon\u2019s health minister, said 97 paramedics and firefighters had been killed and 188 injured since 8 October 2023. He accused Israel of war crimes, arguing that strikes that hit health facilities and workers were in \u201cviolation of international law and treaties\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Erik ten Hag criticised Marcus Rashford for his part in the poor defending that allowed Porto\u2019s opening goal in Manchester United\u2019s 3-3 draw with Porto, but denied the forward was taken off for this at half-time, stating it was simply to rotate his squad. United raced into a 2-0 lead on 20 minutes at Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o through Rashford and Rasmus H\u00f8jlund but let this slip as Pep\u00ea and Samu drew Porto level across seven first-half minutes. Pep\u00ea\u2019s goal derived from a cross along Rashford\u2019s left flank and the manager was asked if this was why he replaced him with Alejandro Garnacho. Ten Hag said: \u201cI have to watch it back and over the left side, definitely we didn\u2019t defend well tonight. Marcus also played a part in this but as I say it had to do with Garnacho coming on \u2013 and nothing against Rashford. We have to rotate.

Your body is the tool you need and if it breaks down it is really difficult but you find your way through it. \u201cPlayers are fortunate now. With me, my career was on the line. Now most of these guys, not all, make enough money to look after themselves for the future. Not that it\u2019s about that, it doesn\u2019t make it feel any better when you\u2019re injured, but it\u2019s worse when you\u2019re injured for that long and you don\u2019t know what is coming next and you are on the breadline. That\u2019s a whole different ball game. But he has had a tough run of it, there is no doubt about that, and on the back of him feeling better about himself. To have this period out has been very challenging for him but whenever I see him he seems to be in good spirits. He\u2019s well aware of the situation.\u201d",

This week, Bruno and Diogo go back home in an effort to find themselves, Erik tries to get out of jail again, and Sir Jim wonders whether he\u2019s made a terrible mistake. Yes, it\u2019s Desolation Street. </p> <p>Or perhaps it\u2019s the road to redemption. Erik ten Hag\u2019s Man United do have it in them to bounce back from a shocker \u2013 they\u2019ve had plenty of practice, after all. And this game looks like an opportunity to play on the counter, which often suits them. Porto have the sort of home record this season that is a distant memory for United fans: played four, won four. Opta\u2019s algorithm gives them a 52pc chance of a win tonight to United\u2019s 23. </p> <p>Porto have two extra incentives. They\u2019re even lower in the Europa League mega-table than United, after losing 3-2 at Bodo/Glimt last week. And they have a score to settle, as the last time they entertained United, in a second leg following a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford, the tie was decided by a screamer from Cristiano Ronaldo. That was a Champions League quarter-final in 2008-09. Those were the days. </p> <p>Kick-off is at 8pm BST and I\u2019ll be back soon with the teams.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Jamie Jackson has filed his match report from the ground, which is my cue to go for a walk round the block and try to work out what on earth just happened. Football, bloody hell. Thanks for your company and correspondence, and sorry I couldn\u2019t get through much of it \u2013 there were far too many goals being scored. Asked why he took Rashford off, Ten Hag springs a surprise. \u201cWe have to rotate,\u201d he says. \u201cGarnacho has to play.. We have a tough game on Sunday [at Villa Park] and we need players fresh.\u201d Yes, but \u2026 Rashford was playing his best football for 18 months. Just as it was bizarre to leave him out at Crystal Palace after he\u2019d scored three goals in two games, so it was weird not to give him another 20 minutes here. He was terrifying his full-back. And here\u2019s Erik ten Hag. \"We started the game very good, we dominated, we scored two goals, but then we lost control. The middle part was not good, the ending very good \u2026 the defending we have to improve.\u201d Here is Harry Maguire, taking questions about what went wrong. \u201cFar too many gaps,\u201d he says, \u201ctoo many crosses coming into the box, and they ultimately punished us for it. We played really well with the ball in the first half, really poor without it.\u201d Asked about United\u2019s habit of conceding twice in quick succession in Europe, he doesn\u2019t dodge the question. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a mental issue I think, it\u2019s about belief. It\u2019s something that we need to be aware of and make sure when we do concede that we stick together and regroup\u2026 I\u2019ve played for this club for six years and I know how it works\u2026 The manager knows how to deal with it. It\u2019s part of the privilege of playing for this club.\u201d In that interview, just like in the box in the 91st minute, Maguire had his head screwed on. Wasn\u2019t expecting this. United\u2019s dressing-room door, according to TNT, is still firmly shut. Is Fernandes getting a lecture on how to be a captain from Maguire? The bad news for Ten Hag fans is that Matthijs de Ligt is struggling, Lisandro Martinez is not the commanding presence he can be, Bruno Fernandes is a 30-year-old behaving like a hot-headed youth, and Marcus Rashford appears to have picked up an injury just as he has returned to form. The good news for Ten Hag fans is that he brought on Maguire, who spared him some of his blushes. The bad news for United fans is that for the third time in four games, they\u2019ve drawn when they should have won. The good news is that they\u2019ve remembered how to score goals. For the first 20 minutes, they were clinical. \u201cYou know who United should get,\u201d says Drew Lundgren. \u201cThat Jadon Sancho. He looks a proper player.\u201d \u201cRed cards,\u201d says Nick Smith. \u201cThe captain needs to have a word with Fernandes\u2026\u201d Ten Hag is a magician in one way. The players he sidelines keep bouncing back and becoming indispensable. There\u2019s hope for Antony yet. So United led 2-0, then went 3-2 down. Bruno Fernandes, the captain Erik ten Hag appointed, went out of his way to collect another red card. Harry Maguire, the captain Ten Hag had harshly demoted, came on and salvaged a point \u2013 and maybe Ten Hag\u2019s job too. Anyone who is allergic to clich\u00e9s may want to look away now. You couldn\u2019t make it up. And that is that. 90+5 min Ten Hag waves his arms as Mazraoui waits to take a throw-in. United win a free kick \u2013 but \u2026 90+4 min Porto come again. Evans responds with a fine header under pressure \u2013 and gets clattered. 90+3 min There are still two more minutes, maybe three in the light of the goal. Garnacho won the corner by taking yet another shot. Eriksen curled in a great ball and Maguire planted an imperious header in the near corner. He\u2019s done it! 90 min Antony wins a corner. Can Maguire or Evans steal a point? 89 min Porto see off the corner and have the chance to get a fourth \u2026 but now they\u2019re too slow. So slow that they allow Jonny Evans to get back. 88 min United\u2019s success in this game, which seems a long time ago now, came through the pace of Rashford and Hojlund. Without them, they\u2019re relying heavily on Garnacho, who darts in now and draws a good save from Costa. 85 min Christian Eriksen, who seldom completes 90 minutes, is now playing in two positions at once \u2013 his own and Fernandes\u2019. 83 min Big chance for Porto! Galeno (I think) is clean through, but his shot is a poor one and Onana saves without much trouble. Another high boot, another yellow, and Fernandes has his second early bath in five days. This one seems unlikely to be rescinded. 77 min What would you do now, if you were Erik ten Hag? He replaces both his centre-backs, sending on Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans for De Ligt and Martinez. 77 min Subs for Porto. Off goes Samu, who gets a big hand after scoring twice. On comes Fabio Vieira of Arsenal. 74 min Up the other end, Galeno shoots wide. 74 min Garnacho has another go with a volley that doesn\u2019t have the power he is looking for. 72 min Following a United corner, Eriksen picks out De Ligt, whose header is accurate but not threatening. 70 min It\u2019s still end to end. United, sliced open again, are grateful for a flaky shot. Then they attack and Fernandes has a decent chance but can\u2019t keep the shot down. 68 min Yes, it\u2019s Amad coming off. Joshua Zirkzee is coming on too, in place of Hojlund, who made his first start of the season and scored his first goal. 67 min Antony is about to come on for United, presumably in place of Amad \u2013 unless Ten Hag is sending him to left-back, as he did a couple of times last season. 65 min Chance for Samu! A shemozzle at the back presents him with a shot, which is sharp enough to need tipping round the post by Onana. 64 min United win a corner and then exert some pressure, which is relieved when Martinez balloons a shot. 62 min I may have spoken too soon about Costa (among other things). He sees a shot come in from Mazraoui, gets a feeble palm to it and nearly presents Garnacho with a big chance. 60 min Stat du jour, courtesy of TNT: this is the 24th time, in all comps, that Erik ten Hag\u2019s United have conceded three goals in a game. No Premier League side has managed more in the past 26 months. 57 min It\u2019s still very open. Maybe Porto feel it would be bad manners to sit on their lead, given the way United failed to sit on theirs. 57 min United keep the ball for a while, then Garnacho has a go from distance \u2013 easily saved. They\u2019re playing Costa back into form. 54 min United ease into the box again as Garnacho plays in Eriksen. His cross is too easy for Costa to gather, and for once Eriksen made the wrong choice \u2013 a cutback was the better option. 52 min Chance for United! Fernandes shoots wide, then argues that it should be a corner, not a goal kick. He may be right, but he has to be careful after picking up a yellow. Pepe got away down the right, and Martinez, perhaps still feeling that knock, couldn\u2019t catch him. He crossed for Samu, who was again too good for De Ligt. He slammed the ball into the roof of the net. The comeback is complete! 48 min Save! By Onana, getting down well to tip Moura\u2019s shot round the post \u2013 but United were carved open, in the way that is becoming a trademark. 47 min Yes, it\u2019s Rashford who\u2019s gone off. I hope he\u2019s not badly hurt. Garnacho slots into his place on the left and instantly has a shot from distance, which is blocked. Erik ten Hag is sending his first sub on. It\u2019s Alejandro Garnacho, and it\u2019s not Amad coming off, so maybe Rashford has an injury. He was terrific while he lasted. Top marks for entertainment. Correction! The email about Desolation Row (19:56) came from Richard Hirst, not Krish. Je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9. A half of two halves. United scored twice against the run of play, with a little help from Diogo Costa. And then Porto came roaring back. It\u2019s been highly entertaining and mildly perplexing. 45+2 min Chance for Rashford! He made a fabulous run, but then he kept on running and ended up near the penalty spot, having a shot that was easily blocked. 45+1 min We\u2019re into the first of three added minutes. Martinez seems to be OK. United get forward and Amad tees up Dalot, whose shot sails over the bar. 43 min There\u2019s a pause as Lisandro Martinez is down injured. Talking of United centre-backs \u2026 \u201cI don\u2019t think De Ligt has the physical presence,\u201d says Martin Lancon. \u201cMaguire would have been on top to stop the second Porto goal.\u201d 42 min Half-chance for United! Fernandes plays a handsome chip towards Hojlund and Casemiro, whose point-blank shot is saved. 41 min There was another card in the aftermath of Porto\u2019s second goal \u2013 a yellow for Ruud van Nistelrooy. 39 min De Ligt makes a mistake playing out from the back, but gets away with it. United break with Hojlund out on his own. He could just go for goal but he waits for Amad to join him, then overhits the pass. 37 min Amad wins a corner. United\u2019s spirit is still there, but this is beginning to feel horribly like those Champions League games a year ago, when they seemed hell-bent on losing 4-3. 35 min Samu did very well, nosing his way in front of De Ligt and twisting to plant his header past Onana and under the bar. But United, really? No sooner have they emerged from the crisis than it\u2019s back on. This is becoming ridiculous. 32 min And now Bruno Fernandes gets a card too \u2013 though not a red one. He went into a 50-50 with a high boot. 30 min Casemiro, not for the first time, is shrugged off the ball in midfield. We\u2019ve seen the best and worst of him this evening. Mazraoui bails him out with a good flick-header at the far post, amd then Amad wins a foul and Samu goes into the book, possibly for dissent. 29 min Andre Onana did well to save one header, but couldn\u2019t do anything about the follow-up from Pepe, who reacted faster than Martinez. In the build-up, the defender at fault was Dalot, who was slow to clear a loose ball. Game on! And here it is. 26 min Porto just need to score the next goal. They\u2019re in the box again now, forcing De Ligt to head over his own bar, but they can\u2019t do anything with the resulting corner. 25 min Crisis, what crisis? 23 min Rashford breaks free again and whips in a left-foot cross, or is it a shot? Costa beats it away wiht his biceps. Costa is beaten at his near post again! Hojlund started the move by laying the ball off to Eriksen, who strode into the No 10 zone. He slipped the ball to Rashford, who waited for Hojluind to make his run and then played a simple through ball. Hojlund shot with his left foot, decently enough, but Costa will wonder how he let it past his right hand. And another one! 19 min Porto on the attack again. It comes to nothing but on the evidence so far, I\u2019d be surprised if United kept a clean sheet. 17 min United get a corner, then another. Eriksen takes them a lot better than he did against Spurs on Sunday. Porto\u2019s defenders deal with both, without looking very comfortable. 16 min Close! And Rashford is involved again. Fed by Amad, he curls in a nice little cross which Hojlund could easily have flicked on into the far corner. 14 min Normal service is resumed as Porto work their way down the left. Samu has another shot blocked, then Joao Mario finds Row Z. 10 min United are now knocking the ball around as if the past few weeks had never happened. Their two old gents in midfield did well for the goal too \u2013 Casemiro whipping a crossfield ball to Eriksen, who flicked it on to the left wing. Rashford was about 40 yards out at that stage, but he did the business. That\u2019s four for the season for him, half as many as he managed in the whole of 2023-24. That was vintage Rashford \u2013 bursting between two defenders, then drilling his shot in at the near post. Diogo Costa should have done better, but United won\u2019t care. about that. Against the run of play. 5 min United get forward at last. Casemiro is shoved off the ball rather too easily but the ball falls to Hojlund, who ahsa the chance to tee up Rashford. His pass is a yard or two behind where it needs to be, and the attack peters out. 4 min Samu making trouble in the United box again. He has been the man of the first four minutes. 3 min United deal with the corner comfortably as Bruno Fernandes heads it away, but that\u2019s about the only thing they\u2019ve done right. 2 min And again! Samu is the provider this time, cutting back from the inside-right channel. Galeno\u2019s shot is on target and Onana tips it over. 1 min Porto in the United box already! Their striker Samu gets a shot in, but it\u2019s easily blocked. The players step out into a misty Dragao. Both sides are in their home kit \u2013 Porto in blue-and-white stripes with blue shorts, United in the old red-and-white. An email! \u201cSurely,\u201d says Krish Krishnamoorthy, \u201cyou mean Desolation Row rather than Desolation Street? \u2018They\u2019re selling postcards of the hanging\u2019 might be going a bit far for poor Mr ten Hag, but \u2026\u201d Spurs hold on for another away win. They have six points out of six in the Europa League, as do Lazio and Anderlecht. Which leaves Porto and Man United needing a win all the more. They\u2019re into added time in Spurs\u2019 game at Ferencvaros, and there have just been two late goals. Scott Murray has the details. Say what you like about United, they make a good punchline. Barry Glendenning has some fun at their expense. Porto (probable 4-3-3) Costa; Mario, Pedro, Perez, Moura; Varela, Eustaquio, Gonzalez; Pepe, Omorodion, Galeno. Subs: Ramos, Fernandes, Otavio, Djalo, Grujic, Vieira, Franco, Mora, Sousa, Jaime, Borges, Gul, Namaso. Manchester United (probable 4-2-3-1) Onana; Mazraoui, De Ligt, Martinez, Dalot; Casemiro, Eriksen; Amad, Fernandes, Rashford; H\u00f8jlund. Subs: Bayindir, Heaton, Lindelof, Maguire, Evans, Collyer, Gore, Ugarte, Antony, Garnacho, Zirkzee. Rasmus Hojlund, the only bright light for United in the Champions League last autumn, gets his first start of the season. Erik ten Hag rotates his midfield, replacing Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo with \u2026 Casemiro and Christian Eriksen. The old firm. Evening everyone and welcome to the latest episode of a much-loved soap opera. This week, Bruno and Diogo go back home in an effort to find themselves, Erik tries to get out of jail again, and Sir Jim wonders whether he\u2019s made a terrible mistake. Yes, it\u2019s Desolation Street. Or perhaps it\u2019s the road to redemption. Erik ten Hag\u2019s Man United do have it in them to bounce back from a shocker \u2013 they\u2019ve had plenty of practice, after all. And this game looks like an opportunity to play on the counter, which often suits them. Porto have the sort of home record this season that is a distant memory for United fans: played four, won four. Opta\u2019s algorithm gives them a 52pc chance of a win tonight to United\u2019s 23. Porto have two extra incentives. They\u2019re even lower in the Europa League mega-table than United, after losing 3-2 at Bodo/Glimt last week. And they have a score to settle, as the last time they entertained United, in a second leg following a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford, the tie was decided by a screamer from Cristiano Ronaldo. That was a Champions League quarter-final in 2008-09. Those were the days. Kick-off is at 8pm BST and I\u2019ll be back soon with the teams.",

      "body": "<p>The darkest point is supposedly before dawn. Did Harry Maguire\u2019s late equaliser cast Manchester United\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/29/manchester-united-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">3-0 loss against Tottenham</a> as this? Because beforehand, Erik ten Hag was leading his men into an ever bleaker gloom. From 2-0 up to 2-2 in seven first-half minutes, to allowing a third that seemed to kill off United, then to Bruno Fernandes\u2019s second red card in two matches. This seemed to have Ten Hag\u2019s tenure heading for oblivion.</p> <p>It may still do: the Dutch manager likes to quip he is no Harry Potter. The escape here with a draw has him, for tonight, as Harry Houdini. But for how long can he escape the Sir Jim Ratcliffe axe? It is now only one victory in 10 European outings, so for the next episode of the Ten Hag soap opera tune into United\u2019s trip to Aston Villa on Sunday.

      "bodyText": "The darkest point is supposedly before dawn. Did Harry Maguire\u2019s late equaliser cast Manchester United\u2019s 3-0 loss against Tottenham as this? Because beforehand, Erik ten Hag was leading his men into an ever bleaker gloom. From 2-0 up to 2-2 in seven first-half minutes, to allowing a third that seemed to kill off United, then to Bruno Fernandes\u2019s second red card in two matches. This seemed to have Ten Hag\u2019s tenure heading for oblivion. It may still do: the Dutch manager likes to quip he is no Harry Potter. The escape here with a draw has him, for tonight, as Harry Houdini. But for how long can he escape the Sir Jim Ratcliffe axe? It is now only one victory in 10 European outings, so for the next episode of the Ten Hag soap opera tune into United\u2019s trip to Aston Villa on Sunday. Unlike against Spurs, United had the dream start, thanks to Marcus Rashford. Zigzagging in from the left, his package of pace and tricks took him into Porto\u2019s area.

Joe Biden is \u201cdiscussing\u201d possible Israeli plans to attack Iran\u2019s oil industry, bringing a warning from Iran that it would make the US a \u201clegitimate target\u201d. Meanwhile, Israel signalled it may widen its ground war in Lebanon. We have an exclusive story this morning about a raid by anti-corruption police on Parliament House in Canberra as part of \u201can ongoing investigation\u201d. Civil liberties experts have criticised \u201cundemocratic\u201d protest laws in NSW, and Britain is handing back its last African colony.

Exclusive | Officers from the National Anti-Corruption Commission have conducted a raid at Parliament House as part of an ongoing operation that does not involve any current or former member of parliament. \u2018Undemocratic\u2019 NSW | Protest organisers in NSW would be much less likely to end up fighting police in court for permission to hold rallies if the state had a charter of human rights instead of its \u201cundemocratic\u201d approvals system, a legal expert says. Voice recognition | An Indigenous voice is \u201can idea whose time will come\u201d because without a consultation body governments will struggle to create effective policies, the Uluru statement from the heart architect Megan Davis has argued.

We assess the risks for the Israelis if they decide to retaliate against Iran. Israel has ordered the evacuation of the southern Lebanese city of Nabatieh in a sign that it may widen a ground operation launched this week against Hezbollah. Lebanese medics are fearing for their lives after more than 50 have been killed in Israeli bombings. And a 21-year-old Yazidi woman kidnapped by Islamic State militants in Iraq more than a decade ago has been freed from Gaza in an operation led by the US. \u2018No compromise\u2019 | Melania Trump doubled down in her first public response to news of her passionate support for abortion rights. But it\u2019s not clear whether she is trying to help or hurt her husband. She also claims in a new memoir that she had forced Trump to drop his hardline immigration policy while in office. Breakthrough bill | A bill to introduce assisted dying in England and Wales will come before parliament this month, giving MPs their first chance to vote on the controversial and divisive issue for almost a decade. \u2018Flesh-eating\u2019 injection | A GP worried about his inheritance disguised himself as a nurse and injected deadly flesh-eating poison into his victim, who thought he was getting a home-visit Covid booster, a British court has heard.

According to the website TransferRoom, their squad is worth roughly the same as the other 35 clubs who are taking part in this season\u2019s Conference League and they began the group stages as heavy favourites to go all the way to the final in Wroclaw.</p> <p>Gent have played in every edition of this tournament since it was introduced by Uefa in 2021.</p>    <p>Wouter Vrancken\u2019s side have battled through three qualifying rounds to reach this stage after finishing seventh in the Belgian league and included two players with famous fathers in their starting lineup.

Dewsbury-Hall should have doubled the lead when Neto wiggled away from his marker and squared the ball into the midfielder\u2019s path but he shot just wide.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/03/ferencvaros-tottenham-europa-league-match-report\">Sarr and Johnson on target as Spurs hold on to Europa League win at Ferencvaros</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gent\u2019s first sight of goal came just after the half hour mark when Archie Brown, a product of Derby\u2019s academy who plays for England\u2019s Under-20 side, drew Filip J\u00f6rgensen into a save after a quick break. But their vociferous travelling support could not believe it when Gudjohnsen fired inches over with a powerful drive that would have left the Chelsea goalkeeper with no chance.</p> <p>Barely 30 seconds had elapsed since the restart when Neto took advantage of a moment\u2019s hesitation between Hugo Gambor and Tsuyoshi Watanabe to lash home Chelsea\u2019s second goal after a long ball from captain Axel Disasi. But Gent hit back immediately when the Japan defender rose above Beno\u00eet Badiashile and headed in Gudjohnsen\u2019s cross to the delight of the fans behind J\u00f6rgensen\u2019s goal.</p> <p>Chelsea were forced to go on the attack again and Nkunku celebrated being called up by France by making Gent pay for failing to clear a corner when he lashed home from inside the area. Dewsbury-Hall removed any lingering doubts about the result when he raced onto Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix\u2019s through ball to score Chelsea\u2019s fourth and his first since following Maresca from Leicester. \u201cI know that he needed that \u2013 it\u2019s never easy when you join a new club,\u201d said the Chelsea manager.</p> <p>To their credit, Gent continued to attack and a brilliant run from Brown saw the 22-year-old almost pull one back late on before substitute Omri Gandelman grabbed a late consolation that did little to dampen the home crowd\u2019s enthusiasm.</p>",

We are happy,\u201d said Maresca. \u201cThe last three or four games we have shown a real purpose but we can still do many things better in attack and defence.\u201d Even with 11 changes from their impressive win over Brighton here last weekend, the Chelsea manager was able to name a forward line that cost \u00a3200m to assemble. According to the website TransferRoom, their squad is worth roughly the same as the other 35 clubs who are taking part in this season\u2019s Conference League and they began the group stages as heavy favourites to go all the way to the final in Wroclaw. Gent have played in every edition of this tournament since it was introduced by Uefa in 2021. Wouter Vrancken\u2019s side have battled through three qualifying rounds to reach this stage after finishing seventh in the Belgian league and included two players with famous fathers in their starting lineup. Eidur Gudjohnsen was in the stands to watch his son, 22-year-old striker Andri, almost score against his former club, while Noah Fadiga also did his father \u2013 the Bolton and Senegal winger Khalilou Fadiga \u2013 proud. But with Pedro Neto and Mykhailo Mudryk in the mood to impress in the absence of Palmer and company, Chelsea\u2019s second string were far too strong. Neto had already set up Tosin Adarabioyo for a header with a delicate cross moments before Mudryk popped up on the same flank to deliver an inch-perfect ball for Veiga to head home at the back post after only 12 minutes. Dewsbury-Hall should have doubled the lead when Neto wiggled away from his marker and squared the ball into the midfielder\u2019s path but he shot just wide. Gent\u2019s first sight of goal came just after the half hour mark when Archie Brown, a product of Derby\u2019s academy who plays for England\u2019s Under-20 side, drew Filip J\u00f6rgensen into a save after a quick break. But their vociferous travelling support could not believe it when Gudjohnsen fired inches over with a powerful drive that would have left the Chelsea goalkeeper with no chance. Barely 30 seconds had elapsed since the restart when Neto took advantage of a moment\u2019s hesitation between Hugo Gambor and Tsuyoshi Watanabe to lash home Chelsea\u2019s second goal after a long ball from captain Axel Disasi. But Gent hit back immediately when the Japan defender rose above Beno\u00eet Badiashile and headed in Gudjohnsen\u2019s cross to the delight of the fans behind J\u00f6rgensen\u2019s goal. Chelsea were forced to go on the attack again and Nkunku celebrated being called up by France by making Gent pay for failing to clear a corner when he lashed home from inside the area. Dewsbury-Hall removed any lingering doubts about the result when he raced onto Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix\u2019s through ball to score Chelsea\u2019s fourth and his first since following Maresca from Leicester. \u201cI know that he needed that \u2013 it\u2019s never easy when you join a new club,\u201d said the Chelsea manager. To their credit, Gent continued to attack and a brilliant run from Brown saw the 22-year-old almost pull one back late on before substitute Omri Gandelman grabbed a late consolation that did little to dampen the home crowd\u2019s enthusiasm.",

That post was made during Tuesday night\u2019s vice-presidential debate, in which Trump\u2019s running mate JD Vance, a maniacally misogynistic and virulently anti-abortion politician, who has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments/index.html\">called for a national ban</a> on abortion, as well as the limiting of citizenship rights for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/kfile-jd-vance-history-disparaging-people-without-kids/index.html\">adults without children</a>, spoke in gauzy, non-specific rhetoric about abortion rights while not actually backing away from his extremist views.</p> <p>These gestures do not reflect a sincere change of Republican policy agendas: they reflect, instead, a self-interested change in Republicans\u2019 vocabulary. The Trump campaign is trying to soften its rhetoric on abortion, to change the words they are using to talk about what they want to inflict on American women. They hope that this will convince voters, especially those in swing states like Nevada and Arizona, where abortion rights initiatives will also be on the ballot come November, that they will not restrict access to the procedure further once in office. As is so often the case with Trump\u2019s public statements, the intent is not to inform, but to deceive. They have not actually changed their goals.</p> <p>Take, for instance, Trump\u2019s insistence that he will veto a national \u201cban\u201d on abortion. The suggestion is that if Congress passed a bill outlawing abortion nationwide, that he would not allow that bill to become law. This sounds reasonable enough, until you account for the dishonest way that Republicans use the word \u201cban\u201d: in their parlance, it refers only to an outright prohibition on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, with no exceptions \u2013 the kind that is now in effect in several Republican-controlled states. But to them, the term \u201cban\u201d does not include a law that prohibits abortion at a certain gestational limit \u2013 like, say, 12 or 15 weeks, popular numbers among Republican politicians \u2013 or one that includes nominal exceptions for rape victims or those experiencing health emergencies. Such laws, in rightwing parlance, are not \u201cbans\u201d; they are referred to instead as \u201cstandards\u201d. In this way, Trump can reassure his extremist anti-abortion backers that he will sign a 15- or 12-week ban into law, thus restricting access to abortion nationwide and cutting off care for thousands upon thousands of women, while still claiming to voters that he will not sign a national \u201cban\u201d. He\u2019s like a child telling you that the dog ate his homework while holding two fingers crossed behind his back: the bald-face duplicity of the semantic bait-and-switch would be funny, if it didn\u2019t threaten to get people killed.</p> <p>This kind of warped rhetoric also allows Trump to conceal just how many ways he and his movement have to ban abortion nationwide. Even if they do not capture enough seats in Congress to pass a national ban, for instance, they could still enforce a de facto national prohibition on abortion through enforcement of the long-dormant 1873 Comstock Act (as the Republican policy bible Project 2025 calls for them to do). Trump could also dramatically curtail abortion access nationwide by directing the FDA to rescind approval of the abortion drug mifepristone; he suggested he would do so just this past August. In another bit of laughably transparent dishonesty, Vance tried to walk back Trump\u2019s vow to outlaw mifepristone by claiming that the former president <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/vance-trump-abortion-pill-mifepristone\">hadn\u2019t heard the question</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/03/melania-trump-abortion\">What is Melania Trump\u2019s game in suddenly defending abortion rights?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The clearest sign that Melania\u2019s statements about abortion are meant to help her husband ascend to the political power he would need to ban it, is the timing.

Pro-democracy groups praised the sentencing on Thursday, saying it should make clear to those trying to undermine elections that there are consequences. \u201cIt\u2019s good that she\u2019s being held accountable,\u201d said Nick Penniman, CEO and founder of Issue One, a cross-partisan democracy group. \u201cToday\u2019s sentencing should send a message to other potential saboteurs that messing with America\u2019s elections isn\u2019t a game, and that law enforcement is watching.\u201d Peters\u2019 actions in Mesa county came at a cost, both financial and reputational. County officials say they are now associated with this breach and with election denialism. A county commissioner estimated the financial fallout to county taxpayers at $1.4m, Colorado Public Radio reported, for Peters\u2019 salary and recounts, among other costs. The county clerk position was the first Peters held, starting in 2018. She ran unsuccessfully for the state\u2019s top elections job, the secretary of state, in 2022.",

On Thursday, Rose was found guilty on all counts of manslaughter but not guilty of child neglect.</p> <p>When firefighters attended the property to tackle the blaze, which happened in the lead-up to Christmas in 2021, they found the home 20cm deep in rubbish and strewn with buckets of human excrement. A mattress and a door lay on the stairway, which slowed down efforts to rescue the boys.</p> <p>The fire was started by either a lit tea light or discarded cigarette. Fire alarms were not fitted in the property. The landlord told police this was because he believed he was under no obligation to have them installed.</p> <p>Rose was often cagey about letting people into her home but social services for Sutton council were aware of the living conditions. Their role in the months leading up to the fire has drawn particular attention.</p> <p>One social worker made two visits to Rose in July 2021. After the second visit, she emailed her managers with concerns about the cluttered home with a \u201cstrong, unpleasant smell\u201d. She also said she was worried about Rose\u2019s mental health. Despite this, no further visits were made and her case was closed in September 2021, three months before the fire.</p> <p>A health visitor from Sutton council visited the family on five occasions between November 2018 and January 2020. She expressed similar concerns about the state of the home and said Rose was \u201cstill having some difficulties\u201d in notes from her final visit. The health visitor retired shortly before the final visit but recommended follow-ups. None followed.</p> <p>The missed opportunities to prevent the tragedy have sparked alarm over the present state of children\u2019s services and prompted calls for the government and councils to boost investment into early intervention schemes, funding for which has almost halved from \u00a34bn in 2010 to \u00a32.2bn in 2022-23. These services, which include family hubs and Sure Start centres, often identify struggling or at-risk families, such as Rose, before their problems escalate.</p> <p>At the same time, the amount spent on late intervention services for families that have reached crisis point, which includes care homes and child protection, has hit an all-time high, rising from \u00a36.3bn to \u00a39.9bn.</p> <p>Anne Longfield, the former children\u2019s commissioner for England and executive chair of the Centre For Young Lives, said: \u201cA tragedy of this kind should be ringing absolute alarm bells for anyone who can make a difference.

One said they were in \u201cawe\u201d of how Rose managed her four children during a stay-and-play session at the school.</p> <p>But like Johnson, they also expressed concerns. One noted that one of the boy\u2019s book bags smelt like cigarettes and pet urine and suggested at the time that Rose might benefit from family support.</p> <p>Doctors who assessed Rose after her arrest noted there was a high likelihood that she suffered from a number of mental illnesses, including an underlying personality disorder with borderline traits and a high likelihood that she has recurrent depressive disorder.</p> <p>\u201cIt is likely that she was not coping at the time of the alleged offences and that her living space was one of the manifestations of this,\u201d said one doctor who assessed Rose.</p> <p>On the night of the fire, Rose told firefighters that a woman called Jade was looking after the children when she went to Sainsbury\u2019s. They went back inside the home to search for her but found no signs of anyone else. Police later came to the \u201cfirm conclusion\u201d that Jade either did not exist or played no part in the events of that evening.</p> <p>The blaze occurred at the tail-end of the Covid pandemic when interactions outside contained households were restricted. As a result, the help that Rose relied on from the boy\u2019s father and great-grandmother was greatly reduced. She struggled with her mental health during the period. In May 2020, Rose approached her GP with feelings of low mood. She requested help again with this in April 2021.</p> <p>\u201cWe know the level of vulnerabilities, both for children and families, was increasing before Covid and that the pandemic had heightened many of those vulnerabilities,\u201d said Longfield. \u201cIf we don\u2019t increase the level of support for families, including the improvement of support for parental mental health, then we\u2019re going to leave families struggling and tragedies like this will continue.\u201d</p> <p>Julia Ross, the chair of the British Association of Social Workers, echoed concerns about the impact of the pandemic. She said her members had seen a rise in referrals during that period and that many felt lockdown had hampered their capacity to safeguard children.</p> <p>\u201cThey were still out there on the streets, knocking on doors throughout the pandemic, trying to safeguard children and maintain an oversight,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Jonathan Williams, director of Children\u2019s Services for the London Borough of Sutton, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cOur heartfelt thoughts go out to the family who continue to grieve for their beloved boys. </p> <p>\u201cAfter the house fire, a multi-agency review was conducted by the local safeguarding partnership in January 2022 \u2026 The review found that the children were happy, healthy, well presented, well nourished and had a positive relationship with their mother. The multi-agency review that took place did not query the professional practice and the government\u2019s national panel agreed that a local child safeguarding practice review was not required.\u201d</p>",

She requested help again with this in April 2021. \u201cWe know the level of vulnerabilities, both for children and families, was increasing before Covid and that the pandemic had heightened many of those vulnerabilities,\u201d said Longfield. \u201cIf we don\u2019t increase the level of support for families, including the improvement of support for parental mental health, then we\u2019re going to leave families struggling and tragedies like this will continue.\u201d Julia Ross, the chair of the British Association of Social Workers, echoed concerns about the impact of the pandemic. She said her members had seen a rise in referrals during that period and that many felt lockdown had hampered their capacity to safeguard children. \u201cThey were still out there on the streets, knocking on doors throughout the pandemic, trying to safeguard children and maintain an oversight,\u201d she said. Jonathan Williams, director of Children\u2019s Services for the London Borough of Sutton, said: \u201cOur heartfelt thoughts go out to the family who continue to grieve for their beloved boys. \u201cAfter the house fire, a multi-agency review was conducted by the local safeguarding partnership in January 2022 \u2026 The review found that the children were happy, healthy, well presented, well nourished and had a positive relationship with their mother. The multi-agency review that took place did not query the professional practice and the government\u2019s national panel agreed that a local child safeguarding practice review was not required.\u201d",

Both teams contributed to an entertaining tie, and Barnab\u00e1s Varga\u2019s late consolation should give the Hungarians succour going forward.

      "bodyText": "Ange Postecoglou talks to TNT Sport. \u201cReally happy with them \u2026 it\u2019s never easy going away in Europe \u2026 the atmosphere \u2026 the conditions \u2026 we knew we would be able to overpower them with our running \u2026 we had some decent players on the bench and there\u2019s no point just leaving them there \u2026 they\u2019re not on holiday \u2026 Budapest is a beautiful city but they had to put in a shift \u2026 it\u2019s an important part of our evolution as a team.\u201d And with that, the report\u2019s up! Thanks for reading this MBM. That was rollocking good fun. Not sure Spurs fans, whose nerves will have been put through the shredder towards the end, will totally agree, but there you have it. Ange Postecoglou\u2019s young side overcame some early nerves to take a first-half lead through Pape Sarr. They should have added to it way before Brennan Johnson eventually did \u2013 we\u2019re looking at you, Timo Werner, again \u2013 but then Ferencv\u00e1ros had their opportunities to score as well. Spurs deserved to win on balance, and yet only the picky and the partial could have begrudged Ferencv\u00e1ros had they managed to squeak something out of this game. Both teams contributed to an entertaining tie, and Barnab\u00e1s Varga\u2019s late consolation should give the Hungarians succour going forward. Spurs, however, march on, and for the next two hours at least, the top of the Europa League megatable looks like this \u2026 Spurs get over the line! It\u2019s five wins in a row in all competitions, and two from two in the Europa League! 90 min +7: Maddison cops one in the face while competing for a loose ball with Ciss\u00e9, and that\u2019s surely it now. 90 min +6: Gustavo can\u2019t continue. The corner\u2019s taken. Solanke tries to shield the ball by the flag. He concedes a goal kick. We play on. 90 min +5: \u2026 but it\u2019ll be a while before the corner is taken, because Gustavo has landed awkwardly on his shoulder, and requires some treatment. 90 min +4: Spurs try to slow things down. Vicario takes his sweet time over a goal kick. Kulusevski then wins a corner down the right and that should be enough. 90 min +3: Vicario comes to make a garden-variety catch, only to juggle the ball entertainingly, if not authoritatively. Spurs hack clear. 90 min +1: There will be five additional minutes. This is Spurs. Ram\u00edrez crosses from the left. On the left-hand edge of the six-yard box, Barnab\u00e1s Varga sticks out a leg and forces it into the bottom left. Vicario no chance! Game back on! 88 min: That\u2019s five goals in five for Johnson, who had been getting pelters on social media before starting this run. There\u2019s a lesson to be learned in there. And that is: take the plug off the internet, put it back in its box, and send it back. We\u2019re happy to take the hit. Johnson was denied by the crossbar a couple of moments ago. Now the left-hand post is his friend. Moore finds Johnson by the right-hand edge of the D. He takes a touch to his left and curls delicately across the keeper and off the bottom of the post. And in! 84 min: Kady and Abu Fani have shots blocked. Spurs living dangerously here. That\u2019s Abu Fani\u2019s last act of the evening; he\u2019s replaced by Pe\u0161i\u0107. 83 min: \u2026 and to prove that point, Kady meets a right-wing cross by flashing a close-range header straight at Vicario. Either side of the keeper and it\u2019s a sickener for Spurs. 82 min: Solanke comes on for Sarr. Spurs know they need that extra goal all right. 81 min: \u2026 so having said Gray has been impressive, he\u2019s caught out of position, allowing Makreckis to have a whack from the right-hand corner of the Spurs box. He lashes it wide and high. 80 min: Gray, who has been quietly impressive tonight, drives down the middle of the park and rolls a pass towards Johnson on the right. Johnson meets the ball with a first-time diagonal riser that screams past the keeper and towards the top-left corner \u2026 before twanging off the crossbar. So close to a glory goal! 79 min: Kady looks lively. He dribbles hard in from the right, then swivels and shoots towards the bottom right, hoping to catch Vicario out at the near post. The keeper is wise to his grift and flops on the ball. 78 min: Kady\u2019s first act is to send Zachariassen into acres of space down the right with a cute reverse pass. But the following cross is no good. A reminder to Spurs that the hosts are not cooked yet. 77 min: Two more changes by Ferencv\u00e1ros. Kady and Makreckis come on for Gartenmann and Traor\u00e9. 76 min: Nothing comes of the corner. 75 min: Maddison rolls the free kick to the left, nearly hitting the referee and surprising Kulusevski. The winger still manages to get a shot away. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner. Even so, a bit of a fiasco. 74 min: Johnson\u2019s low cross-cum-shot from the right flank is poked out for a corner. One corner leads to another, which the hosts half-clear. Porro then crosses from the right. Ben Romdhane handles, and it\u2019s a free kick just outside the box, by the right-hand corner. Maddison to take. 72 min: Gartenmann mishits a cross from the right touchline. It nearly Koncheskys its way over Vicario and into the top left. The keeper thinks about tipping over the bar, just in case, but it sails over by its own accord. Hearts in mouths time for Spurs, who could do with a second goal to make breathing easier. 71 min: Maddison slips Moore into acres on the left, and screams for the return on the edge of the D. His request is met, but Gustavo turns up to skittle him over and clear. Maddison wants a free kick, but he\u2019s not getting one. The challenge was hard but fair. 69 min: \u2026 so having said that, this is a bit better from the hosts. Gartenmann crosses from the right, Zachariassen heading harmlessly over from 12 yards. 68 min: The home fans continue to make their noise, as they\u2019ve done all evening. Their team\u2019s not giving them much in return, though. 66 min: Werner is immediately hooked for that atrocity. Bergvall and Lankshear also depart. Maddison, Kulusevski and Johnson come on. 64 min: Zachariassen hits a shot-cum-cross from the right-hand edge of the Spurs box, latching onto a poor Davies header. He wins a corner, from which Spurs counter through Moore on the right. Moore rolls infield to Werner, who is one on one with Dibusz! He\u2019s got to score, but tries to round the keeper on the left. A clunky touch brings him far too wide, and he swipes a dismal effort into the side netting. That was beyond awful. Coming off the back of a couple of big missed chances at Old Trafford, his confidence must be subterranean. 62 min: Gray gets out of a tight spot in the left-back position with a cute dragback. That sends Spurs on the counter, Bissouma slipping a pass down the middle for Lankshear to chase. Lankshear enters the box and cocks his leg back to shoot, only for Gartenmann to slide in from behind and poke the ball back to his keeper, who claims. Lankshear wants a penalty, but it was a fine challenge. Great play all round, really. 60 min: \u0106ivi\u0107 and Saldanha are replaced by Ben Romdhane and Zachariassen. 59 min: Lankshear powers down the right and wins a corner with a low cross intended for Moore. Porro pulls the corner back to Lankshear on the penalty spot. The debutant sends a rising shot inches wide of the top-right corner. A fine effort. 58 min: Saldanha has the opportunity to release Traor\u00e9 down the middle, but overhits the pass. Vicario gathers and breathes again. \u201c\u00c0 propos Yash Gupta\u2019s comment about the number of chances Spurs create,\u201d begins Richard Hirst, \u201cis it just coincidence that Big Ange is an anagram of [said aloud] G, a binge?\u201d 56 min: This second half hasn\u2019t quite taken off yet. Not in the wide-open style of the first, anyway. 54 min: \u2026 a short corner from the right is worked back to Moore, who runs diagonally into the box. Ram\u00edrez hangs out a leg, but Moore declines to do the cynical thing, instead attempting to power into space for a shot. He runs the ball out for a goal kick. 53 min: Porro crosses aimlessly from the right. Ciss\u00e9 knocks it behind for a corner anyway. One set piece leads to another, and \u2026 52 min: Ah yes, nearly the whole pitch is now back in view. Lovely. 51 min: The game restarts with the players just about visible again. 49 min: Nothing comes of the corner. I\u2019m reasonably sure about that \u2026 though the entire pitch has suddenly been enveloped by thick flare smoke. Whiteout. The referee stops play so it can clear. 48 min: Saldanha drifts in from the left and curls a shot towards the bottom right. It\u2019s heading in, but Vicario fingertips around the post for a corner. Great save. 47 min: Barnab\u00e1s Varga nearly gets the better of Romero in a footrace down the right. Nearly, not quite. Romero holding his line. Spurs get the second half underway. No changes. \u201cBefore Big Ange it was so easy to keep track of chances because Tottenham weren\u2019t creating many,\u201d begins Yash Gupta. \u201cNow when Spurs squander an opportunity, instead of pointing finger at players, I\u2019m looking forward to another chance a minute later. At times Angeball resembles holy entity and it is wonderful.\u201d That flew by. Spurs lead a wide-open game, but only thanks to a slightly generous offside call that cost the hosts a goal. So let\u2019s do that again \u2026 That disallowed Ferencv\u00e1ros goal. Turns out the hosts weren\u2019t so hard done by after all. Uefa have just released footage of the VAR decision, and while Adama Traor\u00e9 was indeed miles offside in the middle, he wasn\u2019t a factor in the outcome at all. Barnab\u00e1s Varga\u2019s knee was just off anyway, so the goal was never going to stand. Half-time entertainment. That flew by. Spurs lead a wide-open game, but only thanks to a slightly generous offside call that cost the hosts a goal. 45 min: Sarr sends Moore scampering into a bit of space down the right. A first-time cross is hacked behind for a corner. Porro sends it in from the right. It\u2019s half-cleared by Traore, but Gray returns the volley with a daisycutter from 25 yards that nearly sneaks into the bottom-left corner. Dibusz does well to spot the danger through a thicket of legs and claims. 44 min: Abu Fani body-checks Porro with a forearm smash. You\u2019ve seen players walk for less, but the referee decides a free kick will suffice. Porro to take from the right, 30 yards out. He swings it to the far stick, where Davies is penalised for shoving his opponent. 42 min: Sarr is back up and running. 41 min: It\u2019s come at a cost, though, with Sarr now going down and requesting some treatment. 40 min: Sarr puts in a crunching tackle on Traore. Perfectly executed, at 101 mph, and the roar from the Spurs end is nearly as big as the one that greeted the goal. 38 min: Saldanha races into acres of space down the left and crosses low for Traore, who slices a shot wide left. He should have worked Vicario at the very least. 37 min: This game is a load of nonsense. Gloriously so. Plenty of front-foot fun allied to some slapstick defending. 35 min: There\u2019s a quick check for a penalty for that challenge on Porro. There was contact, you know, Saldanha hanging out a leg unwisely, but the fact Porro sprang up immediately \u2013 and didn\u2019t claim \u2013 may have given the VAR an out. Then there\u2019s another scramble in the home box, Moore eased out of the way when competing for a high ball, Lankshear conceding a free kick by clanking into the keeper. 33 min: \u2026 so having said that, Porro strides down the right and takes a mighty swipe at the ball from an ambitious distance. It pings off the back of Ram\u00edrez and out for a corner. From the set piece, Porro jinks in from the right, is nearly upended by Saldanha, stays on his feet, nutmegs Abu Fani and pings a low diagonal curler off the base of the left-hand post! 32 min: Spurs calm things down with some sterile domination. 30 min: Gartenmann hoicks a low cross into the Spurs box from the right. Vicario claims. There\u2019s not too much of this game being played in the middle of the park. 29 min: Saldanha gets irritated with some close attention from Bergvall, and comes very close to swinging an elbow into his face. Luckily nothing connects, and the pair are pals again soon enough. The referee tells them both to watch themselves. 27 min: Another Spurs corner, Bergvall swinging it in from the left. This one sees Barnab\u00e1s Varga nearly releasing Saldanha clear on goal. This match is so open, the ball being shuttled from end to end with glorious abandon. Good old-fashioned reckless fun. 25 min: A Spurs corner ends up with Traor\u00e9 attacking down the left. Gray dispossesses him and sets Spurs on the counter-counter. That ends with Sarr welting a shot from distance down the keeper\u2019s throat. There is no way this game will end 0-1. Well, well, well! It\u2019s been the hosts all the way, but Spurs take the lead against the run of play. Moore cuts in from the right and tries to find Lankshear in the box. Some pinball. The ball pings off Bergvall, who has fallen over, and tees up Sarr, who takes a touch on the right-hand edge of the six-yard box before slotting across Dibusz and in. 22 min: \u0106ivi\u0107 is booked for hauling down an in-flight Moore. He\u2019ll miss Ferencv\u00e1ros\u2019s next match in this competition. 20 min: Civic cuts back from the byline to the left of goal and cuts back for Barnabas Varga, who slams a shot goalwards from eight yards. Vicario makes a wonder save, a world-class reaction stop, though it technically doesn\u2019t count because the flag then goes up for offside. Ferencv\u00e1ros look like scoring every time they go forward. 18 min: \u2026 but there\u2019s a lengthy VAR check for offside. Barnab\u00e1s Varga glances at the linesman. He knows Adama Traor\u00e9, in the middle, was clearly off. But was he interfering with play, putting off Vicario? VAR says yes. No goal. That\u2019s a generous decision for Spurs. Space for \u0106ivi\u0107 on the left. He swings long for Barnab\u00e1s Varga, racing in from the right. Varga heads downwards, diagonally across Vicario and into the left-hand side of the net. Easy as that, but a glorious finish nonetheless. 14 min: Spurs have found their feet after that shaky start. Literally as well as figuratively; the pitch is wetter than an otter\u2019s pocket. 12 min: A bit of space for Sarr on the edge of the Ferencv\u00e1ros D. All his own work thanks to a nifty shuffle of the shoes. He sends a fierce low drive goalwards, but it\u2019s straight at Dibusz in the Ferencv\u00e1ros goal. Dibusz parries and lines are cleared. 10 min: Werner chops his way past Traor\u00e9 down the left and crosses. Lankshear should work the keeper at the very least, meeting the ball six yards out, but in diving towards it, can only shoulder over the bar. Big chance for the young debutant. 9 min: Spurs show in attack for the first time, Porro swinging a low cross in from the right. Neither Lankshear nor Werner are able to connect. Spurs come again, through Moore down the right flank. His dangerous low fizzer is hooked clear by Gartenmann. 8 min: Traor\u00e9 cuts in from the right and curls a shot towards the bottom left. Easy for Vicario. 7 min: Gartenmann hares down the inside-right channel and looks to be upended by Bissouma. He wants a free kick, just outside the box, but isn\u2019t getting one. Turns out it\u2019s a great decision by the referee, replays showing the Spurs midfielder gently toed the ball away. 6 min: It\u2019s all Ferencv\u00e1ros in terms of possession so far. 4 min: Abu Fani sprays a glorious diagonal pass towards Traor\u00e9 on the right. Traor\u00e9 has the opportunity to drive into the box, but instead opts to tee up Barnabas Varga on the edge of the Spurs D. Varga leans back and lifts a poor first-time effort over the bar. An early warning for Spurs, who already look worryingly open at the back. 3 min: Porro\u2019s first act is to miscontrol in his own area. Then he concedes the first corner of the evening. Abu Fani sends the set piece to the near post, where Bissouma clears. A slightly nervous start by the visitors. 2 min: Gray is playing at centre back this evening, incidentally. Porro at right back. The hosts kick off. A wonderful atmosphere at the Ferencv\u00e1ros Stadion, despite the rain that\u2019s been pelting down for the last 24 hours and doesn\u2019t seem minded to stop. The teams are out! Ferencv\u00e1ros are in their green and white stripes, so Spurs have naturally plumped for their green third-choice kit as opposed to second-choice blue. According to the chit that comes with the shirt, these verdant togs \u201ccelebrate pioneering female creatives in Tottenham, with the all-over print drawing inspiration from the Seven Sisters elm trees.\u201d It\u2019s amazing where the mind can take you when faced with a blank sheet of paper and everyone else from the office are already in the pub. Ange Postecoglou tells TNT Sports that the kids are alright. \u201cThey\u2019ve been with us from the start of pre-season so have been fully fledged members of our squad \u2026 Mikey has had a couple of opportunities off the bench \u2026 we\u2019ve been really keen to get them some game time and think tonight is the ideal time for it \u2026 I\u2019m confident they\u2019ll be able to handle themselves \u2026 I\u2019ve got no fear about putting them out there \u2026 they\u2019ve earned their spot and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll do well \u2026the best way to keep momentum going is to use the whole squad \u2026 I\u2019ve put out a team tonight that I think can do the business.\u201d Pre-match postbag. \u201cThe home side are starting with a Civic while the visitors have got an Austin among the substitutes. From the car angle, Ferencvaros are likely to get better mileage out of this match than Spurs.\u201d Some top gear from Peter Oh there. For the benefit of non-petrolheads, the Civic is a globally popular sedan made by Honda, while the Austin \u2026 well, that\u2019s best explained by this \u201cmontage of racy shots\u201d. A reminder of what happened this time last week, when things could have turned sour for Spurs, but didn\u2019t. It\u2019s been a good week for Dominic Solanke, all told. That Tottenham starting XI is about as youthful, and therefore super-exciting, as it gets. Ange gives the nod to 18-year-old right-back Archie Gray, 18-year old playmaker Lucas Bergvall, 17-year-old winger Mikey Moore, and, making his debut, 19-year-old striker Will Lankshear. Audere est Facere, as they say around N17 way. Ferencvaros: Dibusz, Gartenmann, Cisse, Raul Gustavo, Ramirez, Abu Fani, Maiga, Traore, Saldanha, Civic, Barnabas Varga. Subs: Adam Varga, Ben Romdhane, Pesic, Kady, Zachariassen, Botka, Szalai, Makreckis, Gruber, Toth, Rommens, Misidjan. Tottenham Hotspur: Vicario, Porro, Romero, Gray, Davies, Sarr, Bissouma, Bergvall, Werner, Lankshear, Moore. Subs: Forster, Austin, Maddison, Solanke, Kulusevski, Johnson, Bentancur, van de Ven, Dorrington, Cassanova, Ajayi. Referee: Igor Pajac (Croatia). Spurs managed to see off Qaraba\u011f with ten men last week. Can they dispatch Ferencv\u00e1ros with a full team of 11? We\u2019ll soon find out. An emotional journey \u2013 not for Spurs, who haven\u2019t played the famous Hungarian club before, but for Ange Postecoglou, who played under the legendary Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s at South Melbourne \u2013 begins at 5.45pm BST. It\u2019s on!",

      "body": "<p>Written once their authors have lost power, most prime ministerial memoirs try at some level to be reflective. David Cameron\u2019s begins by confessing that he still has daily anxieties about having called the Brexit referendum. John Major\u2019s starts even more disarmingly, by wondering why he went into politics at all.</p> <p>But Boris Johnson does not do reflective. He never has and he never will. And nor does his new memoir, with its unnerving title, Unleashed. It covers his time as London mayor, Brexit campaigner, foreign secretary and prime minister. But if it is heart-searching and confessions you seek from the pen of Britain\u2019s most iconoclastic prime minister, you can stop now.</p> <p>This is not \u201cthe political memoir of the century\u201d as the Daily Mail has been billing it for the past week. Or, if it is, an unrewarding 76 years lie ahead for the publishing industry. Take this passage from the section describing how Johnson felt in April 2020 when he had to be transferred from Downing Street to St Thomas\u2019 hospital suffering from Covid:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It wasn\u2019t just the physical distress; it was the guilt, the political embarrassment of it all. I needed to be <em>bee-oing-oing </em>back on my feet like an india rubber ball. I needed to be out there, leading the country from the front, sorting the PPE, fixing the care homes, driving the quest for a cure.</p> </blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a lot worth parsing there. And plenty that is characteristic of Johnson\u2019s writing more generally. There\u2019s the rubber ball image and the exuberant vocabulary. But then there\u2019s also the sheer dishonesty and the lies. In reality, Johnson was a chronically indecisive prime minister, emphatically not one who led from the front. The PPE wasn\u2019t being sorted at all, either, nor the care homes fixed. His solipsistic admission that he thought going into hospital was an embarrassing look for a leader shows where his instinctive priorities lay.</p> <p>Then there are the political omissions. Johnson records Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, warning \u2013 rightly \u2013 at the outset of the pandemic that the public would expect the government to act, to make rules and to enforce them. Yet listen to the Covid inquiry, and the evidence of what things were really like at the heart of Johnson\u2019s government in 2020 is jaw-dropping. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a bunch of people less well equipped to run a country,\u201d said the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, in a WhatsApp message.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s book gives his version of the big episodes. But it dodges the larger issues they raise. The description of what he calls \u201cthe whole Partygate hoo-ha\u201d is typical. It is full of angry self-righteousness. But his conclusion that he should not have apologised so much over Partygate is strikingly tin-eared. Though Johnson likes to parade the outward signs of his intellect, there is not a philosophical sentence in the entire book.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He regularly uses a cascade of words when a single one would do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yes, he often dresses up his memoir in amusingly image-rich and alliterative language. Donald Trump is \u201clike an orange-hued dirigible exuberantly buoyed aloft by the inexhaustible Primus stove of his own ego\u201d, for example. Kate Bingham did Covid vaccine deals \u201clike a slightly tipsy billionaire at the Grand National\u201d. Oliver Letwin is \u201cthe Professor Branestawm of British politics\u201d.</p> <p>And, yes, he regularly uses a cascade of words when a single one would do. \u201cI wanted to create ladders, springboards, trampolines, catapults \u2013 anything to help kids with energy and talent,\u201d he writes on his levelling up policy.</p> <p>The freewheeling nature of the memoir is entertaining but becomes irritating for its lack of structure. You will search long and hard to find any other political memoirist who could reflect, after Cameron threatens to \u201cfuck you up for ever\u201d if Johnson opts to back leave in the Brexit campaign: \u201cDid I want to be fucked up? For ever? By a prime minister equipped with all the fucking-up tools available to a modern government, and thousands of fucker-uppers just waiting to do his bidding?\u201d</p> <p>It is important to remember, though, that this has always been Johnson\u2019s way. He uses his wit, appearance and persona to deflect from serious matters and to advance his own cause.

      "bodyText": "Written once their authors have lost power, most prime ministerial memoirs try at some level to be reflective. David Cameron\u2019s begins by confessing that he still has daily anxieties about having called the Brexit referendum. John Major\u2019s starts even more disarmingly, by wondering why he went into politics at all. But Boris Johnson does not do reflective. He never has and he never will. And nor does his new memoir, with its unnerving title, Unleashed. It covers his time as London mayor, Brexit campaigner, foreign secretary and prime minister. But if it is heart-searching and confessions you seek from the pen of Britain\u2019s most iconoclastic prime minister, you can stop now. This is not \u201cthe political memoir of the century\u201d as the Daily Mail has been billing it for the past week. Or, if it is, an unrewarding 76 years lie ahead for the publishing industry. Take this passage from the section describing how Johnson felt in April 2020 when he had to be transferred from Downing Street to St Thomas\u2019 hospital suffering from Covid: It wasn\u2019t just the physical distress; it was the guilt, the political embarrassment of it all. I needed to be bee-oing-oing back on my feet like an india rubber ball. I needed to be out there, leading the country from the front, sorting the PPE, fixing the care homes, driving the quest for a cure. There\u2019s a lot worth parsing there. And plenty that is characteristic of Johnson\u2019s writing more generally. There\u2019s the rubber ball image and the exuberant vocabulary. But then there\u2019s also the sheer dishonesty and the lies. In reality, Johnson was a chronically indecisive prime minister, emphatically not one who led from the front. The PPE wasn\u2019t being sorted at all, either, nor the care homes fixed. His solipsistic admission that he thought going into hospital was an embarrassing look for a leader shows where his instinctive priorities lay. Then there are the political omissions. Johnson records Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, warning \u2013 rightly \u2013 at the outset of the pandemic that the public would expect the government to act, to make rules and to enforce them. Yet listen to the Covid inquiry, and the evidence of what things were really like at the heart of Johnson\u2019s government in 2020 is jaw-dropping. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a bunch of people less well equipped to run a country,\u201d said the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, in a WhatsApp message. Johnson\u2019s book gives his version of the big episodes. But it dodges the larger issues they raise. The description of what he calls \u201cthe whole Partygate hoo-ha\u201d is typical. It is full of angry self-righteousness. But his conclusion that he should not have apologised so much over Partygate is strikingly tin-eared. Though Johnson likes to parade the outward signs of his intellect, there is not a philosophical sentence in the entire book. Yes, he often dresses up his memoir in amusingly image-rich and alliterative language. Donald Trump is \u201clike an orange-hued dirigible exuberantly buoyed aloft by the inexhaustible Primus stove of his own ego\u201d, for example. Kate Bingham did Covid vaccine deals \u201clike a slightly tipsy billionaire at the Grand National\u201d. Oliver Letwin is \u201cthe Professor Branestawm of British politics\u201d. And, yes, he regularly uses a cascade of words when a single one would do. \u201cI wanted to create ladders, springboards, trampolines, catapults \u2013 anything to help kids with energy and talent,\u201d he writes on his levelling up policy. The freewheeling nature of the memoir is entertaining but becomes irritating for its lack of structure. You will search long and hard to find any other political memoirist who could reflect, after Cameron threatens to \u201cfuck you up for ever\u201d if Johnson opts to back leave in the Brexit campaign: \u201cDid I want to be fucked up? For ever? By a prime minister equipped with all the fucking-up tools available to a modern government, and thousands of fucker-uppers just waiting to do his bidding?\u201d It is important to remember, though, that this has always been Johnson\u2019s way. He uses his wit, appearance and persona to deflect from serious matters and to advance his own cause. His language is a form of collusion with his audience to stand apart from the tough business of governing. As Ed Docx observed in 2021 in these pages, Johnson has perfected the role of the clown king, whose speech is \u201cnot \u2013 in truth \u2013 eloquent, but rather the caricature of eloquence\u201d. It is the same with this memoir. That is not to deny that some of his anecdotes are striking. Johnson really does seem to have seriously contemplated a ludicrous armed raid on the Netherlands in order to bring millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses to Britain. He did almost drown on holiday in Scotland in summer 2020 because he was determined to sit out at sea in an inflatable kayak to avoid the Highland midges. And he comes super-close to implying that Benjamin Netanyahu personally planted a listening device in his private departmental bathroom when Johnson was foreign secretary. Just occasionally, there is an almost casually delivered shaft of self-knowledge. \u201cI am afraid, looking back, that I allowed the wish to be the father to the thought,\u201d he writes. He is talking about Northern Ireland policy at this point, but the insight applies to much else in Johnson\u2019s career, including Brexit, levelling up and his ability to govern. It probably describes his chances of a return to power too. Perhaps this overhyped book is the only memoir of which Johnson is capable. He is not going to change. Anyone wanting more about his time at the top will gain greater insight from a few pages of Anthony Seldon and Raymond Newell\u2019s Johnson at 10 than they will from Unleashed\u2019s more than 700 pages.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s 772-page doorstop of a memoir, Unleashed, recounts a chequered political career in his familiar boosterish tone. Here are five things we learned (spoiler: he hasn\u2019t learned much at all):</p>  <h2>He\u2019s baffled the Tories ditched him \u2013 and convinced he\u2019d have won this year\u2019s election</h2>  <p>Johnson\u2019s retelling of the \u201ctorrid sort of summer\u201d that ended his premiership is shot through with bewilderment. While he admits to a few mistakes \u2013 not least failing to read the findings against disgraced MP Owen Paterson before publicly defending him \u2013 he essentially believes MPs were wrong to defenestrate him.</p> <p>When Rishi Sunak resigned as chancellor, \u201cit was worse than a crime, I thought, it was a mistake \u2013 both for Rishi and for the party, never mind the country. So it proved.\u201d Johnson\u2019s biggest failing, as he recalls it, was not buttering up Tory MPs enough. \u201cToo often I would go back to the Number Ten flat, tired out, and work into the evening, when I should have been talking to colleagues and keeping them cheerful.\u201d If his colleagues had \u201cstuck together\u201d, he has \u201cno doubt that we would have gone on to win in 2024\u201d.</p> <h2>Partygate was cooked up by Cummings and Cain</h2>    <p>Johnson\u2019s account of what he calls this \u201cmiserable and wildly inflated affair\u201d, is that on about 15 occasions, officials \u201cbriefly slackened the tempo of their work and raised a glass\u201d. A \u201chandful\u201d of times, he joined them.</p> <p>He maintains these events were in line with Covid rules, but that his former chief of staff Dominic Cummings and his director of communications Lee Cain orchestrated a string of \u201cgrossly exaggerated\u201d media reports in a deliberate attempt to undermine him. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/31/eight-shocking-revelations-from-cummings-and-cain-at-the-covid-inquiry\">The pair</a> were, he says, \u201cbehind it all\u201d. He believes he could have ridden out the storm, if he had been \u201cfar more robust at the time\u201d.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Cummings is barely mentioned: the \u201ctrivial row\u201d that resulted in Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation in February 2020 was, Johnson says, \u201cconfected by people who really didn\u2019t have my interests at heart\u201d. The internecine wrangle that resulted in Cummings\u2019 and Cain\u2019s departures, in November 2020, he describes as, \u201chandbags\u201d.</p> <h2>He doesn\u2019t regret much about the pandemic</h2>  <p>The chapters on Covid are the most painstaking and amount to Johnson\u2019s justification of his decision-making at every stage.</p> <p>He shook hands with staff when visiting Covid patients at the Royal Free hospital because \u201cshaking hands is an ancient human gesture of goodwill\u201d and he didn\u2019t want to spread undue alarm.</p> <p>He stresses the patchy information available in the early days, including the false idea that asymptomatic transmission was unlikely.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s 772-page doorstop of a memoir, Unleashed, recounts a chequered political career in his familiar boosterish tone. Here are five things we learned (spoiler: he hasn\u2019t learned much at all): He\u2019s baffled the Tories ditched him \u2013 and convinced he\u2019d have won this year\u2019s election Johnson\u2019s retelling of the \u201ctorrid sort of summer\u201d that ended his premiership is shot through with bewilderment. While he admits to a few mistakes \u2013 not least failing to read the findings against disgraced MP Owen Paterson before publicly defending him \u2013 he essentially believes MPs were wrong to defenestrate him. When Rishi Sunak resigned as chancellor, \u201cit was worse than a crime, I thought, it was a mistake \u2013 both for Rishi and for the party, never mind the country. So it proved.\u201d Johnson\u2019s biggest failing, as he recalls it, was not buttering up Tory MPs enough. \u201cToo often I would go back to the Number Ten flat, tired out, and work into the evening, when I should have been talking to colleagues and keeping them cheerful.\u201d If his colleagues had \u201cstuck together\u201d, he has \u201cno doubt that we would have gone on to win in 2024\u201d. Partygate was cooked up by Cummings and Cain Johnson\u2019s account of what he calls this \u201cmiserable and wildly inflated affair\u201d, is that on about 15 occasions, officials \u201cbriefly slackened the tempo of their work and raised a glass\u201d. A \u201chandful\u201d of times, he joined them. He maintains these events were in line with Covid rules, but that his former chief of staff Dominic Cummings and his director of communications Lee Cain orchestrated a string of \u201cgrossly exaggerated\u201d media reports in a deliberate attempt to undermine him. The pair were, he says, \u201cbehind it all\u201d. He believes he could have ridden out the storm, if he had been \u201cfar more robust at the time\u201d. Elsewhere, Cummings is barely mentioned: the \u201ctrivial row\u201d that resulted in Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation in February 2020 was, Johnson says, \u201cconfected by people who really didn\u2019t have my interests at heart\u201d. The internecine wrangle that resulted in Cummings\u2019 and Cain\u2019s departures, in November 2020, he describes as, \u201chandbags\u201d. He doesn\u2019t regret much about the pandemic The chapters on Covid are the most painstaking and amount to Johnson\u2019s justification of his decision-making at every stage. He shook hands with staff when visiting Covid patients at the Royal Free hospital because \u201cshaking hands is an ancient human gesture of goodwill\u201d and he didn\u2019t want to spread undue alarm. He stresses the patchy information available in the early days, including the false idea that asymptomatic transmission was unlikely. A moment of epiphany appears to have been when he watched footage of overwhelmed Italian hospitals \u2013 which he knew were generally good, because he had used them when his toddler fell in the pool on holiday in Umbria. There is no acknowledgment that the government could, or should, have moved faster to remove \u201cancient and hallowed liberties from the people\u201d, as he puts it. He\u2019s a closet Keynesian While he would never use the term, Johnson clearly believes, along with the economist John Maynard Keynes, that a good dose of government spending can help the economy weather hard times. After the 2008 banking crisis, as mayor of London, he describes throwing his weight behind Crossrail to prevent George Osborne eyeing it up for cuts when the Tory coalition came to power in 2010. \u201cThose big investments \u2013 Crossrail, the Olympic site, the Westfield Centre at Shepherd\u2019s Bush \u2013 were fortuitously timed for London: vast counter-cyclical programmes that kept the spades going into the ground and people in work.\u201d Never a fan of \u201causterity\u201d, he repeatedly praises infrastructure projects, particularly in transport. As Covid abated, he says, \u201cwe had to use this terrifying moment to our advantage \u2026 by driving on full-pelt with our investments in everything from HS2 to hospitals to broadband.\u201d He deplores Sunak\u2019s subsequent decision to cancel much of HS2. He has many Serious Thoughts about foreign policy While you may have picked up the book to read about the drama of Brexit or the shame of Partygate, Johnson wants you to know that he has considered weighty geopolitical matters. There are chapters on Kosovo, where he was reporting for the Telegraph when Nato troops rolled in, the invasion of Iraq (\u201can arrogant, conceited and misbegotten adventure\u201d), Libya and Syria, where we \u201creally thumped Assad\u201d when Johnson was foreign secretary \u2013 which he suggests was the most that the west could have done in the circumstances. He repeatedly rejects the idea that Brexit has made the UK more insular, insisting that his travels as foreign secretary and prime minister convinced him that many countries around the world, \u201cwanted more Britain, especially in the places where Britain was already well known\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The 10th anniversary of the murder of Claire Throssell\u2019s two young sons, Jack and Paul, is a horrifying reminder of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/01/paul-and-jack-were-murdered-by-their-abusive-father-why-had-the-family-courts-granted-him-contact\">catastrophic consequences</a> that can follow when&nbsp;the family justice system makes mistakes. The serious case review that followed their deaths, in a house fire deliberately started by their father, concluded that the court should have considered suspending the boys\u2019 contact with him. Ms Throssell had left the family home due to domestic violence and had warned that he&nbsp;had told her he could understand why men killed their children.</p> <p>Case reviews are supposed to be learned from. But a decade later, there is plenty of evidence that poor decisions are still being made when domestic violence victims come before family judges. Last month a convicted rapist, Kristoffer White, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/sep/14/father-who-is-convicted-rapist-stripped-of-parental-responsibility-for-daughter\">stripped of parental responsibility</a> for his daughter \u2013 but only after the child\u2019s mother appealed an earlier ruling that permitted unsupervised contact.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.womensaid.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Child-First-Nineteen-Child-Homicides-Report.pdf\">Nineteen children</a> were killed by fathers who were allowed contact with them between 2005 and 2015, in England and Wales. Others have been harmed. A <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5ef3dcade90e075c4e144bfd/assessing-risk-harm-children-parents-pl-childrens-cases-report_.pdf\">report</a> from the Ministry of Justice in 2020 contained 72 recommendations aimed at tilting the culture of the&nbsp;family court away from a presumption of contact with both parents, towards a greater emphasis on safety. But these have not all been implemented, while legal aid cuts continue to have adverse effects. A&nbsp;domestic abuse perpetrators\u2019 programme abolished in 2022 has yet to be replaced.</p> <p>More positive recent changes include the inclusion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/23/but-he-didnt-hit-you-did-he-inside-the-coercive-control-courtroom\">coercive control</a> in 2021\u2019s domestic abuse act. This was part of a broader shift towards a more holistic understanding of the dynamics of abusive relationships. But it is hard to tell to what extent this is reflected in the courts or the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service \u2013 which represents children\u2019s interests in family law cases, and has also faced criticism for past failings.</p> <p>Nicole Jacobs, the domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales, is due to <a href=\"https://domesticabusecommissioner.uk/family-court/\">lead a study</a> on the way abuse allegations are handled. In July, Sir Andrew McFarlane, the family court\u2019s president, reported that <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/guidance-and-resources/a-view-from-the-presidents-chambers-july-2024/\">trials in two areas</a> of a new, child\u2011centred and less adversarial approach to private law disputes had been \u201cfar more successful than even its most ardent supporters would have anticipated\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The 10th anniversary of the murder of Claire Throssell\u2019s two young sons, Jack and Paul, is a horrifying reminder of the catastrophic consequences that can follow when the family justice system makes mistakes. The serious case review that followed their deaths, in a house fire deliberately started by their father, concluded that the court should have considered suspending the boys\u2019 contact with him. Ms Throssell had left the family home due to domestic violence and had warned that he had told her he could understand why men killed their children. Case reviews are supposed to be learned from. But a decade later, there is plenty of evidence that poor decisions are still being made when domestic violence victims come before family judges. Last month a convicted rapist, Kristoffer White, was stripped of parental responsibility for his daughter \u2013 but only after the child\u2019s mother appealed an earlier ruling that permitted unsupervised contact. Nineteen children were killed by fathers who were allowed contact with them between 2005 and 2015, in England and Wales. Others have been harmed. A report from the Ministry of Justice in 2020 contained 72 recommendations aimed at tilting the culture of the family court away from a presumption of contact with both parents, towards a greater emphasis on safety. But these have not all been implemented, while legal aid cuts continue to have adverse effects. A domestic abuse perpetrators\u2019 programme abolished in 2022 has yet to be replaced. More positive recent changes include the inclusion of coercive control in 2021\u2019s domestic abuse act. This was part of a broader shift towards a more holistic understanding of the dynamics of abusive relationships. But it is hard to tell to what extent this is reflected in the courts or the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service \u2013 which represents children\u2019s interests in family law cases, and has also faced criticism for past failings. Nicole Jacobs, the domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales, is due to lead a study on the way abuse allegations are handled. In July, Sir Andrew McFarlane, the family court\u2019s president, reported that trials in two areas of a new, child\u2011centred and less adversarial approach to private law disputes had been \u201cfar more successful than even its most ardent supporters would have anticipated\u201d. Another pilot, of family court reporting by the press and legal bloggers, has been extended beyond its initial three locations. Huge gaps in the published data remain a sticking-point. Case numbers are in the public domain. In 2022 there were 52,204 new private law cases involving children, and 16,384 public law cases where children\u2019s services were involved. But statistics on children\u2019s involvement in proceedings and on the orders made by judges \u2013 and how these vary over time and between regions \u2013 are lacking. So are many other details that could help inform, and improve, policy and practice in a system entrusted with difficult and highly sensitive decisions. The risks to families in which fathers are domestic abusers, or sex offenders, remain the most serious concerns. Senior judges have indicated their support for a more open system. But a lack of resources hinders progress. The anonymisation unit that was supposed to enable more judgments to be published does not exist, due to a lack of funding. And this means that no one \u2013 not journalists, lawyers, campaigners or the public \u2013 can learn from them. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Following congress, Infantino commissioned a legal review. \u201cFootball should not and should never become a hostage for politics and always remain a vector for peace,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThis legal assessment will have to allow for inputs and claims of both member associations.\u201d The assessment was first set to be discussed in August, but was postponed, with an extraordinary meeting of the congress being convened for this week. There is no fixed date for the investigations to be concluded, and the council will then take advice before acting on the outcomes. Campaigners who have been pushing for Fifa to sanction Israel\u2019s football authorities said the council\u2019s decision was \u201ckicking the can down the road\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a predictably pathetic and spineless response from Fifa,\u201d said Nick McGeehan, the director of the human rights organisation FairSquare. \u201cThe evidence is very clear that the Israeli FA is in violation of Fifa statutes and there are multiple grounds for its suspension. \u201cFifa has been aware of IFA violations since 2015 and has kicked the can down the road at every turn, which is what it is doing here. For Infantino to dress up Fifa\u2019s inaction as a form of peacemaking is another reflection of how poorly governed the organisation is.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It is 17 years since the management of Tesco suffered a severe case of hubris and thought they could conquer the US. A supposedly small experiment with a format called Fresh &amp; Easy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/dec/05/tesco-fresh-easy\">ended in an embarrassing retreat</a> and a near-\u00a32bn write-off. And it is 10 years since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/28/tesco-agrees-fine-serious-fraud-office-accounting-scandal\">great accounting scandal</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jan/26/tesco-warning-signs-supplier-relations-fca-andrew-bailey\">bullying of suppliers</a>, a crisis era mixed up with wacky diversions into music streaming (Blinkbox), Android tablets (Hudl) and coffee shops (Harris + Hoole).</p> <p>The contrast with today could not be starker. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/03/tesco-workers-rights-laws-growth-bill-zero-hours-contracts\">Thursday\u2019s strong half-year numbers</a> were accompanied by a forecast that the full-year tally for \u201cretail adjusted operating profit\u201d, Tesco\u2019s slightly odd preferred metric, will be \u00a32.9bn, about \u00a3100m better than the last time it spoke. Given the group\u2019s recent habit of underpromising, nobody will be surprised if the round number of \u00a33bn is reached.</p> <p>The point is that Tesco looks unbeatable when, as now, it concentrates on the day job in the UK and Ireland. The humiliation with Fresh &amp; Easy prompted an exit from most of the other overseas adventures \u2013 Japan, China, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Poland and Turkey. A small \u201ccentral Europe\u201d unit continues in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia but you have to get as far as page 7 of the half-year statement to see the misfit\u2019s performance (briefly) described.</p> <p>In the UK, the extracurricular activities mostly amount to Tesco Bank, but the bulk of that business <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/09/tesco-to-sell-bulk-of-banking-business-to-barclays#:~:text=Tesco%20to%20sell%20bulk%20of,%C2%A3700m%20%7C%20Banking%20%7C%20The%20Guardian\">is about to be sold to Barclays</a>. As a group, Tesco is as concentrated on UK and Irish food retailing as it has been in years. It is the poster-child for the management school that preaches the boring virtues of \u201cfocus\u201d and clearing out the clutter.</p> <p>It is hard to see how the script will change any time soon.

      "bodyText": "It is 17 years since the management of Tesco suffered a severe case of hubris and thought they could conquer the US. A supposedly small experiment with a format called Fresh &amp; Easy ended in an embarrassing retreat and a near-\u00a32bn write-off. And it is 10 years since the great accounting scandal and the bullying of suppliers, a crisis era mixed up with wacky diversions into music streaming (Blinkbox), Android tablets (Hudl) and coffee shops (Harris + Hoole). The contrast with today could not be starker. Thursday\u2019s strong half-year numbers were accompanied by a forecast that the full-year tally for \u201cretail adjusted operating profit\u201d, Tesco\u2019s slightly odd preferred metric, will be \u00a32.9bn, about \u00a3100m better than the last time it spoke. Given the group\u2019s recent habit of underpromising, nobody will be surprised if the round number of \u00a33bn is reached. The point is that Tesco looks unbeatable when, as now, it concentrates on the day job in the UK and Ireland. The humiliation with Fresh &amp; Easy prompted an exit from most of the other overseas adventures \u2013 Japan, China, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Poland and Turkey. A small \u201ccentral Europe\u201d unit continues in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia but you have to get as far as page 7 of the half-year statement to see the misfit\u2019s performance (briefly) described. In the UK, the extracurricular activities mostly amount to Tesco Bank, but the bulk of that business is about to be sold to Barclays. As a group, Tesco is as concentrated on UK and Irish food retailing as it has been in years. It is the poster-child for the management school that preaches the boring virtues of \u201cfocus\u201d and clearing out the clutter. It is hard to see how the script will change any time soon. Grocery retailing is a volume business and Tesco\u2019s market share in the UK (27.8% on research group Kantar\u2019s latest monthly statistics) equals that of its next two competitors combined (Sainsbury\u2019s at 15.3% and Asda at 12.6%). Such huge leadership bestows a permanent buying advantage. It remains a mystery why competition regulators, as late as 2018, cleared the \u00a33.7bn purchase of the cash and carry giant Booker, a deal that extended Tesco\u2019s influence into convenience chains, but the bottom line is that there is zero chance of the acquisition being reversed. Meanwhile, factors that caused former managements to lose their heads \u2013 aside from pure arrogance \u2013 look less of a threat today. Aldi and Lidl were serious irritants for a long time but the headache has been eased with price-match offers and Clubcard deals. And the notional threat from Amazon hasn\u2019t materialised; the US giant dabbles in food retailing in the UK but surely knows that there is better money to be made in hosting datacentres. By way of bonus for Tesco, Asda and Morrisons are now owned by leveraged buyout funds and carry billions-worth of expensive junk-rated debt, which, whatever their managements say, must blunt their competitive bite.

      "body": "<p>Israel has several options if its leaders want to launch retaliatory strikes against Iran, and while western leaders have urged restraint, a significant assault is expected. Possibilities could include strikes against military, economic or even nuclear targets, although Joe Biden said he had told Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/us-wont-support-israeli-attack-on-irans-nuclear-sites-says-biden\">US would not support the last option</a>.</p> \n<p>Iran has relatively weak air defences and it is expected it would struggle to prevent Israeli missiles or an air force bombing run, as was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/19/israel-iran-airtstrikes-ifsahan-tabriz-drones-explosions\">revealed on 19 April</a>. Then, Israel, responding to Iran\u2019s previous missile barrage, damaged part of Iran\u2019s best air defence system, a Russian S-300, in the military-industrial city of Isfahan. It was a strike intended to showcase to Iran what Israel was capable of.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf attacking nuclear sites is off the table, the two big options for Israel are whether it wants to attack military or economic targets,\u201d said Fabian Hinz, a Middle East expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.</p> \n<h2>Military targets</h2> \n<p>The most direct response would be for Israel to try to strike Iran\u2019s cluster of missile and drone bases, which are located, according to Hinz, underground and in some cases \u201cdeep under mountains\u201d. Though it may be possible to bomb and seal off entrances, the bases are designed to resist all the largest conventional explosives, and striking them may not prevent future attacks, he added.</p> \n<p>Alternatives could be to repeat the targeting of Iranian air defence bases \u2013 this time on a larger scale \u2013 which cover Tehran, Isfahan and ports on the Persian gulf. Or a more complex attack could target military-industrial production, such as a more overt repeat of the drone attack on a weapons factory in Isfahan in January 2023. However, all such attacks carry the possibility of miscalculation and risk unanticipated casualties.</p> \n<h2>Oil terminals, refineries and economic infrastructure</h2> \n<p>An attack on Iran\u2019s oil infrastructure has been touted as a likely response to Tuesday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/iranian-strikes-on-israel-what-happened-why-did-iran-attack-missiles-damage-what-next\">ballistic missile assault on Israel</a>, with Biden indicating the issue was under discussion on Thursday. The most cited target is Kharg oil terminal, which handles, on some estimates, 90% of crude oil exports, most of which are destined for China. Other key facilities include the Abadan refinery, near the border with Iraq, which handles a significant proportion of Iran\u2019s domestic oil needs.</p> \n<p>\u201cIran\u2019s oil industry is quite exposed,\u201d said Hinz, adding that attacking economic targets could have a longer-term impact. \u201cIran\u2019s economy is struggling and the regime always wants sanctions relief,\u201d he said, noting that Israel\u2019s bombing of the Houthis in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/29/israel-launches-fresh-airstrikes-at-houthi-targets-in-yemen\">Yemen at the end of last month</a> was focused on fuel, power and port facilities at Ras Issa and Hodeidah.</p> \n<p>A question is whether an economic attack as a direct response to Iran\u2019s on Tuesday is proportionate. Iran said it had selected military targets, and its missiles targeted Israeli airbases, causing light damage to the Nevatim facility and the headquarters of the Mossad spy agency. But a school east of Ashkelon was struck, causing extensive damage to a classroom.</p> \n<p>It is also more likely to lead to an Iranian retaliation than if Israel carried out a more narrowly focused military attack. Maj Gen Mohammad Bagheri, Iran\u2019s military chief of staff, said, if attacked, Tehran would respond with another larger, and more wide-ranging, missile barrage. Tuesday\u2019s attack \u201cwill be repeated with bigger intensity and all infrastructure of the regime will be targeted\u201d, he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/iran-facilitiesmap/giv-45591oO41719i9Yb\" data-alt=\"Map of Iran\u2019s key oil and nuclear infrastructure\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/iran-facilitiesmap/giv-45591oO41719i9Yb\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Targeted killings and other covert methods</h2> \n<p>Israel could take a different tack, expanding its programme of targeted killings further in Iran.

Israel, however, does not appear to be considering a low-key response to what was an overt missile attack, with the prime minister insisting Iran would \u201cpay for it\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Nuclear targets</h2> \n<p>Military experts believe it would be impossible for Israel to mount a disruptive strike on Iran\u2019s network of nuclear sites without direct military help from the US. The key sites where Iran is enriching uranium up to 60% purity, Natanz and Fordow, are both underground, below several dozen metres of rock and concrete.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2024/10/iran-vs-israel-redux-the-enormous-difficulties-and-ramifications-if-israel-attacks-irans-nuclear-sites/\">paper by Darya Dolzikova and Matthew Savill</a>, originally published in April by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, says: \u201cThe only conventional weapon that could plausibly achieve this is the American GBU-57A/B massive ordnance penetrator, which \u2013 with over 12 tonnes and 6 metres long \u2013 can only be carried by large US bombers like the B-2 Spirit.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cd2fbb52-72b4-48b9-bde2-a816e398d58f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KCGsi9MF5YY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Though it may be possible for Israel to attack lesser sites and set back the programme by targeting facilities for the production of centrifuges used in the enrichment process or other such sites, there is a risk that an attack on its nuclear programme could prompt Tehran to speed up its efforts to obtain an atomic bomb.</p> \n<p>\u201cTehran may see the actual weaponization of its nuclear programme as the only option left that can guarantee the security of the Iranian regime,\u201d the authors conclude.</p>",

I\u2019m fortunate to have seen speakers including Michael Foot and Donald Soper, whose handling of heckling added a vital touch of spontaneity. You knew they were confident of their ideas and argument. Speeches written by special advisers and robotically read from the Autocue cannot offer this.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/apr/28/past.labour\">\u201cHeckling is good</a>,\u201d wrote the Guardian\u2019s political editor Michael White 18 years ago. Allowing members of an audience a brief opportunity to express a view should be considered an essential part of a democracy. This includes at conference. Rachel Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer may lack sufficient confidence in their scripts to depart from them, but bundling hecklers out of the hall gives only temporary relief. The questions remain.<br><strong>Mike Sheaff</strong><br><em>Plymouth</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is clearly aware that the British two-party system is not in rude health (\u201cwe have just been through an election in which the two main parties received their lowest ever combined share of the vote\u201d), so why does the headline on his article refer to \u201ceither party conference\u201d \u2013 as if there are only two of them? There are not. I am sorry that Harris did not enjoy his time with Labour at Liverpool and I am sure he was right to expect nothing better from the Tories in Birmingham, so why did he not head for the seaside instead and watch the Lib Dems in action?</p> <p>There he would have seen a leader confident enough to talk of closer engagement with the EU and electoral reform (subjects kept off the agenda in Liverpool and Birmingham) and a party prepared to debate Gaza on the main conference stage. There is passion&nbsp;in politics \u2013 you just have to&nbsp;know where to look for it.<br><strong>Jonathan Allum</strong><br><em>Amersham, Buckinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is totally correct in his outline of changes in party conferences. As one who, in the past, was in part responsible for Labour\u2019s conference organisation, who also attended as an elected councillor and as parliamentary candidate, not to mention fringe chair on Labour and the arts (<a href=\"https://artsforlabour.org/\">Arts for Labour</a>), I can pinpoint with precision the causes of changes in these gatherings.</p> <p>Though it will never be admitted by the media, they are largely responsible for the dumbing down, trivialisation and boring stigma on not only conferences, but politics in general. The public in today\u2019s world only know and perceive politics via the media. Over the years I have understood that the behaviour of the media \u2013 keen on sex scandals rather than citizens\u2019 involvement in the governance of our country \u2013 is responsible for much, if not all, of the dire state of British political benightedness.

      "bodyText": "John Harris is spot-on in his comments about how \u201chopelessly rigid and formulaic the political mainstream now is\u201d (Brexit, Farage, Corbyn all sparked passion \u2013 but there\u2019s no sign of that at either party conference, 29 September). I\u2019m fortunate to have seen speakers including Michael Foot and Donald Soper, whose handling of heckling added a vital touch of spontaneity. You knew they were confident of their ideas and argument. Speeches written by special advisers and robotically read from the Autocue cannot offer this. \u201cHeckling is good,\u201d wrote the Guardian\u2019s political editor Michael White 18 years ago. Allowing members of an audience a brief opportunity to express a view should be considered an essential part of a democracy. This includes at conference. Rachel Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer may lack sufficient confidence in their scripts to depart from them, but bundling hecklers out of the hall gives only temporary relief. The questions remain. Mike Sheaff Plymouth \u2022 John Harris is clearly aware that the British two-party system is not in rude health (\u201cwe have just been through an election in which the two main parties received their lowest ever combined share of the vote\u201d), so why does the headline on his article refer to \u201ceither party conference\u201d \u2013 as if there are only two of them? There are not. I am sorry that Harris did not enjoy his time with Labour at Liverpool and I am sure he was right to expect nothing better from the Tories in Birmingham, so why did he not head for the seaside instead and watch the Lib Dems in action? There he would have seen a leader confident enough to talk of closer engagement with the EU and electoral reform (subjects kept off the agenda in Liverpool and Birmingham) and a party prepared to debate Gaza on the main conference stage. There is passion in politics \u2013 you just have to know where to look for it. Jonathan Allum Amersham, Buckinghamshire \u2022 John Harris is totally correct in his outline of changes in party conferences. As one who, in the past, was in part responsible for Labour\u2019s conference organisation, who also attended as an elected councillor and as parliamentary candidate, not to mention fringe chair on Labour and the arts (Arts for Labour), I can pinpoint with precision the causes of changes in these gatherings. Though it will never be admitted by the media, they are largely responsible for the dumbing down, trivialisation and boring stigma on not only conferences, but politics in general. The public in today\u2019s world only know and perceive politics via the media. Over the years I have understood that the behaviour of the media \u2013 keen on sex scandals rather than citizens\u2019 involvement in the governance of our country \u2013 is responsible for much, if not all, of the dire state of British political benightedness. The Guardian, I may add, is largely an exception. Dr Ian Flintoff Oxford \u2022 Do you have a photograph you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, please click here to upload it.

      "body": "<p>The legalisation of assisted dying in England and Wales appeared to take a decisive step forward after it was announced MPs will vote on a bill to give people a choice about end-of-life care.</p> <p>The Labour MP Kim Leadbeater said her private member\u2019s bill this month would give terminally ill, eligible adults a choice at the end of life to shorten dying and ensure stronger protection for them and their loved ones afterwards.</p> <p>Keir Starmer has said he supports a change in the law, although MPs would get a free vote as it is a matter of conscience. Downing Street has said it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/sep/15/assisted-dying-vote-no-10-bill\">not obstruct</a> the bill and the government would be expected to support the MP with drafting in the later stages.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/03/assisted-dying-bill-parliament-kim-leadbeater-labour-mp\">Writing for the Guardian</a>, Leadbeater said the law had not been updated for 60 years and it was now time to bring the UK into line with some other countries. \u201cSomebody with a terminal condition and very little time left has only limited options,\u201d the Spen Valley MP said.</p> <p>She added: \u201cI believe we should have the right to see out our days surrounded by those we love and care for, knowing that when we are gone they can remember us as we would like to be remembered. I also believe that if we were able to spare them any unnecessary trauma and uncertainty, we would want to do that too.\u201d</p> <p>The MP, who came first in the private members\u2019 ballot, said there would be safeguards and protections in place to ensure people could not come under pressure to agree to assisted dying against their will. She said her bill would not undermine calls for improvements to palliative care.</p> <p>Leadbeater said: \u201cParliament should now be able to consider a change in the law that would offer reassurance and relief \u2013 and most importantly, dignity and choice \u2013 to people in the last months of their lives.\u201d </p> <p>Simon Case, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, said on Thursday evening that the prime minister had decided to set aside collective responsibility on the merits of the bill and others covering the same subject matter.</p> <p>He wrote in a letter to ministers that it \u201cmeans that ministers can vote, or not, however they wish. The government will therefore remain neutral on the passage of the bill and on the matter of assisted dying.\u201d</p> <p>While polling shows a majority of the public back legalising support for terminally ill people who wish to end their lives, the issue could cause serious divisions across parties, with opinion split.</p> <p>While the prime minister said last year, when he was in opposition, that there were \u201cgrounds for changing the law\u201d, the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has said she could not back a policy she described as \u201ca really dangerous position to be in\u201d.</p> <p>Wes Streeting, the health secretary, suggested last month that he worried the state of end-of-life care in the UK meant it was not ready for assisted dying. He has raised concerns over people being coerced into exercising their right to die because of a lack of end-of-life care.</p> <p>Similar legislation is under consideration in Scotland, the Isle of Man and Jersey. Under the current law, anybody in England, Wales and Northern Ireland who travels with a loved one to Dignitas in Switzerland, or stays with someone to comfort them at home as they end their life, could be liable to prosecution for up to 14 years.</p> <p>When UK MPs last voted on the issue, in 2015, the Labour MP Rob Marris introduced a bill that meant people with fewer than six months to live could be prescribed a lethal dose of drugs, which they would have to take themselves. It was defeated by 330 votes to 118.</p> <p>Kit Malthouse, the Conservative former cabinet minister and the chair of the cross-party group of MPs on choice at the end of life, said: \u201cSince the last vote on this issue in 2015, more and more MPs have come to realise that the current situation is a horror show for far too many.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day, people with terminal diseases are forced to endure agony and degradation, denied the choice to end their lives in peace and dignity, surrounded by those who love them.</p> <p>\u201cThe law has to change, for compassion\u2019s sake, and Kim\u2019s bill will be welcomed by the millions who simply don\u2019t understand how parliament can tolerate the terrible pain and misery inaction is inflicting on so many.\u201d</p> <p>Australia, New Zealand, Oregon and a number of other US states currently have assisted dying laws for terminally ill people, as Leadbeater has proposed. None has repealed the laws or subsequently relaxed them. Several other countries, including Canada, have less restrictive approaches based around intolerable suffering.</p> <p>The broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill with lung cancer and last year revealed she had joined Dignitas, the assisted dying clinic, welcomed the news which she said meant people like her could \u201clook forward with hope and confidence that we could have a good death\u201d.</p> <p>She added: \u201cI never thought I might live to see the current cruel law change. But even if it is too late for me, I know thousands of terminally ill patients and their families will be given new hope. All we ask is to be given the choice over our own lives.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Gordon Macdonald, the chief executive of Care Not Killing, which is opposed to a change in the law, said he was disappointed that a bill would be introduced. \u201cI would strongly urge the government to focus on fixing our broken palliative care system that sees up to one in four Brits who would benefit from this type of care being unable to access it, rather than discussing again this dangerous and ideological policy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Charlie Falconer, the Labour former justice secretary, has introduced a separate assisted dying bill in the House of Lords, which is expected to be debated in mid-November.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The legalisation of assisted dying in England and Wales appeared to take a decisive step forward after it was announced MPs will vote on a bill to give people a choice about end-of-life care. The Labour MP Kim Leadbeater said her private member\u2019s bill this month would give terminally ill, eligible adults a choice at the end of life to shorten dying and ensure stronger protection for them and their loved ones afterwards. Keir Starmer has said he supports a change in the law, although MPs would get a free vote as it is a matter of conscience. Downing Street has said it would not obstruct the bill and the government would be expected to support the MP with drafting in the later stages. Writing for the Guardian, Leadbeater said the law had not been updated for 60 years and it was now time to bring the UK into line with some other countries. \u201cSomebody with a terminal condition and very little time left has only limited options,\u201d the Spen Valley MP said. She added: \u201cI believe we should have the right to see out our days surrounded by those we love and care for, knowing that when we are gone they can remember us as we would like to be remembered. I also believe that if we were able to spare them any unnecessary trauma and uncertainty, we would want to do that too.\u201d The MP, who came first in the private members\u2019 ballot, said there would be safeguards and protections in place to ensure people could not come under pressure to agree to assisted dying against their will. She said her bill would not undermine calls for improvements to palliative care. Leadbeater said: \u201cParliament should now be able to consider a change in the law that would offer reassurance and relief \u2013 and most importantly, dignity and choice \u2013 to people in the last months of their lives.\u201d Simon Case, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, said on Thursday evening that the prime minister had decided to set aside collective responsibility on the merits of the bill and others covering the same subject matter. He wrote in a letter to ministers that it \u201cmeans that ministers can vote, or not, however they wish. The government will therefore remain neutral on the passage of the bill and on the matter of assisted dying.\u201d While polling shows a majority of the public back legalising support for terminally ill people who wish to end their lives, the issue could cause serious divisions across parties, with opinion split. While the prime minister said last year, when he was in opposition, that there were \u201cgrounds for changing the law\u201d, the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has said she could not back a policy she described as \u201ca really dangerous position to be in\u201d. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, suggested last month that he worried the state of end-of-life care in the UK meant it was not ready for assisted dying. He has raised concerns over people being coerced into exercising their right to die because of a lack of end-of-life care. Similar legislation is under consideration in Scotland, the Isle of Man and Jersey. Under the current law, anybody in England, Wales and Northern Ireland who travels with a loved one to Dignitas in Switzerland, or stays with someone to comfort them at home as they end their life, could be liable to prosecution for up to 14 years. When UK MPs last voted on the issue, in 2015, the Labour MP Rob Marris introduced a bill that meant people with fewer than six months to live could be prescribed a lethal dose of drugs, which they would have to take themselves. It was defeated by 330 votes to 118. Kit Malthouse, the Conservative former cabinet minister and the chair of the cross-party group of MPs on choice at the end of life, said: \u201cSince the last vote on this issue in 2015, more and more MPs have come to realise that the current situation is a horror show for far too many. \u201cEvery day, people with terminal diseases are forced to endure agony and degradation, denied the choice to end their lives in peace and dignity, surrounded by those who love them. \u201cThe law has to change, for compassion\u2019s sake, and Kim\u2019s bill will be welcomed by the millions who simply don\u2019t understand how parliament can tolerate the terrible pain and misery inaction is inflicting on so many.\u201d Australia, New Zealand, Oregon and a number of other US states currently have assisted dying laws for terminally ill people, as Leadbeater has proposed. None has repealed the laws or subsequently relaxed them. Several other countries, including Canada, have less restrictive approaches based around intolerable suffering. The broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill with lung cancer and last year revealed she had joined Dignitas, the assisted dying clinic, welcomed the news which she said meant people like her could \u201clook forward with hope and confidence that we could have a good death\u201d. She added: \u201cI never thought I might live to see the current cruel law change. But even if it is too late for me, I know thousands of terminally ill patients and their families will be given new hope. All we ask is to be given the choice over our own lives.\u201d Dr Gordon Macdonald, the chief executive of Care Not Killing, which is opposed to a change in the law, said he was disappointed that a bill would be introduced. \u201cI would strongly urge the government to focus on fixing our broken palliative care system that sees up to one in four Brits who would benefit from this type of care being unable to access it, rather than discussing again this dangerous and ideological policy,\u201d he said. Charlie Falconer, the Labour former justice secretary, has introduced a separate assisted dying bill in the House of Lords, which is expected to be debated in mid-November.",

Plans for the base were the reason the UK severed the Chagos Islands from the rest of Mauritius when it granted the latter independence in 1968 and forcibly displaced up to 2,000 people. There was a mixed reaction to the announcement from Chagossians, not all of whom are happy that sovereignty has been handed to Mauritius.

What does my body, my choice really mean?\u201d</p> <p>The news of Melania Trump\u2019s support for abortion rights comes at a time when her husband is striving to convince voters that he can be trusted to protect abortion rights.</p> <p>In the years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, abortion has become Republicans\u2019 achilles heel. It cost Republicans victories in the 2022 midterms, while abortion rights supporters have won a string of ballot measures even in states as red as Kentucky, Kansas and Ohio.</p> <p>Earlier on in his campaign, Trump attempted to be all-things-abortion to everybody, alternately bragging about his role in overturning Roe \u2013 by appointing three of the justices who voted for its demise \u2013 and grousing that hardline positions on abortion were costing the GOP elections. But since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a>, an extraordinarily effective messenger on abortion, became the Democratic nominee for president, he has abandoned that approach in favor of garbled support for abortion rights.</p> <p>\u201cWOMEN WILL BE HAPPY, HEALTH, CONFIDENT AND FREE!\u201d Trump recently posted on Truth Social. \u201cYOU WILL NO LONGER BE THINKING ABOUT ABORTION, BECAUSE IT IS NOW WHERE IT ALWAYS HAD TO BE, WITH THE STATES.\u201d</p> <p>Melania Trump\u2019s revelation, then, could be intended to reassure undecided voters who are disinclined to vote for Harris but support abortion rights \u2013 as a majority of Americans do.

      "bodyText": "When news broke on Wednesday evening that Melania Trump supports abortion rights \u2013 and apparently has for her entire adult life \u2013 it was greeted with surprise and confusion. Melania\u2019s husband, Donald Trump, is trying to rapidly recalibrate his approach to abortion as he races towards election day. Is his wife trying to help him? Hurt him? Or neither? In her forthcoming memoir, Melania Trump went into extensive detail about her support for the procedure. \u201cWhy should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?\u201d she wrote. \u201cA woman\u2019s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.\u201d Shortly after the Guardian broke the news, Trump uploaded a black-and-white video of herself to social media, set to stirring music. \u201cWithout a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth,\u201d she said. \u201cIndividual freedom. What does my body, my choice really mean?\u201d The news of Melania Trump\u2019s support for abortion rights comes at a time when her husband is striving to convince voters that he can be trusted to protect abortion rights. In the years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, abortion has become Republicans\u2019 achilles heel. It cost Republicans victories in the 2022 midterms, while abortion rights supporters have won a string of ballot measures even in states as red as Kentucky, Kansas and Ohio. Earlier on in his campaign, Trump attempted to be all-things-abortion to everybody, alternately bragging about his role in overturning Roe \u2013 by appointing three of the justices who voted for its demise \u2013 and grousing that hardline positions on abortion were costing the GOP elections. But since Kamala Harris, an extraordinarily effective messenger on abortion, became the Democratic nominee for president, he has abandoned that approach in favor of garbled support for abortion rights. \u201cWOMEN WILL BE HAPPY, HEALTH, CONFIDENT AND FREE!\u201d Trump recently posted on Truth Social. \u201cYOU WILL NO LONGER BE THINKING ABOUT ABORTION, BECAUSE IT IS NOW WHERE IT ALWAYS HAD TO BE, WITH THE STATES.\u201d Melania Trump\u2019s revelation, then, could be intended to reassure undecided voters who are disinclined to vote for Harris but support abortion rights \u2013 as a majority of Americans do. But Tresa Undem, a pollster who has surveyed people on abortion for more than two decades, said the odds of such comments appealing to moderates or abortion-supporting conservatives were \u201cfairly slim\u201d. After all, regardless of her personal convictions, it seems unlikely that Melania Trump has any real sway over her tempestuous husband\u2019s policies. Her pro-abortion rights beliefs did not stop Donald Trump from helping to demolish Roe. It also doesn\u2019t help that Melania and Donald Trump\u2019s relationship is, at least in public, far from cozy. (He recently indicated, despite having written the foreword, that he hasn\u2019t read the book.) \u201cNothing Republicans say will distract the American people from the reality they see with their own eyes: story after story of victims of rape and incest being forced into pregnancy, doctors forced to turn away patients during miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies and women literally dying because of Trump\u2019s abortion bans,\u201d Emilia Rowland, Democratic national committee press secretary, said in a text.

      "body": "<p>Consider these two parallel universes. One is Gaza, the scene of some of the worst atrocities committed in the 21st century, as Israel\u2019s genocidal rampage offers a new reminder of our species\u2019 capacity for depravity. According to <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org.uk/media/press-releases/more-women-and-children-killed-in-gaza-by-israeli-military-than-any-other-recent-conflict-in-a-single-year/\">research by Oxfam</a>, more women and children have been killed by the Israeli military in the last year \u201cthan the equivalent period of any other conflict over the past two decades\u201d.</p> <p>What makes this all the more disturbing is that the figures are conservative: the 11,355 children and 6,297 women <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org.uk/media/press-releases/more-women-and-children-killed-in-gaza-by-israeli-military-than-any-other-recent-conflict-in-a-single-year/#:~:text=It%20was%20compared%20with%20the,are%20women%20and%2011%2C355%20children.\">listed</a> as violently killed are only those who have been officially identified. Many of the dead have not been recorded in this way, not least the thousands buried under rubble, listed as missing, or incinerated by Israeli missiles, leaving not a trace. Israel\u2019s destruction of Gaza\u2019s hospitals, too, has laid waste to the system of reporting fatalities. Those caveats notwithstanding, in no 12-month period were so many women and children butchered in the killing fields of Iraq and Syria, despite those populations being much greater than Gaza\u2019s.</p> <p>Then there is a fresh revelation about Israel\u2019s deliberate attempt to starve Gaza\u2019s population. Last week the US investigative outlet ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/gaza-palestine-israel-blocked-humanitarian-aid-blinken\">reported</a> that the US Agency for International Deveopment (USAid) \u2013 a government department \u2013 had delivered a detailed assessment to the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, concluding that Israel was intentionally blocking the deliveries of food and medicine to Gaza. The agency described Israel \u201ckilling aid workers, razing agricultural structures, bombing ambulances and hospitals, sitting on supply depots and routinely turning away trucks full of food and medicine\u201d.</p> <p>In a particularly egregious example, food was stockpiled less than 30 miles across the border at an Israeli port, including sufficient flour to feed most Gazans for five months; it was deliberately withheld. The state department\u2019s refugee agency also concluded Israel was deliberately blocking aid, and recommended the use of US legislation that mandates the freezing of weapons shipments to states blocking US-backed aid. But Blinken rejected these assessments, and the US government has just approved another military aid package, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-says-it-has-secured-87-billion-us-aid-package-2024-09-26/\">worth $8.7bn</a>, to a state its own agencies have concluded is deliberately starving the population of Gaza.</p> <p>Now transport yourself to another universe: that of the British political elite. Two Tory leadership candidates have proposed making loyalty to Israel a central feature of Britishness. The frontrunner, Robert Jenrick, declares the Star of David should be <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/robert-jenrick-israel-tory-conference-b2621106.html\">displayed</a> at every point of entry to Britain to show \u201cwe stand with Israel\u201d. Kemi Badenoch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/29/kemi-badenoch-not-all-cultures-equally-valid-immigration\">declares</a> she is struck \u201cby the number of recent immigrants to the UK who hate Israel\u201d, adding: \u201cThat sentiment has no place here.\u201d Meanwhile, after Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack \u2013 with no reported Israeli casualties \u2013 the UK\u2019s prime minister, Keir Starmer, passionately declares, \u201cWe stand with Israel\u201d, in an official Downing Street address.

      "bodyText": "Consider these two parallel universes. One is Gaza, the scene of some of the worst atrocities committed in the 21st century, as Israel\u2019s genocidal rampage offers a new reminder of our species\u2019 capacity for depravity. According to research by Oxfam, more women and children have been killed by the Israeli military in the last year \u201cthan the equivalent period of any other conflict over the past two decades\u201d. What makes this all the more disturbing is that the figures are conservative: the 11,355 children and 6,297 women listed as violently killed are only those who have been officially identified. Many of the dead have not been recorded in this way, not least the thousands buried under rubble, listed as missing, or incinerated by Israeli missiles, leaving not a trace. Israel\u2019s destruction of Gaza\u2019s hospitals, too, has laid waste to the system of reporting fatalities. Those caveats notwithstanding, in no 12-month period were so many women and children butchered in the killing fields of Iraq and Syria, despite those populations being much greater than Gaza\u2019s. Then there is a fresh revelation about Israel\u2019s deliberate attempt to starve Gaza\u2019s population. Last week the US investigative outlet ProPublica reported that the US Agency for International Deveopment (USAid) \u2013 a government department \u2013 had delivered a detailed assessment to the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, concluding that Israel was intentionally blocking the deliveries of food and medicine to Gaza. The agency described Israel \u201ckilling aid workers, razing agricultural structures, bombing ambulances and hospitals, sitting on supply depots and routinely turning away trucks full of food and medicine\u201d. In a particularly egregious example, food was stockpiled less than 30 miles across the border at an Israeli port, including sufficient flour to feed most Gazans for five months; it was deliberately withheld. The state department\u2019s refugee agency also concluded Israel was deliberately blocking aid, and recommended the use of US legislation that mandates the freezing of weapons shipments to states blocking US-backed aid. But Blinken rejected these assessments, and the US government has just approved another military aid package, worth $8.7bn, to a state its own agencies have concluded is deliberately starving the population of Gaza. Now transport yourself to another universe: that of the British political elite. Two Tory leadership candidates have proposed making loyalty to Israel a central feature of Britishness. The frontrunner, Robert Jenrick, declares the Star of David should be displayed at every point of entry to Britain to show \u201cwe stand with Israel\u201d. Kemi Badenoch declares she is struck \u201cby the number of recent immigrants to the UK who hate Israel\u201d, adding: \u201cThat sentiment has no place here.\u201d Meanwhile, after Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack \u2013 with no reported Israeli casualties \u2013 the UK\u2019s prime minister, Keir Starmer, passionately declares, \u201cWe stand with Israel\u201d, in an official Downing Street address. Here is a man who has not mustered the tiniest fraction of that emotion for the tens of thousands of Arabs slaughtered by Israel, from Palestine to Lebanon. What word is there for that disparity in response, other than racism? Fortunately, these are not the universes inhabited by the British public. Two thirds of voters now have an unfavourable view of Israel, compared with 17% opting for favourable: a record low. Seven in 10 believe it likely that Israel has committed war crimes (just 8% dissent), while 54% believe an arrest warrant should be issued for Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes and crimes against humanity (with 15% dissenting). But this devotion to Israel among our rulers has survived both unspeakable atrocities and ever more repulsed public opinion. In a rational world, advocating a heartfelt alliance with a state engaged in such murderous mayhem would leave you driven from public life in disgrace; here it is the mainstream, respectable position, with those dissenting demonised as hateful extremists. What exactly is Israel supposed to do to shake this? It has conducted the worst massacre of children in our time, from reported sniper shots to the heads of infants to butchering terrified families in their cars, and now it is clear it deliberately starved an entire population. It stands accused of raping male and female detainees alike, while Save the Children condemns Israeli soldiers for sexually abusing Palestinian children in prisons. It has killed at least 885 healthcare workers, and left women having caesarians and children having amputations without anaesthetics. Its soldiers push Palestinian bodies from roofs in scenes reminiscent of Islamic State. Meanwhile, Israeli ministers, politicians, army officers, soldiers and journalists compete over bloodcurdling murderous and genocidal rhetoric. If a state hostile to the west was guilty of atrocities this obscene, there would be widespread consensus that it was one of the great crimes of our age.

      "bodyText": "The UK has agreed to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, ending years of bitter dispute over Britain\u2019s last African colony. The Foreign Office insists that the deal will \u201csettle historic sovereignty claims, protect our national security and close a potential illegal migration route\u201d. It has been welcomed by figures ranging from President Biden to Jeremy Corbyn. But all four Tory leadership candidates have strongly criticised the decision, claiming it is a sign of weakness and a risk to national security, even though one of them, James Cleverly, was foreign secretary, when the talks on transferring sovereignty started. In a statement to parliament on 3 November 2022, Cleverly said: The UK and Mauritius have agreed to engage in constructive negotiations, with a view to arriving at an agreement by early next year. David Clark, a Labour former special adviser in the Foreign Office, accused Cleverly of blatant hypocrisy. Well this is disappointing. I thought Cleverly was a cut above the populist buffoons around him. Turns out he\u2019s just as much of a hyperbolic truth-twister as the rest of them. The negotiations to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands were initiated by him as a Minister. Hundreds of homeless young people, including dozens who are pregnant or have children, are being illegally turned away by councils when they ask for help, the Guardian has learned. Keir Starmer has repaid thousands of pounds in freebies to restore trust in politics, a minister has said as she ruled out accepting more hospitality. Boris Johnson has insisted he would have won another election if he had not been forced from Downing Street, arguing in his new memoir that he broke no rules with lockdown parties and was the victim of a conspiracy. Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader who now sits in the Commons as an independent MP, has been campaigning on behalf of Chagossians for many years. He has welcomed today\u2019s announcement as a \u201cmilestone for decolonisation\u201d. Keir Starmer\u2019s polling figures have not been great recently but, according to these YouGov figures, on at least one metric he is doing very well; some 79% of people approve of his decision to return donations worth \u00a36,000. Back to the homelessness figures (see 10.33am, 11.16am and 12pm), and Vicky Spratt, the housing journalist, has posed these on social media explaining what they mean. Bleak statistics today explain why temporary accommodation is probably the biggest immediate problem faced by Labour... New govt figures show that the number of households facing homelessness has exceeded (320,000) between 2023-2024, the highest on record. This is an 8% rise on 2022-2023 and means that the population of homeless people in England is now greater than the population of Nottingham (stat is from @crisis_uk). The number of households forced to live in temporary accommodation remains at record levels with 117,450 households housed like this by their council. That\u2019s a 12.3% rise on last year. As of 31 March 2024, a fifth of all households with children in temporary accommodation (22.5%) had been there for 5 years or more. There are now 151,630 children living in temporary accommodation, which is enough to fill 5,700 classrooms...just let that sink in... Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has released a statement about the UK\u2019s deal with Mauritius about the Chagos Islands. If anything, it is even more positive about it than President Biden\u2019s. (See 2.03pm.) Here\u2019s an extract. The United States welcomes today\u2019s historic agreement between the Republic of Mauritius and the United Kingdom on the status of the Chagos Archipelago. The United States has strongly supported negotiations between the two countries over the past two years and is pleased to see the successful outcome of this diplomatic effort. Kemi Badenoch has joined the other three Tory leadership candidates (see 12.31pm) in claiming that the government\u2019s decision to return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius creates a security risk. Two days after Israel is attacked directly by Iran, Labour have put our vital base in the Indian ocean at risk. Anyone who has been paying attention to the geopolitical climate will understand the strategic necessity of these islands. Labour has either not been paying attention or don\u2019t care. Either way, this decision weakens UK influence across the world. As mentioned already, the government says the deal will \u201cprotect our national security\u201d. The US government takes the same view. (See 2.03pm.) Unusually, a Labour MP has criticised the Chagos Islands decision. But, unlike the opposition, Peter Lamb is not opposed to the return of sovereignty. He wanted Chagossians to be deciding their own future. This is very disappointing. The decision over the future of the islands belongs the Chagossian people, it\u2019s not for the UK to bargain away. 60 years on from their exile, they\u2019ve been let down again. Lamb is MP for Crawley, where he used to be council leader. The town is home to the largest community of Chagossians in the UK (around 3,500). Back to the Boris Johnson book, and John Crace, the Guardian\u2019s sketch writer, has also been taking a look at it. Weirdly, Jennifer Arcuri does not feature in the index of Boris Johnson book Turns out that his wedding to Carrie was one of the happiest days of Boris Johnson\u2019s life. Mainly because he wasn\u2019t paying for it Owen Bowcott has written a good analysis of the Chagos Islands deal. He says Liz Truss was PM when the UK government started talks with Mauritius about transferring sovereignty. \u201cShe may have been keen on removing a diplomatic obstacle to post-Brexit British trading relations in Asia,\u201d he says. Here is the full article. The risk to peace in Northern Ireland from Brexit was exaggerated and was used by opponents \u201cto trap the UK in the EU\u201d, Boris Johnson has claimed in his memoir, Peter Walker reports. Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, has joined those Tories criticising the Chagos Islands deal. This is a shameful decision. Starmer\u2019s reckless capitulation over the Chagos Islands severely undermines UK national security. We all knew Lammy was weak but now it\u2019s official: he\u2019s China\u2019s useful idiot too. A dark day for our country\u2019s sovereignty. Tom Tugendhat, the former security minister and Tory leadership candidate, has suggested that China could end up establishing a military base on one of the Chagos Islands as a result of the UK\u2019s decision to cede sovereignty. Britain will still have delegated sovereignty over Diego Garcia, the only inhabited island in the archipelago and the site of UK/US airbase which is regarded as being of key strategic significance by London and Washington. But, in an interview with the World at One, Tugendhat said that under the deal announced today Mauritius has not given assurances that it will not lease any of the other islands to another country. \u201cMauritius is free to rent them out to anybody else, including, for example, China,\u201d he said. Tugendhat, who chaired the Commons foreign affairs committee before he became a minister, said that he did not accept the government\u2019s argument (see 1.40pm) had to surrender sovereignty because it was losing cases in international courts. He cited Robert Buckland, the former justice secretary, as one of several lawyers who have said the International Court of Justice was wrong to rule against the UK on this (Buckland wrote about this here) and Tugendhat said the UK could have ignored the court\u2019s advisory opinion anyway. Tugendhat said he agreed the Chagossians had been treated shamefully. But he said they could have been allowed to return without sovereignty being transferred, and he claimed the Mauritian government was not interested in their plight until they took it up for political reasons in the 1990s. And he was particularly critical of James Cleverly, his Tory leadership rival and a former foreign secretary, for starting negotiations on the transfer of sovereignty. This is another area where, I\u2019m afraid, we\u2019re seeing legalism replacing leadership. And we saw this legalism in the Foreign Office in November 2022 [when Cleverly was foreign secretary] when the Foreign Office was pushing for this and nobody stopped it until finally we got leadership under Lord Cameron [Cleverly\u2019s successor as foreign secretary]. Asked to respond to Jonathan Powell\u2019s claims that he was just engaged in posturing for Tory leadership contest purposes (see 1.40pm), Tugendhat said that Powell had been a Labour activist for many years and that his criticism of Tugendhat was \u201csilly\u201d because he (Tugendhat) had been opposing plans to transfer sovereignty of the islands for many years. It was an issue he took up as foreign affairs committee chair, he said. Nigel Farage also claimed the Chagos Islands deal would make Washington \u201cfurious\u201d. (See 2.01pm.) But President Biden has issued a statement welcoming the proposed treaty. In it is he said: I applaud the historic agreement and conclusion of the negotiations between the Republic of Mauritius and the United Kingdom on the status of the Chagos Archipelago. It is a clear demonstration that through diplomacy and partnership, countries can overcome long-standing historical challenges to reach peaceful and mutually beneficial outcomes. This agreement affirms Mauritian sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, while granting the United Kingdom the authority to exercise the sovereign rights of Mauritius with respect to Diego Garcia. Diego Garcia is the site of a joint U.S.-UK military facility that plays a vital role in national, regional, and global security. It enables the United States to support operations that demonstrate our shared commitment to regional stability, provide rapid response to crises, and counter some of the most challenging security threats we face. The agreement secures the effective operation of the joint facility on Diego Garcia into the next century. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has also criticised the decision to return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, calling it a \u201cstrategic disaster\u201d. Giving up the Chagos Islands is a strategic disaster. Our American allies will be furious and Beijing delighted. Labour are making the world a more dangerous place. In his interview on the World at One Jonathan Powell, the former Tony Blair aide who helped to negotiate the Chagos Islands/Mauritius deal as an envoy for Keir Starmer, said the Chagossians were treated \u201cshamefully\u201d when they removed from the islands in the 1960s. He said: What we did in 60s, what Britain did, was wrong. We treated them shamefully. And that\u2019s why previous governments have given them British nationality, British citizenship, and so on. So we setting up a fund that will be administered with the Mauritian government, because this is now Mauritian territory, so we can\u2019t say who goes back. Powell said that, under the deal, Chagossians will not be able to return to Diego Garcia, where Britain will retain delegated sovereignty for at least 99 years. (See 1.19pm.) But they would be able to return to other islands if they wanted, he said. Many of Chagossians are either Mauritian citizens or have the right to Mauritian citizenship. Going back to the islands \u2026 it\u2019s going to be difficult. They\u2019re very remote and very hard to live on, and the life there before was very difficult. But yes, we are committing ourselves to helping on visits, and we\u2019re committing to a fund to help on resettlement, if that\u2019s possible. Jonathan Powell, who as Tony Blair\u2019s chief of staff played a major role in negotiating the Good Friday agreement, had a key role in finalising the Chagos Islands\u2019 deal. Only a month ago he was appointed by Keir Starmer to be his special envoy on the negotiations with Mauritius over the future of the islands. In an interview with Radio 4\u2019s the Word at One, Powell said that over the past month he had negotiated \u201cintensively\u201d and to get this agreement and that the deal was \u201cgenuinely historic\u201d. He was also scathing about the comments from the three Tory leadership candidates on the deal. (See 12.31pm.) Asked for his reaction, he said: I do think these comments from the Tory leadership candidates are a bit silly. James Cleverly was leading these negotiations not that many months ago with the Mauritian government [when he was foreign secretary]. The reason the British government started negotiating with the Mauritians was because of the law cases. We lost a law case at the ICJ [International Court of Justice], and then we lost another on in the Law of the Sea tribunal. Legal advice was clear that we were not going to be able to sustain that position. So that previous government started a negotiation. What this government has done has been able to conclude it, because that government managed to lose the trust of the Mauritian government during the process. So for the people who were involved in that negotiation to start criticising the outcome of something they couldn\u2019t achieve is absolutely ludicrous. When it was put to Powell that the previous government did not want a deal like this, he did not accept that. No, it\u2019s not because of that. The negotiators who\u2019ve been working on this are the same civil servants all the way through. It\u2019s because they are criticising it because they want to try and score points in their desperate attempt to win the leadership. Grant Shapps, the Tory former defence secretary, has also criticised the decision to give Mauritius sovereignty of the Chagos Islands. He posted this on social media. This is absolutely appalling. Surrendering sovereignty here creates read across to other British bases. It\u2019s a weak and deeply regrettable act from this government: British governments until now refused to give up sovereignty of the Chagos Islands because of the strategic importance of the Diego Garcia airbase, which is mostly used by the US. Under the agreement announced today, Britain will be able to exercise sovereignty rights over the base for at least 99 years. The joint statement from both governments says: Both our countries are committed to the need, and will agree in the treaty, to ensure the long-term, secure and effective operation of the existing base on Diego Garcia which plays a vital role in regional and global security. For an initial period of 99 years, the United Kingdom will be authorised to exercise with respect to Diego Garcia the sovereign rights and authorities of Mauritius required to ensure the continued operation of the base well into the next century. The Reform UK MP Rupert Lowe has also criticised the government\u2019s decision to return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, suggesting means Gibraltar\u2019s future as a British overseas territory could be at risk. He posted these on social media. The British Government is now actively undermining British interests overseas. A total surrender. Speaking to contacts in Gibraltar, they are incredibly concerned following the Chagos Islands capitulation - \u2018the thin end of the wedge\u2019... The message is loud and clear - this Labour Government is a disgrace. Russell Findlay taken part in first minister\u2019s questions since he was elected as the new Scottish Conservative leader last Friday. The baptism was barely fiery. With only a hint of nerves at the beginning of his questioning, the former investigative journalist had a decent first outing, interrogating John Swinney on the SNP government\u2019s plans for a national care service, after revelations that more than \u00a328m had been spent on the project \u2013 which would centralise adult social care and social work into a single service - just days after councils pulled their support. Swinney responded that he supported the new service to deal with precisely the issues like delayed discharge that Findlay was setting out. He also lost no time in reminding the chamber that Findlay was a supporter of Liz Truss \u2013 no doubt a theme the SNP will return to frequently in coming months. Findlay would be wise to spend his early days as leader repairing trust amongst his group of MSPs after a surprisingly bitter leadership campaign. But he must also take on the challenge posed by Reform UK after the party managed to secure 7% of the vote share across Scotland, despite having no infrastructure or leadership north of the border. He also needs to navigate a change of emphasis as all candidates for the top job agreed it was time to stop relying on opposition to independence as their guiding principle. Three of the four Tory leadership candidates have issued statement strongly denouncing the government\u2019s decision to return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. Robert Jenrick, the favourite in the contest, called this a \u201cdangerous capitulation\u201d. It\u2019s taken three months for Starmer to surrender Britain\u2019s strategic interests. This is a dangerous capitulation that will hand our territory to an ally of Beijing. James Cleverly, who was foreign secretary when the last government was in talks with Mauritius about giving it back sovereignty over the islands, accused Labour of being weak and unpatriotic. Weak, weak, weak! Labour lied to get into office. Said they\u2019d be whiter than white, said they wouldn\u2019t put up taxes, said they\u2019d stand up to the EU, said that they be patriotic. All lies! And Tom Tugendhat, a former security, claimed this move would undermine the UK\u2019s security. In a dig at Cleverly, he also said it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that the last government started negotiations with Mauritius about a sovereignty transfer. This is a shameful retreat undermining our security and leaving our allies exposed. @FCDOGovUK has negotiated against Britain\u2019s interest &amp; it was disgraceful that these negotiations started under our watch. Lord Cameron rightly blocked them only to see it back under David Lammy\u2019s complete failure of leadership. The government rejects claims the deal poses a security risk. It argues that move will \u201cprotect our national security\u201d. UPDATE: Kemi Badenoch, the fourth candidate still in the Tory leadership contest, has also attacked the decision. See 4.42pm. In its the news release about the agreement to return sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, the government says this deal will close a potential illegal migration route. It explains: The UK and Mauritius have reached a historic agreement to secure the strategically important UK-US military base on Diego Garcia, which plays a crucial role in regional stability and international security. For the first time in more than 50 years, the status of the base will be undisputed and legally secure, following a political agreement between the UK and Mauritius \u2026 Without today\u2019s agreement, the long-term, secure operation of the military base would be under threat, with contested sovereignty and legal challenges \u2013 including through various international courts and tribunals \u2026 Diego Garcia has also seen a small number of vulnerable migrants arrive since 2021, subsequently launching asylum claims. The agreement will shut down any possibility of the Indian Ocean being used as a dangerous illegal migration route to the UK, with Mauritius taking responsibility for any future arrivals. In a statement, David Lammy, the foreign secretary, said: Today\u2019s agreement secures this vital military base for the future. It will strengthen our role in safeguarding global security, shut down any possibility of the Indian Ocean being used as a dangerous illegal migration route to the UK, as well as guaranteeing our long-term relationship with Mauritius, a close Commonwealth partner. And here is the text of the joint statement from the UK and Mauritius about the deal. Keir Starmer spoke to Pravind Jugnauth, the prime minister of Mauritius today, following the deal to return sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to his country. But No 10 stressed that, under the deal, he UK/US military base on Diego Garcia will continue to be able to operate. In its summary of the call between the two prime ministers, Downing Street said: The leaders began by welcoming the political agreement achieved today between the UK and Mauritius on the exercise of sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago after two years of negotiations. The prime minister reiterated the importance of reaching this deal to protect the continued operation of the UK/US military base on Diego Garcia. He underscored his steadfast duty to national and global security which underpinned the political agreement reached today. The homelessness figures from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Governmment out today suggest that rough sleeping in England increased by 14.2% in the year ending in March 2024. They show there were 16,680 households who were rough sleeping when they approached a local authority for help with housing in 2023-24. Commenting on the figures, Vikki Slade, the Lib Dem housing spokesperson, said: It is heartbreaking to think that so many families and children will be on the streets or without a place to call home this winter. For years, the previous Conservative government chose to ignore the thousands that are rough sleeping and broke their promise to ban no fault evictions. The new government must address this awful situation as a matter of urgency and that starts by publishing a cross-Whitehall plan to end all forms of homelessness within this parliament. Slade said today\u2019s figures also show that the number of households living in temporary accommodation reached 117,450 in March 2024 - the highest figure since these records began in 1998. There are different measures of rough sleeping. There is also an annual count of how many people are rough sleeping one night in the autumn, and the figure for autumn 2023 was 3,898. That was a 27% increase on the previous year, but the government said that was partly the result of homelessness returning to levels it was at before the Covid measures to bring people off the streeets brought it down dramatically. The UK has agreed to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, ending years of bitter dispute over Britain\u2019s last African colony, Haroon Siddique reports. Today\u2019s homelessness figures highlight the need for the government to press on with banning no-fault evicitions, campaigners say. The figures show a 4.6% increase in the number of households in England threatened with homelessness because an assured shorthold tenancy has come to an end. The last government promised to abolish section 21 evictions (so-called because section 21 of the Housing Act allows no-fault evictions with two months\u2019 notice), but it never implemented this promise and Labour is now doing this with its renters\u2019 rights bill. Tom Darling, director of the Renters\u2019 Reform Coalition, said: It\u2019s frankly ridiculous section 21 still exists \u2013 we\u2019re approaching 6 years since the previous government first promised to abolish it, while every indicator on the dashboard has been going in the wrong direction. And now we discover homelessness caused by evictions is up almost 5% on the previous year. It\u2019s clear from today\u2019s data that that the renting crisis is driving the homelessness crisis \u2026 Amid this escalating social crisis, the government\u2019s renters\u2019 rights bill is absolutely crucial. This legislation is a significant improvement on the last government\u2019s effort. As drafted it will already make a difference for a lot of people. The number of households in England needing help with homelessness rose by more than 10% last year, according to figures released by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. In a report out today with homelessness figures for the financial year ending in March 2024, it says \u201cinitial assessments were made for 358,370 households in England in 2023-24, up 10.4% from the previous year\u201d. The report says: 146,430 households were assessed as being threatened with homelessness and therefore owed a prevention duty in 2023-24. This is a 3.1% increase from 2022-23. The increase from 2022-23 has been influenced by a 4.6% increase, to 57,340 households, in those threatened with homelessness due to the end of an assured shorthold tenancy. \u2026 178,560 households were assessed as homeless and therefore owed a relief duty in 2023-24. This is up 12.3% from 2022-23. Similar to increases in prevention duties, this also has been influenced by an 8.9% increase, to 22,160 households, in those threatened with homelessness due to the end of an assured short hold tenancy. The homelessness figures cover familes that get help from local authorities either as a result of the prevention duty (an obligation to help a household threatened with homelessness) or the relief duty (an obligation to help households already homeless). These figures apply to people who get placed in temporary accommodation, such as B&amp;B rooms. These are the the same as the rough sleeping figures, which cover people sleeping on the streets. Commenting on the figures, Rick Henderson, CEO at Homeless Link, a body representing homlessness services, said: Everyone needs a safe and secure place to live, but alarmingly the number of people being threatened with or forced into homelessness continues to surge, exposing people\u2019s lives to trauma. Vital homelessness support services are at breaking point and many councils \u2013 spending the lion\u2019s share of their budgets on temporary accommodation \u2013 are facing bankruptcy. Urgent action is needed. Building social housing and the promised cross-government strategy should reduce homelessness in the long-term, while the renters rights bill will help prevent homelessness among people renting privately. But a cliff-edge in homelessness funding is looming in March 2025. The government must therefore use the autumn budget to provide financial certainty for homelessness services. John McTernan, who was political secretary to Tony Blair when Blair was PM, was also on the Today programme this morning discussing Keir Starmer\u2019s record with freebies, and he said he agreed with John Penrose (see 9.52am) that the problem was not rules being broken, but public perception. He explained: Politicians have to not only act by the rules, they have to act by community standards. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that voters are angry, the community\u2019s angry, about about what they see as double standards. And the absolute fundamental rule of politics is the voters are never wrong. Rule one of politics is the votes are never wrong. Rule two, if you\u2019re angry because you think the votes are wrong, please refer to rule number one. McTernan said people were angry because stories about donations have coincided with the government cutting winter fuel payments for pensioners. The backdrop to every single thing that the Labour party has done in government has been its first action to take them into fuel allowance away from 10 million pensioners. That has set the tone for everything, and it\u2019s the backdrop for for how actions are seen. People see that you\u2019ve taken this from 10 million people, and taking that for free from businesses. That\u2019s the truth. There\u2019s anger out there, and behaviour has to change. On the Today programme this morning John Penrose, a former Tory MP who was the government\u2019s anti-corruption tsar, said that he thought the controversy about Keir Starmer accepting donations showed that the rules probably needed tightening. But he also argued that the problem was not related to rules being breached, but political perception. He said: I think that the rules aren\u2019t bad, although they need to be strengthened a bit \u2026 But this isn\u2019t really about what the rules say. This is about whether or not we\u2019ve got someone who\u2019s not behaving like a lawyer, but rather behaving like politician who understands why people are upset. And the rules don\u2019t really cover the idea of, \u2018Isn\u2019t there a double standard here, for example, between living the high life, you and your ministers, while you\u2019re taking money from from pensioners\u2019. Those aren\u2019t really ever going to be covered by any set of rules you could imagine. That\u2019s a question of political judgment, political judgment, political understanding and being in tune with what the rest of the country is actually thinking when you\u2019re sitting there at No 10. Good morning. Yesterday Keir Starmer made the surprise announcement that he has paid back \u00a36,000 worth of gifts and hospitality, including Taylor Swift tickets and rented clothing for his wife, received since he became prime minister. The news overshadowed reports about what happened on his visit to Brussels to meet the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen (also important \u2013 here\u2019s our story), but No 10 felt they had to put the news out yesterday because the donations were all being revealed in the latest update to the Commons register of members\u2019 interests published yesterday. However, as is often the case when a politician under pressure over ethics/transparency makes a concession to critics/the media/public opinion, Starmer has now opened himself up to a whole new bout of questions. The Conservative party (which has a lot of experience of donation scandals) is on the case, and last night it issued this statement. Day after day more and more comes out about the scandal at the top of Keir Starmer\u2019s government. This scandal has become a complete distraction from the job of governing. It appears Starmer will only be transparent when his back\u2019s against the wall. This announcement today poses more questions than it answers. Why did Starmer take these freebies in the first place? Why haven\u2019t Angela Rayner and other senior party members not paid back donations? Starmer said yesterday that his government would be drawing up new \u201cprinciples\u201d to cover political donations and No 10 indicated that Starmer was not saying it was always unacceptable for ministers to accept donations. This article by Peter Walker looks at some of the other revelations in yesterday\u2019s updated register of members\u2019 interests. We\u2019re likely to get more on this as the day goes on. Parliament is still in recess, and there is not a lot in the diary. Boris Johnson\u2019s memoir is out today; it has already been serialised extensively in the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, but today journalists will get their chance to find the bits that Mail might not have been keen to highlight. There are homelessness statistics out. And David Lammy, the foreign secretary, is due to visit Dublin with Nick Thomas-Symonds, the minister dealing with Brexit-related issues. If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line (BTL) or message me on social media. I can\u2019t read all the messages BTL, but if you put \u201cAndrew\u201d in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. I\u2019m still using X and I\u2019ll see something addressed to @AndrewSparrow very quickly. I\u2019m also trying Bluesky (@andrewsparrowgdn) and Threads (@andrewsparrowtheguardian). I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos (no error is too small to correct). And I find your questions very interesting too. I can\u2019t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.",

The former prime minister\u2019s book, Unleashed, also reveals that he believed the risk to peace in Northern Ireland from Brexit was exaggerated and was used by opponents \u201cto trap the UK in the EU\u201d. Settling scores with a number of Conservative former colleagues, he calls David Cameron\u2019s departure as PM immediately after the Brexit vote a \u201cflouncerama\u201d and details his sadness and anger when Michael Gove stood against him to be Tory leader in 2016. What is likely to be the most controversial part of the book comes near the end, where Johnson writes about the revelations over lockdown-breaking No 10 parties, one of a string of controversies that forced him from office in July 2022. Johnson was among more than 100 people fined for breaching restrictions in Downing Street, but in the book he writes: \u201cAt the time we believed that these events were in accordance with the rules \u2013 and I still think they were.\u201d His only mistakes, he adds, were \u201cgrovelling\u201d in response and allowing a \u201cridiculous and unfair witch-hunt\u201d \u2013 a reference to the report on Partygate led by Sue Gray, then a senior civil servant.

      "body": "<p>Clive Everton, who has died aged 87, was known to millions worldwide as the calm, authoritative voice of televised snooker, but of even greater importance was his work as a campaigning journalist for better governance of the game.</p> <p>Through his editing of the magazine Snooker Scene for 50 years, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/09/snooker.sport\">his writing for the Guardian</a> and other newspapers, Clive was engaged in a near-constant battle with snooker\u2019s governing bodies as, he wrote in his 2007 memoir <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Black_Farce_and_Cue_Ball_Wizards.html?id=57J0LgEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\">Black Farce and Cue Ball Wizards</a>, they \u201cfrittered away its potentialities through incompetence, mismanagement and worse\u201d. </p> <p>In his role as the game\u2019s moral conscience, Clive was to have 20 court cases with snooker\u2019s authorities over the decades, all of which he won. He believed, however, that this persistence later affected the commentary career for which he became best known and loved.</p> <p>He began commentating while still a competitive snooker player in the second half of the 1970s, for regional ITV companies. After winning the 1977 national pairs title alongside Roger Bales, Clive joined the BBC on its coverage of the 1978 World Championship from the Crucible in Sheffield. </p> <p>As a commentator, Clive was formal in style, always referring to players by their surname, and maintaining professional distance, even during the snooker boom of the 80s, when figures such as Steve Davis and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jul/25/alex-higgins-obituary-snooker-champion\">Alex Higgins</a> were household names. He used an old-fashioned lip microphone, which he would leave \u201copen\u201d between shots. This would mildly frustrate certain co-commentators, who preferred to chat with each other, but Clive insisted they focused on the action. On occasion, former professional players who were new to commentary would receive the sound advice from Clive that \u201cless is more\u201d. </p> <p>His own command of the English language was such that he would capture the moment with a few succinct, perfectly chosen words. Following the retirement of \u201cWhispering\u201d Ted Lowe after the 1996 World Championship, Clive\u2019s status as the voice of snooker was cemented. </p> <p>Yet, despite his popularity with audiences, Clive believed that his clashes with the sport\u2019s governing body, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), led to numerous attempts by the organisation to remove him from his commentary work. In 1985, he was sacked momentarily, only for Jonathan Martin, the BBC\u2019s head of sport, to immediately reinstate him.</p> <p>\u201cThis was far from the last such attempt,\u201d Everton wrote, \u201cand several ignoble hearts must have been gladdened when, in the face of public opinion, I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jan/10/snooker-clive-everton\">marginalised virtually to vanishing point in 2009</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, Clive remained in demand on Sky Sports\u2019 coverage of Premier League Snooker, and in 2013, when ITV returned to snooker, he was hired as their lead commentator, a role he held up to the end of his career at the 2019 Champion of Champions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In 1956, he won the British under-19 billiards championship, and won the Welsh amateur title on five occasions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Born in Worcester, Clive was the son of Alma and Harold Everton, who had a transport business. The boy\u2019s fascination with cue sports began when his father took him to the plush fauteuils of Leicester Square Hall, then the home of the professional game. There, Clive witnessed his first century break, compiled by Sidney Smith, and he was hooked.</p> <p>It was accepted wisdom in those days that you needed to master English billiards before you could make it as a snooker player, and Clive played both games whenever he could. In 1952, the fledgling BBC Television showed the final of the British under-16 billiards championship, in which Clive was playing John Lambert, from the womb-like amphitheatre of Burroughes &amp; Watts, Soho Square, on a Saturday afternoon. Clive won the match comfortably, and the winner\u2019s trophy was presented to him by the England cricketer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/apr/05/sir-alec-bedser-obituary\">Alec&nbsp;Bedser</a>.</p> <p>When Clive returned to King\u2019s school, Worcester, there was no praise from the headmaster, who did not consider billiards an honourable pursuit. This hardened Clive\u2019s anti-establishment instincts, which were to stay with him into adulthood, as did his love of billiards. In 1956, he won the British under-19 championship, and in 1960 the Welsh amateur title for the first of five occasions, the last coming in 1999. He reached the final of the English amateur championship five times.</p> <p>He turned professional as a snooker player in 1981, but was already well into his 40s by then, and had developed an exaggerated playing style following major back surgery that saw him twist into each shot. Nevertheless, he reached a high of 47 in the world rankings in 1983-84, and continued to hold professional status until 1991.</p>    <p>As a youth he also excelled at tennis, and he was good enough to remain part of the Worcestershire team for 13 years. In 1961, during County Week, the inter-county grass court championships, Clive was in a winning pair that beat Mike Sangster two weeks before he reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon. </p> <p>Aged 19, Clive met Valerie Teasdale while studying at the City of Birmingham College of Commerce; he later got an English degree from Cardiff University. Clive and Valerie married in 1961. </p> <p>Following a brief period teaching, from 1966 to 1970, Clive edited a magazine called Billiards and Snooker, which was owned by the now defunct Billiards and Snooker Control Council (B&amp;SCC).</p> <p>Around this period, Clive was also the Birmingham Post\u2019s hockey correspondent and manager of Jonah Barrington, the world No 1 squash player. Needing a sponsor for Jonah\u2019s tour, Clive approached the former BBC Come Dancing and cricket host <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/sep/03/broadcasting.guardianobituaries\">Peter West </a>and the marketing executive Patrick Nally, who were setting up a sports sponsorship consultancy. They agreed to include squash in their pitch, as well as asking Clive for any other ideas. He suggested hockey and snooker; the latter placing the four best professionals in a league. Peter took this to the BBC, which agreed to show the 1970 final highlights on Grandstand (this became a tournament that evolved by 1975 into the Masters), and Clive put the four players on the front of Billiards and Snooker magazine. </p> <p>The then B&amp;SCC chairman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/aug/02/guardianobituaries.sport\">Jack Karnehm</a>, was incensed at Clive \u201cgiving professionals publicity\u201d, and had him sacked; Clive immediately set up a rival magazine, World Snooker, with the first issue being published just three weeks later, in January 1971. The following year, the B&amp;SCC asked Clive to take on their magazine, its circulation having dropped so low, and the two publications merged to become Snooker Scene, which he edited until 2022, and which I now edit. </p> <p>Clive continued to investigate and report on the sport\u2019s internal strife and mismanagement in Snooker Scene each month, and at the Guardian, where he was snooker correspondent between 1976 and 2011, while at the weekends his work appeared in the Sunday Times for many years and later in the Independent on Sunday. He also wrote more than 20 books on the sport. </p> <p>It was of considerable comfort to Clive that he was able to witness professional snooker\u2019s revival in fortunes from late 2009 onwards under the WPBSA chairmanship of Barry Hearn. </p> <p>By 2017, Clive had made his peace with the organisation, and they in turn inducted him into the World Snooker Hall of Fame. Two years later he was appointed MBE. In 2022, the British Open snooker tournament cup was named the Clive Everton Trophy.</p> <p>He is survived by Valerie and their five children, Jane, Julie, Kate, Lucy and Dan. </p> <p>\u2022 Clive Harold Everton, snooker player, commentator and journalist, born 7 September 1937; died 27 September 2024<em> </em></p>",

Nevertheless, he reached a high of 47 in the world rankings in 1983-84, and continued to hold professional status until 1991. As a youth he also excelled at tennis, and he was good enough to remain part of the Worcestershire team for 13 years. In 1961, during County Week, the inter-county grass court championships, Clive was in a winning pair that beat Mike Sangster two weeks before he reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon. Aged 19, Clive met Valerie Teasdale while studying at the City of Birmingham College of Commerce; he later got an English degree from Cardiff University. Clive and Valerie married in 1961. Following a brief period teaching, from 1966 to 1970, Clive edited a magazine called Billiards and Snooker, which was owned by the now defunct Billiards and Snooker Control Council (B&amp;SCC). Around this period, Clive was also the Birmingham Post\u2019s hockey correspondent and manager of Jonah Barrington, the world No 1 squash player. Needing a sponsor for Jonah\u2019s tour, Clive approached the former BBC Come Dancing and cricket host Peter West and the marketing executive Patrick Nally, who were setting up a sports sponsorship consultancy. They agreed to include squash in their pitch, as well as asking Clive for any other ideas. He suggested hockey and snooker; the latter placing the four best professionals in a league. Peter took this to the BBC, which agreed to show the 1970 final highlights on Grandstand (this became a tournament that evolved by 1975 into the Masters), and Clive put the four players on the front of Billiards and Snooker magazine. The then B&amp;SCC chairman, Jack Karnehm, was incensed at Clive \u201cgiving professionals publicity\u201d, and had him sacked; Clive immediately set up a rival magazine, World Snooker, with the first issue being published just three weeks later, in January 1971. The following year, the B&amp;SCC asked Clive to take on their magazine, its circulation having dropped so low, and the two publications merged to become Snooker Scene, which he edited until 2022, and which I now edit. Clive continued to investigate and report on the sport\u2019s internal strife and mismanagement in Snooker Scene each month, and at the Guardian, where he was snooker correspondent between 1976 and 2011, while at the weekends his work appeared in the Sunday Times for many years and later in the Independent on Sunday. He also wrote more than 20 books on the sport. It was of considerable comfort to Clive that he was able to witness professional snooker\u2019s revival in fortunes from late 2009 onwards under the WPBSA chairmanship of Barry Hearn. By 2017, Clive had made his peace with the organisation, and they in turn inducted him into the World Snooker Hall of Fame. Two years later he was appointed MBE. In 2022, the British Open snooker tournament cup was named the Clive Everton Trophy. He is survived by Valerie and their five children, Jane, Julie, Kate, Lucy and Dan. \u2022 Clive Harold Everton, snooker player, commentator and journalist, born 7 September 1937; died 27 September 2024",

Producers drill into shale and other rocks deep underground, then pump in water, chemicals and sand to form cracks and release oil and gas.</p> <p>By providing access to once hard-to-reach oil, the technology unlocked oil and gas reserves across 20 US states including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas\">Texas</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a>. It is now the most commonly used fossil fuel extraction method in the United States.</p> <p>Since the fracking boom, US oil production has surged at a historic rate. No country in history has extracted as much oil and gas as the US has in each of the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545\">past six years</a>, and gas has become the country\u2019s most commonly used electricity source, eclipsing coal.</p> <h2>Why is fracking so controversial?</h2>  <p>Fracking is controversial because of its environmental and health impacts.

      "bodyText": "Kamala Harris reiterated that she won\u2019t ban fracking on Wednesday in an interview with KDKA-TV, the CBS affiliate in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Though the US vice-president once backed a ban on the fuel extraction process, she said on Wednesday that she changed her mind since joining Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign in 2020 and has since remained firm. The statement comes as she and Donald Trump compete for votes in Pennsylvania, a swing state with 20 seats in the electoral college and a major gas producer. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, has been running ads claiming that if elected, Harris would enshrine a ban on fracking, costing Pennsylvania over 300,000 jobs. Here\u2019s an introduction to the gas and oil extraction process that has transformed the US fossil fuel industry. What is fracking? Hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking, is a method of extracting fossil fuels. Producers drill into shale and other rocks deep underground, then pump in water, chemicals and sand to form cracks and release oil and gas. By providing access to once hard-to-reach oil, the technology unlocked oil and gas reserves across 20 US states including Texas and Pennsylvania. It is now the most commonly used fossil fuel extraction method in the United States. Since the fracking boom, US oil production has surged at a historic rate. No country in history has extracted as much oil and gas as the US has in each of the past six years, and gas has become the country\u2019s most commonly used electricity source, eclipsing coal. Why is fracking so controversial? Fracking is controversial because of its environmental and health impacts. Scientists have long warned that the world must phase out fossil fuels to preserve a livable climate. The drilling technique can also contaminate drinking water. Many Americans\u2019 introduction to these risks came from the 2010 documentary Gasland, which memorably showed a homeowner who was able to light on fire the water flowing out of his kitchen tap More than 17.6 million people live within a mile of a fracked well, researchers found in 2022, with those living in close proximity to wells commonly reporting health issues ranging from headaches and nosebleeds to low infant birth weights and endocrine disruption. Pennsylvania researchers have found that children living close to active wells or near many wells had a higher risk for developing lymphoma, a kind of cancer. The practice is also water-intensive, and has been linked to earthquakes. But it has become part of a larger culture war, with some rightwingers believing that calls to end fracking are anti-American calls from the so-called \u201cwoke left\u201d. Is fracking actually bad for the climate? Fracking is used to produce fossil fuels, which account for the vast majority of all planet-heating pollution. A 2022 report found that planned US fracking projects could release 140bn metric tons of planet-heating gases, tipping the world toward climate disaster. But fracked gas has long been pitched by companies and even some environmentalists as a \u201cbridge fuel\u201d, or a temporary solution to transition from coal to renewable energy sources. When burned, gas emits about half of the greenhouse gas emissions of coal per unit of energy, and it can also have a smaller land footprint than coalmines. Some studies, however, suggest fracked gas may be even worse for the climate than coal throughout its life cycle from extraction to transport to usage. Importantly, fracking for gas can lead to leaks of methane \u2013 a greenhouse gas that warms the planet far faster than carbon dioxide \u2013 which research suggests are routinely underreported. The US is aiming to reduce emissions by at least 50% by 2030, but, under current plans supported by green policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, is on track to see only a drop between 32% and 43% by that time period, researchers have found. Why is fracking such an issue in the 2024 election? Trump has been a staunch supporter of the fossil fuel industry. On Tuesday, he reminded viewers that Harris once supported a ban on fracking\u2013 something he said would devastate the Pennsylvania and US economy. During her 2019 presidential campaign, Harris did back an end to fracking. But in July, her campaign said she was no longer in favor of such a policy, to the disappointment of green groups and some climate-concerned Americans. The prioritization of \u201cenergy independence\u201d is often viewed as a point in favor of continued fossil fuel extraction including fracking. But oil and gas are part of a global market, and every US president in the past 75 years has continued to import foreign fossil fuels. And some argue that clean energy could play an important role in untethering US energy supply from volatile energy markets. In her Wednesday interview with KDKA, the Harris said Trump\u2019s campaign ads were intentionally misleading. \u201cI\u2019m going to bring jobs back to rural communities.

And I\u2019m going to keep doing that work,\u201d she said. Pennsylvania, where polls show Harris and Trump are neck and neck in the polls, is the second-largest gas producer in the US \u2013 and also an important swing state in the presidential election. But Pennsylvanians have decidedly mixed opinions on fracking, with a 2020 survey finding that a slight majority of Pennsylvanians \u2013 52% \u2013 actually oppose fracking, and a 2021 poll by the progressive thinktank Ohio River Valley Institute finding that less than a third of residents saying they want fracking in their state. Some Americans are concerned about a loss of fracking jobs, which have already been steadily declining, including in Pennsylvania. Research shows clean energy currently employs eight times more people in Pennsylvania than gas.",

      "body": "<p>At a stroke, this government could wipe out much of the extra child poverty caused by the last government. It would be a bargain, at a cost of just \u00a32.5bn, revealed today in the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/sites/default/files/2024-10/Child-poverty-trends-and-policy-options_1.pdf\">assessment for the next budget</a>. Authors Anna Henry and Tom Wernham have found the two-child benefit cap added significantly to the rising numbers of children thrown into poverty since 2010. Their findings make it all the more inconceivable that Labour would not scrap the two-child limit at this month\u2019s budget. Nothing else it could spend on would have such instant effect and long-term value. Nothing else would please Labour voters as much.</p> <p>Chancellors rarely get the opportunity to do so much, so easily and relatively cheaply. How much is \u00a32.5bn? That depends on how you look at it. Out of a total spend of over \u00a31tn, it\u2019s a \u201crounding-up error\u201d, says Ben Zaranko, senior IFS economist. But then he adds, \u201cit\u2019s not trivial either\u201d. It would be enough to resolve the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/mar/09/why-access-to-legal-aid-is-impossible-for-those-who-need-it-most\">legal aid crisis</a> blocking the courts, for example. It would do much for prisons, \u201cor for councils struggling with social care and Send crises,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Drawing up her budget, the chancellor has to weigh the imponderables of relative good done.<em><strong> </strong>\u201c</em>The language of priorities is the religion of socialism,\u201d Nye Bevan famously proclaimed, but that doesn\u2019t help much in deciding among them.

      "bodyText": "At a stroke, this government could wipe out much of the extra child poverty caused by the last government. It would be a bargain, at a cost of just \u00a32.5bn, revealed today in the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 assessment for the next budget. Authors Anna Henry and Tom Wernham have found the two-child benefit cap added significantly to the rising numbers of children thrown into poverty since 2010. Their findings make it all the more inconceivable that Labour would not scrap the two-child limit at this month\u2019s budget. Nothing else it could spend on would have such instant effect and long-term value. Nothing else would please Labour voters as much. Chancellors rarely get the opportunity to do so much, so easily and relatively cheaply. How much is \u00a32.5bn? That depends on how you look at it. Out of a total spend of over \u00a31tn, it\u2019s a \u201crounding-up error\u201d, says Ben Zaranko, senior IFS economist. But then he adds, \u201cit\u2019s not trivial either\u201d. It would be enough to resolve the legal aid crisis blocking the courts, for example. It would do much for prisons, \u201cor for councils struggling with social care and Send crises,\u201d he says. Drawing up her budget, the chancellor has to weigh the imponderables of relative good done. \u201cThe language of priorities is the religion of socialism,\u201d Nye Bevan famously proclaimed, but that doesn\u2019t help much in deciding among them. Means-testing the winter fuel allowance saved \u00a31.5bn: it would have been better to announce it as a direct transfer of money from mainly better-off pensioners to the poorest children. In hard utilitarian terms, anything done for children has the greatest long-term reward.

Hepworth Brewery expects to cut the emissions from wort boiling \u2013 an essential step in beer-making to extract flavour \u2013 by using a heat pump that can produce steam at a temperature of up to 130C. The new heating system will recycle the waste vapour from the brewing process, which is normally vented into the air, by using the heat pump to raise the temperature of the steam back to 130C before returning it to the brewer. The heat pump prototype, designed by a start-up based in south-west London, is expected to lower the brewer\u2019s fuel costs by 40% and could soon be used to power the full brewing process, it said. Andy Hepworth, the founder and chairman of Hepworth Brewery, said the government-backed project would enable the company to \u201cswitch off our oil boiler\u201d in favour of the \u201creliable new way to recycle our waste heat\u201d. Heat pumps are expected to play a major role in the government\u2019s ambition to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 in line with its legally binding climate targets.

Because non-Spanish-speaking migrant farm workers were often an afterthought (then and now), there were few Covid-specific health resources in the Krey\u00f2l language Haitians speak.</p> <p>I\u2019m a scholar of Haitian migration, and much of my writing and research is inspired by my own family history. My <a href=\"https://amsterdamnews.com/news/2023/02/16/new-york-citys-newest-centenarian-lamercie-oge-petit/\">paternal grandmother</a> arrived in the US in 1963, and my father joined her in New York a few years later. I grew up knowing about urban Haitian enclaves all over the US, from Queens to Miami\u2019s Little Haiti. However, few people have documented or even know about Haitian life in the rural US, especially in the south.</p>    <p>Acting as an intermediary between English-speaking nurses and the Haitian migrants, I saw a different part of the Haitian diaspora in small-town America. By now, most of us have heard that thousands of Haitians have migrated to Springfield, Ohio, to escape volatility at home. In Springfield, they boosted an ailing midwestern factory sector only to become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/14/racist-history-trump-pet-eating-immigrant\">targets of racist rhetoric</a> from the Trump-Vance ticket and others.</p> <p>It\u2019s become popular to spread false narratives about Haitians, to deride our community as one of criminals and resource vampires. Those unfair charges ignore the history of how western powers plundered Haiti, undermined its existence and fostered systemic crisis.</p> <p>Haiti\u2019s role in world food systems dates to the 1700s when French colonizers called it the \u201cPearl of the Antilles\u201d. During the transatlantic slave trade, it ranked among the world\u2019s top sugar and coffee producers. When the Haitian Revolution brought the end of slavery on the island and its leaders declared their independence, Napoleon Bonaparte obsessed over the loss of his empire\u2019s crown jewel. France later forced the young country to reimburse former enslavers for losing their once-captive workforce \u2013 an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/15/france-haiti-independence-debt\">indemnity of 150m francs </a>with added interest over time. For decades, the US and other countries refused to recognize Haiti, the world\u2019s first independent Black nation. And we wonder why Haiti is the poorest country in the hemisphere, after centuries of extraction, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/world/haiti-wall-street-us-banks.html\">Wall Street-fomented US occupation</a> and a succession of coup d\u2019\u00e9tats.</p> <p>The workers I met in Whiteville were far from \u201ctakers\u201d or \u201cillegals\u201d. They held H-2A visas that permit approved businesses to hire foreign labor when US workers aren\u2019t available or interested in open jobs. Bruce McLean Jr, an extension agent in Columbus county, believes that anywhere from 20% to 25% of all blueberry pickers in south-eastern North Carolina are Haitian.</p> <p>The Whiteville Haitians picked blueberries by hand from mid-June to August. Blueberry pickers often make money by the bucket or box; according to the US Department of Labor, the going wage should be <a href=\"https://seasonaljobs.dol.gov/jobs/H-300-24053-738126\">50 cents a pound for seasonal labor</a>, assuming workers actually make that. In October 2023, the labor department <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20231023\">fined a Sampson county, North Carolina, farm contractor</a> for stiffing blueberry workers out of their last weeks of wages, taking their passports and even charging them fees to work in the H-2A program.</p> <p>The six-week season is intense, with long workdays in blistering heat and rain. Beyond the general physical exertion and working in an unfamiliar place, workers are also exposed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/18/fruits-vegetables-most-pesticide-risk\">pesticides that linger on the berries</a> or soil. They are sometimes shuttled from farm to farm because it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/07/13/484015376/for-pickers-blueberries-mean-easier-labor-but-more-upheaval\">\u201calways blueberry season somewhere\u201d</a>. This group of workers would be moving in 10 days, and that made it all the more important to vaccinate them before their next stop.</p> <p>At Covid\u2019s height, their very status as farm workers put them at high risk. I understood this instantly when I knocked on doors to find a bathroom. One woman allowed me in, and I saw substandard housing in a mildewy old motel. Although the group in Whiteville was working in the open air, they shared cramped housing without appropriate safety measures. Days or weeks of lodging in a room with four twin beds and one shower made privacy and social distancing impossible.</p> <p>But there was no time to be sick. Relatives back home \u2013 in places like L\u2019Est\u00e8re, known for its luscious rice fields, or La Gon\u00e2ve island north-west of Port-au-Prince \u2013 were sending frequent WhatsApp messages asking for financial help. Cellphones are a lifeline for these workers, connecting them to family or online church services. The likelihood of attending Sunday mass locally was slim without their own transportation. And when you\u2019re a migrant berry picker, there\u2019s almost always more work to do.</p> <h2>The Springfield, Ohio, of North Carolina</h2> <p>Seventy miles away, Haitian labor flocked to Mount Olive, an agricultural town known for its pickle company of the same name (and also being the site of a <a href=\"https://labornotes.org/2024/09/farmworker-union-hold-new-election-two-years-after-controversial-vote\">long struggle to organize farm workers</a> for better conditions).</p> <p>There are no good estimates of how many Haitians have come to Mount Olive. Advocates usually say that about 3,000 to 4,000 Haitians arrived after 2010. Pastor Occene Louis of the First Haitian Baptist church thinks that as many as 10,000 have passed through Mount Olive, coming from Brazil or Chile and then moving to other North Carolina cities. A large enough number stayed in Mount Olive that he said the town doesn\u2019t have enough housing; he knows of households with a dozen residents.</p> <p>Perhaps the US census sheds the best, though still imperfect, light on Mount Olive migration patterns. In 2000, Black residents of Mount Olive made up 12% of the population. Twenty years later, they constituted 49%.</p> <p>The town\u2019s now-deceased longtime mayor, Ray McDonald, acknowledged the essential role that Haitians play in the local economy in the film <a href=\"https://vimeopro.com/toddtaylor/todd-taylor-unc-chapel-hill/video/114367940\">Home Away from Haiti.</a></p> <p>He said: \u201cWe need \u2019em worse than they need us, as most of the locals will simply not do that work. It is very hard work. It is dirty work. Again, if they went away, a lot of our major production facilities would have to struggle.\u201d</p> <p>In poultry processing, Haitians drive delivery trucks, butcher carcasses and trim skin from the meat. It\u2019s not only dirty work; it\u2019s dangerous. A town resident told me one laborer lost his hand.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/22/springfield-ohio-haitian-restaurants\">Ohio residents flock to Springfield\u2019s Haitian restaurants: \u2018They are family\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-17039167\">beneficial Haitian invasion</a>\u201d met with various responses. Some longstanding residents were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ourstate.com/mount-olive-welcomed-haitian-immigrants-created-community/\">big-hearted\u201d and welcoming</a>. Others sold their homes and left.</p> <p>Former resident Paulette Bekolo lived in Mount Olive for several years starting in 2011 and saw the growing pains. She found herself advocating for basic rights for Haitian and other workers. Bekolo met with some poultry plants\u2019 human resources departments because \u201cthe working conditions were awful. Some of them were denied basic toilet breaks. They were humiliated peeing on them[selves].\u201d She organized classes in English as a second language, first aid and immigrant rights to help her compatriots fit in.</p> <p>Haitians have left an undeniable mark on the town. Haitian supermarkets have popped up and sell <em>lalo</em> (jute leaves) for stew. While attending a church service was largely out of reach for the Whiteville seasonal workers, Mount Olive\u2019s more established community has seven churches vying for their attendance and souls. Some offer services and Bible study in Krey\u00f2l.</p> <p>In Whiteville, the only business near the moldy motel where Haitians resided was a farm advertising its strawberries, likely picked by other migrants. Women cooked over open fires in a parking lot \u2013 a sign of just how transient this migrant community was. The chef there asked me, \u201c<em>Cherie, ki sa ou vle?</em>\u201d (Honey, what do you want?) as she grabbed the vegetable oil.</p> <p>In Mount Olive, I was served a kitchen-prepared plate of macaroni, rice, beans and meat, and was invited to sit with church congregants. The smells of simmering onions and vegetables in both towns reminded me of my grandmother\u2019s food. I was at home in another part of the country, being fed by Haitian women who help feed us all.</p>",

Bruce McLean Jr, an extension agent in Columbus county, believes that anywhere from 20% to 25% of all blueberry pickers in south-eastern North Carolina are Haitian. The Whiteville Haitians picked blueberries by hand from mid-June to August. Blueberry pickers often make money by the bucket or box; according to the US Department of Labor, the going wage should be 50 cents a pound for seasonal labor, assuming workers actually make that. In October 2023, the labor department fined a Sampson county, North Carolina, farm contractor for stiffing blueberry workers out of their last weeks of wages, taking their passports and even charging them fees to work in the H-2A program. The six-week season is intense, with long workdays in blistering heat and rain. Beyond the general physical exertion and working in an unfamiliar place, workers are also exposed to pesticides that linger on the berries or soil. They are sometimes shuttled from farm to farm because it\u2019s \u201calways blueberry season somewhere\u201d. This group of workers would be moving in 10 days, and that made it all the more important to vaccinate them before their next stop. At Covid\u2019s height, their very status as farm workers put them at high risk. I understood this instantly when I knocked on doors to find a bathroom. One woman allowed me in, and I saw substandard housing in a mildewy old motel. Although the group in Whiteville was working in the open air, they shared cramped housing without appropriate safety measures. Days or weeks of lodging in a room with four twin beds and one shower made privacy and social distancing impossible. But there was no time to be sick. Relatives back home \u2013 in places like L\u2019Est\u00e8re, known for its luscious rice fields, or La Gon\u00e2ve island north-west of Port-au-Prince \u2013 were sending frequent WhatsApp messages asking for financial help. Cellphones are a lifeline for these workers, connecting them to family or online church services. The likelihood of attending Sunday mass locally was slim without their own transportation. And when you\u2019re a migrant berry picker, there\u2019s almost always more work to do. The Springfield, Ohio, of North Carolina Seventy miles away, Haitian labor flocked to Mount Olive, an agricultural town known for its pickle company of the same name (and also being the site of a long struggle to organize farm workers for better conditions). There are no good estimates of how many Haitians have come to Mount Olive. Advocates usually say that about 3,000 to 4,000 Haitians arrived after 2010. Pastor Occene Louis of the First Haitian Baptist church thinks that as many as 10,000 have passed through Mount Olive, coming from Brazil or Chile and then moving to other North Carolina cities. A large enough number stayed in Mount Olive that he said the town doesn\u2019t have enough housing; he knows of households with a dozen residents. Perhaps the US census sheds the best, though still imperfect, light on Mount Olive migration patterns. In 2000, Black residents of Mount Olive made up 12% of the population. Twenty years later, they constituted 49%. The town\u2019s now-deceased longtime mayor, Ray McDonald, acknowledged the essential role that Haitians play in the local economy in the film Home Away from Haiti. He said: \u201cWe need \u2019em worse than they need us, as most of the locals will simply not do that work. It is very hard work. It is dirty work. Again, if they went away, a lot of our major production facilities would have to struggle.\u201d In poultry processing, Haitians drive delivery trucks, butcher carcasses and trim skin from the meat. It\u2019s not only dirty work; it\u2019s dangerous. A town resident told me one laborer lost his hand. This \u201cbeneficial Haitian invasion\u201d met with various responses. Some longstanding residents were \u201cbig-hearted\u201d and welcoming. Others sold their homes and left. Former resident Paulette Bekolo lived in Mount Olive for several years starting in 2011 and saw the growing pains. She found herself advocating for basic rights for Haitian and other workers. Bekolo met with some poultry plants\u2019 human resources departments because \u201cthe working conditions were awful. Some of them were denied basic toilet breaks. They were humiliated peeing on them[selves].\u201d She organized classes in English as a second language, first aid and immigrant rights to help her compatriots fit in. Haitians have left an undeniable mark on the town. Haitian supermarkets have popped up and sell lalo (jute leaves) for stew. While attending a church service was largely out of reach for the Whiteville seasonal workers, Mount Olive\u2019s more established community has seven churches vying for their attendance and souls. Some offer services and Bible study in Krey\u00f2l. In Whiteville, the only business near the moldy motel where Haitians resided was a farm advertising its strawberries, likely picked by other migrants. Women cooked over open fires in a parking lot \u2013 a sign of just how transient this migrant community was. The chef there asked me, \u201cCherie, ki sa ou vle?\u201d (Honey, what do you want?) as she grabbed the vegetable oil. In Mount Olive, I was served a kitchen-prepared plate of macaroni, rice, beans and meat, and was invited to sit with church congregants. The smells of simmering onions and vegetables in both towns reminded me of my grandmother\u2019s food. I was at home in another part of the country, being fed by Haitian women who help feed us all.",

Check with your doctor to see if these are likely side-effects of any medications you may be taking.</p> <p>But certain changes may indicate more serious health concerns. Some are harmless or will go away on their own, and some may need to be treated by a dentist or physician. According to Ren, most people aren\u2019t seeing their dentist nearly enough, and therefore don\u2019t have a medical professional assessing the state of their tongue and mouth. \u201cIn this country, only about 40% of the population sees a dentist regularly,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p> <p>Here are some common tongue changes to keep an eye out for:</p> <p><strong>Bright red color</strong>: A bright red tongue, sometimes known as \u201c<a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/strawberry-tongue\">strawberry tongue</a>\u201d if it\u2019s accompanied by a bumpy texture, could signal a number of conditions, including allergies, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/kawasaki/about/index.html\">Kawasaki disease</a>, toxic shock syndrome, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/20/scarlet-fever-cases-in-uk-more-than-double-during-autumn-and-winter\">scarlet fever</a> and a vitamin B12 deficiency.</p> <p><strong>White patches</strong>: Depending on their texture, white patches on the tongue could signal different conditions. Milky white patches that feel painful to brush or scrape could be a sign of <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10956-thrush\">oral thrush</a>, says Scannapieco. This is a kind of yeast infection which is more common in babies, infants, people over 65 and those with weakened immune systems. It\u2019s treated with antifungal medications.</p> <p>If the white patches are thick and cannot be scraped off, it may be a sign of <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leukoplakia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354405#:~:text=Leukoplakia%20(loo%2Dkoh%2DPLAY,the%20exact%20cause%20of%20leukoplakia.\">leukoplakia</a>, which is sometimes considered a precancerous condition, says Ren.</p> <p><strong>Yellowish color</strong>: \u201cIf someone is accumulating a yellowish green debris on their tongue, that could indicate poor oral hygiene,\u201d says Lim. This color of debris also tends to build up more in patients who smoke, she adds.</p> <p><strong>Red patches with a raised, white border:</strong> This is known as \u201cgeographic tongue\u201d, because these spots tend to move around, appearing in different areas from one day to the next. It\u2019s common \u2013 Ren estimates that roughly 30% of the population will experience it at some point. It\u2019s also painless, benign and incurable. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what causes geographic tongue,\u201d says Lim. She says some literature points to it being an autoimmune condition, and for some of her patients, it seems to be associated with higher levels of stress.</p> <p><strong>Small sores</strong>: Small sores on the tongue or the soft tissue of the mouth are probably canker sores. These can be caused by mouth injuries (biting your own tongue, for example, or irritation from braces), stress, hormonal shifts and some allergies and food sensitivities, according to the <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/canker-sore/symptoms-causes/syc-20370615\">Mayo Clinic</a>. They may also be a sign of certain autoimmune conditions like Crohn\u2019s disease or celiac disease.</p> <p><strong>Black color</strong>: Tongues can appear black or dark brown if the papillae aren\u2019t shed regularly and grow longer than usual, allowing them to trap bacteria and debris in the mouth. This can cause a condition called \u201cblack hairy tongue\u201d. It\u2019s more commonly seen in patients who are immunocompromised, says Lim. In patients with HIV whose CD4 white blood cells are low, for example, their bodies may not be able to fight off everyday bacteria or fungi that then accumulate in the mouth.</p> <h2><strong>How does one keep their tongue healthy?</strong></h2> <p>\u201cThe tongue, unfortunately, is something we often ignore,\u201d says Scannapieco.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say you have to do a lot to keep it clean.

Off the pitch, their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2016/may/26/aston-villa-european-cup-relegated-1982\">Big Cup Boys of 1982</a> were hosted at an official function held to honour their historic achievement, while their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/16/gary-shaw-aston-villa-dies-1982-european-cup-hero\">recently departed comrade Gary Shaw</a> was remembered on the front of yesterday\u2019s matchday programme. In another classy touch, the former striker was also listed one last time on a team-sheet, his name appearing at the bottom of the list of current squad of Villa players trying to emulate the achievements of he and his teammates.</p> <p>Having paid through the nose for their tickets, the home fans were absolutely determined to get their money\u2019s worth and with the visit of such exalted opponents, Villa Park was rocking to the kind of raucous din you just don\u2019t get for the visit of the likes of Fulham. Following a tentative start that suggested they were playing the occasion rather than the game, it took a disallowed Pau Torres goal on 22 minutes for Villa\u2019s players to realise Bayern were in fact fallible and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/02/aston-villa-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report\">they went on to win</a> courtesy of another supersub Jhon Dur\u00e1n\u2019s goal-of-the-season contender, as well as several breathtaking saves from Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, who with each passing match appears to grow at least two extra tentacles. \u201cIt\u2019s the loudest Villa Park I\u2019ve heard since I joined the club, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said the Argentinian keeper after the game. \u201cIt was hurting my ears at some points. It\u2019s a club that\u2019s moving forward.

      "bodyText": "THRILLER AT THE VILLA While Aston Villa showed a deficit of class by gouging their supporters when it came to the admission fee, the club got pretty much everything else spot on ahead of last night\u2019s win over Bayern Munich. Off the pitch, their Big Cup Boys of 1982 were hosted at an official function held to honour their historic achievement, while their recently departed comrade Gary Shaw was remembered on the front of yesterday\u2019s matchday programme. In another classy touch, the former striker was also listed one last time on a team-sheet, his name appearing at the bottom of the list of current squad of Villa players trying to emulate the achievements of he and his teammates. Having paid through the nose for their tickets, the home fans were absolutely determined to get their money\u2019s worth and with the visit of such exalted opponents, Villa Park was rocking to the kind of raucous din you just don\u2019t get for the visit of the likes of Fulham. Following a tentative start that suggested they were playing the occasion rather than the game, it took a disallowed Pau Torres goal on 22 minutes for Villa\u2019s players to realise Bayern were in fact fallible and they went on to win courtesy of another supersub Jhon Dur\u00e1n\u2019s goal-of-the-season contender, as well as several breathtaking saves from Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, who with each passing match appears to grow at least two extra tentacles. \u201cIt\u2019s the loudest Villa Park I\u2019ve heard since I joined the club, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said the Argentinian keeper after the game. \u201cIt was hurting my ears at some points. It\u2019s a club that\u2019s moving forward. That\u2019s the main reason why I want to stay at this football club.\u201d A club that are moving backwards, Manchester United are in Portugal for a comparatively low-key Bigger Vase adventure tonight as they try to bounce back from Sunday\u2019s embarrassment at home to Tottenham, and it seems inconceivable that their owners haven\u2019t noticed how Villa have been utterly transformed under Unai Emery. Appointed before Emery, Erik ten Hag continues to bleat incessantly about needing more time and of player knack, while the Spaniard leads Villa from strength to strength, just getting on with his job without so much as mentioning the rotten run of knack with which he has had to contend. \u201cAs always when we are not winning, we are very disappointed and we are also mad; mad with ourselves and especially when you lose a game like Sunday,\u201d said Ten Hag before United\u2019s match against Porto. \u201cWe are mad and from the madness we have to get motivation and go on to the next game.\u201d And while the Dutchman may have channelled his inner Howard Beale by announcing that he and his players are as mad as hell and not going to take this any more, one suspects it is a sentiment that is increasingly echoed by the high-performance boffins and marginal gains enthusiasts who currently stalk the Old Trafford corridors of power.

What our latest report on financial crime shows is that social media platforms not only continue to enable fraud, but that the issue is just as bad today as it was last year. Victims and financial institutions still ultimately bear the cost. These platforms share no responsibility in reimbursing victims, and so they have no incentive to do anything about it. A commitment to data sharing, albeit needed, simply isn\u2019t good enough.</p> <p>We are confident in the steps the UK government is taking to tackle fraud, but what is urgently needed now is for Meta and other social media companies to commit to supporting victims of fraud in the same way financial institutions do. Their silence on this issue says it all.</p> <p>We are prepared to do our part to keep customers safe, and so should they. We should be the last line of defence, not the only line of defence.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Meta\u2019s</strong> plans, and <strong>Revolut\u2019s</strong> criticism, come as the government

      "bodyText": "Time to recap. The pound is limping home on its worst day in over 18 months, after the Bank of England reignited expectations of more rapid cuts to interest rates. Against the dollar, sterling is currently down over 1.5 cents at $1.3108, a drop of 1.2%. That would be its biggest one-day drop since March 2023, and takes the pound down to a three-week low. It\u2019s a similar position against the euro, where the pound is down 0.9% at \u20ac1.1905, again the worst fall in over 18 months. The selloff began after the governor of the Bank of England told the Guardian it could become a \u201cbit more aggressive\u201d in cutting interest rates if inflation continues to cool. Andrew Bailey said he was encouraged that cost of living pressures had not been as persistent as feared, but warned the Bank was monitoring the Middle East crisis amid fears of an oil price shock. In a wide-ranging interview, Bailey held out the prospect of Threadneedle Street becoming a \u201cbit more aggressive\u201d in cutting interest rates, provided the news on inflation continued to be good. The comments sent City analysts racing to reprice their forecasts for UK interest rates. Hubert de Barochez, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, says: The British pound fell sharply today, and we suspect that it will weaken more over the next year or so given our dovish view of Bank of England policy, the currency\u2019s still-high valuation, and stretched speculative positioning. Royal Bank of Canada now predict the Bank of England will cut rates at every meeting until next May. Elsewere, the oil price has jumped again after president Biden indicated Israel could strike Iran\u2019s oil facilities in retaliation for the missile attack earlier this week. Tesco lifted its profit forecasts, after sales in the first half of the year were stronger than expected: Bank payments can be delayed by an extra three days if lenders suspect consumers are being scammed, as part of a crackdown on booming levels of digital fraud in Britain. Lender Revolut has blasted tech giant Meta, saying it should share the costs of reimbursing fraud victims. The number of customer complaints that were unable to be resolved by water companies in England and Wales has risen by almost a third to the highest level in nearly a decade. Today\u2019s surge in the oil price was driven by the possibility that Israel\u2019s retaliation against Iran for its recent missile barrage will include strikes on the country\u2019s oil industry. Bloomberg reports: West Texas Intermediate soared as much as 5.5% to approach $74 a barrel after President Joe Biden, when asked if he would support Israel striking Iran\u2019s oil facilities, responded \u201cwe\u2019re discussing that.\u201d Biden also said he wasn\u2019t expecting Israel\u2019s retaliation to come Thursday. The oil price has hit its highest level in a month, as energy traders watch events in the Middle East closely. Brent crude has jumped by as much as 5% today to trade as high as $77.65 per barrel today, the highest since the end of August. Back on Tuesday, Brent briefly fell below $70/barrel, before surging as Iran fired missiles at Israel, fuelling fears that a regional war could begin in the Middle East. Today, the Lebanese army said that it returned fire at Israeli forces after one of its soldiers was killed in an Israeli strike. And an Iranian source has told Al Jazeera that Iran has sent a message to the US, via Qatar, saying that \u201cthe phase of unilateral self-restraint has ended\u201d. It also reportedly said any Israeli attack would meet an \u201cunconventional response\u201d that includes targeting Israeli infrastructure. Our Middle East crisis liveblog has all the details: Inki Cho, financial markets strategist consultant to brokerage Exness, says: Oil futures continued their upward trajectory on Thursday as escalating tensions in the Middle East raised concerns about potential disruptions to regional crude supplies. Risks of a larger conflict could continue to push prices to the upside. The uncertainty around the next developments could leave markets cautious. Any damage to energy infrastructure in the region could lead to more dramatic price spikes, further contributing to the bullish outlook after weeks of declines on demand concerns. In the banking world, fintech firm Revolut is calling on Meta to commit to sharing the cost of reimbursing of fraud victims. Revolut argues that Meta\u2019s new data sharing initiative with UK banks and financial institutions \u201cfalls woefully short of what\u2019s required to tackle fraud globally\u201d. Meta has announced it will expand its data sharing scheme with more financial institutions, to help stop scammers who use social networks to defraud users. Nathaniel Gleicher, Meta\u2019s global head of counter-fraud, explained: We will only beat these criminals if we work together and share relevant information related to scams. Financial institutions can share unique information with us which we can in turn use to train our systems to take action against more scams globally. But Revolut\u2019s head of financial crime, Woody Malouf, says Meta\u2019s scheme isn\u2019t good enough: These plans are baby steps, when what the industry really needs is giant leaps forward. What our latest report on financial crime shows is that social media platforms not only continue to enable fraud, but that the issue is just as bad today as it was last year. Victims and financial institutions still ultimately bear the cost. These platforms share no responsibility in reimbursing victims, and so they have no incentive to do anything about it. A commitment to data sharing, albeit needed, simply isn\u2019t good enough. We are confident in the steps the UK government is taking to tackle fraud, but what is urgently needed now is for Meta and other social media companies to commit to supporting victims of fraud in the same way financial institutions do. Their silence on this issue says it all. We are prepared to do our part to keep customers safe, and so should they. We should be the last line of defence, not the only line of defence. Meta\u2019s plans, and Revolut\u2019s criticism, come as the government brings in new rules which mean fraud victims wiill receiving up to \u00a385,000 in refunds from banks within five days of an authorised push payment scam. Banks, though, argue that technology companies must do more. Last month David Callington, the head of fraud at HSBC UK, told the Guardian that tech firms should be made to cover the cost of fraud perpetrated over their networks. The costs of fraud will also now be shared equally by the banks and payment firms on both sides of the transaction, meaning there will be a fresh burden on the companies whose accounts receive the victims\u2019 cash. Royal Bank of Canada have revised their forecasts for UK interest rates, following BoE governor Andrew Bailey\u2019s interview in the Guardian today. RBC now believes there is scope for the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee to deliver \u201cmore and faster easing than previously\u201d. They now predict the Bank will cut interest rates by 25 basis points, or a quarter of one percentage point, \u201cat successive MPC meetings between November this year and May next year.\u201d Previously, they had expected the Bank to cut in November but hold rates, at 4.75%, in December. As well as two more cuts this year (November and December, following the cut in August), they also anticipate cuts at the Bank\u2019s meetings in February, March and May. RBC say that equates to the BoE delivering 150bps of cuts in total in this current cycle to leave Bank Rate at 3.75% - 50bp more than it had penciled in hitherto. Italy\u2019s stock market is having a bad day too, as investors react to the prospect of a new windfall tax. According to Bloomberg, Italian Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti has said Italy plans to raise taxes on the companies that benefitted most from the economic turbulence of recent years in order to help bring down the country\u2019s budget deficit. In an interview for Bloomberg\u2019s Future of Finance event in Milan today, Giorgetti suggested that a number of industries could face new levies. He says: We will be approving a budget that will require sacrifices from everyone, which means taxing extra profits. It means taxing profits made and revenues made, and it is an effort that the whole country must undertake which means individuals, but also small, medium and large companies. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB share index is down 1.35% today, the biggest fall among major European markets today. Back in the markets, the pound is on track for its worst day against the euro in almost two years. The rapid repricing of the outlook for UK interest rates has pushed sterling down by over 1% against the euro. It\u2019s down 1.3 eurocents now, at \u20ac1.188. This would be the biggest one-day drop, in both points and percentage terms, since 15 December 2022. More than 300 people have been told they have had at least one conviction quashed under legislation passed to deal with the Post Office Horizon IT scandal, new figures released by the government show. The Ministry of Justice reports that 335 letters had been sent to individuals so far (to the end of September). The 335 letters cover a total of 1,030 convictions, suggesting many people are likely to have had more than one conviction quashed under the legislation. All those people will be eligible for compensation under the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme, which exonerated post office operators who had been convicted on charges including false accounting, theft and fraud. If the individual is deceased their personal representative may be eligible to submit a claim, the MoJ says. The MoJ said it aims to have written to the majority of affected individuals by early November 2024, and will be updating today\u2019s data on a monthly basis. A total of 459 individuals have had their cases assessed so far. Back in the US, there\u2019s been a small increased in the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit. The number of initial claims for jobless support rose by 6,000 last week, to 225,000. It\u2019s a little higher than expected; Wall Street had forecast 221,000 new initial claims. However, its a fairly low level by historic standards, suggesting US companies are still holding onto workers. Deutsche Bank have just published a research note on the market reaction to our interview with Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey. In it, they point out that markets have been pushing up the chances of an interest rate cut in December, as well as at November\u2019s meeting. A cut in November now looks very likely, but could the Bank actually manage two cuts by Christmas? Deutsche\u2019s strategist Shreyas Gopal writes: One simple interpretation of the Governor\u2019s comments is that it could now take an upside surprise to inflation for the MPC not to cut rates back-to-back in November and December. Previously the guidance suggested that the burden of proof was on inflation to surprise to the downside for such a shift away from the \u201cgradual\u201d pace of easing. Consistent with that interpretation, the rates market has notably increased its pricing for the December meeting. It\u2019s the largest dovish repricing of this particular meeting in over six months, though in level terms we have simply reverted to levels seen just a couple of weeks ago. The oil price is rising again today, as rising tensions between Israel and Iran worry the markets. Brent crude is up almost 2% so far today at $75.30 per barrel. Yesterday Brent touched a one-month high of $76 per barrel. As analysts at Saxo put it: The geopolitical risks in the Middle East will continue to underpin oil prices in the short-term. The drop in energy prices earlier this year had helped to pull down inflation, which is why Andrew Bailey told us that the Bank of England would be watching the oil price \u201cextremely closely to see the impact of the latest news\u201d. Over in the US, companies continued to cut jobs last month. The recruitment firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas has reported that US-based employers announced 72,821 cuts in September. Although that\u2019s a 4% decrease on August\u2019s layoffs, it\u2019s a whopping 53% more than in September 2023. And it means US companies have laid off more people so far this year, than in the first nine months of 2023. Challenger explains: For the year, companies have announced 609,242 job cuts, up 0.8% from 604,514 announced during the same period last year. Though less than a percentage point separates them, this is the first time this year that year-to-date cuts are higher than those tracked during the same period in 2023. This suggests the US labour market has lost some momentum, which may encourage the Federal Reserve to continue lowering US interest rates, as the markets already expect. The pound has been \u201cwhacked\u201d as Andrew Bailey \u201cshifts gears\u201d on the outlook for UK interest rates, says Brad Bechtel, global head of foreign exchange at investment bank Jefferies. Bechtel told clients: The BoE\u2019s Bailey spoke about becoming more aggressive on rate cuts if conditions warrant, in an article in the Guardian today. The BoE had been expected to go slower than the Fed and ECB but ultimately arrive around similar levels down the road. Bailey\u2019s comments came on the back of what he saw as continued improvement on the cost of living as inflation continues to move lower. He didn\u2019t commit to a faster pace, just mentioned it as a possibility but it was enough to send the GBP around 1.1% lower on the day and put it on the bottom of the leader board in overnight trade Here\u2019s our news story on the pound\u2019s tumble today: We also have evidence today that lower borrowing costs are leading to an uptick in the housing market. Zoopla has reported that the lowest mortgage rates for 15 months is supporting a rebound in sales market activity across the UK. They say that the number of agreed sales, and demand from buyers, are both up by more than a quarter over the last 4 weeks compared to the same period a year ago. Households that have held off making moving decisions over the last two years are returning to the market, they reckon, following recent falls in mortgage rates. Today is turning into the pound\u2019s worst day in over 18 months. Update: at 12.20pm, sterling is down around 1.2% so far today against the US dollar at around $1.31, a drop of over 1.5 cents. That would be its biggest one-day drop against the dollar since 7 March 2023. The pound has been dropping steadily through the day, after the governor of the Bank of England told the Guardian it could become a \u201cbit more aggressive\u201d in cutting interest rates if inflation continues to cool. Today\u2019s comments from Andrew Bailey have \u201cchallenged investors\u2019 expectations\u201d that the BoE, faced with persistent price pressures in the key services sector, would cut rates far more slowly than the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. So says the Financial Times, adding; Given that inflation in the UK has been higher than in the US and Europe, the market has been pricing a shallower cycle,\u201d said Athanasios Vamvakidis, global head of G10 FX strategy at Bank of America. But these comments suggest that the BoE could go faster. The pound has now fallen by around 2% against the US dollar so far this week. Around half of that is today\u2019s fall. The other half largely came on Tuesday, when Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel led investors to rush into safe-haven assets such as the dollar. This chart from brokerage XM shows major asset price changes this morning \u2013 with the pound\u2019s slide against the US dollar at the bottom: Charalampos Pissouros, senior investment analyst at XM, says Today, it was the pound\u2019s turn to tumble as BoE Governor Bailey said in an interview with the Guardian that they could turn \u201ca bit more activist\u201d on interest rate cuts if data continues to suggest progress in inflation. The market is now nearly fully convinced that a quarter point cut will be delivered in November, assigning a 65% probability for another one in December. Geopolitical risks may have prompted the Bank of England\u2019s governor to hint at faster interest rate cuts, suggests Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool. Prof Milas tells us: Andrew Bailey, and rightly so, notes that the Bank\u2019s MPC might cut more aggressively if the news on inflation continue to be good. But this is a given. So, why his comments now? It is not a coincidence that Bailey\u2019s comments coincide with geopolitical risk, fuelled by tensions between Israel and Iran, being on the rise. As my colleague Mike Ellington and I have noted in an LSE Business Review blog, rising geopolitical risk impacts negatively, and strongly, on four-quarter UK output growth within two to three quarters. My argument is that Bailey had (also) this negative output scenario in mind when talking about further interest rate cuts. The pound continues to slide against the US dollar \u2013 it\u2019s now down a cent and a half, at $1.3115, which is a three-week low. Michael Brown, senior research strategist at brokerage Pepperstone, reckons the markets may be overdoing it\u2026 Data just released by the Bank of England shows that UK businesses have trimmed their inflation expectations. The Bank\u2019s latest \u2018decision makers panel\u2019 survey shows that expectations for CPI inflation a year ahead have dropped by 0.1 percentage point to 2.6%. Firms also expect inflation to be 2.6% in three years time, which is also a drop of 0.1 percentage points compared with last month\u2019s report. These expectations are important, as they influence how fast companies will expect to raise their own prices. Firms are still expecting to make inflation-beating pay rises, too. The Bank explains: Expected year-ahead wage growth remained unchanged at 4.1% on a three-month moving-average basis in September. Annual wage growth was 5.7% in the three months to September, 0.1 percentage points lower than in the three months to August. Firms therefore expect their wage growth to decline by 1.6 percentage points over the next 12 months based on three-month averages. The DMP report also shows a small drop in business uncertainty (despite other surveys showing that confidence has been hit by worries about this month\u2019s budget). It say: Uncertainty fell in the three months to September with 48% of firms reporting that the overall level of uncertainty facing their businesses was high or very high, one percentage point lower than in the three months to August Here\u2019s a chart showing how the pound swooned as the Guardian published our interview with Andrew Bailey online: Andew Bailey\u2019s hint that the Bank of England could be \u201cmore aggressive\u201d in cutting interest rates is also moving the London stock market. Shares in housebuilders are rallying, as traders calculate that lower borrowing costs could lift demand for homes. Housebuilder Persimmon is the top riser on the FTSE 100 share index, up 3.1%, followed by rival Vistry (+2.3%) and Barratt (+2.2%). A UK interest rate cut in November now looks almost certain, the City believes. According to the latest money market pricing, a cut in Bank Rate next month to 4.75% is now a 96.5% chance, leaving only a 3.5% likelihood that the BoE leaves rates on hold at 5% again. Before Andrew Bailey\u2019s Guardian interview moved the markets, a November cut was around an 88% chance, the markets indicated. Andrew Bailey\u2019s comments are significant, because a couple of weeks ago he sounded rather more cautious about future interest rate cuts. On 19 September, when the Bank left rates on hold at 5%, Bailey said \u201cIt\u2019s vital that inflation stays low, so we need to be careful not to cut too fast or by too much.\u201d A week ago, he told the Kent Messenger that he thought the path for interest rates would be \u201cdownwards, gradually\u201d. So, today\u2019s talk about being a bit more \u201cactivist\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d do feel like a change in stance, which is why the pound dropped this morning. Today\u2019s fall means the pound has now lost all its gains against the dollar over the last two weeks, since the US Federal Reserve slashed its lending rate by half of a percent. The Fed\u2019s \u2018jumbo\u2019 rate cut weakened the dollar against the pound (and other currencies). Back in the currency markets, the pound is continuing to drop against the US dollar. Sterling has now lost a full cent, to $1.3161, as investors digest Andrew Bailey\u2019s suggestion that the Bank could become a \u201cbit more aggressive\u201d in cutting interest rates provided the news on inflation continued to be good. Inflation was last clocked at 2.2%, in August, only slightly above the Bank\u2019s target of 2%. Our interview with Andrew Bailey is also moving the government bond market, it seems. This just flashed up on Reuters: UK GILT FUTURES OPEN UP ABOUT 20 TICKS AFTER BOE\u2019S BAILEY TALKS OF CHANCE OF MORE AGGRESSIVE RATE CUTS Gilts are UK government bonds. And prices are rising in early trading, which pushes down the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. Ths yield on 10-year gilts (a benchmark for govenment borrowing), has fallen by 30 basis points to 4.011%, down from 4.041% last night. That means the price of the bond has gone up, and indicates that investors are pricing in deeper cuts to UK interest rates in coming months than before. The pound is also losing ground against the euro, as well as the dollar. Sterling has dropped by 0.66%, or three-quarters of a eurocent, to \u20ac1.1933 against the euro this morning, down from \u20ac1.2012 last night. Bloomberg\u2019s Markets Today liveblog has spotted that Andrew Bailey\u2019s comments are \u201crippling through bets on Bank of England rate cuts\u201d. Investors are now more confident that the Bank will cut borrowing costs in coming months. Bloomberg\u2019s Sam Unsted explains: Having wavered slightly so far this week, a 25 basis point cut in November is now being fully priced again. And bets are being added further down the horizon too, with 125 basis points now priced by June next year. Sterling has been rattled by the dovish comments from the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey in today\u2019s interview with the Guardian, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB. Brooks points out that the dollar has also been benefitting from \u2018safe haven flows\u2019, as nervous investors try to protect their money due to the Middle East crisis. She says it\u2019s been a \u2018bruising week\u2019 for the pound, which may have further to fall against the dollar. In a note headlined \u201cAndrew Bailey sinks the pound\u201d, Brooks explains: The pound was already selling off before Bailey\u2019s comments, and GBP/USD is down more than 1% so far this week, it is down from $1.34 at the start of this week to below $1.31 this morning. It has found decent support at $1.3170, however, this has been a bruising week for the pound, and $1.35 seems like a mountain to climb from here. Part of the pound\u2019s sell off is due to external factors. As geopolitical risks in the Middle East have risen, the US dollar has caught a bid. The currencies that were most extended vs. the US dollar have sold off rapidly, as investors have sought the safety of the dollar. Hence, the pound and the yen were in the sellers\u2019 sights, as the markets scrambled to buy dollars. The pound is still the best performing currency in the G10 FX space so far this year, thus, if tensions escalate further, then we could see another leg lower for GBP/USD [the pound against the dollar]. Supermarket chain Tesco has announced it now expected to make profit of \u00a32.9bn for the year, up from \u00a32.8bn previously predicted. Tesco says it will make \u00a3100m more than expected after it grabbed share from rivals by cutting prices, put more staff on the shop floor and used AI to target ranges to local tastes. The UK\u2019s biggest supermarket said it had made \u00a3260m of cost savings in the six months to 24 August and had also benefited from restructuring its bank and shoppers trading up to higher priced products as the cost of living crisis has eased. The retailer said 20 million more people had bought its Finest premium own-label range. The dollar is also strengthening against other currencies this morning. Reuters reports: The dollar scaled a more than six-week high versus the yen on Thursday as robustness in the U.S. jobs market reinforced bets the Federal Reserve will not rush to cut interest rates. Sterling tumbled to a two-week trough after Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said in an interview with the Guardian newspaper that the central bank could become \u201ca bit more activist\u201d on rate cuts if there was further good news on inflation. The euro slid to a three-week trough after normally hawkish European Central Bank policymaker Isabel Schnabel took a dovish tone on inflation, cementing bets for a rate cut this month. The yen has come under selling pressure since Japan\u2019s new prime minister said on Wednesday, following a meeting with the central bank governor, that the country is not ready for additional rate hikes. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The pound has dropped to a two-week low this morning, after the Bank of England governor told the Guardian that the central bank could become a \u201cbit more aggressive\u201d in cutting interest rates provided the news on inflation continued to be good. Andrew Bailey told us that he has been encouraged by the fact that cost of living pressures had not been as persistent as the Bank thought they might be. In an interview with my colleague Larry Elliott, Bailey says that if the news on inflation continued to be good there was a chance of the Bank becoming more \u201ca bit more activist\u201d in its approach to cutting interest rates, now at 5%. This has knocked the pound, which is down 0.8 of a cent to $1.3185, its lowest level since 19 September (just before the Fed\u2019s rate cut). The Bank had recently sounded more cautious about rate cuts than its counterparts in the US and the eurozone. It has only made one quarter-point cut this year, in August, while the Federal Reserve has cut US rates by half a point, and the European Central Bank has made two quarter-point cuts since June. The Bank is next scheduled to set interest rates in early November; the money markets suggest there\u2019s an 88% chance of a cut, to 4.75%. Bailey made the comments in a wide-ranging inteview, in which he explained he was watching developments in the Middle East \u201cextremely closely\u201d. Bailey told us: \u201cGeopolitical concerns are very serious,. It\u2019s tragic what\u2019s going on. There are obviously stresses and the real issue then is how they might interact with some still quite stretched markets in places.\u201d Bailey said that in the year since the Hamas attack on Israel there had not been a big rise in oil prices of the sort seen in the past. He explained: \u201cFrom the point of view of monetary policy, it\u2019s a big help we haven\u2019t had to deal with a big increase in the oil price. But obviously we\u2019ve had that experience in the past, and in the 1970s, the oil price was a big part of the story. \u201cObviously, we keep watching it. We watch it extremely closely to see the impact of the latest news. But \u2026 my sense from all the conversations I have with counterparts in the region, is that there is, for the moment, a strong commitment to keep the market stable.

      "bodyText": "Late-night hosts talk JD Vance\u2019s many lies during the vice-presidential debate and a new special counsel report detailing how Donald Trump tried to steal the 2020 election. Seth Meyers Donald Trump is \u201ca bad liar\u201d, said Seth Meyers on Wednesday\u2019s Late Night, but he chose as his running mate \u201csomeone who is much more polished at it\u201d. JD Vance, Ohio senator, is \u201cbrazen and shameless, but he\u2019s admittedly very smooth. He\u2019s like a slick used car dealer, and can be very convincing until you remember the car he\u2019s trying to sell you is an AMC Gremlin with raccoons in the engine.\u201d For instance, during the vice-presidential debate on Tuesday evening, Vance claimed that he was not in favor of a national abortion ban, but did support a \u201cminimum national standard\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s a ban,\u201d Meyers corrected. \u201cA \u2018minimum national standard\u2019 is just a bullshit way of describing a national abortion ban. It\u2019s like when I go to the coffee shop on my block and they say they sell all-natural, gluten-free breakfast biscuits. That\u2019s a cookie, dude. Except now you\u2019ve guaranteed that my kids won\u2019t stop asking me why they can\u2019t have it.\u201d Vance has said multiple times that he favors a national abortion ban. On a rightwing podcast in 2022, he said: \u201cI certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you say yes to every rightwing podcast in the universe,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cJD Vance is on record contradicting every thing he says now. Politicians used to be worried about being caught on a hot mic. But now they go into every McMansion basement they can find like they\u2019re on a hot mic scavenger hunt.\u201d Vance also refused to say whether Trump lost the 2020 election. When asked point blank by his opponent, Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, Vance deflected with: \u201cI\u2019m focused on the future.\u201d \u201cIf you ask someone a straightforward question and they say \u2018I\u2019m focused on the future\u2019 that\u2019s how you know they\u2019re caught in a lie,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cVance may have delivered a slick performance last night, but it was just that \u2013 a performance.\u201d Stephen Colbert \u201cWe are all still struggling to digest last night\u2019s vice-presidential debate \u2013 which is surprising, because usually I have no trouble eating two slices of white bread,\u201d joked Stephen Colbert on Wednesday night. The Late Show host described the debate as a \u201cfrosty cup of ZzzQuil\u201d, as the two politicians performed civility and appeared to frequently agree with each other. The Atlantic described the debate as \u201ca vision of what American politics could be without the distorting gravitational field generated by Donald Trump\u201d. \u201cI would love that,\u201d said Colbert, \u201cbut here\u2019s the thing: Donald Trump hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. He\u2019s still the main character. This is like a scene from It without Pennywise on camera, and everyone is suddenly like, \u2018Welp, guess there\u2019s no more scary clowns in Derry. Ooh, free sewer balloon!\u2019\u201d Colbert took particular aim at Vance\u2019s answer to a question on Obamacare, which Trump tried to destroy numerous times: \u201cI think you could make a really good argument that [Trump] salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came along.\u201d \u201cThat kind of junior high debate team sophistry is exactly the worst kind of behavior that intelligent people use to justify evil,\u201d added Colbert. \u201cYou know, when you think about it, it could be argued that Godzilla really spearheaded Tokyo\u2019s urban renewal.\u201d Colbert was also incensed at Vance\u2019s characterization of January 6: \u201cIt\u2019s really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th.\u201d \u201cYeah, 14 days after his plot to overthrow the election ended in a violent coup that failed,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying to your ex: \u2018Barbara, I think it\u2019s rich that you\u2019re calling me psychotically obsessed with our relationship, when I left your and Brad\u2019s wedding peacefully. You\u2019re the one who won\u2019t stop talking about me setting fire to the DJ.\u2019\u201d Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel looked ahead to election day: \u201cWe are 34 days away from Trump saying the election was rigged, just as he did four years ago.\u201d Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election four years ago are detailed in a new report from special counsel Jack Smith. The judge overseeing the January 6 case in Washington unsealed a 165-page court filing containing a \u201cmountain\u201d of testimony and evidence against Trump. \u201cAll the stuff we know happened, we now have in writing,\u201d said Kimmel. The filing lays out \u201cthe increasingly desperate ways Trump tried to steal the election\u201d, Kimmel explained. \u201cYou know, sometimes I would wonder, does Trump really believe that this election was stolen from him? And the answer is no, he doesn\u2019t. The plan all along was to declare himself the winner even he if wasn\u2019t, which he did.

      "bodyText": "Hospital executives refused to call the police about Lucy Letby because of a \u201cconcern that we will be in the media spotlight\u201d, an inquiry has been told. Murthy Saladi, a consultant paediatrician, urged hospital bosses in an email on 29 June 2016 to contact Cheshire constabulary about a series of \u201cunexpected and unexplained\u201d deaths. This was less than a week after Letby had murdered her final newborn victims \u2013 two triplet boys \u2013 by injecting them with air on the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester hospital in north-west England. Letby, 34, is serving a whole-life prison term after being convicted across two trials of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder another seven between June 2015 and June 2016. Some experts have questioned Letby\u2019s convictions but those doubts are not being considered by the Thirlwall inquiry, which is examining the concerns raised about the nurse and how they were handled by the hospital. Saladi told the inquiry on Thursday that unexpected deaths were \u201cextremely rare\u201d at the district general hospital and that initially doctors thought there might have been an infection on the unit. However, he said that the suspicion of senior doctors began to fall on Letby when it was noticed she was the \u201cone member of staff who was associated with all these deaths\u201d. Two days after the death of the second triplet, Child P, on 24 June 2016, Saladi and other consultants believed Letby should be removed from the neonatal unit, the inquiry heard, and they expressed those views in an email to Karen Rees, then head of nursing. The inquiry heard that Saladi emailed senior doctors and executives the following day to say that the police should be contacted as they could \u201clook into people\u2019s lives\u201d and search the nurse\u2019s home. But in a meeting on 30 June the executives said they would order an independent external review instead of calling Cheshire constabulary, the inquiry heard. Saladi said the executives were \u201clooking at it as doctors versus nurses\u201d and they would get independent input from a team at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH). Asked whether Stephen Cross, the hospital\u2019s then-director of legal services and corporate affairs, had made any comment about police involvement during this meeting, Saladi said: \u201cI think there was talk of \u2018red tape\u2019 like \u2018the media vans will be all on our grounds\u2019. There was some concern that we will be in the media spotlight.\u201d Giving evidence at Liverpool town hall, Saladi said the response of executives was that \u201cif you\u2019re calling the police then all the media spotlight will be on us, nobody will be coming to our labour ward or neonatal unit, so lets get independent input and if that shows [deliberate harm] then let\u2019s go to the police\u201d. The paediatrician said he believed hospital bosses had \u201cunfortunately\u201d already \u201cmade up their mind\u201d about not contacting the police at this point. Another consultant, John Gibbs, told the inquiry this week that he now believed the police should have been contacted months earlier, in February 2016, when a wide-ranging review was unable to find any common link between the deaths other than Letby being the only member of staff on duty for each of them. Richard Baker KC, for some of the bereaved families, asked Saladi about the initial concern of doctors about an infection or hospital bug causing the babies\u2019 deaths. Baker said: \u201cThe babies were investigated for infection and reliable evidence was obtained that those babies had not been infected by any contamination from the ward.\u201d Saladi agreed and said: \u201cThere was no infection in the babies, that is correct.\u201d Letby, 34, was removed from the neonatal unit in early July 2016 but it was another 10 months before the police were contacted in May 2017. Saladi said the relationship between consultants and managers at the Countess of Chester had broken down by January 2017. The inquiry has heard that executives told consultants in January 2017 that two external reviews had cleared Letby of any wrongdoing and ordered the senior doctors to apologise to her before she returned to the unit. Saladi said former chief executive Tony Chambers had \u201cbanged the table\u201d and told the consultants that the hospital was \u201cdrawing a line under\u201d the allegations. \u201cI do remember the red face of Tony Chambers, his forceful voice and him banging on the table,\u201d he said in a statement to the inquiry.",

      "bodyText": "How do you review a band who, 20 years ago, purported to end their career with a song called TISM Are Shit? As pre-emptive strikes go, it brooks no critical retort. Now \u2013 in a song called Old Skool TISM \u2013 the artistes formerly known as This is Serious Mum would have us believe that \u201ceverything is shit except for TISM\u201d. I am not so sure. True old-school fans should not be surprised by TISM\u2019s return. Their public debut in late 1983 \u2013 menacingly billed as The Get Fucked Concert \u2013 was also meant to be their farewell. It is part of TISM folklore that the rot set in after that, and every show since has been a cynical cash-in. Don\u2019t take my word for it: that\u2019s according to the \u201cTISM Wankerpedia fan page\u201d. So: caveat emptor. Death to Art, their seventh full-length album, is not as good as their debut, 1988\u2019s Great Truckin\u2019 Songs of the Renaissance. But that was a 10-star album; the kind of thing Guardian style guides don\u2019t allow for. TISM would agree it\u2019s only been downhill from there. I would argue it\u2019s been a terminal decline since their first single, Defecate on My Face. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning A song like that cannot be bottomed.

Almost one in five (18%) adults delayed or did not see a dental professional in 2022-23 due to cost, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare\u2019s (AIHW\u2019s) Oral Health and Dental Care report, released on Friday. Only one in two adults visited a dental professional in the last 12 months, the report said \u2013 a figure that had remained stable over the past 10 years. These numbers echo the 2023 Senate inquiry into access to dental services, which found Australia has a two-tiered oral and dental health care system. \u201cAround half of Australians have acceptable oral and dental health and adequate access to services, and the other half do not,\u201d the report said. AIHW data showed people living in areas of least socio-economic disadvantage were more likely to visit a dentist (65%) than those in areas of most disadvantage, where the percentage dropped to 42%. Cost was a notable barrier for people in rural and remote areas and for those with specialised health needs, including living with a disability. The report found Indigenous people disproportionately suffered from poor dental health. About one in 20 (6%) Indigenous Australians aged 15 and older reported complete tooth loss, and just under half had lost at least one tooth. The report found people who finished year 11 or above at high school had on average half the number of missing teeth (3.3) as those whose reached year 10 or lower (7.7). Poor oral health can lead to lasting \u201cphysical and psychological disability\u201d, the report said, and compromise a person\u2019s nutrition and exacerbate other health conditions such as heart disease. There were close to 87,400 hospitalisations for dental conditions that could have potentially been prevented with earlier treatment, the report said. There has been a substantial increase in the number of people who reported the detrimental social impacts of their oral health in the last 30 years, the report found. In 1994, one in five Australians reported feeling uncomfortable due to dental problems. In 2021, almost half (44%) reported feeling uncomfortable. Jason* says for the last 15 years he had never been able to afford to go to the dentist. Now, aged 39, he has found it is \u201ctoo late\u201d. He has discovered he has gum disease, a chronic disease he will never be rid of, but is having to dip $8,000 into his emergency savings to have laser surgery to try to treat it. The disease could cause Jason to develop \u201cblack triangles\u201d \u2013 gaps between the teeth along the gumline \u2013 which the laser helps reduce and prevent but is not guaranteed.

I can\u2019t continue to be in this role doing what I\u2019m doing looking like this.\u201d The AIHW report collated data from sources including the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Australian Research Centre for Population Oral Health at the University of Adelaide and the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The AIHW acknowledged a comprehensive picture was difficult to build because of a lack of national data sources and old, disjointed record-keeping. Associate Prof Matt Hopcraft from the University of Melbourne\u2019s dental school says the out-of-date information is hindering informed dental policy and improvements to oral health. Hopcraft has called for dental services to be made available under Medicare. The Labor backbenchers Helen Polley, Brian Mitchell, Mike Freelander and Graham Perrett have advocated for opening up a discussion over how dental could be added to Medicare. The health minister, Mark Butler, was cool on the idea, saying in September \u201cthat\u2019s not something we\u2019re going to be able to do in the near term\u201d. But Hopcraft argues dental should be a priority for government. \u201cAs the cost of living crisis continues to bite, we need to see significant reform in our dental care system,\u201d he says. \u201cWith an election due next year, it is important that we put oral health on the radar so that it is not neglected again.\u201d *Names changed to protect anonymity Want to tell us your story?

      "body": "<p>Amazon has been trying to break into the games industry for years, yet despite using the vast resources at its disposal to hire some of the best designers in the business, the company struggled for years to make headway. Lately, however, Amazon has found success publishing massively multiplayer online games. First came 2021\u2019s New World, Amazon Games\u2019 homebrew fantasy with an emphasis on survival and player-built settlements. The following year brought Lost Ark, developed by Korean studio SmileGate, which combined large-scale multiplayer with Diablo-style fighting. Critical reception was mixed, but both games proved popular with players. This week, Amazon publishes its third MMO in four years, Throne and Liberty, also developed in Korea. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about this latest free offering.</p> <p><strong>What is Throne and Liberty?</strong></p>    <p>It\u2019s a massively multiplayer online game in the vein of World of Warcraft. Set across a large and richly painted fantasy world, it sees players creating their own character and embarking on a series of adventures, playing either solo, with friends, or as part of a larger guild. Players can follow the main story, cooperate with friends to battle through dungeons, or battle against rival players to claim ownership of the game\u2019s regions.</p> <p>Throne and Liberty is notable for its long gestation period. It was originally announced in 2011 as an extension of the Lineage series of role-playing games, under the name Lineage Eternal. After a turbulent development that saw multiple delays, a technological overhaul, and a change in leadership, Throne and Liberty released in Korea last December. Amazon is the game\u2019s global publisher, having acquired the rights in February last year.</p> <p><strong>How does Throne and Liberty differ from other MMOs?</strong></p>    <p>There are a couple of features that lend Throne and Liberty its own flavour. The most obvious of these is the ability to \u201cmorph\u201d into different animals. Instead of sprinting to travel the world faster, players can transform into a speedy land animal such as a wolf, leap from cliffs and \u201cglide\u201d across the landscape as a bird, or turn into a cute otter wearing a leaf as a hat (or another aquatic animal) if they wade into deep water.</p> <p>It\u2019s a fun gimmick, but it\u2019s not that deep. Throne and Liberty\u2019s combat and character development are more notable. Unlike most MMOs, there are no specific character classes. Instead, your character\u2019s skills and abilities are defined by the weapons they wield.</p> <p>There are six weapon types to choose from, each of which comes packaged with abilities. Since players can equip two weapons at any time, you can synthesise your own class. I spent most of my time wielding a sword and shield that allowed me to push enemies around, and a magical staff that let me throw fireballs and summon lightning bolts from the sky.</p> <p><strong>Is Throne and Liberty any good?</strong></p>    <p>Parts of it are. The world is enjoyable to explore, thanks to those Animorph-esque powers, and partly due to the impressive environment design. And while combat is traditional for an MMO (for instance, characters attack automatically while special abilities are triggered by the player), fights are fast-paced and surprisingly muscular, with flashy, tangible character powers. One of combat\u2019s more interesting flourishes is a dodge and parry, letting you block, avoid and deflect attacks. It adds an extra layer of reactivity to battles, an interesting hybrid of classic MMO combat and more modern action-oriented play.</p> <p>Outside this though, much of what Throne and Liberty does is familiar, sometimes to the point of being trite. Although its fantasy world has some weirder edges, such as the giant whale that floats around the sky, it\u2019s largely a traditional hodgepodge of wizards, warriors, orcs and goblins. Storytelling is basic, the characters superficial, and quests mostly involve pressing \u201cF\u201d on a lot of different items, with few meaningful interactions outside of combat. Finally, as is common with many free-to-play online games, the crafting and upgrade systems are unnecessarily convoluted, and improving your weapons and armour can be tedious and confusing.</p> <p><strong>Should I play Throne and Liberty?</strong></p>    <p>Throne and Liberty is free-to-play, and while it doesn\u2019t break much new ground, there\u2019s enough baseline quality to its world and combat to make it moderately diverting. And what it lacks in depth it makes up for in pacing, so you don\u2019t have to sink dozens of hours into it to see a decent chunk of the world.</p> <p>That said, if you only have time to play one Korean MMO published by Amazon, I\u2019d recommend Lost Ark over Throne of Liberty. While Throne and Liberty\u2019s combat can be spectacular, Lost Ark\u2019s throwdowns are truly off the chain, starting you off with the power of a god and building from there. Likewise, its story takes wilder swings than Throne and Liberty: its adventure transports you to an island populated by Borrower-like pixies, and pits you against an army of demonic clowns. It\u2019s structurally and thematically similar but offers a bolder, weirder experience all around. And like Throne and Liberty, it can be played for free.</p>",

Not how to attain it or strengthen it or build it, but why it can get fucked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/sep/11/in-the-face-of-grief-its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-to-say-what-matters-is-that-you-keep-trying\">In the face of grief, it\u2019s hard to find the right words to say. What matters is that you keep trying | Ranjana Srivastava</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A quick Google search of \u201cresilience\u201d results in a list of definitions that are variations on a theme. The words \u201cbounce back\u201d appear in most. Positivity. Optimism. Overcoming adverse events. Coming back stronger than before. Yawn. Cringe. Vomit.</p> <p>My issue isn\u2019t necessarily the concept of resilience itself, it\u2019s the way our culture has co-opted resilience to change its meaning. There is an emphasis here on the individual and not the collective. In many ways, it\u2019s an excuse for society to place the burden of being OK on the person suffering.</p> <p>To focus on resilience is to focus on what\u2019s visible to the outside world, therefore failing to grasp what it costs to survive.</p> <p>It also positions resilience as binary. The myth of resilience is that it\u2019s an either/or situation. You\u2019re either resilient or not. But this is rarely the case. Resilience is fluid, not an endpoint.</p> <p>Nora McInerny is an author and podcaster who began speaking openly about loss and grief after the death of her husband, Aaron, from brain cancer, which followed the death of her father, after a miscarriage. She\u2019s also fun at parties. \u201cNo matter how many lemons life throws at you, you do not owe anyone a glass of lemonade,\u201d she posted on Instagram recently.</p> <p>And I think this is where my bugbear with resilience culture comes from. It\u2019s the performative resilience that society demands from people. \u201cBe OK!\u201d it says. \u201cInspire me!\u201d it shouts.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very tired!\u201d I want to shout back. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted!\u201d I want to say. \u201cI just need a little nap!\u201d</p> <p>It is uncomfortable when the people we love are in pain. It\u2019s excruciating to bear witness to the aftershock of how cruel and random life can be. But we need to sit in this discomfort. It\u2019s the very least we owe each other.</p> <p>There is a passage from It\u2019s OK That You\u2019re Not OK<em> </em>by Megan Devine that I return to often: \u201cHere\u2019s what I most want you to know: this really is as bad as you think. No matter what anyone else says, this sucks. What has happened cannot be made right. What is lost cannot be restored. There is no beauty here, inside this central fact \u2026 You need someone to hold your hand while you stand there in blinking horror, staring at the hole that was your life. Some things cannot be fixed. They can only be carried.\u201d</p> <p>True resilience is living with what is. Sometimes that looks inspiring and sometimes that looks like just getting through the day. It\u2019s rarely pretty, often exhausting and always made easier without the burden of expectation.</p> <ul> <li><p>Natasha Sholl is a writer and lapsed lawyer living in Melbourne.

      "bodyText": "The other day I was stopped on the street by someone who told me that during a particularly bad depressive episode in which she was hospitalised, she just thought of me and realised her life wasn\u2019t actually that bad. Um, thanks? I\u2019m not sure if that comment was more or less offensive than the guy who told me he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure how I got out of bed each day\u201d. Cheers bro. The short version is that in my twenties my boyfriend died suddenly while we were sleeping, nine years later my brother died suddenly at work and in 2022 our lives imploded (again) when my son was diagnosed with cancer and severe Guillain Barre Syndrome which has left him paralysed. I\u2019m fun at parties. My point being that as someone who does, in fact, get out of bed each day and is apparently the personification of \u201cworse\u201d on the It-Could-Always-Be-Worse Scale, I believe I have the credentials to talk about resilience. Not how to attain it or strengthen it or build it, but why it can get fucked. A quick Google search of \u201cresilience\u201d results in a list of definitions that are variations on a theme. The words \u201cbounce back\u201d appear in most. Positivity. Optimism. Overcoming adverse events. Coming back stronger than before. Yawn. Cringe. Vomit. My issue isn\u2019t necessarily the concept of resilience itself, it\u2019s the way our culture has co-opted resilience to change its meaning. There is an emphasis here on the individual and not the collective. In many ways, it\u2019s an excuse for society to place the burden of being OK on the person suffering. To focus on resilience is to focus on what\u2019s visible to the outside world, therefore failing to grasp what it costs to survive. It also positions resilience as binary. The myth of resilience is that it\u2019s an either/or situation. You\u2019re either resilient or not. But this is rarely the case. Resilience is fluid, not an endpoint. Nora McInerny is an author and podcaster who began speaking openly about loss and grief after the death of her husband, Aaron, from brain cancer, which followed the death of her father, after a miscarriage. She\u2019s also fun at parties. \u201cNo matter how many lemons life throws at you, you do not owe anyone a glass of lemonade,\u201d she posted on Instagram recently. And I think this is where my bugbear with resilience culture comes from. It\u2019s the performative resilience that society demands from people. \u201cBe OK!\u201d it says. \u201cInspire me!\u201d it shouts. \u201cI\u2019m very tired!\u201d I want to shout back. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted!\u201d I want to say. \u201cI just need a little nap!\u201d It is uncomfortable when the people we love are in pain. It\u2019s excruciating to bear witness to the aftershock of how cruel and random life can be. But we need to sit in this discomfort. It\u2019s the very least we owe each other. There is a passage from It\u2019s OK That You\u2019re Not OK by Megan Devine that I return to often: \u201cHere\u2019s what I most want you to know: this really is as bad as you think. No matter what anyone else says, this sucks. What has happened cannot be made right. What is lost cannot be restored. There is no beauty here, inside this central fact \u2026 You need someone to hold your hand while you stand there in blinking horror, staring at the hole that was your life. Some things cannot be fixed. They can only be carried.\u201d True resilience is living with what is. Sometimes that looks inspiring and sometimes that looks like just getting through the day. It\u2019s rarely pretty, often exhausting and always made easier without the burden of expectation. Natasha Sholl is a writer and lapsed lawyer living in Melbourne.

The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, had said a pro-Palestine event on 7 October would be \u201cseen as incredibly provocative\u201d and he was \u201cworried about social cohesion\u201d. But human rights and civil liberties advocates condemned NSW police for trying to prevent the demonstrations, especially as the Palestine Action Group had lodged the paperwork required to stage protests lawfully. A NSW police spokesperson on Thursday afternoon said it was inappropriate for the force to comment as it was dealing with the matter in court. Victoria police have previously said they have no legal power to prevent similar protests from occurring in Melbourne because the state does not have the permit system which exists in NSW. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, on Thursday said the chief commissioner of Victoria police, Shane Patton, had \u201cmade pretty clear on previous occasions that he doesn\u2019t see there\u2019s a need for the permit system\u201d.

The NSW Council for Civil Liberties president, Lydia Shelly, said the form 1 system was an \u201cinternational embarrassment\u201d that \u201clent itself to litigation\u201d and had \u201cno place in a democratic society\u201d. \u201cThe public in a democracy should not be forced in a position where they need to go to court to try to exercise their democratic freedoms,\u201d Shelly said. \u201cThey are consistently placed in that position again and again and again in NSW.\u201d The NSW CCL urged the Minns Labor government to scrap the form 1 system and legislate a human rights charter like those which exist in Victoria and Queensland. Introduced in 2006, Victoria\u2019s charter protects 20 civil rights including freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly, including for protest or demonstration. Queensland\u2019s Human Rights Act implemented similar safeguards when it became law in 2019. The Human Rights Law Centre (HRLC) has urged the Victorian government not to introduce a permit system, arguing this could conflict with its human rights charter. The Australian Human Rights Commission has called for a federal human rights act since 2022 that would protect the \u201cfreedom to speak, create, protest, travel and organise\u201d.

Kaky was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit FGM and forced marriage, which he denied. Sentencing Kaky, Judge Nirmal Shant KC said his plans were barbaric. \u201cYou made concerted efforts to make sure this happened. I make, nonetheless, some adjustment for the fact that no FGM took place, and importantly, thankfully, [the girl] was unaware of any of these plans,\u201d she said. \u201cThis offence calls for a deterrent sentence. What you did, what you had planned, was barbaric.\u201d The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was able to proceed with the case after proving FGM was a criminal offence in Iraq. It provided evidence to the court that Kaky had booked and paid for the trip to Iraq while living in Nottingham. Messages on his phone showed that he intended for the victim to be subjected to FGM and forced into marriage, and showed him calling FGM \u201cnormal\u201d. The court heard the offences happened in 2019, but it took several years for Kaky to be charged due to the complexity of the case. Kaky had moved to Swansea during this time. Janine McKinney, chief crown prosecutor for CPS East Midlands, said: \u201cThis has been a landmark prosecution, not just because it is the first conviction of its kind, but for the message it sends to people who may be vulnerable to this horrific form of abuse.\u201d NHS figures showed hospital and GP attendances about FGM in England rose by 15% in the 2023-24 financial year. The defence barrister Geraldine Kelly told the court Kaky\u2019s academic accomplishments as a PhD student at the University of Nottingham were \u201crespected\u201d and \u201cimpressive\u201d, and that losing his job was \u201cin itself a form of punishment\u201d. The University of Nottingham said Kaky was a visiting scholar when the offences came to light. A spokesperson said: \u201cThere is no place for such barbaric offences in our society and our thoughts are with those who have been affected by these actions. Following the arrest of Emad Kaky, the university ended its association with him and withdrew the invitation to him as a visiting academic.\u201d",

It could also disrupt voting, including in North Carolina, one of just a handful of states likely to decide the 5 November presidential election. Long before the storm made landfall on Thursday, politicos have kept a close eye on North Carolina as a key battleground state, with polls showing the state is closely divided in the choice between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Early voting in North Carolina will begin on 17 October as planned, state officials said, but adhering to that schedule will not be an easy task. \u201cThe destruction is unprecedented and this level of uncertainty this close to election day is daunting,\u201d Karen Brinson Bell, the executive director of the state\u2019s election board, told reporters. In-person voting North Carolina counties are required to offer at least 13 days of in-person early voting. Many counties may struggle to meet that requirement. Officials said they were unaware of any voting equipment or ballots destroyed by Helene, but five county election offices in western North Carolina were closed as of Thursday morning. It is also still unknown how many early voting sites and election day locations will be inaccessible due to mudslides, damaged roads or fallen trees, Brinson Bell said on Tuesday. In-person voting stations require electricity and potable water, something several western North Carolina counties still lack after the storm. They also require staff, and it is not clear how many would-be poll workers have had to relocate due to the storm. Buncombe county \u2013 home to the region\u2019s Democratic stronghold of Asheville \u2013 was planning to open 14 early voting locations on 17 October.

Now, following Helene, the US Postal Service (USPS) has been forced to halt to mail delivery to homes and businesses in dozens of zip codes across the western North Carolina until further notice. An additional complicating factor: in rural North Carolina, some postal workers use their own cars to deliver mail, and officials do not know how many workers\u2019 personal vehicles were destroyed by Helene, the environmental publication Grist reported. \u201cThe safety of our customers and employees is the Postal Service\u2019s top priority in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene,\u201d Martha Johnson, a USPS spokesperson, said in an emailed statement, adding that the agency was \u201ccommitted to delivering each piece of mail where it is safe to do so and where roads are passable\u201d, and would \u201ccontinue to communicate with local boards of election in impacted areas to ensure the ongoing transport and delivery of Election Mail as soon as it is safe to do so\u201d.

The elections board is still assessing whether to ask the state to reinstate the grace period, they told reporters on Tuesday. If they do not make the request, they could face lawsuits from voting rights groups. Competing priorities With many North Carolina voters cut off from electricity, internet and cell service, officials expect difficulties in communicating changes to polling locations or mail-in voting processes. Many affected residents may also be too overwhelmed or busy with relocation, cleanup and other concerns, leaving them unable or unwilling to go to the polls.

On Truth Social, Trump, writing in all-caps, called it \u201ccomplete and total election interference.\u201d</p> <p>Here are some key points made in the filing:</p>  <h2>\u2018Fundamentally a private\u2019 scheme</h2>  <p>The new court filing, in which Trump is referred to as \u201cthe defendant\u201d, alleges that Trump\u2019s plan that day was \u201cfundamentally a private one\u201d, and therefore not related to his duties as president but instead as a candidate for office.</p> <p>It reads: \u201cThe defendant asserts that he is immune from prosecution for his criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 presidential election because, he claims, it entailed official conduct. Not so. Although the defendant was the incumbent president during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one.</p> <p>\u201cHe extensively used private actors and his campaign infrastructure to attempt to overturn the election results and operated in a private capacity as a candidate for office.\u201d</p> <p>The filing looks back to election day for Trump\u2019s use of private advisers: \u201cAs election day turned to November 4, the contest was too close to project a winner, and in discussions about what the defendant should say publicly regarding the election, senior advisors suggested that the defendant should show restraint while counting continued. Two private advisors, however, advocated a different course: [name redacted] and [name redacted] suggested that the defendant just declare victory. And at about 2.20am, the defendant gave televised remarks to a crowd of his campaign supporters in which he falsely claimed, without evidence or specificity, that there had been fraud in the election and that he had won.\u201d</p> <p>On 4 January, the filing says, a White House counsel was excluded from a meeting during which Trump sought to pressure Pence to help overturn the election result. Only a private attorney was present, the filing says: \u201cIt is hard to imagine stronger evidence\u201d than this that Trump\u2019s conduct was private.</p> <h2>A presidential candidate alone in a dining room with Twitter and Fox News</h2>  <p>Trump\u2019s day on 6 January started at 1am, with a tweet pressuring Pence to obstruct the certification of the results. Seven hours later, at 8.17am, Trump tweeted about it again. Shortly before his speech at the Ellipse, Trump called Pence and again pressured him to \u201cinduce him to act unlawfully in the upcoming session\u201d, where Pence would be certifying the election results. Pence refused.</p> <p>At this point, according to the filing, Trump \u201cdecided to re-insert into his campaign speech at the Ellipse remarks targeting Pence for his refusal to misuse his role in the certification\u201d.</p> <p>Trump gave his speech, and at 1pm, the certification process began at the Capitol. </p> <p>Trump, meanwhile, \u201csettled in the dining room off of the Oval Office. He spent the afternoon there reviewing Twitter on his phone, while the dining room television played Fox News\u2019 contemporaneous coverage of events at the Capitol.\u201d</p> <p>It was from the dining room that Trump watched a crowd of his supporters march towards the Capitol. He had been there less than an hour when, at \u201capproximately 2.24pm, Fox News reported that a police officer may have been injured and that \u2018protestors ... have made their way inside the Capitol.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAt 2.24pm, Trump tweeted, writing, \u2018Mike Pence didn\u2019t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country and our constitution, giving states a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The filing reads: \u201cThe content of the 2.24pm tweet was not a message sent to address a matter of public concern and ease unrest; it was the message of an angry candidate upon the realization that he would lose power.\u201d</p> <p>A minute later, the Secret Service evacuated Pence to a secure location.</p> <h2>Trump, when told Pence had been evacuated, said: \u2018So what?\u2019</h2>  <p>The filing states that Trump said: \u201cSo what?\u201d after being told that Pence had subsequently been taken to a secure location.</p> <p>The indictment notes that the government does not intend to use the exchange at trial.

Human Rights Watch has called the forcible displacement an \u201cappalling colonial crime\u201d and a crime against humanity. 1982 The UK government agrees to pay \u00a34m into a trust fund for the Chagossians, set up under a Mauritian statute. 2000 The UK high court finds the expulsion of the Chagossians to be unlawful. 2008 The House of Lords, then the UK\u2019s highest court, decides against the right of return for Chagossians, overturning a series of decisions by judges in lower British courts that had found their exile to be unlawful. 2010 A US diplomatic cable dated May 2009, disclosed by WikiLeaks, reveals that a UK Foreign Office official had told the US that a decision to set up a \u201cmarine protected area\u201d (MPA) would \u201cput paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago\u2019s former residents\u201d. 2015 A UN tribunal rules that Britain acted illegally in the way it created a marine protected area (MPA) in the Chagos Islands, saying it had to failed to consult Mauritius and illegally deprived it of fishing rights. 2016 The UK government announces a \u00a340m support package to assist and compensate Chagossians living in the UK, but still refuses to let them return home. 2019 In an advisory opinion, the UN\u2019s highest court, the international court of justice, rules that continued British occupation of the remote Indian Ocean archipelago is illegal and orders the UK to hand it back to Mauritius \u201cas rapidly as possible\u201d. The UN general assembly overwhelmingly backs a motion condemning Britain\u2019s occupation of the islands. The motion sets a six-month deadline for Britain to withdraw and for the islands to be reunified with Mauritius, but the UK does not comply. 2021 The UN\u2019s special international maritime court rejects the UK\u2019s claim to sovereignty over the Chagos Islands, and the prime minister of Mauritius urges it to end its \u201cunlawful occupation\u201d. 2021 A group of Tamil asylum seekers fleeing Sri Lanka in a fishing boat are rescued and taken to Diego Garcia. They remain there in what they have described as horrific, prison-like conditions. Reports of attempted suicides and self-harm have been rife. 2022 The UK announces that it has agreed to open negotiations with Mauritius over the future handover of the Chagos Islands. 2024 The UK agrees to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, ending years of bitter dispute over Britain\u2019s last African colony, although it will retain control over the military base on Diego Garcia, which it operates jointly with the US.",

No old cars. No old guitars. I suppose I\u2019d like to have back the red leather jacket that Syd gave me in 66 or 67.

The rich and the powerful have siphoned off the majority of this money. I was lucky to be part of the golden years when there was a much better share going to the musicians, so I support anything that could be done to make that easier. The working musician today has to go out and play live \u2013 they can\u2019t survive any other way. They won\u2019t do it by the recording process and that\u2019s a tragedy because that is not encouraging new music to be created. It\u2019s not the greatest era that the world has been through, as gradually all the work moves to robots and AI, and the amount of people creaming off the money gets smaller and smaller and they get richer and richer. \u201cSod everyone else\u201d seems to be the attitude.</p> <p><strong>What does your Comfortably Numb guitar solo mean to you?

I tend to steer clear of people who actively support genocidal and autocratic dictators like Putin and Maduro [president of Venezuela]. Nothing would make me share a stage with someone who thinks such treatment of women and the LGBT community is OK. On the other hand, I\u2019d love to be back on stage with [late Pink Floyd keyboardist] Rick Wright, who was one of the gentlest and most musically gifted people I\u2019ve ever known.</p> <p><strong>Can you get Kate Bush back on stage soon?</strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3552546?page=1\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3552546?page=1\">fakeycakemaker</a></em><br>Kate Bush is the only person who can get Kate Bush back on stage. I think the shows she did in 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo were some of the best I\u2019ve ever seen. We went several nights. I\u2019ve tried persuading her recently, actually. Gently.</p> <p><strong>Polly [Samson, Gilmour\u2019s wife and collaborator] has said that mortality is one of the recurring themes on [new album] Luck and Strange. </strong><strong>How do you feel about mortality and immortality? </strong><em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15072063?page=1\">Dmitry_S</a></em><br>It\u2019s sad that I don\u2019t believe in a higher power. There\u2019s a song on the album called A Single Spark \u2013 Polly\u2019s words, my feelings \u2013 that comes from a line on&nbsp;the first page of Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s book Speak, Memory, and that says it all. I can\u2019t remember quite how he put it, but he said that&nbsp;life is a single spark between two eternities.</p> <p><strong>Do you believe that music is a product of the mind alone, or is there an element of inspiration that is somehow received directly from a higher consciousness? </strong><em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/110133369?page=1\">PhilipCologne</a></em><br>I\u2019m an atheist, so I hate to say it out&nbsp;loud, but there are times when it feels like music is channelling itself when I\u2019m writing. It doesn\u2019t always feel like it\u2019s something I\u2019ve done \u2013 it\u2019s somehow just comes through me.</p> <p><strong>As a guitar player myself, I\u2019d like to ask you about your opinion on the key element(s) to improve my solo technique. Thanks in advance. </strong><em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/109541076?page=1\">SantiA85</a></em><br>I would advise forgetting technique! Don\u2019t worry about it. Just play notes and melodies that appeal to your heart and mind and let them out.</p>    <p><strong>What were some of the best lyrics you think Roger ever wrote? </strong><em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/111316343?page=1\">evermost</a></em><br>Gosh, let me have a think about that. How about a song called Walk With Me Sydney? [<em>CL: I\u2019m not familiar</em><em> with those lyrics</em><em>.</em>] I\u2019m not surprised [laughs]. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s officially recorded.</p> <p><strong>How do you feel about the current state of music, and are there any bands right now whose music you really like or feel inspired by? </strong><em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/18526930?page=1\">Edcott</a></em><br>I don\u2019t really listen to an awful lot of modern music. But the band I have been listening to is Alt-J, and they are what brought me to Charlie&nbsp;Andrew as a producer for this album. The work that they do with his help, I have found inspiring. He showed a massive lack of respect for my past and what I\u2019ve done and, believe me, that is something one needs in life \u2013 to have people that come at you on a&nbsp;level playing field!</p> <p><strong>Do you miss any of your guitars or amps from the </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/events/the-david-gilmour-guitar-collection\">Christie\u2019s</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/events/the-david-gilmour-guitar-collection\"> sale</a> back in </strong><strong>2019</strong><strong>? If so, which one(s)? </strong><em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/18543091?page=1\">bobbiediamonds</a></em><br>To be perfectly truthful, I kept a few guitars back which are my real favourites. But I generally think of guitars as tools of the trade. I don\u2019t have a massive sentimental attachment and what cushions any of that loss is the good that was \u2013 and is being \u2013 done by the money that was raised by that auction, which went to ClientEarth.</p> <p><strong>Would you like to travel into space? </strong><em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13239086?page=1\">blipvert</a></em><br>I have been invited to travel into space, funnily enough. We\u2019d played in Moscow \u2013 back when one wasn\u2019t ashamed to \u2013 and they asked me if I wanted to go up into space. But I had seen their rockets and their capsules in the space museum in Moscow, and I nearly shit myself and said: \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d They were rickety and held together with&nbsp;nuts and bolts.</p> <p><strong>Whose music do you listen to when you want to switch off? </strong><em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/106630234?page=1\">Miningbird</a></em><br>These days I find myself listening to audiobooks a lot, not listening to music so much. Hitler, Stalin, Mum and Dad by Daniel Finkelstein is one. The Escape Artist [by Jonathan Freedland] is one. Martin Amis\u2019s book [Inside Story] that he wrote in the couple of years before he died is an extraordinary piece of work. I think he tries to cover a bit of all his obsessions of the moment, and one suspects that each one of those obsessions would have been the subject of whole books if he had had more time. It\u2019s a tragedy that he died so young.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMr5GpCpKyA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gMr5GpCpKyA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>You were part of some of the greatest albums of all time. Is this daunting or inspiring? </strong><em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1901973?page=1\">SwindonNick</a></em><br>Mostly not daunting. Definitely inspiring. The feeling of listening through my new album in the control room, when it was all finished and tied together, was not unlike the same moment of listening through The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road in 1973. The thrill I got is very similar.</p> <p><strong>What remaining ambitions do you have in terms of music creation? </strong><em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1027342?page=1\">JohnAlexF</a></em><br>My ambition is to keep going. As soon as this tour is finished, I\u2019ll get back to work in my studio creating more music. I don\u2019t have higher ambitions than that.<br></p> <p>\u2022 Luck and Strange is out now on Sony Music.

Can you get Kate Bush back on stage soon? fakeycakemaker Kate Bush is the only person who can get Kate Bush back on stage. I think the shows she did in 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo were some of the best I\u2019ve ever seen. We went several nights. I\u2019ve tried persuading her recently, actually. Gently. Polly [Samson, Gilmour\u2019s wife and collaborator] has said that mortality is one of the recurring themes on [new album] Luck and Strange. How do you feel about mortality and immortality? Dmitry_S It\u2019s sad that I don\u2019t believe in a higher power. There\u2019s a song on the album called A Single Spark \u2013 Polly\u2019s words, my feelings \u2013 that comes from a line on the first page of Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s book Speak, Memory, and that says it all. I can\u2019t remember quite how he put it, but he said that life is a single spark between two eternities. Do you believe that music is a product of the mind alone, or is there an element of inspiration that is somehow received directly from a higher consciousness? PhilipCologne I\u2019m an atheist, so I hate to say it out loud, but there are times when it feels like music is channelling itself when I\u2019m writing. It doesn\u2019t always feel like it\u2019s something I\u2019ve done \u2013 it\u2019s somehow just comes through me. As a guitar player myself, I\u2019d like to ask you about your opinion on the key element(s) to improve my solo technique. Thanks in advance. SantiA85 I would advise forgetting technique! Don\u2019t worry about it. Just play notes and melodies that appeal to your heart and mind and let them out. What were some of the best lyrics you think Roger ever wrote? evermost Gosh, let me have a think about that. How about a song called Walk With Me Sydney? [CL: I\u2019m not familiar with those lyrics.] I\u2019m not surprised [laughs]. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s officially recorded. How do you feel about the current state of music, and are there any bands right now whose music you really like or feel inspired by? Edcott I don\u2019t really listen to an awful lot of modern music. But the band I have been listening to is Alt-J, and they are what brought me to Charlie Andrew as a producer for this album. The work that they do with his help, I have found inspiring. He showed a massive lack of respect for my past and what I\u2019ve done and, believe me, that is something one needs in life \u2013 to have people that come at you on a level playing field! Do you miss any of your guitars or amps from the Christie\u2019s sale back in 2019? If so, which one(s)? bobbiediamonds To be perfectly truthful, I kept a few guitars back which are my real favourites. But I generally think of guitars as tools of the trade. I don\u2019t have a massive sentimental attachment and what cushions any of that loss is the good that was \u2013 and is being \u2013 done by the money that was raised by that auction, which went to ClientEarth. Would you like to travel into space? blipvert I have been invited to travel into space, funnily enough. We\u2019d played in Moscow \u2013 back when one wasn\u2019t ashamed to \u2013 and they asked me if I wanted to go up into space. But I had seen their rockets and their capsules in the space museum in Moscow, and I nearly shit myself and said: \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d They were rickety and held together with nuts and bolts. Whose music do you listen to when you want to switch off? Miningbird These days I find myself listening to audiobooks a lot, not listening to music so much. Hitler, Stalin, Mum and Dad by Daniel Finkelstein is one. The Escape Artist [by Jonathan Freedland] is one. Martin Amis\u2019s book [Inside Story] that he wrote in the couple of years before he died is an extraordinary piece of work. I think he tries to cover a bit of all his obsessions of the moment, and one suspects that each one of those obsessions would have been the subject of whole books if he had had more time. It\u2019s a tragedy that he died so young. You were part of some of the greatest albums of all time. Is this daunting or inspiring? SwindonNick Mostly not daunting. Definitely inspiring. The feeling of listening through my new album in the control room, when it was all finished and tied together, was not unlike the same moment of listening through The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road in 1973. The thrill I got is very similar. What remaining ambitions do you have in terms of music creation? JohnAlexF My ambition is to keep going. As soon as this tour is finished, I\u2019ll get back to work in my studio creating more music. I don\u2019t have higher ambitions than that. \u2022 Luck and Strange is out now on Sony Music. David Gilmour plays six nights at Royal Albert Hall from 9 October, followed by dates in Los Angeles and New York",

Here are some of your responses.</p> <h2>\u2018My mother refused to talk to me for two days after we named our son\u2019</h2> <p>My youngest son is named Indiana. Yes, as in Jones. My husband is Welsh and he wanted a name that was indicative of \u201can intrepid Welshman\u201d. We were watching an Indiana Jones film with our other two children. My husband turned to our son Finn, who was two, and said: \u201cWhat do you think about the name Indiana?\u201d And Finn said: \u201cYeah!\u201d And that was it. Indiana loves his name. But my mother was horrified and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly call a child Indiana!\u201d and refused to talk to me for two days. She definitely got over it, and he\u2019s the apple of her eye. Our son is now 19, and has lived up to his namesake. We still haven\u2019t met a single other Indiana. <strong>Sabina Regan, 58, London </strong></p> <h2>\u2018The only other Cloudesleys are 19th-century academics and cricketers\u2019</h2> <p>My son, born this year, is named Cloudesley. It seems to be a very unusual first name indeed, especially in this century. The main point of inspiration for the name was Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell, a naval officer who lived from 1650-1707. He is actually most famous for wrecking his fleet in the Scilly Isles due to a miscalculation of longitude at sea \u2013 but we leave this bit out when we explain the name. I trained as a naval historian and was, for a time, curator of maritime history at the National Maritime Museum.</p> <p>My wife and I always found the name to be a delight, totally at odds with the historical figure and his fate. It conjures up atmospheric imagery. The only other people with the first name Cloudesley that we can find information about seem to be 19th-century academics and cricketers. For many years, \u201cCloudesley\u201d was how we would refer to our hypothetical future child: \u201cone day, when we have a Cloudesley \u2026\u201d When our son was born, we knew it had to be Cloudesley. Curiously, two months before he was born, I saw <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/n1HD20ZfXpM\">a segment about the rarity of the name</a> on QI: I nearly wrote in to tell them that the world now has another Cloudesley in it! <strong>Joshua Newton, London </strong></p> <h2>\u2018People assume I\u2019m some kind of Dutch aristocrat\u2019</h2> <p>My last name Lyne de Ver is a mix of my dad\u2019s English surname Lyne meaning waterway or lake, and my mum\u2019s surname Ver. She is a Hungarian refugee who came to England when she was 12 and apparently Ver in Hungarian means blood. Cheery. My unmarried parents decided to put their names together when I was born. I always get comments on it \u2013 usually people assuming I\u2019m some kind of Dutch aristocrat. I actually have decidedly working class origins, albeit creative parents who added a fancy \u201cde\u201d in the middle. My parents did then marry, and divorced. I decided to keep the name when I married, so now only my mum and I have the name \u2013 I assume we\u2019re the only ones in the world with it, which I love. <strong>Jessica Lyne de Ver, 42, Godalming </strong></p> <h2>\u2018We named our daughter after a small and noisy bird\u2019</h2> <p>When our daughter, Matilda Wren Harrison, was born in November 2015, we had a hard time choosing her name. We consulted loads of baby name books. My wife\u2019s a teacher, and she didn\u2019t want her to have the same name as one of her students. So we just decided, let\u2019s see what she looks like. And she just looked like a Matilda. As for her middle name, we chose Wren based purely on the fact that she was a small and very noisy bird. I\u2019ve always been into ornithology and the prophecy has been fulfilled \u2013 she\u2019s been very chatty since she was 14 months old. <strong>Chris Harrison, 41, Stalybridge </strong></p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019ve never met another Reeve\u2019</h2> <p>My parents intended to name me Ryan, regardless of whether I was a boy or a girl. Friends of theirs had their baby days before I was born and used the name Ryan. My mother insisted on a short, \u201cR\u201d name and thought about the actor Christopher Reeve, who was then playing Superman. So Reeve it was. I\u2019ve never met another Reeve, although I\u2019m complimented on my name often. I always enjoyed having an unusual name. As a kid, occasionally I\u2019d be teased about it, but everyone was teased about something or other. Many of my female classmates were named Jennifer, which is a lovely name, but it must be odd in its own way to share your name with so many others in your generation. <strong>Reeve, 45, Pennsylvania </strong></p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m named after a Baywatch character\u2019</h2> <p>People often look at me blankly when I say my name in my broad Yorkshire accent. I\u2019ve had friends repeat it after me in the Queen\u2019s English, as if it has to be translated, and it causes so much confusion at Starbucks that I give a fake name. I\u2019ve often been asked whether if it\u2019s short for something else \u2013 depending on my mood, I\u2019ll sometimes say Shaunifer or Shaniqua. The truth is that I\u2019m named after a Baywatch character Shauni McClain. Yes, my dad chose it. <strong>Shauni Sanderson, 34, Leeds </strong></p> <h2>\u2018We didn\u2019t want the name to die out\u2019</h2> <p>We were scratching our heads for a name for our newborn son. When his brother visited from uni, where he was studying English literature, he left us without helping resolve the problem. However, on the train back, he texted: \u201cGot it \u2026 Soren\u201d, after S\u00f8ren Kierkergaard, who he was reading at the time. We all loved it, although we wanted an English version of the name, so we pronounce it without the accent on the \u201co\u201d. Online, we found it was one of \u201cfive names dying out that didn\u2019t deserve to\u201d, so we stuck with it. <strong>Mark, Hampshire </strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "The view from the decaying jetty on the atoll of Peros Banhos takes in a vast lagoon surrounded by palm trees and sun-bleached beaches. From there, more than 50 years ago, some of the last Chagos Islanders were forcibly deported by British colonial administrators. Their pet dogs, several of which swam out to departing boats, were rounded up; the animals were shot or gassed. Clearance of about 2,000 people from the remote but strategically important archipelago in the middle of the Indian Ocean was complete by 1973. On the outer islands, creepers and banyan trees reclaimed deserted atolls, enveloping abandoned churches, homes and graveyards. The central island of Diego Garcia, however, became a US military base leased from the UK government. In return for expelling everybody from their homeland and an extended lease, Washington gave the British government a $14m discount on the purchase of American Polaris nuclear weapons. What became the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) had, in contravention of UN laws, already been detached from Mauritius in 1965 before the latter\u2019s independence was granted. Removal of the entire population \u2013 most of whom were initially dumped without effective compensation in shantytowns in Mauritius and Seychelles \u2013 also marked the start of a determined but arduous campaign by Chagossians to obtain the right to return. A series of legal challenges were brought by the Chagos Refugee Group, notably Olivier Bancoult, who took so many actions in the London high courts that judges referred to them as Bancoult No 1, Bancoult No 2, No 3, No 4 and No 5 for legal convenience. It was an emotional rollercoaster as Chagossian hopes of returning home occasionally soared only to be dashed by switches in Foreign Office policy. One internal memo notoriously belittled Chagossians as a \u201ca few Tarzans and Man Fridays\u201d. Bancoult\u2019s first case against the Foreign Office was heard in 2000. The high court sensationally ruled in his favour, judges agreeing that the government did not have the power to expel all inhabitants. Nevertheless, in 2004 the government again declared that no one had the right of abode on BIOT. In 2010, the outgoing Labour government created a marine protected area (MPA), banning fishing around the Chagos. In Bancoult No 3, lawyers argued that the MPA had been established solely to render it impracticable for Chagossians to live on the islands. Bancoult lost in the UK supreme court. As further legal challenges came and went, the Mauritian government, working with lawyers including Prof Philippe Sands KC, explored an alternative legal approach \u2013 questioning the legality of the original detachment of the Chagos Islands from Mauritius. Mauritius argued that the separation was in breach of UN general assembly resolution 1514, passed in 1960, which banned the breakup of colonies prior to independence. Mauritius went to the UN general assembly in New York and urged that the issue be referred to the organisation\u2019s highest court, the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague, for an advisory legal opinion on the status of the archipelago. Cases about Britain\u2019s mistreatment of the Chagossians had aroused international sympathy for their cause. The Mauritian challenge was further helped by the UK\u2019s 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU, depriving the UK of European allies at a crucial moment. When it came to a general assembly vote in 2017 on whether to seek an advisory opinion, Mauritius won by 94 to 15. The ICJ majority judgment delivered two years later was even more humiliating. The UK was ordered to hand back the Chagos Islands to Mauritius \u201cas rapidly as possible\u201d. UK diplomats shrugged off the vote, insisting it was only an advisory opinion and therefore non-binding. For the Mauritian government, however, its claim to sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago was now established in international law and endorsed by the United Nations. Two years ago the Mauritian government sent an expedition to the Chagos archipelago. The Guardian, which had covered the dispute for many years, was present when the Mauritian flag was raised on Peros Banhos in defiance of London\u2019s refusal to hand back the islands. Despite the flag subsequently being removed by BIOT officials, negotiations with Mauritius eventually began during the UK prime ministership of Liz Truss in 2022. She may have been keen on removing a diplomatic obstacle to post-Brexit British trading relations in Asia. Two years later, Chagossians are hoping they can finally return, at least to their outer islands. Mauritius has promised to help them go home.",

A sign in the reception area of the police station at the Corby Cube reads: \u201cBail signers please either ring 101 and get an incident number or take a photo on your phone proving yourself as being at the front desk.\u201d The Corby and East Northamptonshire MP, Labour\u2019s Lee Barron, said he was meeting police on Friday to discuss the issue, adding it was damaging the public perception of the police. The front counter at the police station in the Northamptonshire town, which has more than 68,000 residents, is now only open on Tuesdays and Thursdays, owing to staffing shortages. Previously the police station was open to the public from Monday to Friday. Barron said it was \u201cpretty shocking\u201d that Corby had reached such a level with policing that people answering bail were \u201chaving to prove their bail conditions by taking selfies\u201d. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t so serious, it would be funny,\u201d Barron said. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is have a situation where the public perception of the police is they\u2019re not there.\u201d His constituents have also had issues reporting crimes in person, and obtaining crime numbers for insurance purposes, he added. \u201cThis is no criticism of police officers,\u201d he added. \u201cThese officers deserve better resources to enable them to do their jobs.\u201d Conditions to report to a police station at designated times are often imposed on those who have been released on police bail while under investigation, or have been bailed by a court before a future appearance.

But that didn\u2019t work, so they decided on an alternate course of action as Dutcher was about three miles from reaching a T-shaped intersection at the end of the road that they were on, WDAY reported.</p> <p>A deputy instructed Dutcher to intentionally run into the back of a Minnesota state patrol trooper\u2019s squad car. Meanwhile, the trooper, Zach Gruver, sped up, positioned himself in front of Dutcher and activated his cruiser\u2019s anti-collision sensors.</p> <p>\u201cYes, run into the back of his car,\u201d the deputy reassured an uncertain Dutcher, as video from the officer\u2019s cruiser showed.</p> <p>Dutcher did as he was told. He rammed his SUV into the rear of Gruver\u2019s cruiser, and they both eventually came to a stop. The white-knuckle episode reportedly lasted about 20 minutes and concluded with no one being physically injured.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MnStatePatrol/posts/pfbid09U7kJd588tcWArRP1JVGYF7DWSe7UcRCgDvUNbCM8kErKvp6PWLL6ykVJjTz4VJ8l\">statement</a> on Facebook on Tuesday, the Minnesota state patrol said: \u201cIt\u2019s not very often a sheriff\u2019s deputy orders you to hit a state patrol vehicle, but hitting trooper Zach Gruver\u2019s squad [car] helped save 18-year-old Sam Dutcher\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <p>Gruver told ABC outlets: \u201cI don\u2019t think I did anything special. Really what I think it comes down to is I just had the fastest car and was able to get in front of him.\u201d</p> <p>Authorities have not said what caused Dutcher\u2019s car to accelerate on its own. What is known as sudden unintended acceleration can generally occur for a number of reasons ranging from mistakenly pressing a pedal in the car to mechanical or electrical problems with the vehicle, as <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703510204575085531383717288?KEYWORDS=sudden+acceleration\">the Wall Street Journal</a> previously reported.</p> <p>Honda later distributed a statement to ABC News, which said the car manufacturer was \u201cgrateful\u201d that Dutcher was safe and expressed gratitude for \u201cthe role of law enforcement in helping [him] stop the vehicle\u201d. The statement from Honda also said: \u201cWe cannot speculate about the issue the customer experienced without a detailed inspection, and we encourage the family to have the vehicle towed to an authorized Honda dealer for inspection if that has not already occurred.\u201d</p> <p>Dutcher told WDAY how it eventually dawned on him that his brush with death \u201creally just happened\u201d.</p> <p>Nonetheless, he had since returned to his classes at Minnesota State University Moorhead, where he is studying mechanics.</p>",

But that didn\u2019t work, so they decided on an alternate course of action as Dutcher was about three miles from reaching a T-shaped intersection at the end of the road that they were on, WDAY reported. A deputy instructed Dutcher to intentionally run into the back of a Minnesota state patrol trooper\u2019s squad car. Meanwhile, the trooper, Zach Gruver, sped up, positioned himself in front of Dutcher and activated his cruiser\u2019s anti-collision sensors. \u201cYes, run into the back of his car,\u201d the deputy reassured an uncertain Dutcher, as video from the officer\u2019s cruiser showed. Dutcher did as he was told. He rammed his SUV into the rear of Gruver\u2019s cruiser, and they both eventually came to a stop. The white-knuckle episode reportedly lasted about 20 minutes and concluded with no one being physically injured. In a statement on Facebook on Tuesday, the Minnesota state patrol said: \u201cIt\u2019s not very often a sheriff\u2019s deputy orders you to hit a state patrol vehicle, but hitting trooper Zach Gruver\u2019s squad [car] helped save 18-year-old Sam Dutcher\u2019s life.\u201d Gruver told ABC outlets: \u201cI don\u2019t think I did anything special. Really what I think it comes down to is I just had the fastest car and was able to get in front of him.\u201d Authorities have not said what caused Dutcher\u2019s car to accelerate on its own. What is known as sudden unintended acceleration can generally occur for a number of reasons ranging from mistakenly pressing a pedal in the car to mechanical or electrical problems with the vehicle, as the Wall Street Journal previously reported. Honda later distributed a statement to ABC News, which said the car manufacturer was \u201cgrateful\u201d that Dutcher was safe and expressed gratitude for \u201cthe role of law enforcement in helping [him] stop the vehicle\u201d. The statement from Honda also said: \u201cWe cannot speculate about the issue the customer experienced without a detailed inspection, and we encourage the family to have the vehicle towed to an authorized Honda dealer for inspection if that has not already occurred.\u201d Dutcher told WDAY how it eventually dawned on him that his brush with death \u201creally just happened\u201d. Nonetheless, he had since returned to his classes at Minnesota State University Moorhead, where he is studying mechanics.",

It\u2019s an MLS original, born of the league\u2019s inherent weirdness thanks to the efforts of its earliest and most dedicated fans. Messi and Miami didn\u2019t just boost a league property by winning the Shield \u2013 they etched their name onto a piece of US soccer culture, and one of MLS\u2019s two longest-running markers of sporting success.</p> <p>The Shield\u2019s very existence is owed to a grassroots movement that feels a world away from the superstardom occupied by Messi and strived for by the league as a whole. The original trophy was conceived just a few years into the league\u2019s existence by supporters (hence the name), who felt that, in addition to the champion-crowning playoffs and MLS Cup, there should be recognition for the team with the most points at the end of the year, as happens in virtually every other domestic league in the world. The original shield itself was fabricated by a Kansas University art student for a few thousand dollars. It has since been replaced, but has usually been passed between fan organizations rather than club officials. Wednesday was a rare instance in which it was not: Because none of Inter Miami\u2019s supporters\u2019 groups are registered with the Independent Supporters\u2019 Council (ISC), the group that administers the Shield, fans of 2023 winners FC Cincinnati drove to Columbus to hand-deliver it to Inter Miami for their locker room celebration (In theory, Miami fans will hold the Shield once a group joins the ISC). </p> <p>Despite the unexpected involvement of Messi and all of Miami\u2019s stars, there was no on-field pomp and circumstance when the shield exchange occurred (a clear missed opportunity by the league). A star won\u2019t be added above the Inter Miami crest, and the club won\u2019t be known as 2024\u2019s league champion. In a sense, that\u2019s fair \u2013 the size of the league and its unbalanced schedule means that the Shield is not an unassailable measure of how one team stands in comparison to everyone else. But the Shield is still a pretty good indicator of which MLS team was actually the best over the course of the season, and for Miami to win it so soon after Messi\u2019s arrival is a huge achievement.</p> <p>It may seem like ancient history now, but remember that Miami missed the playoffs last year and were dead last when Messi arrived. Yet they won not just because of Messi, but because a constantly evolving team coalesced quickly and learned to play about as well without their biggest star as they did with him. Messi has missed 15 games this year, mostly due to injury, but still managed to put up an eye-popping 17 goals and 15 assists in his 17 appearances so far, as Miami averaged an impressive 2.12 points per game with the Argentinian. For most teams in MLS history, and certainly most Shield winners, losing such a productive player would be devastating. In Miami, the team did even better (barely), earning 2.13 points per game in the games Messi missed.</p> <p>That speaks in part to the performances all over the field. Luis Su\u00e1rez, of course, scored heaps of important goals. Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets elevated the play of those around them through their workrate and intelligence. Smart young additions like Federico Redondo raised the team\u2019s ceiling outside its stars. Stalwarts like Robert Taylor put in workmanlike shifts constantly. The defensive unit and goalkeeper Drake Callender also repeatedly came up in big moments, including on Wednesday, when Callender saved a Cucho Hern\u00e1ndez penalty kick that would have tied a game Miami needed to win in order to capture the Shield.</p> <p>The Shield win also speaks to the ability of head coach Tata Martino, who in essence was building the plane while teaching his team to fly it \u2026 sometimes without its captain. Between the end of the 2023 season and today, Inter Miami have turned over about half of their 30-player active roster. That includes players like Gregore, DeAndre Yedlin and Kamal Miller who had been important parts of the team\u2019s core. Several of those additions, like Redondo, right back Marcelo Weigandt, and midfielder Mat\u00edas Rojas either arrived midseason or had their introductions interrupted by injury.</p> <p>Despite proving their worth over the course of a full season, Supporters\u2019 Shield winners are not usually remembered unless they also win MLS Cup \u2013 something only four Shield winners in the last 20 years have done. If Inter Miami buck that trend and do the double, the sight of Messi lifting the Philip F Anschutz Trophy, on a podium, surrounded by confetti and joyous teammates at a sold-out Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale would be stark enough to overshadow everything else, including the Shield. This is especially true given that it could be Messi\u2019s last act on US shores \u2013 his contract expires at the end of this season. </p> <p>But if Miami make an early playoff exit, winning the Shield will always give Messi and Miami their own unassailable claim to MLS greatness. And the Shield itself, by mere association, could benefit in stature as a result.</p>",

Yet they won not just because of Messi, but because a constantly evolving team coalesced quickly and learned to play about as well without their biggest star as they did with him. Messi has missed 15 games this year, mostly due to injury, but still managed to put up an eye-popping 17 goals and 15 assists in his 17 appearances so far, as Miami averaged an impressive 2.12 points per game with the Argentinian. For most teams in MLS history, and certainly most Shield winners, losing such a productive player would be devastating. In Miami, the team did even better (barely), earning 2.13 points per game in the games Messi missed. That speaks in part to the performances all over the field. Luis Su\u00e1rez, of course, scored heaps of important goals. Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets elevated the play of those around them through their workrate and intelligence. Smart young additions like Federico Redondo raised the team\u2019s ceiling outside its stars. Stalwarts like Robert Taylor put in workmanlike shifts constantly. The defensive unit and goalkeeper Drake Callender also repeatedly came up in big moments, including on Wednesday, when Callender saved a Cucho Hern\u00e1ndez penalty kick that would have tied a game Miami needed to win in order to capture the Shield. The Shield win also speaks to the ability of head coach Tata Martino, who in essence was building the plane while teaching his team to fly it \u2026 sometimes without its captain. Between the end of the 2023 season and today, Inter Miami have turned over about half of their 30-player active roster. That includes players like Gregore, DeAndre Yedlin and Kamal Miller who had been important parts of the team\u2019s core. Several of those additions, like Redondo, right back Marcelo Weigandt, and midfielder Mat\u00edas Rojas either arrived midseason or had their introductions interrupted by injury. Despite proving their worth over the course of a full season, Supporters\u2019 Shield winners are not usually remembered unless they also win MLS Cup \u2013 something only four Shield winners in the last 20 years have done. If Inter Miami buck that trend and do the double, the sight of Messi lifting the Philip F Anschutz Trophy, on a podium, surrounded by confetti and joyous teammates at a sold-out Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale would be stark enough to overshadow everything else, including the Shield. This is especially true given that it could be Messi\u2019s last act on US shores \u2013 his contract expires at the end of this season. But if Miami make an early playoff exit, winning the Shield will always give Messi and Miami their own unassailable claim to MLS greatness. And the Shield itself, by mere association, could benefit in stature as a result.",

NHS wait times and the UK\u2019s broken health system run as a subsidiary arm to the narrative, as well as the heartbreak of not being able to visit loved ones during the Covid pandemic. References to blood-bound, family duty will be recognisible to anyone who has grown up in a south Asian household. But, tradition is not purely presented, it is challenged, too. The play lays out a plethora of culturally specific complications, generational differences and big unanswerable questions, which are realistically left untied. The final scene though is spoiled by its secrets being given away in the title. A shame, as otherwise this is an arresting picture of the ripple-effect of a dementia diagnosis and the heavy grief that follows. \u2022 At the Dorfman theatre, National Theatre, London, until 16 November",

There is a buzz around the conference now because we\u2019re involved in choosing a leader. But the reality is that no one cares what we think for at least another three years. I can\u2019t imagine what next year will be like.\u201d</p> <p>The conference was haunted by many ghosts of the last administration \u2013 with the former chief schemer Gavin Williamson telling colleagues he is planning to focus on children\u2019s charities and wildlife conservation from the backbenches.</p> <p>George Osborne, the ex-chancellor, watched the leadership speeches from the press gallery under the guise of being a \u201cpodcaster\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like the night of the living dead in here,\u201d said one Tory aide of the Spectator party, where the former cabinet minister Michael Gove held court as the new editor of the rightwing magazine, surrounded by formerly powerful colleagues.</p> <p>The candidates had a frantic schedule of glad-handing activists, delivering stump speeches at drinks parties and signing unusual merchandise. The candidates were eager to showcase their supporters; the former trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan was wandering round with a fake Tom Tugendhat neck tattoo, while a corridor was cleared for Jenrick and his wife, Michal Berkner, to walk down with a huge entourage of MPs behind them.</p> <p>Jenrick appeared to be so much considered the likely successor by some in the party hierarchy that he was moved to Rishi Sunak\u2019s suite in the Hyatt after the former prime minister left. The party insisted that was less to do with a presumption of victory and more because he had previously been next to Badenoch\u2019s suite and the two camps could hear each other through the walls.</p> <p>Badenoch, the target of an unofficial \u201cstop Kemi\u201d campaign among MPs, tried to engineer a move of her own to persuade centrist colleagues to back her to be one of the last two candidates, with Jenrick.</p> <p>\u201cShe picked up a bit of support,\u201d one said. \u201cUntil <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/sep/29/maternity-pay-is-excessive-says-tory-leadership-hopeful-kemi-badenoch\">the maternity pay thin</a>g. It just reminded us that she would be risky.\u201d</p> <p>The assumption among Tories in Birmingham was that Tugendhat would be knocked out in the next round of voting next week, triggering an almightly battle for his MP backers. If they move en masse to Cleverly, who is the next most centrist candidate, it could keep Badenoch out of the last two.</p> <p>Allies of Jenrick have been predicting with confidence \u2013 some would say misplaced \u2013 that Badenoch will not make the final. \u201cWe\u2019ll look forward to saying goodbye to her next week,\u201d one said.</p> <p>\u201cImmigration aside, Rob is more centrist than Kemi on lots of issues. She\u2019s more of a libertarian,\u201d a Jenrick ally said, pointing to Badenoch\u2019s opposition to Sunak\u2019s smoking ban.</p> <p>Allies of Sunak, however, were scathing of Jenrick\u2019s time in his government and said Badenoch had, by comparison, been a team player. \u201cRob stabbed Rishi in the back,\u201d a former Sunak adviser said. \u201cKemi was never actively helpful but neither did she try to undermine the prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>With such a focus on the contest, a former cabinet minister said many MPs \u2013 and the candidates \u2013 had not yet begun to acknowledge and process the reality of opposition. \u201cThey take solace from the fact Labour has had a bumpy few months,\u201d they said. \u201cBut they\u2019re delusional. The result was an unequivocal rejection of everything we stood for.\u201d</p> <p>Another said they felt the sense of optimism was getting out of hand. \u201cA few people are getting carried away and saying Labour will only last five years,\u201d said a former Tory MP who lost their seat in July. \u201cEven if Labour screw things up badly enough, we\u2019d need to win 40 seats off the Lib Dems and there\u2019s no way we\u2019ll do that when they\u2019re not in government.\u201d</p> <p>At numerous fringe events, MPs and others argued that a \u201cproperly Conservative\u201d agenda of quitting the ECHR, low taxes and culture wars would eliminate the threat from Reform and allow the Tories to sweep back into power against a weak and divided Labour government.</p> <p>At one event, the Orpington MP, Gareth Bacon, complained that the last Conservative government had \u201cgoverned from the left\u201d, and this was the only reason Reform did so well \u2013 not mentioning the 60 or so seats his party lost to the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>Some grassroots members may agree there is a need to swing right \u2013 with noisy approval for Badenoch at her fringe events and conference speech, and for Jenrick\u2019s enthusiasm for leaving the ECHR. But the more centrist and still pro-Brexit Cleverly got a similarly warm reception, and appreciation for acknowledging the party\u2019s failings at the election.</p> <p>The party is now in advanced talks to move the Tory conference from Birmingham to Newcastle next year. With the race now in effect a three-way battle between Badenoch, Jenrick and Cleverly, it is still wide open as to who will be attempting to give the Tories a fresh start in the north-east in 2025 \u2013 and whether anyone in the country will be listening.</p>",

The result was an unequivocal rejection of everything we stood for.\u201d Another said they felt the sense of optimism was getting out of hand. \u201cA few people are getting carried away and saying Labour will only last five years,\u201d said a former Tory MP who lost their seat in July. \u201cEven if Labour screw things up badly enough, we\u2019d need to win 40 seats off the Lib Dems and there\u2019s no way we\u2019ll do that when they\u2019re not in government.\u201d At numerous fringe events, MPs and others argued that a \u201cproperly Conservative\u201d agenda of quitting the ECHR, low taxes and culture wars would eliminate the threat from Reform and allow the Tories to sweep back into power against a weak and divided Labour government. At one event, the Orpington MP, Gareth Bacon, complained that the last Conservative government had \u201cgoverned from the left\u201d, and this was the only reason Reform did so well \u2013 not mentioning the 60 or so seats his party lost to the Liberal Democrats. Some grassroots members may agree there is a need to swing right \u2013 with noisy approval for Badenoch at her fringe events and conference speech, and for Jenrick\u2019s enthusiasm for leaving the ECHR. But the more centrist and still pro-Brexit Cleverly got a similarly warm reception, and appreciation for acknowledging the party\u2019s failings at the election. The party is now in advanced talks to move the Tory conference from Birmingham to Newcastle next year. With the race now in effect a three-way battle between Badenoch, Jenrick and Cleverly, it is still wide open as to who will be attempting to give the Tories a fresh start in the north-east in 2025 \u2013 and whether anyone in the country will be listening.",

Developed in the late 1980s by the husband-and-wife team of G\u00e1bor Csup\u00f3 and Arlene Klasky, Rugrats was born in an era of non-traditional character design. This was the age of Ren and Stimpy, of Beavis and Butt-Head. An age where even the white-bread mid-century superhero Mighty Mouse could be reimagined as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZYvz-csE4s\">something warped and ironic</a>.</p> <p>But even compared with these shows, Rugrats was weird to look at. Tommy Pickles, the show\u2019s one-year-old lead character, has a huge and dented head that makes him look like something crossed between an overripe mango and a human brain. His friend Chuckie Finster has raving dots for eyes and hair that looks like someone has kicked a nest of snakes. Even though Tommy\u2019s cousinAngelica tried to disguise it with her hair, there\u2019s no denying that her head has the exact dimensions of a pear. This is all by design \u2013 during development Csup\u00f3 said that he wanted his characters to look \u201cstrange\u201d rather than \u201ccute\u201d. But this is because the design of the characters was two-dimensional.</p> <p>That changed in 2021, when Paramount+ launched an all-CGI version of Rugrats. Rendered in three dimensions, the new series was initially off-putting but ultimately fine. It didn\u2019t take long to adjust to the horrors of seeing a testicle-headed baby stagger around looking like a 1996 Windows screensaver. The public may have thought differently \u2013 the series had little of the cultural impact of the original \u2013 but it was a broadly successful experiment.</p> <p>However, I put it to you that this was because the 2021 Rugrats series was entirely computer-generated. The babies were CG. The parents were CG. The houses and gardens and streets were CG. The reason that it worked was because you could watch it and quickly assure yourself that it was OK, because everything was uniformly weird.</p> <p>The problem with Deadline\u2019s announcement, though, is the word \u201chybrid\u201d. This will be a film where real people will have to share the screen with computer-animated characters. Same as in the Paddington movies, or the Sonic the Hedgehog movies, or the Woody Woodpecker movies. However, those worked because the humans were interacting with animals, not screaming, stumbling babies with voices that make them sound like chain-smoking old ladies and heads that look like cysts.</p> <p>And yet, presumably, in the Rugrats movie this is exactly what\u2019s going to happen. You might be wondering what the balance will be between live action and CGI. Will there be CGI babies and human adults? Will the entire Pickles family be CGI, and they\u2019ll move into a neighbourhood of normal humans? Honestly, I can\u2019t see it mattering. However it shakes down, this will still be a movie about regular human beings who will be forced to look at a succession of pulsating, blob-headed characters who all to some degree look as though they\u2019ve made several trips through the Brundlefly teleporter.</p> <p>As much as Deadline is framing this like new news, the truth is that a live-action/CGI Rugrats has been on and off the cards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/24/rugrats-cgi-remake-fireman-sam-peter-rabbit-bob-the-builder\">for six years now</a>.

The decision is the first such ruling to come out of a state supreme court, and according to Chris Erchull, senior staff attorney at GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders, the ruling could set guidance for other states and federal courts fighting similar cases. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no US supreme court precedent, federal courts have to look around at what other courts are saying for precedent,\u201d said Erchull. \u201cSo it is going to be very powerful and persuasive.\u201d Erchull, who filed an amicus brief in the case, said it was critical for students to have a supportive framework that allows them to explore their gender identity in school. \u201cIt\u2019s not a public school teacher or administrator\u2019s place to make a decision about how and when to talk to families about these really intimate, sensitive matters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is in the best interest of everyone if the information comes from the student when the student is ready, on the student\u2019s own terms.\u201d Policies on LGBTQ+ students\u2019 right to privacy varies by school district throughout the nation. In 2015, the New Hampshire school board association issued a model policy to protect the privacy of trans students and to prevent discrimination, which was adopted by 48 of 196 school districts and charter schools, according to a 2020 ACLU New Hampshire report. The policy was rescinded in 2022 due to conservative pushback, but some school districts, including Manchester, the largest in the state, continue to advise school personnel not to share a trans or gender nonconforming student\u2019s identity to others without the child\u2019s consent. In July, California became the first state to ban school district policies that require staff to notify parents when a child changes their name or pronouns. Revealing a child\u2019s gender identity or sexual orientation to their family when they\u2019re not ready can lead to suicide and the child getting kicked out of their home, he added. LGBTQ+ youth are 120% more likely to experience homelessness than their cisgender and heterosexual counterparts. For Heather Romeri, it is crucial that students make their own choices about who they disclose their gender identity to and when. \u201cTwo of my children are both trans, so they have both been able to come to me at their own time when they were ready to disclose the information they needed to,\u201d she said. \u201cHearing that from someone else would have been not good for our relationship, not good for \u2026 our children [being able to come] out safely and happily.\u201d Nico Romeri has trans friends who haven\u2019t shared their gender identity with their parents because they fear for their safety, Heather said. \u201cThey really believe they will be hurt or they will be kicked out of their house,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey have [seen] others who have tried to come out to their parents, and it\u2019s had negative repercussions to them emotionally.\u201d She sees the victory of the New Hampshire ruling as a prime example for other states considering policies for LGBTQ+ students\u2019 rights. Now 17, Romeri said that he joined the amicus brief to support his friends who don\u2019t have the same supportive environment to transition. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to represent the people that can\u2019t voice [their identity fully] and to keep the laws in place.\u201d",

As government figures showed the number of households with children living in temporary accommodation in England rose 15% in the last year to nearly 75,000, it emerged that a young pregnant woman who was sleeping rough was refused support because she \u201cwasn\u2019t 20 weeks\u201d into her pregnancy. Others were rejected because they were wrongly judged to have no local connection or to have made themselves homeless \u2013 in one case despite a person having fled domestic abuse. The cases are among 564 instances of \u201cgatekeeping\u201d by council officials recorded by helpline operators at Centrepoint, a homelessness charity. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said the problem was \u201cextremely concerning\u201d. Councils and homelessness charities have said they need more funding to protect vulnerable people. On Thursday, annual homeless data for England showed 146,430 households were assessed as being threatened with homelessness and therefore owed a prevention duty in 2023-24, up 3.1% in the year. The number of families living in temporary accommodation rose by 12% to more than 117,000 after several years of stability. The number of asylum seekers needing help because they were required to leave Home Office accommodation more than doubled to 3,420 households, and the number of households who needed help owingto rent arrears because of a rent rise almost doubled to 590 households. Centrepoint said its helpline recorded 82 cases in the last 14 months where homeless people aged between 16 and 25 who had children or were pregnant were turned away by councils, and helpline staff say this is increasingly common. Paul Brocklehurst, the charity\u2019s senior helpline manager, said staff were spending increasing amounts of time advocating for council staff to provide homelessness assessments and temporary accommodation, as is their duty under the Homelessness Reduction Act and Housing Act. \u201cThe blame can\u2019t just lie with councils though,\u201d he said. \u201cDecades of chronic underfunding from central government have forced many to make impossible decisions around who gets what support.

Residents in the capital heard a missile flying overhead before hearing the sound of the explosion in the district of Bachoura. Videos showed the floor of an apartment building burning. Residents living in nearby areas began to flee, driving away quickly in cars and on scooters. The Israeli strike hit a medical centre belonging to the Hezbollah-linked Islamic Health Organisation in the early hours of Thursday. The attack was the second airstrike on central Beirut this week, with most strikes having previously been confined to suburbs in the southern suburbs. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was targeting Beirut and issued evacuation warnings for various locations throughout the night. Three missiles hit the southern suburb of Dahiyeh, where the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed last week, and loud explosions were heard, Lebanese security officials said. At least nine people were killed and others were wounded, Lebanese health officials said, adding that a further 46 people had been killed in Israeli attacks on the city in the previous 24 hours. A Hezbollah-linked civil defence group said seven of its staff, including two medics, had been killed in the Beirut attack, which Israel said was a \u201cprecise\u201d airstrike. Two days after Iran fired more than 180 missiles into Israel, the wider region awaited Israel\u2019s response to the attack. The US president, Joe Biden, said he would not support an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites, as he attempted to contain a rapidly escalating regional conflict. On Wednesday, the IDF said eight soldiers were killed in ground combat in southern Lebanon. The large group of soldiers, from the commando brigade and including an officer, was involved in a clash with Hezbollah in a village north of the Israeli border community of Misgav Am, while two other soldiers from the Golani brigade were killed in a separate incident.

For the German giants, who suffered a first group-stage defeat since 2017, Vincent Kompany\u2019s coaching experience at this level could be in question. But credit Villa\u2019s manager. Just as in the Premier League at Burnley last season, Unai Emery did a number on Kompany, and of the two World Cup-winning keepers, it was Emi Mart\u00ednez who outshone Manuel Neuer on Wednesday night. Just as in 1982\u2019s European Cup final, Villa beat Bayern 1-0. The goal came from a player who (sort of) shares his surname with Birmingham\u2019s most famous pop group. Jhon Dur\u00e1n\u2019s beautiful, first-time finish caught Neuer roaming. \u201cI never saw where the goalkeeper was,\u201d admitted Dur\u00e1n. He was almost sold in the summer, but has scored six times this season, five as a sub. The Colombian, once of Chicago Fire, is a brilliant finisher, a true wildcard to throw into what was already a dangerous forward line of talented Englishmen in Ollie Watkins, Jaden Philogene, Morgan Rogers and Jacob Ramsey.

The French league, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/24/tv-rights-chaos-france-premier-league-serie-a-la-liga\">beset by financial problems</a>, and struggling to sell overseas TV rights, has had a fine start to the group stage, with Lille pulling off perhaps the club\u2019s finest result in European football. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/02/champions-league-girona-feyenoord-shakhtar-atalanta-leipzig-juventus-lille-real-madrid\">Their winning goal against Real Madrid</a> arrived via Jonathan David\u2019s ice-cool penalty. R\u00e9my Cabella, who Newcastle fans may just about recall from his spell on Tyneside, pulled the strings in midfield, and Lille were worthy winners over the defending champions. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 was thrown on in the 57th minute for Endrick but it came to little avail against the club his kid brother Ethan plays for. Jude Bellingham and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior were reduced to scraps by Bruno G\u00e9n\u00e9sio\u2019s team.</p> <p><strong>Brest</strong> - The club\u2019s first season in European football continues to be a dream: this week it was a 4-0 win at Red Bull Salzburg. Abdallah Sima, a forward loaned from Brighton, scored twice amid a devastating counter-attacking display. The fact that Brest\u2019s first two games came against Austrian teams \u2013 they beat Sturm Graz in their first game \u2013 is a knot in the draw system. But Leverkusen, their next opponent, should be wary.</p> <h2><strong>Slipping down</strong></h2> <p><strong>Celtic</strong> - The Glaswegians were second in the table after matchday one, but are beginning to worry whether they can make the top 24 after the second week. The question marks against Celtic and Brendan Rodgers\u2019 record in Europe\u2019s top echelon returned against Borussia Dortmund. To use an apposite Scottish term, they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/01/borussia-dortmund-celtic-champions-league-match-report\">\u201cgubbed\u201d by Dortmund, 7-1</a>. It could have been more. \u201cAfter the first two goals it was quite easy to cut through,\u201d said Dortmund\u2019s latest English star, Jamie Gittens, embracing understatement. Karim Adeyemi scored a first-half hat-trick, and Dortmund became the third team to put seven past a Rodgers\u2019 Celtic team in the Champions League, following Barcelona in 2016 and PSG in 2017.

Barcelona 5-0 Young Boys was, with apologies, a case of men against boys, rather like their opening home defeat to Aston Villa. Their presence at the bottom of the table, along with that of Slovan Bratislava, asks an existential question of the new format. What happens to teams who become the whipping boys? With no trapdoor into the Europa League these days, what are the prospects for the lesser lights as the table takes shape and the no-hopers coalesce at the bottom? There is already a danger of the closing weeks being rather less than competitive.</p> <p><strong>Atl\u00e9tico Madrid</strong> - Perhaps the credit for Benfica\u2019s 4-0 win in Lisbon belongs with Bruno Lage\u2019s team: Kerem Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu\u2019s fine goal set off a famous win, and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda rolled back the years. Despite Atl\u00e9ti\u2019s struggles on the road \u2013 they have now won just one of their last 10 Champions League games away \u2013 the manner of defeat was striking. Diego Simeone\u2019s men conceded as many goals as they have in their entire La Liga season so far. The absence of key summer signing Robin Le Normand <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/sport/atletico-madrid-robin-le-normand-brain-injury-spt-intl/index.html\">due to a \u201ctraumatic brain injury\u201d</a> suffered in last weekend\u2019s Madrid derby provided one explanation; he has been outstanding.</p> <h2><strong>A good week for</strong></h2> <p><strong>J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku (Manchester City) </strong>- Tuesday\u2019s visit to Slovan Bratislava allowed Pep Guardiola a chance to experiment with his Manchester City squad, and rest some aching legs.

James McAtee, yet another local youth product, scored his first European goal. Most striking was Guardiola unravelling the trend for inverted wingers, fielding Savinho on the left and Doku on the right. It resulted in a record-breaking performance from the Belgian, with 26 touches in the opposition box against Slovan Bratislava. According to Opta, that was the most since its records began in 2008.</p> <p><strong>Mehdi Taremi (Inter)</strong> - The source of Inter\u2019s continued success in Serie A is strong recruitment, including a willingness to sign experienced players who still have something to prove. Beppe Marotta was CEO during Juventus\u2019 golden decade. He doubles as Inter\u2019s head of recruitment, and Taremi, the Iranian signed on a free from Benfica at 32, looks the latest hit. Two assists and a late penalty, his first Inter goal, sealed an all-action display from a player who starred in Portugal and now provides able assistance to Lautaro Mart\u00ednez and Marcus Thuram. Mart\u00ednez, Inter\u2019s captain, handed Taremi the chance to take the penalty against Red Star Belgrade as a reward for his overall performance in the 4-0 victory.</p> <p><strong>Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o (Juventus) </strong>- Something is stirring at Juventus under Thiago Motta. The club has returned to the days of smart signings rather than vanity projects, and Concei\u00e7\u00e3o was snapped up on loan from Porto after his father was sacked as coach. He wears the same Juve No 7 shirt as Federico Chiesa and Cristiano Ronaldo before him. Replacing the injured Nicol\u00e1s Gonz\u00e1lez after 12 minutes at Leipzig, Concei\u00e7\u00e3o took his opportunity well, confirming a talent made apparent during his cameos at Euro 2024. He ended up scoring the winner in a dramatic 3-2 comeback from a team who had to cope with keeper Michele Di Gregorio\u2019s 59th minute red card. Du\u0161an Vlahovi\u0107\u2019s brilliant equaliser was followed by Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019s weaving, darting run that ended with his second goal in five days.</p>",

For the German giants, who suffered a first group-stage defeat since 2017, Vincent Kompany\u2019s coaching experience at this level could be in question. But credit Villa\u2019s manager. Just as in the Premier League at Burnley last season, Unai Emery did a number on Kompany, and of the two World Cup-winning keepers, it was Emi Mart\u00ednez who outshone Manuel Neuer on Wednesday night. Just as in 1982\u2019s European Cup final, Villa beat Bayern 1-0. The goal came from a player who (sort of) shares his surname with Birmingham\u2019s most famous pop group. Jhon Dur\u00e1n\u2019s beautiful, first-time finish caught Neuer roaming. \u201cI never saw where the goalkeeper was,\u201d admitted Dur\u00e1n. He was almost sold in the summer, but has scored six times this season, five as a sub. The Colombian, once of Chicago Fire, is a brilliant finisher, a true wildcard to throw into what was already a dangerous forward line of talented Englishmen in Ollie Watkins, Jaden Philogene, Morgan Rogers and Jacob Ramsey. Villa Park swelled with pride and emotion in England\u2019s second city. Lille - Ligue 1 on the up? Only PSG let the side down, overpowered by Arsenal on Tuesday night, even if it did take a late goal for Monaco to rescue a rain-sodden draw at Dinamo Zagreb.

According to a document unsealed in federal court on Wednesday, on 7 December 2020, Giuliani tried to send a message urging someone unspecified to help in the plan to appoint a slate of fake electors. \u201cSo I need you to pass a joint resolution from the legislature that states the election is in dispute, there\u2019s an ongoing investigation by the legislature, and the Electors sent by Governor Whitmer are not the official electors of the state of Michigan and do not fall within the Safe Harbor deadline under Michigan law,\u201d Giuliani wrote. As Trump sought to overturn the 2020 election, his allies sought to appoint alternate slates of electors in states that he lost to send to Congress. These false slates of electors met in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, New Mexico, Nevada and Arizona and signed certificates in which they represented that they were valid electors in their states. Trump allies then attempted to send those certificates to Congress for counting on 6 January 2021. The plan failed. Some of the electors have since been charged criminally, while others have not. Some have said they were told that they were instructed they were acting as a backup in case Trump won court cases challenging the election results. Prosecutors said Giuliani failed to send the message because \u201che put the wrong number into his phone,\u201d prosecutors wrote. The detail was included in a legal brief by the special counsel Jack Smith that was unsealed by the US district judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing the federal election interference case against Trump. The brief, which contains several new details about Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the 2020 race, argues why Trump should be held accountable \u2013 specifically, why he is not entitled to immunity after the US supreme court held that presidents cannot be charged for \u201cofficial acts\u201d while in office. Giuliani is an unnamed co-conspirator in the case. He also faces criminal charges in Georgia and Arizona over his efforts to overturn the election results. He has had his law license suspended in New York and has been disbarred in Washington DC over his involvement in the scheme. He is also appealing a judgment that he owes two Georgia election workers nearly $150m for defaming them after the 2020 election. Giuliani has a history of sloppy cellphone use.

I sympathise with him. He seemed crestfallen that two young women were being thrown behind bars because a judge deified him and his painting, which, in Van Gogh\u2019s mind, was not meant to be venerated, but instead inspire young artists and activists to do exactly what Phoebe and Anna had done \u2013 to push the boundaries of life and art even further, and raise uncomfortable questions.</p> <p>During his lifetime, Van Gogh was a pariah. No one would buy his paintings, and he suffered from numerous untreated mental illnesses. He also lived in desperate poverty. A few months before painting Sunflowers \u2013 desperate, unrecognised and lonely \u2013 Van Gogh cut off his ear. Years after his suicide, the art market finally caught up with Van Gogh. The art world tends to love artists more when they\u2019re dead. When artists are alive, they\u2019re often too unpredictable and opinionated for their work to be easily commodified.</p> <p>Nature was Van Gogh\u2019s ultimate muse. He loved it, as do Phoebe and Anna. I believe he would have approved of Phoebe and Anna\u2019s action \u2013 it belonging to the tradition of activists and artists defying norms to create a new, better world. In the case of Just Stop Oil, to save our one and only planet from destruction and protect the natural world that Van Gogh so loved. Their protest is part of the legacy that he himself contributed to, followed by the surrealists, dadaists, Fluxus, the Young British Artists and many others whose works now sell for millions and grace the walls of prestigious museums.

      "body": "  <p>So you\u2019ve broken up with fast fashion. Congrats! You\u2019ve switched to buying secondhand, started to shop local and swapped polyester for EcoVero viscose. All worthy steps, and yet the climate is still in crisis, and there is more that can be done.</p> <p>Once upon a time, I thought sustainable fashion meant clothes I couldn\u2019t afford, in shapes I would never wear, and in shades inspired by ancient grains. To have an ethical wardrobe, I believed, meant to resign oneself to life in a porridgey hemp sack dress. But over the past decade, the industry has swelled with a new wave of designers determined to prove me wrong. Suddenly there were new brands for every style, all using cleaner, greener, fairer methods of production.</p> <p>At the same time, secondhand was emerging as the shopaholic\u2019s guilt free alternative \u2013 whether \u201ctrue\u201d vintage from eras past, or last season\u2019s unloved duds via booming resale apps. The secondhand clothes market is <a href=\"https://www.columbiathreadneedle.co.uk/en/intm/insights/second-hand-clothing-to-overtake-fast-fashion/\" rel=\"nofollow\">set to overtake fast fashion</a> by the end of this decade. As awareness grows, fortunately, so have our shopping options.</p> <p>Which is ironic, because if there\u2019s one thing the researchers, activists and advocates agree on, it\u2019s that we can\u2019t shop things better. Quite the opposite. The next phase of fashion\u2019s revolution has been waking up to the truth: that producing new clothing can never be \u201csustainable\u201d while the planet is groaning under the weight of our castoffs.</p> <p>Kantamanto market in Accra, Ghana, has become a symbol of both the problem and its solution. Some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/05/yvette-yaa-konadu-tetteh-how-ghana-became-fast-fashions-dumping-ground\">15m secondhand garments</a> arrive in the country weekly, mostly from Europe and the US. Skilled local artisans fight against the avalanche of waste by repairing and upcycling as much as they can \u2013 but around 40% go unsold and end up carpeting the beaches like seaweed.</p>    <p>Back home, the discourse has shifted to focus not on what we buy, but what we don\u2019t. How do we keep our clothes in use and make them last longer? How do we stay in love with them, instead of letting our eyes wander?</p> <p>While brands still have a huge part to play in fashioning a better system, bragging rights no longer belong to brand new threads but to something storied, well worn and lovingly maintained.

      "bodyText": "So you\u2019ve broken up with fast fashion. Congrats! You\u2019ve switched to buying secondhand, started to shop local and swapped polyester for EcoVero viscose. All worthy steps, and yet the climate is still in crisis, and there is more that can be done. Once upon a time, I thought sustainable fashion meant clothes I couldn\u2019t afford, in shapes I would never wear, and in shades inspired by ancient grains. To have an ethical wardrobe, I believed, meant to resign oneself to life in a porridgey hemp sack dress. But over the past decade, the industry has swelled with a new wave of designers determined to prove me wrong. Suddenly there were new brands for every style, all using cleaner, greener, fairer methods of production. At the same time, secondhand was emerging as the shopaholic\u2019s guilt free alternative \u2013 whether \u201ctrue\u201d vintage from eras past, or last season\u2019s unloved duds via booming resale apps. The secondhand clothes market is set to overtake fast fashion by the end of this decade. As awareness grows, fortunately, so have our shopping options. Which is ironic, because if there\u2019s one thing the researchers, activists and advocates agree on, it\u2019s that we can\u2019t shop things better. Quite the opposite. The next phase of fashion\u2019s revolution has been waking up to the truth: that producing new clothing can never be \u201csustainable\u201d while the planet is groaning under the weight of our castoffs. Kantamanto market in Accra, Ghana, has become a symbol of both the problem and its solution. Some 15m secondhand garments arrive in the country weekly, mostly from Europe and the US. Skilled local artisans fight against the avalanche of waste by repairing and upcycling as much as they can \u2013 but around 40% go unsold and end up carpeting the beaches like seaweed. Back home, the discourse has shifted to focus not on what we buy, but what we don\u2019t. How do we keep our clothes in use and make them last longer? How do we stay in love with them, instead of letting our eyes wander? While brands still have a huge part to play in fashioning a better system, bragging rights no longer belong to brand new threads but to something storied, well worn and lovingly maintained. Visible mending is becoming a badge of honour, as people push back against fast fashion\u2019s culture of planned obsolescence. Fashion activist Orsola de Castro recently took to Instagram to update her much-quoted missive that the most sustainable garment is the one already in your wardrobe. \u201cWhen it comes to clothes, maintaining, caring for and repairing your own is the most sustainable thing you can do,\u201d she wrote. It\u2019s a democratising take on a system that has long been criticised for its elitism. We might not all be able to afford a pair of \u00a3300 trousers, but we can try to look after the ones we have. We can invest our time; in repairing the zip when it breaks, in having them altered when our body or our taste changes, and in looking after them carefully on a day-to-day basis. Which leads us to the next frontier: washing. It might not be the sexiest part of the sustainability conversation, but it\u2019s time to hang our laundry habits out for inspection. Up to 25% of a garment\u2019s carbon footprint comes from the way we care for it, according to appliance manufacturer AEG. If you\u2019re one of the many people who fling everything in the laundry basket each night as a matter of course, take note. Beyond the environmental and financial cost of all that heating and spinning, there\u2019s another reason to employ the sniff test. Overwashing is damaging our clothes, too. Take a moment to reflect on your own laundry tragedies. We all have them; the in memoriam reel of wardrobe heroes taken too soon.

And let\u2019s agree that anything worn intimately should still be washed every time. But for everything else, stop and ask yourself: does it really need full immersion, or is this something a spot wash could fix?

      "bodyText": "The leader of the Quebec independence party propping up the government of Justin Trudeau has insisted that the political lifeline depends on the quick passage of two pieces of legislation, and warned Canada\u2019s embattled prime minister that he remains \u201cvery vulnerable\u201d. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader, Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, told the Guardian the Liberals must act swiftly to enshrine protections for dairy farmers and boost payments to seniors to stave off a fatal vote of non-confidence. He warned that unless both pieces of legislation are passed into law by 29 October, his party would begin discussions with other parties to trigger a federal election. \u201cWe have not had a friendly relationship with the Liberals for the last five years,\u201d said Blanchet. \u201cBut we saw an opportunity to pursue issues that were good for Quebecers and also good for Canadians.\u201d The Bloc\u2019s newfound political power follows a tumultuous month in parliament, in which Jagmeet Singh, leader of the leftwing New Democratic party (NDP) \u2013 ended a pact with Trudeau\u2019s Liberals. Since then the Conservatives have twice attempted to topple the government with no-confidence votes, both of which failed. Amid the instability, Blanchet\u2019s party sensed a rare political opening. The Bloc carefully assessed which pieces of legislation might be able to drive a wedge between Liberals and the NDP in order to extract as much political benefit as he could for his constituents. They settled on a bill to enshrine protection for dairy farmers and another that hikes payouts for seniors \u2013 two key voting constituencies for the party. The party only fields candidates in the province of Quebec, but despite its narrow geographic range it exerts a disproportionate electoral force, with 32 seats in the House of Commons. Formed in 1990 with the aim of promoting Quebec sovereignty at the federal level, the Bloc was initially envisioned as a temporary stopgap to a successful referendum on secession from Canada. But separatists narrowly lost a 1995 plebiscite, transforming the party into a permanent fixture of federal politics.. On many cultural issues, including on climate and LGBTQ+ rights, the Bloc tacks left of centre. Blanchet has called the British monarchy \u201cracist\u201d, \u201chumiliating\u201d and \u201calmost archeological\u201d in repeated calls for it to be scrapped as the foundation of Canada\u2019s political system. But the party has also frustrated federal politicians for defending discriminatory provincial laws that run afoul of the country\u2019s Charter of Rights and Freedoms, including a contentious law that bans religious symbols and disproportionately affects Muslim women. Of the two pieces of legislation Blanchet is wielding as a bargaining chip, the 10% increase to seniors\u2019 retirement income would cost C$16bn (US$12bn) over the next five years, according to the parliamentary budget officer, a figure Liberals warned was too costly. The federal labour minister, Steven MacKinnon, this week dismissed the Blocas \u201cseparatists\u201d, agitating for an election \u201cto usher in a Conservative government that \u2026 would bring in the winning conditions for their sovereignty project\u201d. Other Liberals have been more cautious in their criticism. The parliamentary secretary, Adam van Koeverden, told reporters \u201cthe Bloc\u2019s heart is in the right place\u201d but suggested there were other routes to addressing poverty among seniors. A loss of the Bloc\u2019s support would not immediately trigger an election, as the Liberal minority is strong enough that it requires only one additional party to back it to remain in power, and experts say the NDP would prefer to keep Trudeau in power, rather than face an election. But Blanchet\u2019s posturing reflects a shifting political landscape. Recent polling suggests the Bloc will dominate Quebec in the next election, wiping out a Liberal grip on key ridings needed for Trudeau to remain in power. That popularity mirrors a similar surge in support for the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a provincial party whose leader has revived the prospect of a push to separate from Canada. Blanchet says voters in Quebec are drawn to the Bloc because they see other party leaders \u201cbehaving like bad kids in the schoolyards\u201d while his party remain \u201cserious, responsible, coherent\u201d in parliament. \u201cQuebecers preferred that to the style of [Conservative leader Pierre] Poilievre and they are very, very tired with Mr Trudeau.\u201d He also believes the appeal lies in a way federal leaders attempt to court both Quebec voters, as well as those across the country. \u201cIn order to please Quebec and Canada, Canadian party leaders tend to say one thing in French and another one in English.

Alvaro Manrique Barrenechea, a Tennessee immigration law professor, got a letter this year claiming he could be illegally voting, despite becoming naturalized in 2019 and having the legal right to vote. And Nicholas Ross, an Ohio music professor, became a US citizen in May after nearly three decades in the country but <a href=\"https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/08/06/ohio-sec-of-state-laroses-noncitizen-voter-registration-audit-sweeps-in-naturalized-citizens/\">received</a> an accusatory letter from the Ohio secretary of state in June telling him he could be ineligible to vote because he wasn\u2019t a US citizen. Voting as a non-citizen would be a crime, it warned.</p> <p>These purges are not just complicating the ability of some qualified voters to cast a ballot this year. They are also setting the stage for future laws to restrict voters\u2019 access to the ballot and are giving fuel to Donald Trump and his allies to seed doubt about the integrity of elections and undermine results if he loses in November.</p> <p>Trump and other Republicans are already using the false idea that non-citizens could vote in widespread numbers to suggest the election could be stolen.</p> <p>\u201cOur elections are bad,\u201d Trump said during the 10 September debate. \u201cAnd a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they\u2019re trying to get them to vote. They can\u2019t even speak English. They don\u2019t even know what country they\u2019re in practically. And these people are trying to get them to vote. And that\u2019s why they\u2019re allowing them to come into our country.\u201d </p> <p>There is no proof that non-citizens are voting, or even registering to vote, in any meaningful numbers. It\u2019s not the first time Republicans have made these claims, but the purges and rhetoric over non-citizen voting this year are, perhaps, at their apex.</p> <p>The rhetoric makes voting an immigration issue, linking two red-meat issues for Republicans. It also aligns with broad anti-immigrant sentiment the right is advancing, with much of it stemming from a conspiracy that there is an intentional and systematic effort to replace white Americans with minorities through mass migration \u2013 the great replacement theory.</p> <p>Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said the theory holds that the white population is being displaced by non-white immigrants \u201cwho will vote in a certain particular way\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese attacks on non-citizens and voters are part and parcel of the great replacement conspiracy theory,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re indistinguishable.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said it was clear why Trump and supporters were leaning into the myth of non-citizen voting.</p>    <p>\u201cThis is about setting the stage to claim an election was stolen,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be one of the primary, but among many, false claims made if Trump loses. And it will be false, but it still could be dangerous because it could incite his supporters to believing a totally secure election was stolen.\u201d</p> <p>The myth of non-citizen voting has also taken hold after some of the most outlandish myths about the 2020 election weredebunked, said Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian thinktank. </p> <p>\u201cIt keeps \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 alive at a point where most of the other things about \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 don\u2019t have much currency,\u201d he said, referring generally to the movement that tried to halt the certification of the 2020 election.\u201d</p> <p>Republicans have waged an aggressive legal effort in Congress, state capitols and courtrooms to create the false impression that there are non-citizens on the rolls. Congressional Republicans are pushing a bill to address the nonexistent problem, though it is stalled in DC after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/23/government-spending-shutdown-bill-trump\">failed effort</a> to tie it to a government funding bill.</p> <p>The Republican National Committee and other Trump-aligned groups have also filed suit in a number of battleground states \u2013 including Nevada, North Carolina and <a href=\"https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2024/09/04/america-first-lawsuit-seeks-force-counties-check-citizenship-federal-only-voters/\">Arizona</a> \u2013 accusing election officials of not doing enough to ensure non-citizens aren\u2019t on the voter rolls. The state officials have all said there are adequate safeguards in place to ensure that only US citizens are voting.</p> <p>Republican statewide officials in several states \u2013 Tennessee, Alabama, Ohio and Texas \u2013 have also launched efforts to hunt for non-citizens on the voter rolls and have flagged thousands of voters for possible removal. Voting rights groups have raised deep concerns about those efforts, saying the methodology is flawed and that states are presenting misleading statistics to give an exaggerated impression of how many non-citizens may be on the rolls.</p> <p>The list of potential non-citizens flagged in Alabama has so far shown itself to be off-base, the US Department of Justice said in a lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/28/us-justice-department-sues-alabama-voter-purge\">filed last week</a>, claiming the purge was conducted illegally. In response to letters asking suspected non-citizens to provide documentation of their citizenship before voting this fall \u2013 an extra hoop to jump through before casting a ballot \u2013 more than 700 voters, nearly one in four on the list, have provided such proof. </p> <p>***</p> <p>Ross, the Ohio music professor who received a letter from the state\u2019s top election official, said he dug into why he might have been flagged and found a likely reason. He had renewed his driver\u2019s license in January, when he had a green card, which seemed to land him on the secretary of state\u2019s potential non-citizen list. He sent in paperwork to prove his citizenship after receiving the letter.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you do this and just look at the last driver\u2019s license, you\u2019re just netting a lot of naturalized citizens,\u201d Ross said. \u201cAnd of course, my concern is, then you\u2019re creating this narrative of lots of non-US citizens trying to vote by including those numbers.\u201d</p> <p>Dan Lusheck, a spokesman for the office of the Ohio secretary of state, Frank LaRose, says it found \u201capproximately 600 non-citizens registered to vote, a relatively small number considering there are over 8 million registered voters in Ohio\u201d. </p> <p>LaRose\u2019s office forwarded the flagged registrations to the state attorney general for potential prosecution, claiming some of them may have voted. Prosecutors say they have investigated and found little. A prosecutor in one county office <a href=\"https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/09/16/why-is-larose-asking-ohio-to-investigate-voter-fraud-cases-that-prosecutors-believe-have-no-merit/\">told the Ohio Capital Journal</a> that most cases involved people checking the box claiming they are not citizens on their registration forms. When told they should rescind their registration, almost all of them complied. </p> <p>\u201cThe secretary believes that voter fraud is extremely rare because we take it seriously here in Ohio,\u201d Lusheck said. \u201cA law that is not enforced isn\u2019t a law, it\u2019s a suggestion.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the naturalized citizens erroneously on the list as non-citizens appear to have been flagged from outdated motor vehicles data. The voters may have driver\u2019s licenses that have not expired, then got their citizenship. The <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship-resource-center/new-us-citizens\">guidelines</a> for what to do after you become a citizen say a driver\u2019s license <em>can</em> be renewed or updated, but it\u2019s not a requirement. </p> <p>In Tennessee, state officials sent more than 14,000 notices to people asking them to prove their citizenship. The secretary of state\u2019s office there has since <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/voting-citizenship-tennessee-7802df69609bc54eb55d9296f6321100\">said</a> it would not remove voters who didn\u2019t prove their citizenship. The office did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>One of the voters targeted was Manrique Barrenechea, an immigration law professor at Vanderbilt University, who became a US citizen in 2019 and has voted since. He did not feel comfortable sending documents in the mail to prove what he believes the state should already be able to confirm.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re putting the burden on me to get information that you already have as government,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For some immigrants, the letter may read as intimidating, he said.</p> <p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s not that they\u2019re trying to make it difficult for immigrants to vote, but it really generated an extra step to me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Alabama secretary of state, Wes Allen, started a process to purge alleged non-citizens from the rolls within 90 days of an election, which both a private <a href=\"https://campaignlegal.org/sites/default/files/2024-09/AL%20Citizenship%20Complaint%20%28To%20File%29%209.13.24%20430pm%20FINAL.pdf\">lawsuit</a> and the justice department lawsuit claim runs afoul of federal law. Allen also referred the alleged non-citizens on the voter list to the Alabama attorney general\u2019s office for criminal investigation, which the lawsuit argues amounts to voter intimidation.</p> <p>Allen\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It feels like they are trying to make me think I\u2019ve broken the law \u2013 just for trying to exercise my right to vote</p> <footer> <cite>James Cozadd</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some eligible voters who were sent letters by Allen issued declarations in court. Cozadd, a Republican and lifelong Alabaman, received a letter claiming he had previously been issued a non-citizen identification number. He wrote in his declaration that he cannot figure out why the state would believe that.</p> <p>\u201cI was stunned to receive that letter. It feels like they are trying to make me think I\u2019ve broken the law \u2013 just for trying to exercise my right to vote,\u201d he wrote. </p> <p>There have been some isolated examples of states that have had relatively small problems with non-citizens on their rolls. Oregon election officials recently said they would remove <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/oregon-2024-election-citizen-voter-registration-18d3c0bda65a5030cd07f1d536e39ab7\">more than 1,200 people</a> from its voter rolls after they failed to provide proof of citizenship when they registered. Only nine of them had cast ballots and there are 3 million registered voters in the state.</p> <p>Lorraine Minnitte, a professor at Rutgers who has studied incidents of voter fraud for decades, said that for years Republicans have seized on misunderstandings of the complex processes to maintain the voter rolls to suggest that non-citizens were voting.</p> <p>What\u2019s different now is the scale at which they are claiming it\u2019s occurring.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s now something that has almost a national audience where in the past it was a little more isolated to places like Texas or Arizona,\u201d she said. Constant images of migrants coming over the border that are aired on Fox News and other conservative outlets, she said, had only augmented the myth.</p> <p>Kate Huddleston, senior legal counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, said the messaging on this issue had ramped up over the past few years and coincided with racism and xenophobia. The misinformation about non-citizen voting could play into conspiracy theories and distrust of elections, she said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an extremely rare problem,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause people don\u2019t understand that this is extremely rare, we see laws or policies that end up sweeping in large numbers of naturalized citizens, or sweeping in folks who don\u2019t have easy access to documentary proof of citizenship, and then really taking away their fundamental right to vote.\u201d</p>",

Voting as a non-citizen would be a crime, it warned. These purges are not just complicating the ability of some qualified voters to cast a ballot this year. They are also setting the stage for future laws to restrict voters\u2019 access to the ballot and are giving fuel to Donald Trump and his allies to seed doubt about the integrity of elections and undermine results if he loses in November. Trump and other Republicans are already using the false idea that non-citizens could vote in widespread numbers to suggest the election could be stolen. \u201cOur elections are bad,\u201d Trump said during the 10 September debate. \u201cAnd a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they\u2019re trying to get them to vote. They can\u2019t even speak English. They don\u2019t even know what country they\u2019re in practically. And these people are trying to get them to vote. And that\u2019s why they\u2019re allowing them to come into our country.\u201d There is no proof that non-citizens are voting, or even registering to vote, in any meaningful numbers. It\u2019s not the first time Republicans have made these claims, but the purges and rhetoric over non-citizen voting this year are, perhaps, at their apex. The rhetoric makes voting an immigration issue, linking two red-meat issues for Republicans. It also aligns with broad anti-immigrant sentiment the right is advancing, with much of it stemming from a conspiracy that there is an intentional and systematic effort to replace white Americans with minorities through mass migration \u2013 the great replacement theory. Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said the theory holds that the white population is being displaced by non-white immigrants \u201cwho will vote in a certain particular way\u201d. \u201cThese attacks on non-citizens and voters are part and parcel of the great replacement conspiracy theory,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re indistinguishable.\u201d *** David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said it was clear why Trump and supporters were leaning into the myth of non-citizen voting. \u201cThis is about setting the stage to claim an election was stolen,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be one of the primary, but among many, false claims made if Trump loses. And it will be false, but it still could be dangerous because it could incite his supporters to believing a totally secure election was stolen.\u201d The myth of non-citizen voting has also taken hold after some of the most outlandish myths about the 2020 election weredebunked, said Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian thinktank. \u201cIt keeps \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 alive at a point where most of the other things about \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 don\u2019t have much currency,\u201d he said, referring generally to the movement that tried to halt the certification of the 2020 election.\u201d Republicans have waged an aggressive legal effort in Congress, state capitols and courtrooms to create the false impression that there are non-citizens on the rolls. Congressional Republicans are pushing a bill to address the nonexistent problem, though it is stalled in DC after a failed effort to tie it to a government funding bill. The Republican National Committee and other Trump-aligned groups have also filed suit in a number of battleground states \u2013 including Nevada, North Carolina and Arizona \u2013 accusing election officials of not doing enough to ensure non-citizens aren\u2019t on the voter rolls. The state officials have all said there are adequate safeguards in place to ensure that only US citizens are voting. Republican statewide officials in several states \u2013 Tennessee, Alabama, Ohio and Texas \u2013 have also launched efforts to hunt for non-citizens on the voter rolls and have flagged thousands of voters for possible removal. Voting rights groups have raised deep concerns about those efforts, saying the methodology is flawed and that states are presenting misleading statistics to give an exaggerated impression of how many non-citizens may be on the rolls. The list of potential non-citizens flagged in Alabama has so far shown itself to be off-base, the US Department of Justice said in a lawsuit filed last week, claiming the purge was conducted illegally. In response to letters asking suspected non-citizens to provide documentation of their citizenship before voting this fall \u2013 an extra hoop to jump through before casting a ballot \u2013 more than 700 voters, nearly one in four on the list, have provided such proof. *** Ross, the Ohio music professor who received a letter from the state\u2019s top election official, said he dug into why he might have been flagged and found a likely reason. He had renewed his driver\u2019s license in January, when he had a green card, which seemed to land him on the secretary of state\u2019s potential non-citizen list. He sent in paperwork to prove his citizenship after receiving the letter. \u201cWhen you do this and just look at the last driver\u2019s license, you\u2019re just netting a lot of naturalized citizens,\u201d Ross said. \u201cAnd of course, my concern is, then you\u2019re creating this narrative of lots of non-US citizens trying to vote by including those numbers.\u201d Dan Lusheck, a spokesman for the office of the Ohio secretary of state, Frank LaRose, says it found \u201capproximately 600 non-citizens registered to vote, a relatively small number considering there are over 8 million registered voters in Ohio\u201d. LaRose\u2019s office forwarded the flagged registrations to the state attorney general for potential prosecution, claiming some of them may have voted. Prosecutors say they have investigated and found little. A prosecutor in one county office told the Ohio Capital Journal that most cases involved people checking the box claiming they are not citizens on their registration forms. When told they should rescind their registration, almost all of them complied. \u201cThe secretary believes that voter fraud is extremely rare because we take it seriously here in Ohio,\u201d Lusheck said. \u201cA law that is not enforced isn\u2019t a law, it\u2019s a suggestion.\u201d Many of the naturalized citizens erroneously on the list as non-citizens appear to have been flagged from outdated motor vehicles data. The voters may have driver\u2019s licenses that have not expired, then got their citizenship. The guidelines for what to do after you become a citizen say a driver\u2019s license can be renewed or updated, but it\u2019s not a requirement. In Tennessee, state officials sent more than 14,000 notices to people asking them to prove their citizenship. The secretary of state\u2019s office there has since said it would not remove voters who didn\u2019t prove their citizenship. The office did not respond to a request for comment. One of the voters targeted was Manrique Barrenechea, an immigration law professor at Vanderbilt University, who became a US citizen in 2019 and has voted since. He did not feel comfortable sending documents in the mail to prove what he believes the state should already be able to confirm. \u201cYou\u2019re putting the burden on me to get information that you already have as government,\u201d he said. For some immigrants, the letter may read as intimidating, he said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not that they\u2019re trying to make it difficult for immigrants to vote, but it really generated an extra step to me,\u201d he said. The Alabama secretary of state, Wes Allen, started a process to purge alleged non-citizens from the rolls within 90 days of an election, which both a private lawsuit and the justice department lawsuit claim runs afoul of federal law. Allen also referred the alleged non-citizens on the voter list to the Alabama attorney general\u2019s office for criminal investigation, which the lawsuit argues amounts to voter intimidation. Allen\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. Some eligible voters who were sent letters by Allen issued declarations in court. Cozadd, a Republican and lifelong Alabaman, received a letter claiming he had previously been issued a non-citizen identification number. He wrote in his declaration that he cannot figure out why the state would believe that. \u201cI was stunned to receive that letter. It feels like they are trying to make me think I\u2019ve broken the law \u2013 just for trying to exercise my right to vote,\u201d he wrote. There have been some isolated examples of states that have had relatively small problems with non-citizens on their rolls. Oregon election officials recently said they would remove more than 1,200 people from its voter rolls after they failed to provide proof of citizenship when they registered. Only nine of them had cast ballots and there are 3 million registered voters in the state. Lorraine Minnitte, a professor at Rutgers who has studied incidents of voter fraud for decades, said that for years Republicans have seized on misunderstandings of the complex processes to maintain the voter rolls to suggest that non-citizens were voting. What\u2019s different now is the scale at which they are claiming it\u2019s occurring. \u201cIt\u2019s now something that has almost a national audience where in the past it was a little more isolated to places like Texas or Arizona,\u201d she said. Constant images of migrants coming over the border that are aired on Fox News and other conservative outlets, she said, had only augmented the myth. Kate Huddleston, senior legal counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, said the messaging on this issue had ramped up over the past few years and coincided with racism and xenophobia. The misinformation about non-citizen voting could play into conspiracy theories and distrust of elections, she said. \u201cThis is an extremely rare problem,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause people don\u2019t understand that this is extremely rare, we see laws or policies that end up sweeping in large numbers of naturalized citizens, or sweeping in folks who don\u2019t have easy access to documentary proof of citizenship, and then really taking away their fundamental right to vote.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "When Leonid Volkov, a longtime associate of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, was brutally attacked with a hammer outside his home in Lithuania in March, it initially seemed yet another case of the Kremlin hunting down its enemies abroad. The assailant smashed open Volkov\u2019s car window and struck him repeatedly with a hammer, breaking his left arm and damaging his left leg. Western officials and opposition figures assumed the attack, which took place a few weeks after Navalny\u2019s mysterious death in prison, had been orchestrated by the Kremlin. Then, last month, Navalny\u2019s team released an explosive investigation that cast doubt on that version of events. In the video, Maria Pevchikh, the head of Navalny\u2019s investigation department, accused the wealthy businessman and outspoken Kremlin critic Leonid Nevzlin of hiring the men to beat up Volkov outside his home, claiming the attack was triggered by a personal dispute. Nevzlin has denied any involvement in the attack. In a statement on X, he wrote: \u201cI have nothing to do with any attacks on people, in any form whatsoever,\u201d adding that \u201cjustice will confirm the absurdity and complete baselessness of the accusations against me\u201d. In their investigation, Navalny\u2019s team published screenshots they said showed conversations on the messaging app Signal between Nevzlin and an alleged associate, Anatoly Blinov, apparently discussing the attack on Volkov. Navalny\u2019s team handed their dossier of evidence to Polish authorities, where Blinov was arrested in September. The allegations have caused shock and led to infighting among members of the exiled Russian opposition, as people come to terms with the implications of the revelations, if true. Pevchikh, of Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation, told the Guardian: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a rulebook on what you do when you find out that someone you know stabs you in the back. \u201cVolkov was attacked three weeks after Alexei was killed. We had barely buried him. In the lowest point of our lives, someone pushes you from behind so you fall even more and suffer even more.\u201d Nevzlin, a former executive and partner of the ex-oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, gave up his Russian citizenship after the start of Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and is now based in Israel, where he owns a stake in the Haaretz newspaper. From Israel, Nevzlin has funded several media projects that are critical of the Kremlin and voiced staunch support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. He has previously clashed with other opposition groups, including Navalny\u2019s team, over disagreements regarding the best approach to challenge Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. Nevzlin is known for his more radical political views, including calling for the dissolution of Russia as a country and referring to the majority of Russia\u2019s population as \u201cslave cattle\u201d. The Navalny team\u2019s investigation is based partly on a cache of private Signal screenshots they have obtained, which, they say, reveal exchanges between Nevzlin and a fixer, allegedly Blinov, a Russian lawyer. Pevchikh stated in the video investigation that the screenshots were provided by a middleman with ties to Russia\u2019s FSB security service. The Guardian was unable to verify the authenticity of the conversations, which also featured covertly shot photos of Volkov and other members of Navalny\u2019s team living in Vilnius. \u201cTime to do away with this moron,\u201d reads one of the messages, which the Navalny team claims Nevzlin wrote. They further allege that Nevzlin, in the messages, discusses plans to abduct Volkov in a way that would leave him \u201cin a wheelchair\u201d before handing him over to the FSB. The Navalny team said in a statement it believed \u201cstupid senseless hatred\u201d combined with \u201cpolitical competition\u201d may have driven the attack on Volkov. The Polish law enforcement agency said Blinov was under investigation on three charges, \u201cincluding the charge of orchestrating the assault on Russian opposition activist Leonid V due to his political identity and activities\u201d. So far, they have not made any comment on the allegation that Nevzlin was behind the attack. \u201cMany different scenarios have to be investigated. We also know that in such cases, disinformation is often being shared,\u201d said Stanis\u0142aw \u017baryn, a national security adviser to the Polish president, in an interview in Warsaw. The arrest of Blinov came months after Polish authorities detained two men suspected of attacking Volkov, based on a European arrest warrant issued by Lithuania. Prosecutors said they were investigating eight people in the case \u2013 six Poles, a Belarusian and the Russian who has been charged. The Polish prosecutor\u2019s office said it was looking at events \u201cthat took place both in Europe (including Vilnius) and in South and North America\u201d. It was not immediately clear what incident authorities were referring to, though Pevchikh in the investigation also claimed Nevzlin was behind an attack on the wife of a well-known Russian economist based in Argentina who has feuded with Nevzlin on social media. Nevzlin in turn told Sota, an opposition media outlet he sponsors, that Blinov, the fixer, was seeking to implicate him in ordering the attack on Volkov, and denied involvement in organising any attack. He said he himself filed a report to the Lithuanian police on 5 August about what he described as a provocation. The community of Russian dissidents living abroad has long been disposed to infighting, but the accusations against Nevzlin have provoked the biggest split in the opposition movement since the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Navalny\u2019s team has also accused Khodorkovsky, once Russia\u2019s richest man who spent 10 years in prison after falling out with Putin, of being aware of Nevzlin\u2019s alleged crimes before they became public. Khodorkovsky has defended his former business partner Nevzlin, claiming the screenshots were probably part of a scheme orchestrated by Russian security services. \u201cEither it is true, and Leonid Nevzlin has gone mad, or it is an FSB provocation and a fake on which a lot of money has been spent \u2026 For perfectly understandable reasons, I lean towards the second,\u201d Khodorkovsky said last month. Khodorkovsky flew into Warsaw on Monday and met Polish prosecutors to share his own information about the case. In an interview on Wednesday, Khodorkovsky said he still believed the evidence was probably faked by Russian authorities. He also suggested the most implausible part of the allegations was not that Nevzlin could have theoretically ordered the attack, but that he would have been clumsy enough to leave a trail of evidence. \u201cThere are things you can believe in, although it would be idiotic and hard to see why. But then there are things that it is absolutely impossible to believe,\u201d he said. The scandal risks further splitting Russia\u2019s already marginalised opposition, which has been scattered across European capitals since Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and Putin\u2019s brutal crackdown on dissent. Without Navalny, regarded as a unifying figure and Putin\u2019s most formidable opponent, the opposition finds itself lacking a clear leader. The public quarrels have been eagerly picked up by Russian state media propagandists, who have been leveraging the scandal to further discredit the opposition. Pevchikh said: \u201cIt is damaging to all the sides including us, and it\u2019s probably a life-changing event in terms of the Russian opposition \u2026 But in these very difficult situations you just have to speak the truth, however sad and scary it is.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Mary Fleming was on holiday in Kenya when she saw it: a mound of secondhand clothes heaped by a river, the pile so vast and unruly it was spilling into the water.</p> <p>The sight shocked her. At home in Ireland she was a passionate shopper and bought a new outfit almost every weekend. Now in east Africa she was seeing the consequence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/13/clothing-environment-fast-fashion-thrifting\">fast fashion</a> and mass consumption.</p> <p>A decade later Fleming, now 34, is leading a campaign to prevent waste by swapping, reusing, repairing and repurposing clothes under the inimitable exhortation: \u201cBecause secondhand is feckin\u2019 grand\u201d.</p>    <p>She is the founder of <a href=\"https://www.changeclothes.org/\">Change Clothes</a>, a non-profit that hosts a swap shop in Dublin and runs pop-up outlets and workshops across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a>. It lets people rent, exchange and buy used clothes and gives tutorials in mending and upcycling frayed garments.</p> <p>\u201cMost people wouldn\u2019t know how to patch a hole. Once they figure it out they\u2019re delighted with themselves,\u201d says Fleming. \u201cIt\u2019s so simple it\u2019s criminal that it\u2019s not better known.\u201d</p> <p>Change Clothes outgrew its base in Crumlin, west Dublin, and this month moved to new premises in the city centre. \u201cSo many people were coming, we just needed more space,\u201d says Fleming, who was still unpacking and sorting shoes and fabrics at the Thomas Street hub. The non-profit also runs night markets and workshops in making Halloween costumes, Christmas baubles and wreaths.</p>    <p>\u201cThis has grown really quickly so who knows where we will be in a few years. There is an appetite for change, an opportunity for change.\u201d Fleming points to rolls of brightly coloured textiles stacked in a corner. \u201cAn underground network of textile freaks alerted me to a dump that had brand new rolls of fabric \u2013 it was heading for a landfill.\u201d</p> <p>Change Clothes is a mecca for the converted but Fleming\u2019s goal is to reach people who bin old or unwanted clothes and trek to Zara, Next or Gap and other outlets to replenish their wardrobe. \u201cIn some communities there is still a stigma about secondhand clothes and not wanting to be seen to be poor. We\u2019re trying to change perceptions. There is a lot of work to be done.\u201d</p> <p>Enticing people into a swap-shop can be a \u201cgreat gateway drug\u201d that introduces them to wider possibilities of reusing and repairing garments, she says.</p>    <p>Fleming and her team of two part-time staff and a dozen or so volunteers have three categories: clothes in very good condition, clothes that \u201cneed help\u201d and clothes at the end of their life.</p> <p>For a \u20ac5 (\u00a34.20) fee people with garments in the first category can book a 30-minute slot at Change Clothes, obtain tokens for their donations \u2013 the better the condition or brand, the more tokens \u2013 and then use the tokens to select items from the shop\u2019s racks.</p> <p>Alternatively you can rent an item, which must be returned clean, for about \u20ac10 per week. Last year, Fleming added her wedding dress, a sequin gown, to the rental racks. She had bought it online, her first such purchase in years, after her first choice, a secondhand dress, did not fit properly.</p> <p>Surplus clothing in good condition is donated to refugee centres and assisted living accommodation.</p> <p>Fleming\u2019s team crisscrosses Ireland visiting university campuses, libraries and community centres to give lessons in repairing or repurposing damaged or worn clothes. People\u2019s eyes light up when they discover they can do basic tailoring, she says. \u201cIt can be incredibly creative and mindful. You\u2019re not on your phone or laptop.\u201d</p> <p>Garments beyond rescue are chopped and cut and turned into something else such as banners or placemats.</p>    <p>The need for such skills is about to grow. From January <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240212IPR17625/textiles-and-food-waste-reduction-new-eu-rules-to-support-circular-economy\">new EU rules</a> will require member states to separate the collection of textiles for re-use and recycling, a directive that covers clothing, blankets, bed linen, curtains, hats, footwear, mattresses and carpets.</p> <p>The sight of that riverbank in Kenya redirected Fleming\u2019s life. She quit her career in corporate marketing to work for non-profits that promoted sustainability. Her first swap-shop, a weekend pop-up, was such a hit she organised more, using her parents\u2019 garage for storage, which she still does. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very patient, God love them.\u201d</p> <p>Fleming finds ideas and inspiration in <a href=\"https://suayla.com/\">Suay</a>, a Los Angeles shop and recycling hub, and collaborates with the Northern Ireland charity Show Some Love Belfast, but she has no illusions about the challenge facing the movement.</p> <p>Irish shopfronts are filled with Halloween outfits and decorations that will soon give way to winter and Christmas ware, then spring ware, summer ware and back to Halloween, part of a remorseless, globalised churn of production and consumption.</p> <p>\u201cIf I spent every day thinking about what we\u2019re up against I don\u2019t think I\u2019d bother. I want to focus on the change that is possible,\u201d says Fleming. Garment by garment she will spread the message: second hand is feckin\u2019 grand.</p>",

Once they figure it out they\u2019re delighted with themselves,\u201d says Fleming. \u201cIt\u2019s so simple it\u2019s criminal that it\u2019s not better known.\u201d Change Clothes outgrew its base in Crumlin, west Dublin, and this month moved to new premises in the city centre. \u201cSo many people were coming, we just needed more space,\u201d says Fleming, who was still unpacking and sorting shoes and fabrics at the Thomas Street hub. The non-profit also runs night markets and workshops in making Halloween costumes, Christmas baubles and wreaths. \u201cThis has grown really quickly so who knows where we will be in a few years. There is an appetite for change, an opportunity for change.\u201d Fleming points to rolls of brightly coloured textiles stacked in a corner. \u201cAn underground network of textile freaks alerted me to a dump that had brand new rolls of fabric \u2013 it was heading for a landfill.\u201d Change Clothes is a mecca for the converted but Fleming\u2019s goal is to reach people who bin old or unwanted clothes and trek to Zara, Next or Gap and other outlets to replenish their wardrobe. \u201cIn some communities there is still a stigma about secondhand clothes and not wanting to be seen to be poor. We\u2019re trying to change perceptions. There is a lot of work to be done.\u201d Enticing people into a swap-shop can be a \u201cgreat gateway drug\u201d that introduces them to wider possibilities of reusing and repairing garments, she says. Fleming and her team of two part-time staff and a dozen or so volunteers have three categories: clothes in very good condition, clothes that \u201cneed help\u201d and clothes at the end of their life. For a \u20ac5 (\u00a34.20) fee people with garments in the first category can book a 30-minute slot at Change Clothes, obtain tokens for their donations \u2013 the better the condition or brand, the more tokens \u2013 and then use the tokens to select items from the shop\u2019s racks. Alternatively you can rent an item, which must be returned clean, for about \u20ac10 per week. Last year, Fleming added her wedding dress, a sequin gown, to the rental racks. She had bought it online, her first such purchase in years, after her first choice, a secondhand dress, did not fit properly. Surplus clothing in good condition is donated to refugee centres and assisted living accommodation. Fleming\u2019s team crisscrosses Ireland visiting university campuses, libraries and community centres to give lessons in repairing or repurposing damaged or worn clothes. People\u2019s eyes light up when they discover they can do basic tailoring, she says. \u201cIt can be incredibly creative and mindful. You\u2019re not on your phone or laptop.\u201d Garments beyond rescue are chopped and cut and turned into something else such as banners or placemats. The need for such skills is about to grow. From January new EU rules will require member states to separate the collection of textiles for re-use and recycling, a directive that covers clothing, blankets, bed linen, curtains, hats, footwear, mattresses and carpets. The sight of that riverbank in Kenya redirected Fleming\u2019s life. She quit her career in corporate marketing to work for non-profits that promoted sustainability. Her first swap-shop, a weekend pop-up, was such a hit she organised more, using her parents\u2019 garage for storage, which she still does. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very patient, God love them.\u201d Fleming finds ideas and inspiration in Suay, a Los Angeles shop and recycling hub, and collaborates with the Northern Ireland charity Show Some Love Belfast, but she has no illusions about the challenge facing the movement. Irish shopfronts are filled with Halloween outfits and decorations that will soon give way to winter and Christmas ware, then spring ware, summer ware and back to Halloween, part of a remorseless, globalised churn of production and consumption. \u201cIf I spent every day thinking about what we\u2019re up against I don\u2019t think I\u2019d bother. I want to focus on the change that is possible,\u201d says Fleming. Garment by garment she will spread the message: second hand is feckin\u2019 grand.",

The storm has killed at least two people, with several more reported missing and more than 120 injured.

At least nine people also died in a hospital fire on Thursday morning, just a few kilometres from where Krathon made landfall. The fire is not believed to be linked to the typhoon, but authorities battled to evacuate hundreds of patients from the hospital amid the severe weather conditions. Krathon had reached super typhoon status earlier in the week, after passing through the islands in the northern Philippines, but stalled in the open seas to Taiwan\u2019s south-west and weakened before crossing the coastline as the equivalent of a category one typhoon. Residents received texts early on Thursday warning them to stay inside, but the Kaohsiung mayor, Chen Chi-mai, said there were still too many people outside. \u201cLooking at surveillance cameras we can see there are a lot of people out riding scooters under such strong wind and rain, which is really very dangerous,\u201d he said. Several landslides were also reported around the island, including in the far north-east, as the outer bands of the slow-moving storm covered much of Taiwan\u2019s main island, bringing more than 1.6 metres of rain to some areas far from the storm\u2019s centre. Authorities took extra precautions with this storm, after Taiwan was hit by the very strong Typhoon Gaemi, equivalent to a category 4 hurricane, in July. Gaemi killed 11 people in Taiwan, brought widespread flooding including to Kaohsiung\u2019s city centre and grounded several ships. Offices, classes and financial markets were shut across all of Taiwan on Wednesday and Thursday, and hundreds of flights were grounded. More than 38,000 troops had been placed on standby and almost 10,000 people evacuated from some mountainous areas. Two reported deaths occurred before the storm made landfall. Rescue authorities said on Wednesday afternoon that one man in his 70s had died after falling from a tree and two were missing \u2013 one having fallen into rough seas and another swept away by a river, according to government news services. On Thursday morning, a truck driver was reported killed after a falling boulder struck his vehicle. At least 70 injuries have also been reported, mostly in the east coast county of Taitung, which has been battered by high winds and rain. One person was reported missing in the central county of Yunlin. The storm\u2019s impact zone mirrored a destructive 1977 storm that killed 37 people, with authorities citing this to urge extreme caution. While Taiwan is frequently hit by typhoons, it is rare for them to make landfall on the densely populated west coast. The storm is expected to weaken as it travels up the western plain of Taiwan, reverting back to a tropical depression before hitting the capital, Taipei, on Friday.",

Not in emergency care, because you can\u2019t shop around. But people can end up waiting three years for a hip replacement. The state could provide vouchers for the amount the NHS would have spent, then patients could take their custom to the private sector and top up if needed. It would reduce waiting times, both for the patients who took the vouchers and for those that didn\u2019t.</p> <p><strong>Mary</strong> I agree the NHS as it currently works is inefficient. But I believe that the&nbsp;profit motive is in conflict with care. In my experience of the private social care system, the profit motive drives up prices and drives down quality of care.

      "bodyText": "Shash, 28, Cambridge Occupation Doctor, looking to become an orthopaedic surgeon Voting record Ukip, Tory, and in the last election he spoiled his ballot by spelling out R-E-F-O-R-M like a crossword answer in the candidate boxes Amuse bouche He\u2019s a beekeeper \u2013 \u201cBuckfast bees, pure British stock\u201d Mary, 44, London Occupation Public sector worker Voting record Doesn\u2019t like to say, as in her work she supports people with very different political views to hers, \u201cbut regardless, I live in a safe Labour seat\u201d Amuse bouche Her parents put her in Scottish Highland dance classes, and she has been known to bust it out at parties For starters Mary I was nervous. I don\u2019t always remember the right word. But I love to hear other people\u2019s perspectives. Shash I wasn\u2019t nervous. I enjoy agreeable disagreeableness. Mary I\u2019m vegan so only had one option for each course: arancini, and then tofu skewers. It was delicious. Shash I had deep-fried calamari, fish and chips, and three ciders. We didn\u2019t have dessert \u2013 we talked for so long we didn\u2019t even finish our mains. The big beef Mary Shash thinks some things should be funded by tax \u2013 defence, police, judiciary \u2013 but the rest should be left to the market. Having arrived late because of a delayed train I said, \u201cWhat about trains?\u201d He said, \u201cYeah, that can\u2019t really be left to the market.\u201d Then we talked about the water companies, and he said water shouldn\u2019t be left to the market either. Shash Clearly, we need a state for civilisation to exist \u2013 we need to prevent mob rule. But tax should be limited. It\u2019s inherently violent, mafia-esque coercion: \u201cGive me your money or I\u2019ll throw you in a box.\u201d Mary For him, it seemed the state\u2019s main purpose is defence against violence. But what about consensus, care and community? What if that\u2019s the reason we pay taxes, and those are the things that should be prioritised? Shash The reasons food banks exist \u2013 people not being able to meet their basic calorific needs \u2013 are grotesque, but the charitable neighbourliness is great. That\u2019s eroded by overreliance on the state. Sharing plate Shash I think there\u2019s room for privatisation in healthcare. Not in emergency care, because you can\u2019t shop around. But people can end up waiting three years for a hip replacement. The state could provide vouchers for the amount the NHS would have spent, then patients could take their custom to the private sector and top up if needed. It would reduce waiting times, both for the patients who took the vouchers and for those that didn\u2019t. Mary I agree the NHS as it currently works is inefficient. But I believe that the profit motive is in conflict with care. In my experience of the private social care system, the profit motive drives up prices and drives down quality of care. The amount of regulation you\u2019d need to make a market fair would bring in so much inefficiency that you may as well just run a state system better. For afters Shash Taking refugees is an inefficient way to alleviate suffering. If that money was spent in low-resource countries it would alleviate more suffering. Buying mosquito nets or childhood vaccines would affect millions of people rather than a few self-selecting thousands. Mary That\u2019s a theoretical utilitarian argument \u2013 do this as more people are killed by mosquitoes than war \u2013 that only works on paper. We live in a world that\u2019s going to push migration to northern Europe: the question is how do we deal with it ethically? Takeaways Mary Shash said, \u201cThe left always identifies with the victim, and the right with people who are strong.\u201d I can see the appeal of wanting to identify with winners and strength. He said people on the right have a stronger disgust response than people on the left. I was left wondering if that\u2019s what makes them defensive in the face of difference and change, because the world feels more threatening to them.

Andrew Bailey said he was encouraged that cost of living pressures had not been as persistent as feared, but warned the Bank was monitoring the Middle East crisis amid fears of an oil price shock. In a wide-ranging interview, Bailey held out the prospect of Threadneedle Street becoming a \u201cbit more aggressive\u201d in cutting interest rates, provided the news on inflation continued to be good. Sterling fell by 1.5\u00a2 against the US dollar on international currency markets after the article was published on Thursday morning, to trade at about $1.31 \u2013 its lowest level in three weeks. The pound had already fallen by more than 1% over the week but analysts said Bailey\u2019s Guardian interview had triggered a sharper decline. Kathleen Brooks, a research director at XTB, said: \u201cThe market has used Bailey\u2019s comments as a green light to price in more [interest rate cuts].

The central bank cut interest rates in August for the first time since the Covid pandemic, with a reduction from 5.25% to 5%. Although it held borrowing costs unchanged in September, Bailey signalled readiness to resume interest cuts if inflation continued to cool. Inflation currently stands at 2.2% \u2013 just above the Bank\u2019s 2% target. However, Bailey said if news on the pace of price rises continued to be good the central bank could become \u201ca bit more activist\u201d in its approach to cutting interest rates. However, investors fear escalating tensions in the Middle East threaten to drive oil prices back up towards $100 a barrel in the event of a spiralling conflict involving Israel and Iran \u2013 a development that could reignite inflationary pressures.

Once the Las Vegas Raiders ejected on the Derek Carr experience, it was clear that Adams\u2019 exit would not be far behind.</p> <p>The three-time All-Pro joined the Raiders to reunite with Carr, his old college quarterback and friend, and to get paid. Two years on, Carr is now in New Orleans and Adams is reportedly on the trade block, <a href=\"https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/player/_/id/14463/davante-adams\">with a plump bank account</a>. </p> <p>Things moved quickly this season. After the pummeling at the hands of the Panthers in week three, Raiders\u2019 coach Antonio Pierce said some of his players made \u201c<a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/story/_/id/41389532/antonio-pierce-blasts-raiders-business-decisions-made-loss\">business decisions</a>\u201d in the second half of the game, and that he would be forced to make some of his own. He did not identify the players he was talking about, but it doesn\u2019t take Watson or Holmes to crack the case. Four days later, Adams <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/story/_/id/41499052/sources-raiders-davante-adams-considered-week-week\">pulled up at practice</a> with a mild hamstring injury that the Raiders said would keep him out week-to-week. Then, the Raiders reportedly informed other teams they were <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41555473/sources-raiders-open-trading-davante-adams-pick-more\">open to trading</a> the receiver \u2013 and Adams told the franchise he \u201c<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/rapoport-davante-adams-informs-raiders-204410449.html\">preferred</a>\u201c to be traded. </p> <p>Although the rate of midseason trades has increased, they are still rare.

But in recent years we\u2019ve seen an uptick in deals for legitimate difference-makers, including Jalen Ramsey and Von Miller to the Rams and Christian McCaffrey moving to San Francisco.</p> <p>A potential Adams deal hinges as a pivot point for the season \u2013 and could tip the championship scales. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/02/cold-ravenous-and-predatory-private-equity-is-slouching-towards-the-nfl\">Cold, ravenous and predatory, private equity is slouching towards the NFL</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Integrating a new receiver midstream isn\u2019t easy, but Adams is not a typical player. He has proven he can put up meaty production regardless of who\u2019s throwing him the ball or the system he plays in. Adams posted 1,516 receiving yards in his first season in Vegas with Derek Carr and averaged 11.2 yards per reception in 2023 with Jimmy Garoppolo, Aidan O\u2019Connell and Brian Hoyer throwing him the ball. The 31-year-old may no longer be at the peak of his powers, but strip even 10% away from the six-time Pro Bowler and you still wind up with one of the league\u2019s premier receivers.</p> <p>The early signals are that the Raiders want a second-round pick in exchange for Adams. To most contenders, that\u2019s a palatable deal. Yet there\u2019s every chance that the asking price comes down. When the Panthers dealt McCaffrey in the middle of the 2022 season, Carolina\u2019s starting position was that it would require multiple high-end picks; they ultimately settled for a second-round pick and a crop of middle-round selections. Adams\u2019 <a href=\"https://x.com/spotrac/status/1841115996335063345\">contract is also fairly digestible</a>, and he can rework his deal to push his preferred trade over the line. </p> <p>Here are five teams who could make a swing for the receiver. </p> <h2><strong>New York Jets</strong></h2> <p>Despite strong offseason moves and the return of Aaron Rodgers, the Jets offense has been rickety through four weeks. They\u2019ve smoked the Titans and Patriots but come unstuck against the Broncos and 49ers. Problems along the offensive line have ground core elements of the offense to a halt. The run game has been solid if a little undercooked, and the passing game has been boom or bust.</p> <p>Some of the concerns that hampered Rodgers during the back end of his time in Green Bay persist, but there are signs that the Jets offense can catch fire if they can figure their offensive line \u2013 though that\u2019s a big if.</p> <p>But there\u2019s another nagging concern: the lack of chemistry between Rodgers and the Jets\u2019 star young receiver Garrett Wilson. There are hints, here and there, buried beneath the top-line numbers, that the pair\u2019s chemistry is growing. But for the most part, Wilson\u2019s value to the offense so far has been the gravitational pull he places on opposing defenses, which then opens up easier passing windows for his teammates.</p> <p>Adding Adams would be an instant cure-all. There was a time in Green Bay when the Rodgers-to-Adams connection was the most scintillating in the league. Of all the great quarterback-receiver duos in recent times, none were as productive as Rodgers and Adams. And rarely, in the history of the league, has there been a tandem so <a href=\"https://www.readoptional.com/p/davante-adams-packers-scheme-lafleur\">instinctive and intellectual</a>. During Rodgers\u2019 back-to-back MVP seasons, the pair were a <a href=\"https://www.readoptional.com/p/davante-adams-packers-scheme-lafleur\">walking first down</a> and they made 60-yard shots look like pitch-and-catch stuff.</p> <p>Stacking Adams on top of a receiving corps with Wilson, Mike Williams and Allen Lazard would hand the Jets as dangerous a combination of weapons as anywhere in the AFC.</p> <p>The Jets have the pieces to get it done, as well as the desperation to pay the asking price. They\u2019re operating in a Super Bowl or bust window with a 40-year-old quarterback, and if this season is a failure then everyone in the building could \u2013 and perhaps should \u2013 lose their jobs ... while it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what Rodgers would do next: Retire? Run for Senate?</p> <p>A package of linebacker Haason Reddick \u2013 still <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/haason-reddick-holdout-why-eagles-are-not-allowed-by-nfl-to-trade-for-star-pass-rusher-again/\">holding out for a new contract </a>\u2013 plus an early-round pick <em>should </em>be enough to get a deal over the line for the Jets.</p>    <h2><strong>Buffalo Bills</strong></h2> <p>Buffalo\u2019s offense opened the season on fire before it ran into a ditch on Sunday night against the Ravens. They\u2019ve democratized the offense around Josh Allen, splitting targets between a bevy of receivers and tight ends while leaning into a power-run game to lighten the load on their star quarterback.</p> <p>As plans go, it\u2019s a good one. Trading away Stefon Diggs in the offseason has, so far, proven to be the <a href=\"https://x.com/JFowlerESPN/status/1841452925970723235\">addition-by-subtraction</a> move the organization hoped it would be. But while the early returns have been promising, there are still nagging doubts about whether they have the receiving firepower to win multiple games in January against playoff-caliber defenses. The shellacking at the hands of the Ravens exposed the preseason concerns with Buffalo\u2019s receiving corps. It\u2019s a talented group, but the skillsets of their top threats overlap. At their best, each of the Bills\u2019 top targets do their best work aligning inside and attacking the middle of the field. </p> <p>Buffalo could, maybe should, bet on the development of their players \u2013 chiefly, rookie receiver Keon Coleman. But until one of the young pups proves they can be a difference-maker on the perimeter, the Bills owe it to Allen and their Super Bowl chances to kick the tires on an Adams trade. </p> <h2><strong>Washington Commanders</strong></h2> <p>You know that Mike Tyson quote about everyone having a plan until they get punched in the face? Well, every franchise has a carefully coordinated, multi-year rebuilding plan until they realize they\u2019ve stumbled into a special quarterback four games into his career.</p> <p>The Commanders\u2019 offense has been a buzzsaw, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/01/jayden-daniels-quarterback-washington-commanders-nfl-football\">Jayden Daniels setting fire to opposing defenses</a>. Washington lead the league in points per drive and the percentage of drives that end in a score \u2013 by an almost <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2024/\">baffling amount</a>.</p> <p>Maintaining that level throughout the season is a tough ask. Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s offenses have a habit of running into the ground the further a season progresses and, at some point, Daniels may return to Earth. If there\u2019s one thing that can keep the unit chugging along, it would be acquiring another All-Pro caliber receiver alongside Terry McLaurin.</p> <p>Adding a player of Adams\u2019 age and salary \u2013 he\u2019s due $36.5m next season \u2013 would mean accelerating the team\u2019s timeline. But it would follow the trend set by the Texans, Eagles and Dolphins of acquiring an experienced, expensive receiver while their talented young quarterbacks were still on cheap rookie deals. </p> <p>With the Commanders in an unexpected divisional race, they should act boldly to increase their playoff hopes and aid the development of Daniels.</p> <h2><strong>Green Bay Packers</strong></h2> <p>Cast your eyes around the NFC and it\u2019s hard to find a contender who feels <em>really </em>good about their championship chances. The Niners are hampered by injuries; the Eagles cannot figure out if their sludgy starts are a result of bad vibes, poor coaching, or a lack of talent; the Vikings are wondering if Sam Darnold\u2019s MVP-like start to the season is sustainable; Detroit\u2019s offensive line, once the powerhouse of the loveable Lions, has looked fallible.</p> <p>Perhaps the team with the most mojo in the conference, despite the defeat to the Vikings last week, is the Packers, who survived Jordan Love\u2019s early injury scare and were able to keep the train on the tracks.</p> <p>If the Packers were to chase a midseason upgrade, bolstering their pass-rush would be the top priority. But bringing Adams back would raise the team\u2019s ceiling on offense. The four-man grouping of Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed, Christian Watson and Dontayvion Wicks is filled with talent, but Adams would tie the pieces together. </p> <h2><strong>Kansas City Chiefs</strong></h2> <p>There is a stronger chance that Adams will push for a reunion with Derek Carr in New Orleans than signing off on a trade to Kansas City. But if Adams wants to win a ring, then pairing up with Patrick Mahomes is the way to go. And the Chiefs need a receiver.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/news/chiefs-wr-rashee-rice-carted-off-after-suffering-knee-injury-vs-chargers\">injury to Rashee Rice</a> could see KC\u2019s No 1 receiver ruled out for the season. And if Rice does make it back before the end of the regular season, he could still be suspended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/10/rashee-rice-arrest-warrant-aggravated-assault-dallas-crash\">due to his offseason arrest</a>. Whether Rice returns or not before the playoffs, Adams would inject some life into an offense that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/30/kansas-city-chiefs-unbeaten-start-nfl-football\">has been limp</a> in the early stages of the season.</p> <p>Still, acquiring a player in-division would come at a premium for the Chiefs. Some teams are comfortable moving a player within their division if it brings back the best haul. The Raiders, however, based on their current leadership, do not profile as one of those teams. But the Chiefs should still take a run at the top receiver on the market. They can fudge their cap figure to create enough room to land Adams and they have plenty of draft capital to toss at the Raiders. </p> <p>Whatever price would make the Raiders engage in talks would probably make most franchises queasy. But the Chiefs are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/12/kansas-city-chiefs-threepeat-chances-patrick-mahomes\">gunning for an unprecedented three-peat</a>. Go chase history!</p>",

There are hints, here and there, buried beneath the top-line numbers, that the pair\u2019s chemistry is growing. But for the most part, Wilson\u2019s value to the offense so far has been the gravitational pull he places on opposing defenses, which then opens up easier passing windows for his teammates. Adding Adams would be an instant cure-all. There was a time in Green Bay when the Rodgers-to-Adams connection was the most scintillating in the league. Of all the great quarterback-receiver duos in recent times, none were as productive as Rodgers and Adams. And rarely, in the history of the league, has there been a tandem so instinctive and intellectual. During Rodgers\u2019 back-to-back MVP seasons, the pair were a walking first down and they made 60-yard shots look like pitch-and-catch stuff. Stacking Adams on top of a receiving corps with Wilson, Mike Williams and Allen Lazard would hand the Jets as dangerous a combination of weapons as anywhere in the AFC. The Jets have the pieces to get it done, as well as the desperation to pay the asking price. They\u2019re operating in a Super Bowl or bust window with a 40-year-old quarterback, and if this season is a failure then everyone in the building could \u2013 and perhaps should \u2013 lose their jobs ... while it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what Rodgers would do next: Retire? Run for Senate? A package of linebacker Haason Reddick \u2013 still holding out for a new contract \u2013 plus an early-round pick should be enough to get a deal over the line for the Jets. Buffalo Bills Buffalo\u2019s offense opened the season on fire before it ran into a ditch on Sunday night against the Ravens. They\u2019ve democratized the offense around Josh Allen, splitting targets between a bevy of receivers and tight ends while leaning into a power-run game to lighten the load on their star quarterback. As plans go, it\u2019s a good one. Trading away Stefon Diggs in the offseason has, so far, proven to be the addition-by-subtraction move the organization hoped it would be. But while the early returns have been promising, there are still nagging doubts about whether they have the receiving firepower to win multiple games in January against playoff-caliber defenses. The shellacking at the hands of the Ravens exposed the preseason concerns with Buffalo\u2019s receiving corps. It\u2019s a talented group, but the skillsets of their top threats overlap. At their best, each of the Bills\u2019 top targets do their best work aligning inside and attacking the middle of the field. Buffalo could, maybe should, bet on the development of their players \u2013 chiefly, rookie receiver Keon Coleman. But until one of the young pups proves they can be a difference-maker on the perimeter, the Bills owe it to Allen and their Super Bowl chances to kick the tires on an Adams trade. Washington Commanders You know that Mike Tyson quote about everyone having a plan until they get punched in the face? Well, every franchise has a carefully coordinated, multi-year rebuilding plan until they realize they\u2019ve stumbled into a special quarterback four games into his career. The Commanders\u2019 offense has been a buzzsaw, with Jayden Daniels setting fire to opposing defenses. Washington lead the league in points per drive and the percentage of drives that end in a score \u2013 by an almost baffling amount. Maintaining that level throughout the season is a tough ask. Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s offenses have a habit of running into the ground the further a season progresses and, at some point, Daniels may return to Earth. If there\u2019s one thing that can keep the unit chugging along, it would be acquiring another All-Pro caliber receiver alongside Terry McLaurin. Adding a player of Adams\u2019 age and salary \u2013 he\u2019s due $36.5m next season \u2013 would mean accelerating the team\u2019s timeline. But it would follow the trend set by the Texans, Eagles and Dolphins of acquiring an experienced, expensive receiver while their talented young quarterbacks were still on cheap rookie deals. With the Commanders in an unexpected divisional race, they should act boldly to increase their playoff hopes and aid the development of Daniels. Green Bay Packers Cast your eyes around the NFC and it\u2019s hard to find a contender who feels really good about their championship chances. The Niners are hampered by injuries; the Eagles cannot figure out if their sludgy starts are a result of bad vibes, poor coaching, or a lack of talent; the Vikings are wondering if Sam Darnold\u2019s MVP-like start to the season is sustainable; Detroit\u2019s offensive line, once the powerhouse of the loveable Lions, has looked fallible. Perhaps the team with the most mojo in the conference, despite the defeat to the Vikings last week, is the Packers, who survived Jordan Love\u2019s early injury scare and were able to keep the train on the tracks. If the Packers were to chase a midseason upgrade, bolstering their pass-rush would be the top priority. But bringing Adams back would raise the team\u2019s ceiling on offense. The four-man grouping of Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed, Christian Watson and Dontayvion Wicks is filled with talent, but Adams would tie the pieces together. Kansas City Chiefs There is a stronger chance that Adams will push for a reunion with Derek Carr in New Orleans than signing off on a trade to Kansas City. But if Adams wants to win a ring, then pairing up with Patrick Mahomes is the way to go. And the Chiefs need a receiver. Last week\u2019s injury to Rashee Rice could see KC\u2019s No 1 receiver ruled out for the season. And if Rice does make it back before the end of the regular season, he could still be suspended due to his offseason arrest. Whether Rice returns or not before the playoffs, Adams would inject some life into an offense that has been limp in the early stages of the season. Still, acquiring a player in-division would come at a premium for the Chiefs. Some teams are comfortable moving a player within their division if it brings back the best haul. The Raiders, however, based on their current leadership, do not profile as one of those teams. But the Chiefs should still take a run at the top receiver on the market. They can fudge their cap figure to create enough room to land Adams and they have plenty of draft capital to toss at the Raiders. Whatever price would make the Raiders engage in talks would probably make most franchises queasy. But the Chiefs are gunning for an unprecedented three-peat. Go chase history!",

The speed garage bass on the title track wobbles stiffly \u2013 further undermined by the plodding almost-groove, and synth stabs arranged in an overused house rhythm. On Volume, Snaith heavily samples a hip-house ur-text in Marrs\u2019 Pump Up the Volume, but he can\u2019t do anything new with it, and flattens the original\u2019s alien dynamics (and here, as well as on Dear Life, the influence of one of the defining 00s dance tracks feels all too evident: the James Holden remix of Nathan Fake\u2019s The Sky Was Pink).</p> <p>As each Caribou project goes by, it\u2019s clear that 2010\u2019s Swim \u2013 where his pre- and post-club eras lolloped into each other \u2013 is by some distance his greatest.

      "body": "<p>Arafat Issa hangs Palestinian flags across a pedestrian bridge in Durham, North Carolina, almost every week. But on 28 July, a man in a baseball cap pulled out a knife and cut the flags down from the steel railing. Issa says the man cursed at him and his family before waving the knife in their direction. They had seven children, including Issa\u2019s four-month-old daughter, with them.</p> <p>\u201cHe told us: go back where you came from,\u201d Issa says. \u201cI was scared \u2026 it\u2019s not like we were doing anything wrong. We were peacefully protesting.\u201d</p> <p>Issa is a 42-year-old Palestinian American barber who has lived in North Carolina for more than a decade. His parents and siblings are in the West Bank, where settler violence against Palestinians is escalating. His experience is one of many examples of anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim hate documented by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) since 7 October of last year. \u201cWe are seeing an uptick in violent vigilante response to peaceful pro-Palestinian protesters,\u201d said Nicole Fauster-Bradford, the community advocacy director at Cair.</p> <p>Advocates say the aftermath of 7 October in the US had echoes of the fear that followed 9/11, when the government expanded surveillance<strong> </strong>powers that were largely wielded against Muslim and Arab communities, and hate crimes against them surged.</p>    <p>\u201cIslamophobia comes in cycles \u2013 often tied to something in the news,\u201d says Corey Saylor, research and advocacy director at Cair. The last year, he continued, \u201cstands out for its enormity\u201d of anti-Muslim hate.</p> <p>On the other hand, the last year has also seen a movement for Palestinian rights that is unprecedented in its size and visibility. \u201cThis is not the community that was subjected to payback after 9/11. It\u2019s much stronger now,\u201d says Saylor. \u201cEarly on, there was fear. I would say that\u2019s completely morphed to resilience\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>From <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/press_releases/new-cair-data-shows-anti-muslim-anti-palestinian-hate-remain-elevated-in-first-half-of-2024/\">January to June </a>of this year, Cair vetted almost 5,000 complaints of alleged Islamophobia; that\u2019s an increase of more than two-thirds compared to the same period the previous year. The volume of incidents was particularly bad in the immediate aftermath of 7 October. In the <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-new-data-shows-the-end-of-2023-was-a-relentless-wave-of-bias-community-resilience-is-impressive/\">last three months of 2023</a>, Cair received more than 3,500 complaints, an almost 180% increase in relation to the corresponding months in 2022.</p> <p>Cair defines Islamophobia as a fear, hatred or prejudice towards Islam or Muslims perpetuated by people and institutions. Many of the incidents in the last year entailed anti-Palestinian censorship and discrimination; Cair says it counts these cases because anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian bias are often conflated. Experts note that anti-Muslim sentiment has actually its origins in anti-Palestinian discrimination: Arab Americans organizing for Palestine in the 1960s and 70s were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/article/2024/may/23/islamophobia-us-palestine-history\">spied on by the government</a> and some of the country\u2019s first anti-terrorism laws <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/548748b1e4b083fc03ebf70e/t/65d637d9f2843f3855780ae3/1708537837536/Anti-Palestinian+at+the+Core-.pdf\">evolved as a response to Palestinian liberation struggles</a>.</p> <p>Among the most violent incidents of the last year were the fatal Chicago stabbing of six-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/18/wadea-al-fayoume-six-year-old-palestinian-boy-killed-hate-crime-illinois\">Wadea al-Fayoume</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/02/vermont-palestinians-students-three-friends-shot\">Vermont shooting</a> of three Palestinian college students that left one of them, 21-year-old Hisham Awartani, paralyzed. But far more common is what advocates view as the censorship and discipline of students and employees for being pro-Palestinian.</p>    <p>\u201cPost 9/11 was more of the knee-jerk reaction: your typical bigot inside a grocery store targeting a Muslim hijabi. That\u2019s reactionary, that\u2019s the type of discrimination we were used to,\u201d says Abed Ayoub, national executive director of the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee. The targeting of students and employees since 7 October feels systematic, he adds.</p> <p>Of the almost 5,000 complaints Cair received in the first half of this year, it said 19% were related to immigration and asylum, 14% to employment discrimination, 10% to education discrimination and 8% were hate crimes and similar incidents. Cair says immigration cases \u2013 often involving people from Muslim-majority countries facing extra scrutiny \u2013 have long been the most common kinds of complaints they get.</p> <p>What\u2019s new is people being targeted at their schools and workplace \u201cin a personal way that we\u2019ve never seen before\u201d, says Saylor. This can involve, for example, students and employees who get disciplined for social media posts supporting Palestine. Cair views these cases as discriminatory because, the group says, the rules are often enforced inconsistently, with workplaces and schools that send emails supportive of Israel punishing employees with different political opinions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/11/unlike-911-were-fighting-back\">\u2018Unlike 9/11, we\u2019re fighting back\u2019: Arab Americans in Dearborn are resilient in the face of Islamophobia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Palestine Legal, a non-profit that has filed more than a dozen complaints with the education department alleging anti-Palestinian discrimination, says the rules often go out the window when it comes to pro-Palestinian speech. \u201c[Students are] being dragged through disciplinary hearings without any due process. They\u2019re getting suspended before any conclusion has been made in their disciplinary hearing,\u201d says Dima Khalidi, the organization\u2019s founder and director.</p> <p>Like Cair, Palestine Legal was flooded with cases in the three months following 7 October, when it received more than 1,000 requests in that time. (That\u2019s <a href=\"https://palestinelegal.org/news/2024/5/23/new-report-analyzes-crackdown-on-palestine-solidarity-in-the-usnbsp\">four times more</a> than the number of requests they received in all of 2022.) Both organizations note their tallies are likely undercounts.</p> <p>Alongside these incidents, antisemitism has also been rising. FBI <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-2023-crime-in-the-nation-statistics\">data released in September</a> noted that anti-Jewish hate crimes increased by almost two-thirds in 2023, from 1,122 documented incidents to 1,832. It\u2019s not immediately clear how many of those occurred after 7 October. The Anti-Defamation League has also recorded a surge in antisemitic incidents, but its data has been <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/19/media/wikipedia-adl/index.html\">called into question</a> for its conflation of antisemitism with criticism of Israel.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Advocates point to what they say is the normalization of rhetoric conflating Arab Americans with terrorism, a pattern that recalls the post-9/11 environment. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/18/john-kennedy-senator-questioning-civil-rights-groups\">Last month</a>, the Republican senator John Kennedy repeatedly suggested, without evidence, that Maya Berry, the head of the Arab American Institute, supported Hamas and said that she should hide her \u201chead in a bag\u201d. That same month, the National Review <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/20/rashida-tlaib-cartoon-pager\">ran a cartoon</a> depicting the US congresswoman Rashida Tlaib with a detonating pager \u2013 days after such devices blew up across Lebanon in an operation targeting Hezbollah that has been widely attributed to Israel.</p>    <p>In the aftermath of 9/11, a slew of legislation justified law enforcement measures against Americans under the guise of fighting terrorism. While the environment after 7 October has not reached anywhere near that fever pitch, civil rights groups in the last year have found themselves pushing back against a number of efforts that they say conflate legitimate anti-war activity with terrorism. A coalition of more than 120 groups, including the ACLU, Amnesty International USA and Cair, recently issued an <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/documents/civil-society-letter-to-congress-opposing-hr-9495\">open letter</a> warning against a measure that would that would strip non-profit status from groups considered to be supporting terrorism, which is widely seen as targeting pro-Palestinian student groups.</p> <p>Ramzi Kassem, the co-director and founder of <a href=\"http://www.cunyclear.org/\">Clear</a>, a legal non-profit and clinic at the City University of New York, says his organization has seen an increase of complaints in the last year from people who have been approached by the FBI and other agencies in relation to protest activities \u2013 through door knocks, at airports and borders, and when applying for immigration benefits. They are not only Palestinians, Arabs or Muslims, but also people of other backgrounds who support Palestinian rights and oppose current US and Israeli policies.</p> <p>History shows that progressive movements challenging the status quo are often met with surveillance and disruption by US law enforcement, he says: \u201cWe saw that with the civil rights movement, the Vietnam war, the anti-apartheid movement and Black Lives Matter. We\u2019re seeing that again now.\u201d</p> <p>But any hostility \u2013 whether from neighbors, school administrators, or decision-makers \u2013 does not seem to be dampening what has become a mass movement for Palestinian liberation. Weeks after Issa\u2019s flags were cut down, on 22 August, he returned to the American Tobacco Trail Bridge with a friend. Another stranger approached them \u2013 this time, carrying a gun, Issa says. The two friends tried to follow the man to note down his license plate but retreated after he threatened to shoot them.</p> <p>Issa called the police about both incidents but law enforcement has so far declined to pursue prosecution. In the meantime, Issa can\u2019t imagine not protesting. He plans to go back to the bridge. \u201cWe have to support our family. It\u2019s not safe but it\u2019s not more dangerous than what they are living through,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to keep going. It\u2019s our duty.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Arafat Issa hangs Palestinian flags across a pedestrian bridge in Durham, North Carolina, almost every week. But on 28 July, a man in a baseball cap pulled out a knife and cut the flags down from the steel railing. Issa says the man cursed at him and his family before waving the knife in their direction. They had seven children, including Issa\u2019s four-month-old daughter, with them. \u201cHe told us: go back where you came from,\u201d Issa says. \u201cI was scared \u2026 it\u2019s not like we were doing anything wrong. We were peacefully protesting.\u201d Issa is a 42-year-old Palestinian American barber who has lived in North Carolina for more than a decade. His parents and siblings are in the West Bank, where settler violence against Palestinians is escalating. His experience is one of many examples of anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim hate documented by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) since 7 October of last year. \u201cWe are seeing an uptick in violent vigilante response to peaceful pro-Palestinian protesters,\u201d said Nicole Fauster-Bradford, the community advocacy director at Cair. Advocates say the aftermath of 7 October in the US had echoes of the fear that followed 9/11, when the government expanded surveillance powers that were largely wielded against Muslim and Arab communities, and hate crimes against them surged. \u201cIslamophobia comes in cycles \u2013 often tied to something in the news,\u201d says Corey Saylor, research and advocacy director at Cair. The last year, he continued, \u201cstands out for its enormity\u201d of anti-Muslim hate. On the other hand, the last year has also seen a movement for Palestinian rights that is unprecedented in its size and visibility. \u201cThis is not the community that was subjected to payback after 9/11. It\u2019s much stronger now,\u201d says Saylor. \u201cEarly on, there was fear. I would say that\u2019s completely morphed to resilience\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 From January to June of this year, Cair vetted almost 5,000 complaints of alleged Islamophobia; that\u2019s an increase of more than two-thirds compared to the same period the previous year. The volume of incidents was particularly bad in the immediate aftermath of 7 October. In the last three months of 2023, Cair received more than 3,500 complaints, an almost 180% increase in relation to the corresponding months in 2022. Cair defines Islamophobia as a fear, hatred or prejudice towards Islam or Muslims perpetuated by people and institutions. Many of the incidents in the last year entailed anti-Palestinian censorship and discrimination; Cair says it counts these cases because anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian bias are often conflated. Experts note that anti-Muslim sentiment has actually its origins in anti-Palestinian discrimination: Arab Americans organizing for Palestine in the 1960s and 70s were spied on by the government and some of the country\u2019s first anti-terrorism laws evolved as a response to Palestinian liberation struggles. Among the most violent incidents of the last year were the fatal Chicago stabbing of six-year-old Wadea al-Fayoume and a Vermont shooting of three Palestinian college students that left one of them, 21-year-old Hisham Awartani, paralyzed. But far more common is what advocates view as the censorship and discipline of students and employees for being pro-Palestinian. \u201cPost 9/11 was more of the knee-jerk reaction: your typical bigot inside a grocery store targeting a Muslim hijabi. That\u2019s reactionary, that\u2019s the type of discrimination we were used to,\u201d says Abed Ayoub, national executive director of the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee. The targeting of students and employees since 7 October feels systematic, he adds. Of the almost 5,000 complaints Cair received in the first half of this year, it said 19% were related to immigration and asylum, 14% to employment discrimination, 10% to education discrimination and 8% were hate crimes and similar incidents. Cair says immigration cases \u2013 often involving people from Muslim-majority countries facing extra scrutiny \u2013 have long been the most common kinds of complaints they get. What\u2019s new is people being targeted at their schools and workplace \u201cin a personal way that we\u2019ve never seen before\u201d, says Saylor. This can involve, for example, students and employees who get disciplined for social media posts supporting Palestine. Cair views these cases as discriminatory because, the group says, the rules are often enforced inconsistently, with workplaces and schools that send emails supportive of Israel punishing employees with different political opinions. Palestine Legal, a non-profit that has filed more than a dozen complaints with the education department alleging anti-Palestinian discrimination, says the rules often go out the window when it comes to pro-Palestinian speech. \u201c[Students are] being dragged through disciplinary hearings without any due process. They\u2019re getting suspended before any conclusion has been made in their disciplinary hearing,\u201d says Dima Khalidi, the organization\u2019s founder and director. Like Cair, Palestine Legal was flooded with cases in the three months following 7 October, when it received more than 1,000 requests in that time. (That\u2019s four times more than the number of requests they received in all of 2022.) Both organizations note their tallies are likely undercounts. Alongside these incidents, antisemitism has also been rising. FBI data released in September noted that anti-Jewish hate crimes increased by almost two-thirds in 2023, from 1,122 documented incidents to 1,832. It\u2019s not immediately clear how many of those occurred after 7 October. The Anti-Defamation League has also recorded a surge in antisemitic incidents, but its data has been called into question for its conflation of antisemitism with criticism of Israel. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Advocates point to what they say is the normalization of rhetoric conflating Arab Americans with terrorism, a pattern that recalls the post-9/11 environment. Last month, the Republican senator John Kennedy repeatedly suggested, without evidence, that Maya Berry, the head of the Arab American Institute, supported Hamas and said that she should hide her \u201chead in a bag\u201d. That same month, the National Review ran a cartoon depicting the US congresswoman Rashida Tlaib with a detonating pager \u2013 days after such devices blew up across Lebanon in an operation targeting Hezbollah that has been widely attributed to Israel. In the aftermath of 9/11, a slew of legislation justified law enforcement measures against Americans under the guise of fighting terrorism. While the environment after 7 October has not reached anywhere near that fever pitch, civil rights groups in the last year have found themselves pushing back against a number of efforts that they say conflate legitimate anti-war activity with terrorism. A coalition of more than 120 groups, including the ACLU, Amnesty International USA and Cair, recently issued an open letter warning against a measure that would that would strip non-profit status from groups considered to be supporting terrorism, which is widely seen as targeting pro-Palestinian student groups. Ramzi Kassem, the co-director and founder of Clear, a legal non-profit and clinic at the City University of New York, says his organization has seen an increase of complaints in the last year from people who have been approached by the FBI and other agencies in relation to protest activities \u2013 through door knocks, at airports and borders, and when applying for immigration benefits. They are not only Palestinians, Arabs or Muslims, but also people of other backgrounds who support Palestinian rights and oppose current US and Israeli policies. History shows that progressive movements challenging the status quo are often met with surveillance and disruption by US law enforcement, he says: \u201cWe saw that with the civil rights movement, the Vietnam war, the anti-apartheid movement and Black Lives Matter. We\u2019re seeing that again now.\u201d But any hostility \u2013 whether from neighbors, school administrators, or decision-makers \u2013 does not seem to be dampening what has become a mass movement for Palestinian liberation. Weeks after Issa\u2019s flags were cut down, on 22 August, he returned to the American Tobacco Trail Bridge with a friend. Another stranger approached them \u2013 this time, carrying a gun, Issa says. The two friends tried to follow the man to note down his license plate but retreated after he threatened to shoot them. Issa called the police about both incidents but law enforcement has so far declined to pursue prosecution. In the meantime, Issa can\u2019t imagine not protesting. He plans to go back to the bridge. \u201cWe have to support our family. It\u2019s not safe but it\u2019s not more dangerous than what they are living through,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to keep going. It\u2019s our duty.\u201d",

We can be seen everywhere on TV, film and runways, and we can be heard all across the music industry. It could be assumed that if we regularly manifest the first half of that popular Pride slogan, \u201cwe\u2019re queer, we\u2019re here \u2026\u201d, those outside our delightful social bubbles will do their bit and \u201cget used to it\u201d.</p> <p>However, for all of LGBTQ+ people\u2019s increased visibility, not everyone has got used to us. Recent <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2024/09/30/holding-hands-uk-same-sex-couples/\">research from Stonewall</a> showed that only 44% of LGBTQ+ couples in the UK feel safe holding their partner\u2019s hand in public.</p> <p>And sure, when we\u2019re in the middle of decidedly LGBTQ+ friendly places \u2013such as Hackney or Soho or Margate, or on holiday in European cities where we know we won\u2019t actually understand any impending words shouted at us \u2013 we will be affectionate in some ways. But more often than not, we don\u2019t hold hands. We snatch moments of affection when we know \u2013 because we\u2019ve checked \u2013 people aren\u2019t looking.</p> <p>Hand-holding is a common metric for LGBTQ+ people\u2019s perceptions of the tolerance of others. If we can\u2019t hold hands with one another, how far out of reach lies true equality? Because straight couples don\u2019t just hold hands in public. They kiss, they cuddle, they pat each other\u2019s bums, they play footsie under the table and fall about on crowded Sunday trains because they\u2019re so busy getting lost in one another. And there\u2019s at least one straight couple I recently witnessed at an exhibition of historic female artists who spent hours stand-up spooning while discussing 17th-century brushwork in baby talk.</p> <p>Same-sex couples\u2019 thoughts on holding hands is not an accurate measure of homophobia or acceptance, of course. There are plenty of single people with no one holding their hands who bend expectations of gender and face homophobia and transphobia as a result. There are too many straight people who insist that same-sex couples\u2019 fear of reprisals for holding hands are all in our snowflakey minds. (Experience tells me they\u2019re not.)</p> <p>I\u2019m not alone; there\u2019s been a rise in <a href=\"https://www.stonewall.org.uk/about-us/news/new-data-rise-hate-crime-against-lgbtq-people-continues-stonewall-slams-uk-gov-\">hate crime</a> against LGBTQ+ people, particularly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-66984843\">transgender people</a>, in recent years. That\u2019s only for reported crimes, because why would this community gladly report any sort of crime against the person to police forces that have been found to <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2023-03-21/casey-review-met-police-failing-women-with-institutional-sexism-racism-and-homophobia/\">harbour homophobic views</a>?</p> <p>And for all the increase in <em>our</em> visibility, for all our abundance, the profile of our potential assailants remains vague. We don\u2019t know who to be wary of, so we watch out for everyone. Will it be the bored teenage boys loitering near the bus stop, who are trained on manosphere TikToks and pornography\u2019s sick scripts of what lesbians do? Is it the traditionally dressed older man shuffling down the high street who\u2019ll spit at us? Is it the short-sleeved football fans, looking us up and down? Staying alert requires stress and vigilance, a heightened level of cortisol that many of our straight counterparts don\u2019t have to deal with. Women will of course know the terror of aggressive men, with public harassment a real and endemic problem, but when they\u2019re walking hand in hand with a man, at least others tend to back off.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/19/italy-queer-rights-giorgia-meloni-lgbtq-community\">My queer friends in Italy are so worn down by discrimination, they don\u2019t notice it.

However, work must be done to get a clearer idea of who is actually harming LGBTQ+ people, when they act and how productive intervention works. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46543874\">BBC research in 2018</a> found that young people are the most common perpetrators of anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes, but this needs updating and intervention methods need identifying and delivering. The government has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/23/keir-starmer-promises-to-halve-violence-against-women-as-part-of-labour-crime-mission\">committed to halving violence</a> against women and girls in 10 years; I imagine some of its work in retraining the police, deterring male violence and improving victim support will protect more LGBTQ+ people and could be built upon to improve life for the whole group. </p> <p>Of course, the UK is not the worst place to be LGBTQ+. On a recent trip to Morocco for a friend\u2019s wedding, my partner and I had to pretend we were cousins. Most people bought it, until a cab driver in a remote village decided to ask us who we were to one another, then promptly tell us how much his friends hate gay people. We, avoiding eye contact with him and each other, had no idea whether he was very much on our side, or very much not. The stress of it all, on top of having to cover up so much, meant we couldn\u2019t relax. Conversely, on another trip, this time to a women\u2019s festival at Lesbos, we felt sheer delight at just being able to be ourselves.

      "bodyText": "You can\u2019t move for representations of LGBTQ+ people now, apparently. There are many of us in parliament, for instance \u2013 69 out of 650 MPs \u2013 and you only need to stumble into A&amp;E to be surrounded by rainbow lanyards. We can be seen everywhere on TV, film and runways, and we can be heard all across the music industry. It could be assumed that if we regularly manifest the first half of that popular Pride slogan, \u201cwe\u2019re queer, we\u2019re here \u2026\u201d, those outside our delightful social bubbles will do their bit and \u201cget used to it\u201d. However, for all of LGBTQ+ people\u2019s increased visibility, not everyone has got used to us. Recent research from Stonewall showed that only 44% of LGBTQ+ couples in the UK feel safe holding their partner\u2019s hand in public. And sure, when we\u2019re in the middle of decidedly LGBTQ+ friendly places \u2013such as Hackney or Soho or Margate, or on holiday in European cities where we know we won\u2019t actually understand any impending words shouted at us \u2013 we will be affectionate in some ways. But more often than not, we don\u2019t hold hands. We snatch moments of affection when we know \u2013 because we\u2019ve checked \u2013 people aren\u2019t looking. Hand-holding is a common metric for LGBTQ+ people\u2019s perceptions of the tolerance of others. If we can\u2019t hold hands with one another, how far out of reach lies true equality? Because straight couples don\u2019t just hold hands in public. They kiss, they cuddle, they pat each other\u2019s bums, they play footsie under the table and fall about on crowded Sunday trains because they\u2019re so busy getting lost in one another. And there\u2019s at least one straight couple I recently witnessed at an exhibition of historic female artists who spent hours stand-up spooning while discussing 17th-century brushwork in baby talk. Same-sex couples\u2019 thoughts on holding hands is not an accurate measure of homophobia or acceptance, of course. There are plenty of single people with no one holding their hands who bend expectations of gender and face homophobia and transphobia as a result. There are too many straight people who insist that same-sex couples\u2019 fear of reprisals for holding hands are all in our snowflakey minds. (Experience tells me they\u2019re not.) I\u2019m not alone; there\u2019s been a rise in hate crime against LGBTQ+ people, particularly transgender people, in recent years. That\u2019s only for reported crimes, because why would this community gladly report any sort of crime against the person to police forces that have been found to harbour homophobic views? And for all the increase in our visibility, for all our abundance, the profile of our potential assailants remains vague. We don\u2019t know who to be wary of, so we watch out for everyone. Will it be the bored teenage boys loitering near the bus stop, who are trained on manosphere TikToks and pornography\u2019s sick scripts of what lesbians do? Is it the traditionally dressed older man shuffling down the high street who\u2019ll spit at us? Is it the short-sleeved football fans, looking us up and down? Staying alert requires stress and vigilance, a heightened level of cortisol that many of our straight counterparts don\u2019t have to deal with. Women will of course know the terror of aggressive men, with public harassment a real and endemic problem, but when they\u2019re walking hand in hand with a man, at least others tend to back off. I say \u201cboys\u201d and \u201cmen\u201d, because most of the public homophobia that\u2019s been hurled at me as one half of a lesbian couple is from men, who also get to clobber us with misogyny at the same time. However, work must be done to get a clearer idea of who is actually harming LGBTQ+ people, when they act and how productive intervention works. BBC research in 2018 found that young people are the most common perpetrators of anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes, but this needs updating and intervention methods need identifying and delivering. The government has already committed to halving violence against women and girls in 10 years; I imagine some of its work in retraining the police, deterring male violence and improving victim support will protect more LGBTQ+ people and could be built upon to improve life for the whole group. Of course, the UK is not the worst place to be LGBTQ+. On a recent trip to Morocco for a friend\u2019s wedding, my partner and I had to pretend we were cousins. Most people bought it, until a cab driver in a remote village decided to ask us who we were to one another, then promptly tell us how much his friends hate gay people. We, avoiding eye contact with him and each other, had no idea whether he was very much on our side, or very much not. The stress of it all, on top of having to cover up so much, meant we couldn\u2019t relax. Conversely, on another trip, this time to a women\u2019s festival at Lesbos, we felt sheer delight at just being able to be ourselves. We\u2019re not asking to skinny-dip in the Thames, to naked conga along Hadrian\u2019s Wall, to have a full bacchanal in Bath. We just want to feel safe in the knowledge that we, as human beings with the same need for love as the rest of the population, belong.

Fresh from 24 wickets at 20.25 in a 5-1 Test summer, Woakes has 137 at 21.59 on home soil. It is the lowest bowling average for any seamer in England with 100-plus victims, bar Fred Trueman and Alec Bedser. The strike rate \u2013 a wicket every 42.9 balls \u2013 is bettered by no one. Throw in the runs from No 8, the professionalism, plus the small matter of two World Cup winner\u2019s medals, and McCullum, always sunny side up admittedly, wasn\u2019t hyperbolising when hailing a \u201cremarkable cricketer\u201d during the season.</p> <p>But chatting over a flat white in Birmingham last week before flying to Pakistan, Woakes, acknowledged the flip side; those 36 wickets at 51 on the road that have kept the chatterati going over the course of his 11-year Test career. He is not immune to the eyebrows raised at this overseas recall, the jokes about confiscating his passport, nor is he consumed by them either. The backing of his head coach and his captain, Ben Stokes, is plenty.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been around long enough, I know I need to be better [away from home],\u201d he says, meeting the subject head on. \u201cThe slight frustration from my side would be that, yes, I agree, my away record is nowhere near as good as at home. But my home record is bloody good. Exceptional. So it\u2019s pretty hard to get the two exactly the same.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more when people say I\u2019ve never had a good game away from home. I have. It\u2019s just probably the games in between have been poor rather than average.</p>    <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something that gets me down. I know what I\u2019m capable of. The fact I\u2019ve been selected suggests I\u2019m pretty good and from a knowledge perspective I have a wealth of it, more so now than ever in my career.</p> <p>\u201cThe opinion inside this dressing room is the only one that counts, captain and coach. As long as you\u2019re working towards the team trying to win and in the style they want, that\u2019s all that matters. While I\u2019ve got that backing and support from them, I will continue to give it everything for England, home, away, wherever.\u201d</p> <p>It is good to hear Woakes sounding so bullish, even if talk of Mr Nice Guy has always underplayed his inner steel. Pakistan is not necessarily the fast-medium graveyard some assume. Jimmy Anderson and Ollie Robinson got the Kookaburra ball to nip about in late 2022, their contributions central to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/20/pakistan-v-england-third-test-day-four-report\">the 3-0 clean sweep</a>. This time Robinson is on the outer, not trusted to stay on the park after too many false dawns with conditioning, while Anderson has slotted into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/01/jimmy-anderson-mentor-england-bowlers-final-test-appearance-cricket\">the role of bowling coach</a> after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/10/jimmy-anderson-end-test-cricket-career-england-brendon-mccullum\">McCullum tapped him on the shoulder</a> in April.</p> <p>When Woakes, 35, survived this look to the future it was queried by some, even if he is seven years Anderson\u2019s junior and the batting made it a false equivalence. \u201cSometimes that\u2019s taken for granted,\u201d he says. \u201cPart of the reason I have played so much is that role. You have to bat time, build partnerships, change gear.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked on it all my career and get serious job satisfaction from it. Although I look back at the 62 [in the third Test against West Indies] and think I threw it away. No Warwickshire player has scored a Test hundred at Edgbaston. I knew that stat and still kick myself.\u201d</p> <p>After a decade operating in the slipstream of Anderson and Stuart Broad, the upshot, finally, was a first summer with the new ball. That in itself says a bit more about the home and away records, not that Woakes has ever bemoaned coinciding with the pair. \u201cI can\u2019t say the new ball was overdue,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI have so much to thank them for. If they\u2019d not been around I might not have learned so much. I may have got an opportunity sooner but might not have been as good. We\u2019ll never know. I\u2019ve won 200-odd caps across all three formats and I\u2019d have been happy with just one in each. I feel very fortunate, even if it\u2019s taken a lot of hard work.\u201d</p> <p>That hard work often gets underplayed with fast bowlers and, as well as a dash of salt and pepper in the beard, this summer has brought a touch of the old bowler\u2019s gait when Woakes is walking back to his mark; a slight hobble that denotes a career of pushing through the pain barrier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/30/england-head-to-pakistan-unscathed-packed-schedule-cricket\">England head for Pakistan hoping to remain \u2018unscathed\u2019 by packed schedule</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cReally?\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough it doesn\u2019t surprise me. I\u2019ve bowled a lot of overs. I remember Jimmy in his farewell speech to us saying you have to have a sadistic streak. When you wake up in the morning, you hate it \u2026 but you also love it. It\u2019s joints for me, stiffness in back, knees, ankles.</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m really pleased with playing all six this summer. I was sore after the third Test against West Indies, had a week off, then bowled in training to prepare for the Hundred. It wasn\u2019t widely known at the time but I suffered a grade two thigh strain. Not major, but it should have been at least a fortnight out. </p> <p>\u201cI still managed to get fit to play at Old Trafford 10 days later. Jimmy had told me: \u2018I don\u2019t want you to bowl in training until very, very late. You won\u2019t forget how to bowl.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Anderson\u2019s advice to trust the body and the knowhow was the \u201cperfect\u201d example of his impact, says Woakes, after the switch from senior pro to rookie coach could have been awkward given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/08/jimmy-anderson-retire-england-test-cricket-west-indies-lords\">the obvious reluctance to retire</a>. \u201cJimmy would be the first to admit it was weird for him and us before the Trent Bridge Test, guys working out when to speak or approach each other. He\u2019s usually got his emotions going before a match and so to slot in as coach must have been hard.</p> <p>\u201cBut he\u2019s been brilliant at picking his moments, tactics, skills, sending messages out to the middle or having a quiet word in the dressing room. Just the right balance. He just knows what I need at this stage of my career.\u201d</p> <p>Could that knowledge see Woakes go to a similar age? \u201cPast 40? Nah \u2026 hmm \u2026 I guess you never say never. But I have only looked at what\u2019s up next, never too far down the line. I do want to keep playing all formats.\u201d</p>    <p>No Anderson or Broad on the field also meant a fresh new-ball partnership with Gus Atkinson, Surrey\u2019s silent assassin who whistled up 34 wickets and a century in his maiden summer, plus a place on all three honours boards at Lord\u2019s. Woakes, the last cricketer to achieve that rare treble \u2013 one of six \u2013 was jokingly ordered to \u201cwelcome him to the club\u201d when he got back to the dressing room.</p> <p>\u201cStokesy made me do it,\u201d says Woakes, smiling. \u201cEven though we didn\u2019t know each other much Gus and I really hit it off this summer. We have very different skills: I swing it, he goes to wobble the ball early, I bowl mid-crease, he is tight to the stumps. We communicated really well.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a young bowler but quietly confident in his skills. Not shy, just quiet. There is definitely more to come. People might say he\u2019s got tougher challenges ahead, but it wasn\u2019t an easy summer. Test cricket is bloody hard regardless of opposition and he bossed it.\u201d</p> <p>Woakes can be said to have done so, too, and for reasons that go beyond the boundary. During his time at the Indian Premier League his father, Roger, died due to heart failure. Woakes flew back when he was ill in hospital, returned to India as things appeared to be improving, only to then receive the terrible news at the beginning of May when 4,000 miles from home. Little wonder his start to the season with Warwickshire was low-key and that first Test at Lord\u2019s a bit rusty.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the first time either Amie [his wife] or myself had lost someone. It was really tough and it still is,\u201d he says. \u201cMy dad lived a great life. He was 81 and the main reason I got into the game. He loved it.</p> <p>\u201cCricket has been good for me, giving me a purpose. But also perspective with it, that really family is the most important thing.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t quite know how to act. Was I getting back into cricket too soon? It wasn\u2019t just losing Dad, it was a duty of care to Mum, my sister, the rest of my family, and you spread yourself thin. So I\u2019m not surprised I didn\u2019t start great.</p> <p>\u201cIt was all a bit of a blur, I almost can\u2019t remember playing [those county games], but I have to give myself a bit of a pat on the back for how I\u2019ve handled it.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever happens next on this return to the road, that pat on the back is well earned.</p>",

This year, a legal opinion was issued by the CJEU advocate general, Maciej Szpunar, on this topic, an opinion that will guide the court\u2019s thinking. In Szpunar\u2019s assessment, the key questions were as follows: did Fifa, as football\u2019s governing authority, act against Diarra\u2019s rights to freedom of movement when he was denied authorisation to join Charleroi? Does the obligation placed on a buying club to cover costs of a player\u2019s departure from their previous club affect their ability to trade? And do Fifa\u2019s transfer rules achieve such outcomes by their very design? In all three cases, Szpunar argued the answer was yes. If the court decides the same, then there are clear structural challenges to the very nature of the transfer system. It should be noted that Szpunar did observe that the rules as they stand \u201cgenerally seem likely to promote contractual stability\u201d and contribute to \u201cbalance\u201d in sporting competitions \u201cby preserving a degree of equality of opportunity\u201d.</p> <h2>What are the possible outcomes?</h2> <p>One option remains that the court finds in favour of Fifa and everything stays the same. The opposite end of the scale would have the court deciding that a player should be able to walk away from a contract without it affecting their ability to find a new club or imposing any costs on that new club. There are also numerous outcomes in between, most of which would involve a technical or legal fix to the current system. For example \u2013 a burden of proof being required to show that a buying club was party to a player breaching contract without \u201cjust cause\u201d.</p>    <h2>What could be the consequences?</h2> <p>A decision against Fifa\u2019s rules would fundamentally shift the bargaining power in transfer and contract negotiations away from clubs and towards players (and their agents). It would lead to more broken contracts and greater uncertainty over transfer fees. It would probably necessitate the creation of a new body to determine what compensation, if any, a club was owed (and by whom) in the event that a player walked out.</p> <p>The knock-on effects could be huge. For many clubs in Europe, transfer dealing is a vital means of keeping their heads above water. A ruling against Fifa would act against that and, probably, in favour of bigger clubs who could persuade players to quit their contracts in a way that is not possible now. On the other hand, the kind of trading models that underpin multi-club ownership groups would also become more uncertain, with clubs effectively losing control of career paths.</p> <h2>So will this be Bosman part two?</h2> <p>It depends which way you look at it. The Bosman ruling, in 1995, pertained to every player and their ability to freely leave a club at the end of their contract. Not every player might want to take up the option of breaking their contract, meanwhile, but a ruling against Fifa would mean a player could quit their club at any point in their contract. It\u2019s also not a guarantee the court will agree with the advocate general\u2019s argument or hold to it fully. On top of that, as is often the case, this ruling will not be the final verdict, with the case returning to Belgian courts.</p>",

While bodies representing small businesses have expressed concerns about higher costs, several large employers, including the bakery chain Greggs, have said they are relaxed about the legislation as they already offer many of the benefits it enshrines.</p>    <p>Tesco said it was likely to make \u00a32.9bn in profit this year, \u00a3100m more than previously expected, as shoppers bought more items than it predicted in the first half of the year.

Sales of clothing are also up and Tesco plans to put its F&amp;F own-label range back online for the first time in six years.</p> <p>The supermarket is continuing to cut costs with plans to take out \u00a3240m in the second half by improving productivity using technology, such as AI that is helping tailor ranges to suit local areas.

The bill, which is due to go before parliament next month, is expected to include measures such as ending \u201cexploitative\u201d zero-hours contracts, a better deal for new parents, day-one protection against unfair dismissal, and statutory sick pay from the first day of illness. A poll by the TUC union found widespread support among business leaders for the changes. While bodies representing small businesses have expressed concerns about higher costs, several large employers, including the bakery chain Greggs, have said they are relaxed about the legislation as they already offer many of the benefits it enshrines. Tesco said it was likely to make \u00a32.9bn in profit this year, \u00a3100m more than previously expected, as shoppers bought more items than it predicted in the first half of the year. Profits rose 20% to \u00a31.4bn as sales rose by 4% to \u00a331.5bn in the six months to 24 August. Murphy said Tesco\u2019s sales had been bolstered by the Euro 2024 football championship and by putting a further 2,000 staff on the shop floor during the first half of the year while it made \u00a3260m in cost savings, partly by using technology to be more efficient. The group also said it had gained market share from rivals by cutting prices on thousands of items and adding 100 more lines to its price-matching scheme against the discounter Aldi in the past year to take it to almost 800. Murphy said Tesco was \u201cpreparing for a good Christmas\u201d \u2013 the most important part of the trading year for retailers \u2013 and would have more goods for sale than last year as it was seeing a \u201crelatively positive picture\u201d in customer sentiment. He said a slowdown in sales growth in the second quarter was caused by lower-than-expected inflation in the market. \u201cWe see customer sentiment improving ahead of Christmas, and we expect more customers to go for a special and fun-filled Christmas,\u201d he said. He said shoppers were showing \u201ca willingness to spend a little bit more to treat themselves\u201d \u2013 spending 15% more on Tesco\u2019s Finest premium own-label range while continuing to keep a lid on budgets by swapping dining out for premium ready meals. However, he added that the supermarket was acutely aware of the continued challenges customers were facing, given continuing cost-of-living pressures on households. Tesco\u2019s Whoosh fast-track grocery delivery service also increased sales by a fifth as startup rivals, including Getir, dropped out of the market. Sales of clothing are also up and Tesco plans to put its F&amp;F own-label range back online for the first time in six years. The supermarket is continuing to cut costs with plans to take out \u00a3240m in the second half by improving productivity using technology, such as AI that is helping tailor ranges to suit local areas. The company said the technology was enabling it to take on fewer staff to support growth rather than leading to job cuts.",

From staff who were grabbed by the crotch, raped or made to have their ovaries checked by the in-house doctor, it\u2019s horrific listening \u2013 and a testimony to the bravery of those speaking out. AD From Now On Widely available, episodes weekly Host Lisa Phillips is an ex-model who, at 21, was abused by Jeffrey Epstein on his private island. Here, she tells her story and uses it to help other survivors of abuse. Part confessional, part interviews with guests \u2013 including former cult members \u2013 it veers from courageous soulbearing to deeply insightful psychological help book. AD Proper Tasty Pub Quiz Widely available, episodes weekly Each week, award-winning chef Tom Kerridge and broadcaster pal Chris Stark invite you to take part in a pub quiz at Kerridge\u2019s gastro-watering hole, The Butcher\u2019s Tap and Grill in Chelsea. They\u2019ll have a celebrity guest answering questions and having a foodie chat, too, starting these first couple of episodes with Jamie Redknapp and Pixie Lott. Hollie Richardson There\u2019s a podcast for that This week, Charlie Lindlar chooses five of the best Guardian audio long reads, from Archie Bland\u2019s essay on the rise and fall of \u201cbanter\u201d to Michael Aylwin\u2019s devastating retelling of his wife\u2019s struggle with Alzheimer\u2019s The age of banter This rendition of a 2017 long read by Archie Bland transports us back to the heyday of LadBible and Dapper Laughs. There, we examine an era of brash, cruelty-as-the-point comedy and ask: what on earth was that about? Archie meets a group of \u201cparty pilgrims\u201d who took an overnight boat from Ayia Napa to Syria, takes a walk through the history of the lad mag, and interrogates the peak of this bizarre culture: Richard Keys and Andy Gray\u2019s departure from Sky over sexist comments that were, in the immortal words of \u201cKeysy\u201d, \u201cjust banter\u201d. \u201cIs it time to get off the banter bus?\u201d the piece asks. Yes, obviously \u2013 but this fine piece is worth one last ride. For more from Archie, sign up to our First Edition newsletter here How Alzheimer\u2019s undid my dazzling, creative wife in her 40s In August this year, Guardian journalist Michael Aylwin penned a stunning read on his wife Vanessa and her struggle with Alzheimer\u2019s. Aylwin reckons with the early signs of Vanessa\u2019s dementia, her strength as the disease ate at her, and recalls how their relationship transformed as it took hold. It is a tough but necessary read that lays bare the truth of illness, the strain it places on a marriage, and the damage done by not talking frankly about its effects. Michael\u2019s description of his \u201cdazzling and creative\u201d wife and her \u201cbrutal and unanswerable\u201d deterioration is only more moving heard in his own words. My four miscarriages: why is losing a pregnancy so shrouded in mystery? This 2020 long read explores perhaps the most private of burdens: fertility. After experiencing four consecutive miscarriages, journalist Jennie Agg resolved to investigate the language we use to describe losing a pregnancy, the state of miscarriage care, and whether anything could have been done to change what happened to her. Agg writes with elegance \u2013 \u201cto be pregnant again after previous miscarriages is to live at the fork of two alternative lives\u201d \u2013 and Emma Powell matches her with a gripping reading of her profound words. For even more, Agg went even deeper on the urgent need for better miscarriage care in this 2021 episode of Today in Focus. How the sandwich consumed Britain It may be hard to believe, but there was a time before Pret a Manger, Greggs and the Tesco meal deal. Lunch used to look so different \u2013 so how did we end up with the sandwich monoculture? Tracing the packaged sandwich back to its 1980s roots, writer Sam Knight ponders how Marks &amp; Spencer egg and cress triangles grew into an \u00a38bn industry where \u201csandwich people\u201d preempt, and often dictate, what you have for lunch. Knight reads his story in this episode with the same wonder and whimsy as he wrote the source material. Cotton Capital: the backlash \u2013 how slavery research came under fire As part of the Guardian\u2019s 2023 series investigating the newspaper\u2019s founders and their historic links to slavery, Samira Shackle dug into a series of similar studies taking place at universities and other public institutions \u2013 and the grim backlash that followed. Shackle meets bold historian Nicolas Bell-Romero, and follows him on his quest to understand Cambridge\u2019s problematic past \u2013 not just how it gained from slavery but how, in Shackle\u2019s words, \u201cits scholarship might have reinforced, validated or challenged race-based thinking\u201d. A vital piece of reporting, made more compelling in audio form. To catch up on the rest of the Cotton Capital project, visit the project homepage or sign up to our 15-week newsletter series.

      "body": "<p>She is one of the biggest opponents of fossil fuel on the world stage \u2013 but Susana Muhamad\u2019s political career was sparked in the halls of an oil company. It began when she resigned as a sustainability consultant with Shell in 2009 and returned home to Colombia. She was 32 and disillusioned, a far cry from the heights she would later reach as the country\u2019s environment minister, and one of the most high-profile progressive leaders in global environmental politics.</p> <p>Muhamad joined Shell an idealistic 26-year-old. \u201cI really thought that you could make a huge impact within an energy company on the climate issue, especially because all their publicity was saying that they were going to become an energy company, meaning they will not be only a fossil fuel company,\u201d she says, when we meet in the Colombian embassy in London.</p> <p>\u201cI resigned the date that they decided to put their innovation money on fracking.\u201d</p>    <p>Now 47, Muhamad, whose surname comes from her Palestinian grandfather, is preparing to oversee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-16\">biodiversity Cop16</a>, a summit on the future of life on Earth that will bring together leaders from nearly 200 countries in Cali, Colombia, next month. For many, she is a rising star of the environmental movement, joining voices such as the Barbadian prime minister, Mia Mottley, in putting forward an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/14/world-fairer-economy-trade-inflation-debt-climate-crisis\">alternative vision</a> of how the world could be, and demanding the developed world finance a just transition.</p> <p>\u201cSusana is the Frida Kahlo of environmental geopolitics,\u201d says activist Oscar Soria. \u201cLike Kahlo, whose art challenged cultural norms and spoke of resilience, Muhamad paints a vision of ecological justice that goes beyond traditional environmentalism \u2026 an environmental agenda that is \u2026 reshaping the narrative around climate justice and biodiversity restitution.\u201d</p>    <p>Colombia\u2019s embassy is sandwiched between Harrods and its Ecuadorian counterpart, and the room we meet in has a front row seat to the UK capital\u2019s wealthiest extremes. Outside, a Rolls-Royce SUV and a blacked-out BMW wait with their drivers next to the high-end department store. Convertible supercars pass shoppers swinging luxury purchases from their hands. Muhamad, representing Colombia\u2019s first ever leftist government, is entertaining NGOs, journalists and senior British politicians \u2013 and pushing a vision of \u201cjust transition\u201d that would resolve economic imbalances alongside the environmental.</p> <p>The minister has had to be careful to avoid rhetoric on global inequality that might allow her political opponents to tie her administration to more radical leftwing politicians from her region, but she is not naive to the potential pitfalls on the path to net zero. \u201cWe have to be clear that this energy transition cannot be at the cost of Indigenous peoples, local communities and biodiversity,\u201d she <a href=\"https://x.com/susanamuhamad/status/1735049874540744800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1735049874540744800%7Ctwgr%5Ec0e274aa9c8c0603b25025d40ea0c902c7a15c7e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.climatechangenews.com%2F2023%2F12%2F13%2Fdubai-deal-ministers-and-observers-react-to-the-uae-consensus%2F\">told the plenary hall</a> at the conclusion of Cop28 in Dubai last December after a deal to transition away from fossil fuels was passed. \u201cIn this balance between opportunity and risk lies responsibility. I want to call on everyone to keep being mobilised because intergenerational justice with this text is still at stake,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/29/nature-biodiversity-genetic-digital-sequencing-information-dsi-biopiracy-cop16-aoe\">Who wins from nature\u2019s genetic bounty?

President Gustavo Petro\u2019s administration is pushing to ban fracking as it tries to phase out coal, oil and gas, pledging to make<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/09/middle-class-fear-green-policies-fuels-rise-of-far-right-colombias-petro-warns-aoe\"> biodiversity the basis of its wealth</a> in the post-fossil fuels era. Last month, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-26/colombia-working-on-40-billion-jetp-like-climate-investment-plan?srnd=undefined&amp;sref=T4zDKGrK\">she launched</a> a $40bn investment plan aimed at making this vision a reality. Muhamad was one of the ministers leading efforts to include \u201cphase out\u201d in the final Cop28 text in Dubai \u2013 an attempt that was ultimately unsuccessful. Colombia and Brazil, under Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, have been leading efforts to end deforestation in the Amazon.</p>    <p>The night before the embassy meeting, Muhamad addressed an event for the nature summit at the Natural History Museum. Standing under a blue whale skeleton and with a statue of Charles Darwin at her back, Muhamad underscored the urgency of the task, inviting the world to the \u201cpeople\u2019s Cop\u201d. \u201cAs we decarbonise, we have to protect and recover nature because otherwise the climate will not stabilise,\u201d she told the crowd.</p> <p>Muhamad has been quick to point out that decarbonisation efforts alone will be futile without the conservation of the natural world and the huge carbon sink it provides, which absorbs <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2024/09/27/wwf_our_climates_secret_ally_uncovering_the_story_of_nature_in_the_ipcc_ar6.pdf\">half of all human emissions </a>each year. \u201cThere is a double movement humanity must make. The first one is to decarbonise and have a just energy transition,\u201d she said in August while announcing her vision for the conference. \u201cThe other side of the coin is to restore nature and allow nature to take again its power over planet Earth so that we can really stabilise the climate.\u201d</p> <p>The scientific backdrop to October\u2019s conference is bleak. Figures from WWF show that wildlife populations <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/69-average-decline-in-wildlife-populations-since-1970-says-new-wwf-report\">have plunged</a> due to a mixture of habitat loss, pollution, overconsumption, the spread of invasive species and global heating. Last year was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/12/2023-hottest-year-record-us-scientists\">hottest ever recorded</a>. The droughts and extreme heat have brought catastrophic consequences for Earth\u2019s forests, grasslands and oceans: ecosystems that underpin human health, food security and civilisation. Despite the warnings, the UN\u2019s biodiversity convention has long been overshadowed by its climate counterpart, and governments have never met a single target they have set for themselves on biodiversity.</p>    <p>The summit also has important domestic significance.

      "bodyText": "She is one of the biggest opponents of fossil fuel on the world stage \u2013 but Susana Muhamad\u2019s political career was sparked in the halls of an oil company. It began when she resigned as a sustainability consultant with Shell in 2009 and returned home to Colombia. She was 32 and disillusioned, a far cry from the heights she would later reach as the country\u2019s environment minister, and one of the most high-profile progressive leaders in global environmental politics. Muhamad joined Shell an idealistic 26-year-old. \u201cI really thought that you could make a huge impact within an energy company on the climate issue, especially because all their publicity was saying that they were going to become an energy company, meaning they will not be only a fossil fuel company,\u201d she says, when we meet in the Colombian embassy in London. \u201cI resigned the date that they decided to put their innovation money on fracking.\u201d Now 47, Muhamad, whose surname comes from her Palestinian grandfather, is preparing to oversee biodiversity Cop16, a summit on the future of life on Earth that will bring together leaders from nearly 200 countries in Cali, Colombia, next month. For many, she is a rising star of the environmental movement, joining voices such as the Barbadian prime minister, Mia Mottley, in putting forward an alternative vision of how the world could be, and demanding the developed world finance a just transition. \u201cSusana is the Frida Kahlo of environmental geopolitics,\u201d says activist Oscar Soria. \u201cLike Kahlo, whose art challenged cultural norms and spoke of resilience, Muhamad paints a vision of ecological justice that goes beyond traditional environmentalism \u2026 an environmental agenda that is \u2026 reshaping the narrative around climate justice and biodiversity restitution.\u201d Colombia\u2019s embassy is sandwiched between Harrods and its Ecuadorian counterpart, and the room we meet in has a front row seat to the UK capital\u2019s wealthiest extremes. Outside, a Rolls-Royce SUV and a blacked-out BMW wait with their drivers next to the high-end department store. Convertible supercars pass shoppers swinging luxury purchases from their hands. Muhamad, representing Colombia\u2019s first ever leftist government, is entertaining NGOs, journalists and senior British politicians \u2013 and pushing a vision of \u201cjust transition\u201d that would resolve economic imbalances alongside the environmental. The minister has had to be careful to avoid rhetoric on global inequality that might allow her political opponents to tie her administration to more radical leftwing politicians from her region, but she is not naive to the potential pitfalls on the path to net zero. \u201cWe have to be clear that this energy transition cannot be at the cost of Indigenous peoples, local communities and biodiversity,\u201d she told the plenary hall at the conclusion of Cop28 in Dubai last December after a deal to transition away from fossil fuels was passed. \u201cIn this balance between opportunity and risk lies responsibility. I want to call on everyone to keep being mobilised because intergenerational justice with this text is still at stake,\u201d she said. Colombia became the first significant fossil fuel producer to join an alliance of nations calling for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty at the December meeting. President Gustavo Petro\u2019s administration is pushing to ban fracking as it tries to phase out coal, oil and gas, pledging to make biodiversity the basis of its wealth in the post-fossil fuels era. Last month, she launched a $40bn investment plan aimed at making this vision a reality. Muhamad was one of the ministers leading efforts to include \u201cphase out\u201d in the final Cop28 text in Dubai \u2013 an attempt that was ultimately unsuccessful. Colombia and Brazil, under Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, have been leading efforts to end deforestation in the Amazon. The night before the embassy meeting, Muhamad addressed an event for the nature summit at the Natural History Museum. Standing under a blue whale skeleton and with a statue of Charles Darwin at her back, Muhamad underscored the urgency of the task, inviting the world to the \u201cpeople\u2019s Cop\u201d. \u201cAs we decarbonise, we have to protect and recover nature because otherwise the climate will not stabilise,\u201d she told the crowd. Muhamad has been quick to point out that decarbonisation efforts alone will be futile without the conservation of the natural world and the huge carbon sink it provides, which absorbs half of all human emissions each year. \u201cThere is a double movement humanity must make. The first one is to decarbonise and have a just energy transition,\u201d she said in August while announcing her vision for the conference. \u201cThe other side of the coin is to restore nature and allow nature to take again its power over planet Earth so that we can really stabilise the climate.\u201d The scientific backdrop to October\u2019s conference is bleak. Figures from WWF show that wildlife populations have plunged due to a mixture of habitat loss, pollution, overconsumption, the spread of invasive species and global heating. Last year was the hottest ever recorded. The droughts and extreme heat have brought catastrophic consequences for Earth\u2019s forests, grasslands and oceans: ecosystems that underpin human health, food security and civilisation. Despite the warnings, the UN\u2019s biodiversity convention has long been overshadowed by its climate counterpart, and governments have never met a single target they have set for themselves on biodiversity. The summit also has important domestic significance. Since Petro, a former Marxist guerrilla, announced at the climate change Cop28 in Dubai last year that Colombia would host the biodiversity conference, he and Muhamad have put Cop16 at the heart of the domestic agenda, hoping to use it as a chance to bring lasting peace with hold-out rebel groups in forest areas. In July, Central General Staff (EMC), a guerrilla faction that rejected the country\u2019s 2016 peace agreement, threatened the summit after a series of bombings and shootings that were blamed on the group, but it has since backed down on the threat. Even so, 12,000 soldiers and police offers will be in Cali to guard the conference. \u201cIt was a very strange situation, and we are also hoping to use Cop as a way to promote peace within the country,\u201d Muhamad says. At home, her ministerial brief ranges from eliminating deforestation across the country, which has fallen to its lowest level in 23 years, to managing Pablo Escobar\u2019s hippos, which have thrived east of Medell\u00edn since the drug lord\u2019s death in 1993. Muhamad bursts into laughter when I ask about the hippos and what it is like managing them, before settling into a ministerial answer. She says the African mammals are being phased out with a mixture of euthanasia, sterilisation and hippo transportation: \u201cFor us, it\u2019s very straightforward, they are an invasive species that have been declared [as such] officially, not even by this government, by the last government. I agree with that assessment. We have already adopted in April this year the plan to manage the hippo problem,\u201d she says. Muhamad has lived in an eco-village in South Africa with miners, worked in human rights in Denmark and lived with campesinos in Colombia when she was a student before her first \u201cformal\u201d job with Shell. Now, she is preparing to be a Cop president for the first time, a role that requires her to focus on consensus and make good on her decision to leave Shell. When contact by the Guardian, the company said it is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 and they are investing $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions last year, which was 23% of our capital spending.

      "body": "<p>As a young female TV crew member working in an industry where 50% of freelancers are currently unemployed, Amelie* was desperate for a job and money to pay her bills. So when she was offered work on a TV film for a major UK broadcaster miles from where she lived, she took it \u2013 despite the fact no accommodation was provided. The set location was in Essex, two and a half to three hours\u2019 drive away from home. Her commute entailed driving around the M25 to and from each day\u2019s shooting, which could take six hours a day during rush hour, and doing the journey even when filming finished at 5.30am. So it was no surprise to those who knew her that, after a couple of weeks, she fell asleep at the wheel of her car and crashed.</p> <p>It also came as no shock to many who work within the multibillion-pound UK television industry. Car accidents caused by tired, overstretched crew nodding off happen frequently and are often unreported, as workers fear raising the issue could cost them their jobs. Exhaustion is also leading to burnout and accidents on set, with one source alleging a Netflix production recorded almost 50 incidents.</p> <p>In May, this worrying situation was highlighted by the <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/05/9-1-1-crew-member-killed-car-accident-1235914615/\">death in the US of Rico Priem</a> \u2013 a crew member on emergency services drama 9-1-1, who died driving home after suffering a heart attack following two consecutive 14-hour overnight shifts. There are now concerns that it is only a matter of time before a similar tragedy occurs in Britain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I fell asleep driving around London \u2013 I drove into the back of another vehicle. Your body is saying \u2018no\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite its glamorous image, the television industry is renowned for its long working hours, and experienced workers say the situation has worsened due to an advertising downturn, fewer TV shows being commissioned, budget cuts and inflation. The industry is also going through a period of structural change, with the streamers trying to become more profitable and the traditional British broadcasters commissioning fewer of the smaller shows that used to fill TV channels during the daytime, as viewing habits move to online rivals. With the business model in flux, the UK independent TV production sector <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/sep/11/uk-tv-production-sector-income-falls-by-400m-as-programming-budgets-cut\">suffered a \u00a3400m fall in revenues</a> to \u00a33.61bn last year.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/aug/08/traditional-tv-is-dying-can-networks-pivot-and-survive\"> Broadcasters are cutting spending</a> and some production companies are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/sep/14/uk-tv-production-companies-indies-commissioning-spend\">struggling to survive or closing.</a></p> <p>Many working in the industry are fearful of reprisals, but some have spoken to the Guardian anonymously as they are worried about crew members\u2019 wellbeing \u2013 particularly following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/aug/14/the-life-and-tragic-death-of-john-balson-how-a-true-producer-documented-his-own-rising-horror\">tragic death of crime producer John Balson</a>, who died by suicide this year after developing an illness he thought was either caused or exacerbated by overwork.</p> <p>Insiders revealed that \u201cunrealistic budgets\u201d combined with \u201chuge expectations\u201d on how a show will look, plus last-minute creative decisions being made by \u201cdetached\u201d executives in offices miles away (which those on the ground have to turn into reality), are creating an exhausted workforce, with some choosing to leave the industry as it has damaged their health.</p> <p>One experienced crew member says that safety has been \u201can ongoing issue \u2026 for a while\u201d, adding: \u201cI fell asleep driving around London \u2013 I drove into the back of another vehicle. I know lots of people who\u2019ve done the same thing. No amount of coffee is going to help. Your body is saying \u2018no\u2019 \u2026 [but] you don\u2019t know until you\u2019ve fallen asleep.</p> <p>\u201cI know people who have woken up just before they\u2019ve hit the central reservation. Everybody knows of someone who\u2019s crashed. The danger element is real.\u201d</p>    <p>Fortunately, Amelie survived her accident. A friend of hers says: \u201cI was so upset for her but she just took it in her stride and said, \u2018What can I do?\u2019 She has an insurance claim so will lose her no-claims bonus and the premium will go up.\u201d</p> <p>The friend added that the production company that employed Amelie had provided health and safety courses on set for staff, \u201cbut they need to put more in there about the travelling\u201d to and from filming and not just \u201ctick that box\u201d of people completing courses. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to try to do something because it\u2019s shocking. Rico Priem died. Is the industry going to [wait until] somebody else dies to do something?\u201d</p> <p>The national secretary of UK broadcast workers\u2019 union Bectu, Spencer MacDonald, says the industry needs to \u201cwake up to the situation\u201d and face the fact that \u201call the time there are accidents happening\u201d after long shoots. However, he says, \u201cmost of the time they go unreported\u201d because they happen off set, and \u201cbecause people are freelance, so they\u2019re concerned about their reputation\u201d. Many workers don\u2019t want to be seen to be saying that the accidents happened as \u201ca result of the hours they have been working\u201d.</p> <p>The freelance nature of the industry also exacerbates the issue in that many TV shows are made not by broadcasters themselves but by separate, independent production companies. Rules and collective agreements with unions are in place as to how TV shows are made and how much time crews should have off between shifts. But the theory is not always put into practice: many series are shot on multiple locations and crews are not always put up in hotels by the production, meaning some may have long drives home after filming.</p> <p>As one head of department (HoD) explains, there is a \u201cstructural issue\u201d around hotel accommodation for junior crew members. \u201cWhen the production office is London-based, no one would normally get overnight accommodation if they\u2019re travelling from somewhere like the Midlands or Yorkshire, because they [the production office] expect everyone to live in London.\u201d While senior workers who live far from the English capital can afford to pay for their own hotel in London, many less-established staff members cannot, so they commute.</p> <p>The HoD goes on: \u201cIf you\u2019re important to them on the production, they\u2019ll bend over backwards and give you what you want. If you\u2019re a runner or a second or third assistant director, or lower, they sometimes see you as one of the minions and you don\u2019t matter. That\u2019s appalling, because for me everybody is as important as the next person.\u201d</p> <p>Power imbalances are also a factor. If the production\u2019s first assistant director [essentially the director\u2019s right-hand person] pushes to get all their team accommodation \u201cand ends up costing the producer money that they didn\u2019t budget for, they might not use them again on their next production,\u201d the HoD notes.</p>    <p>Car crashes on the way home from filming are a grey area: though the driver\u2019s tiredness may have been caused by their shift pattern, such incidents happen outside working hours so do not have to be reported to producers. However, the exhaustion some crew are experiencing can also lead to accidents on set, which are recorded. One insider said they worked on a series for Netflix which involved shooting in mountainous areas and switching between night and day work. Approximately 48 accident reports were filed. The source explains: \u201cPeople can\u2019t switch from night work to day work just like that. We know a lot about the effect of lack of sleep. People are just getting stretched so far these days.\u201d They say the production was not \u201cdoing anything that wasn\u2019t by the book\u201d but that producers should look at working practices.</p> <p>Netflix points out that it has a production health and safety team for each show, plus a confidential hotline, and it has worked with safety experts to establish its Netflix Lifesavers protocol to <a href=\"https://www.safersets.com/\">ensure safer sets.</a> A spokesperson says: \u201cWe have a tool pack for people on set, 24-hour hotlines and take health and safety very seriously.\u201d</p> <p>However, the insider says: \u201cSomeone would have had a budget in mind but it often does not work in reality. What we see more and more of is unrealistic budgets and executives who are detached from [what\u2019s happening] on the ground and making decisions last minute. There is turmoil, pressure and huge expectations.\u201d</p> <p>They add: \u201cIt was always tough, but it\u2019s progressively got worse. It really does come from the top \u2026 then pressure is put on us to make up for the fact [that decisions] are not properly thought out and planned. We\u2019re expected to make it work.\u201d</p> <p>MacDonald of Bectu says that with more shows being made for US streamers and studios, the culture has evolved as they have a \u201cdifferent mindset\u201d. \u201cOver there, they have shorter turnaround times \u2013 the time between when they finish and then they start again \u2026 The culture in America is kind of \u2018capture as much as they can within the time that they\u2019ve got\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Looking after crew members\u2019 wellbeing benefits the industry long-term as it is more expensive to retrain than retain staff, MacDonald explains. He believes change is possible, pointing to the success of shorter working days in Nordic countries. Bectu has also negotiated better hours for set construction staff (eg carpenters) which resulted in higher productivity and less churn, \u201cbecause they\u2019re not burnt out and they don\u2019t get so many mental health issues\u201d.</p> <p>According to the Film and TV Charity\u2019s <a href=\"https://filmtvcharity.org.uk/assets/documents/Reports/Looking-Glass-Report-2022.pdf\">2022 survey</a>, only 11% of respondents thought \u201cthe industry is a mentally healthy place to work\u201d and 83% said that \u201cindustry culture has a negative effect on their wellbeing\u201d. One professional I speak with (who has a stress-related illness) says the industry often takes advantage of the fact that many people see their career as a vocation, so go the extra mile at the expense of their wellbeing. They also say autoimmune diseases are on the rise. Cambridge University and autoimmune charity <a href=\"https://www.wrenproject.org/\">the Wren Project</a> recently co-authored research into the issue and Wren\u2019s founder, Kate Middleton, confirmed there is a \u201cstrong correlation between stress and autoimmune disease and the interaction of physical and mental health\u201d.</p>    <p>The Mark Milsome Foundation \u2013 created following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/23/mark-milsome-risk-to-life-was-not-effectively-recognised-says-coroner\">the death of a cameraman</a> while filming a night-time car stunt for BBC/Netflix drama Black Earth Rising \u2013 runs courses about <a href=\"https://www.markmilsomefoundation.com/healthandsafety/\">set health and safety</a> and is lobbying for education about the issue to be mandatory. Its chair, Samantha Wainstein, tells the Guardian that the current difficult employment climate makes people even more nervous to speak out. \u201cThat\u2019s potentially why we\u2019re seeing a number of incidents in the last few months.\u201d Sometimes people are \u201casked to opt out [of agreements] \u2026 and say that you will work the hours as required\u201d.</p> <p>Wainstein says the foundation wants the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act to be reviewed as it is out of date with the way people work in the freelance and gig economy. \u201cPeople need to feel that they can speak up. A number of studios and productions are trying hard to make a difference. That\u2019s fantastic \u2013 but a bigger cultural shift is needed.\u201d</p> <p>One solution suggested by many is each show having an anonymous exit survey. As one source says: \u201cEveryone\u2019s frightened of losing their job so they don\u2019t want to put their names to the complaints.</p> <p>\u201cProductions do mostly try to do the right thing in terms of checklists etc but those things are not always implemented.\u201d</p> <p>John McVay, CEO of the producers\u2019 alliance Pact, says his members care about crew and want to hear about issues. \u201cAnyone being harmed, or [in an accident] is absolutely terrible.\u201d He says HoDs should raise issues \u201cif they\u2019re concerned about something and give the production an opportunity to do something about it\u201d.</p> <p>A new watchdog, the Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority, is being set up to provide a safer environment for workers in TV, film, music and theatre, but is not due to launch until next year.

      "bodyText": "As a young female TV crew member working in an industry where 50% of freelancers are currently unemployed, Amelie* was desperate for a job and money to pay her bills. So when she was offered work on a TV film for a major UK broadcaster miles from where she lived, she took it \u2013 despite the fact no accommodation was provided. The set location was in Essex, two and a half to three hours\u2019 drive away from home. Her commute entailed driving around the M25 to and from each day\u2019s shooting, which could take six hours a day during rush hour, and doing the journey even when filming finished at 5.30am. So it was no surprise to those who knew her that, after a couple of weeks, she fell asleep at the wheel of her car and crashed. It also came as no shock to many who work within the multibillion-pound UK television industry. Car accidents caused by tired, overstretched crew nodding off happen frequently and are often unreported, as workers fear raising the issue could cost them their jobs. Exhaustion is also leading to burnout and accidents on set, with one source alleging a Netflix production recorded almost 50 incidents. In May, this worrying situation was highlighted by the death in the US of Rico Priem \u2013 a crew member on emergency services drama 9-1-1, who died driving home after suffering a heart attack following two consecutive 14-hour overnight shifts. There are now concerns that it is only a matter of time before a similar tragedy occurs in Britain. Despite its glamorous image, the television industry is renowned for its long working hours, and experienced workers say the situation has worsened due to an advertising downturn, fewer TV shows being commissioned, budget cuts and inflation. The industry is also going through a period of structural change, with the streamers trying to become more profitable and the traditional British broadcasters commissioning fewer of the smaller shows that used to fill TV channels during the daytime, as viewing habits move to online rivals. With the business model in flux, the UK independent TV production sector suffered a \u00a3400m fall in revenues to \u00a33.61bn last year. Broadcasters are cutting spending and some production companies are struggling to survive or closing. Many working in the industry are fearful of reprisals, but some have spoken to the Guardian anonymously as they are worried about crew members\u2019 wellbeing \u2013 particularly following the tragic death of crime producer John Balson, who died by suicide this year after developing an illness he thought was either caused or exacerbated by overwork. Insiders revealed that \u201cunrealistic budgets\u201d combined with \u201chuge expectations\u201d on how a show will look, plus last-minute creative decisions being made by \u201cdetached\u201d executives in offices miles away (which those on the ground have to turn into reality), are creating an exhausted workforce, with some choosing to leave the industry as it has damaged their health. One experienced crew member says that safety has been \u201can ongoing issue \u2026 for a while\u201d, adding: \u201cI fell asleep driving around London \u2013 I drove into the back of another vehicle. I know lots of people who\u2019ve done the same thing. No amount of coffee is going to help. Your body is saying \u2018no\u2019 \u2026 [but] you don\u2019t know until you\u2019ve fallen asleep. \u201cI know people who have woken up just before they\u2019ve hit the central reservation. Everybody knows of someone who\u2019s crashed. The danger element is real.\u201d Fortunately, Amelie survived her accident. A friend of hers says: \u201cI was so upset for her but she just took it in her stride and said, \u2018What can I do?\u2019 She has an insurance claim so will lose her no-claims bonus and the premium will go up.\u201d The friend added that the production company that employed Amelie had provided health and safety courses on set for staff, \u201cbut they need to put more in there about the travelling\u201d to and from filming and not just \u201ctick that box\u201d of people completing courses. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to try to do something because it\u2019s shocking. Rico Priem died. Is the industry going to [wait until] somebody else dies to do something?\u201d The national secretary of UK broadcast workers\u2019 union Bectu, Spencer MacDonald, says the industry needs to \u201cwake up to the situation\u201d and face the fact that \u201call the time there are accidents happening\u201d after long shoots. However, he says, \u201cmost of the time they go unreported\u201d because they happen off set, and \u201cbecause people are freelance, so they\u2019re concerned about their reputation\u201d. Many workers don\u2019t want to be seen to be saying that the accidents happened as \u201ca result of the hours they have been working\u201d. The freelance nature of the industry also exacerbates the issue in that many TV shows are made not by broadcasters themselves but by separate, independent production companies. Rules and collective agreements with unions are in place as to how TV shows are made and how much time crews should have off between shifts. But the theory is not always put into practice: many series are shot on multiple locations and crews are not always put up in hotels by the production, meaning some may have long drives home after filming. As one head of department (HoD) explains, there is a \u201cstructural issue\u201d around hotel accommodation for junior crew members. \u201cWhen the production office is London-based, no one would normally get overnight accommodation if they\u2019re travelling from somewhere like the Midlands or Yorkshire, because they [the production office] expect everyone to live in London.\u201d While senior workers who live far from the English capital can afford to pay for their own hotel in London, many less-established staff members cannot, so they commute. The HoD goes on: \u201cIf you\u2019re important to them on the production, they\u2019ll bend over backwards and give you what you want. If you\u2019re a runner or a second or third assistant director, or lower, they sometimes see you as one of the minions and you don\u2019t matter. That\u2019s appalling, because for me everybody is as important as the next person.\u201d Power imbalances are also a factor. If the production\u2019s first assistant director [essentially the director\u2019s right-hand person] pushes to get all their team accommodation \u201cand ends up costing the producer money that they didn\u2019t budget for, they might not use them again on their next production,\u201d the HoD notes. Car crashes on the way home from filming are a grey area: though the driver\u2019s tiredness may have been caused by their shift pattern, such incidents happen outside working hours so do not have to be reported to producers. However, the exhaustion some crew are experiencing can also lead to accidents on set, which are recorded. One insider said they worked on a series for Netflix which involved shooting in mountainous areas and switching between night and day work. Approximately 48 accident reports were filed. The source explains: \u201cPeople can\u2019t switch from night work to day work just like that. We know a lot about the effect of lack of sleep. People are just getting stretched so far these days.\u201d They say the production was not \u201cdoing anything that wasn\u2019t by the book\u201d but that producers should look at working practices. Netflix points out that it has a production health and safety team for each show, plus a confidential hotline, and it has worked with safety experts to establish its Netflix Lifesavers protocol to ensure safer sets. A spokesperson says: \u201cWe have a tool pack for people on set, 24-hour hotlines and take health and safety very seriously.\u201d However, the insider says: \u201cSomeone would have had a budget in mind but it often does not work in reality. What we see more and more of is unrealistic budgets and executives who are detached from [what\u2019s happening] on the ground and making decisions last minute. There is turmoil, pressure and huge expectations.\u201d They add: \u201cIt was always tough, but it\u2019s progressively got worse. It really does come from the top \u2026 then pressure is put on us to make up for the fact [that decisions] are not properly thought out and planned. We\u2019re expected to make it work.\u201d MacDonald of Bectu says that with more shows being made for US streamers and studios, the culture has evolved as they have a \u201cdifferent mindset\u201d. \u201cOver there, they have shorter turnaround times \u2013 the time between when they finish and then they start again \u2026 The culture in America is kind of \u2018capture as much as they can within the time that they\u2019ve got\u2019.\u201d Looking after crew members\u2019 wellbeing benefits the industry long-term as it is more expensive to retrain than retain staff, MacDonald explains. He believes change is possible, pointing to the success of shorter working days in Nordic countries. Bectu has also negotiated better hours for set construction staff (eg carpenters) which resulted in higher productivity and less churn, \u201cbecause they\u2019re not burnt out and they don\u2019t get so many mental health issues\u201d. According to the Film and TV Charity\u2019s 2022 survey, only 11% of respondents thought \u201cthe industry is a mentally healthy place to work\u201d and 83% said that \u201cindustry culture has a negative effect on their wellbeing\u201d. One professional I speak with (who has a stress-related illness) says the industry often takes advantage of the fact that many people see their career as a vocation, so go the extra mile at the expense of their wellbeing. They also say autoimmune diseases are on the rise. Cambridge University and autoimmune charity the Wren Project recently co-authored research into the issue and Wren\u2019s founder, Kate Middleton, confirmed there is a \u201cstrong correlation between stress and autoimmune disease and the interaction of physical and mental health\u201d. The Mark Milsome Foundation \u2013 created following the death of a cameraman while filming a night-time car stunt for BBC/Netflix drama Black Earth Rising \u2013 runs courses about set health and safety and is lobbying for education about the issue to be mandatory. Its chair, Samantha Wainstein, tells the Guardian that the current difficult employment climate makes people even more nervous to speak out. \u201cThat\u2019s potentially why we\u2019re seeing a number of incidents in the last few months.\u201d Sometimes people are \u201casked to opt out [of agreements] \u2026 and say that you will work the hours as required\u201d. Wainstein says the foundation wants the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act to be reviewed as it is out of date with the way people work in the freelance and gig economy. \u201cPeople need to feel that they can speak up. A number of studios and productions are trying hard to make a difference. That\u2019s fantastic \u2013 but a bigger cultural shift is needed.\u201d One solution suggested by many is each show having an anonymous exit survey. As one source says: \u201cEveryone\u2019s frightened of losing their job so they don\u2019t want to put their names to the complaints. \u201cProductions do mostly try to do the right thing in terms of checklists etc but those things are not always implemented.\u201d John McVay, CEO of the producers\u2019 alliance Pact, says his members care about crew and want to hear about issues. \u201cAnyone being harmed, or [in an accident] is absolutely terrible.\u201d He says HoDs should raise issues \u201cif they\u2019re concerned about something and give the production an opportunity to do something about it\u201d. A new watchdog, the Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority, is being set up to provide a safer environment for workers in TV, film, music and theatre, but is not due to launch until next year. The BBC and ITV declined to comment as individual programmes have not been named. As Wainstein puts it: \u201cWorking in TV is incredibly exciting and incredibly collegiate. It has wonderful things about it, but it\u2019s not wonderful enough to give up your life for. It\u2019s just not.\u201d * Name changed to protect identity \u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "bodyText": "Graves could be reused and closed burial grounds reopened under proposals aimed at tackling a lack of space for the dead. The Law Commission has suggested that cemeteries that have been declared full could be reused for new burials. The proposal is part of a public consultation by the commission on updating 170-year-old burial laws in England and Wales. The commission has warned that urban areas are fast running out of burial space, with many cemeteries already full. Proposed changes would allow burial grounds to reuse graves, but only after public consultation and government approval. Safeguards would also be in place for each individual grave, with plots only eligible for reuse when the last person was buried at least 75 years ago. A separate public consultation is considering the timeframes around grave reuse, and what would happen if family members objected. Prof Nick Hopkins, the commissioner for property, family and trust law, said any change would need to be considered in consultation with the public. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re very keen to ensure that there are proper safeguards in place so that where graves are reused that is done in a way that is sensitive. And in a way that has the public\u2019s support, and is not done against the wishes of relatives of the person buried.\u201d He added: \u201cOur proposals provide a significant opportunity to reform burial and cremation law and secure burial space for future generations.\u201d Current legislation makes it illegal to redevelop a graveyard for any reason other than to develop a place of worship. Other publicly run cemeteries can be redeveloped if the owner is granted an act of parliament. Alex Davies-Jones, a junior justice minister, said the government was awaiting the commission\u2019s recommendations \u201cwith interest\u201d. Dr Julie Rugg, an expert on burial reform from the University of York, said changes were \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, she said: \u201cOur system isn\u2019t working, and is actually threatening our funeral heritage [and] the Victorian cemeteries we love so much.

Here were the major developments of the day: The pro-Palestine vigil planned for 7 October will be going ahead after organisers revealed it has become a standing vigil, which does not require a form 1 application. The mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore, said \u201cshutting down protests is not the answer\u201d and called for protests to be allowed to go ahead, while the premier, Chris Minns, said that stopping the pro-Palestine and Lebanon rally planned for Sunday could protect Sydney\u2019s \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d. The Australian federal police is investigating nine complaints over alleged public displays of prohibited symbols in Victoria after weekend protests in Melbourne against Israel\u2019s attacks on Lebanon. Acclaimed pianist Jayson Gillham has filed legal proceedings against the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in the federal court. Gillham, whose performance with the MSO was cancelled after a dedication on stage to Palestinian journalists who had died in the Gaza conflict, alleged that he was \u201csilenced for speaking the truth \u2013 that Israel targets journalists\u201d. And the Australian National University has proposed a reorganisation of its academic structure, with vice-chancellor Prof Genevieve Bell admitting the university is facing \u201ca substantial financial challenge\u201d. Continued from previous post: A Greens spokesperson said the PWSS had been \u201cessential\u201d in supporting MPs and senators\u2019 offices to maintain safe workplaces \u201cdespite the challenging nature of political work\u201d. The PWSS is the independent service established after the Jenkins review into parliament\u2019s culture. The leader\u2019s office has no legal power to resolve disputes between staff and any individual Senator\u2019s office, and if any member of staff raises a complaint, they are encouraged and offered support to pursue it through the independent PWSS, and that occurred here. The Greens will not comment on any individual cases in relation to staff. Bandt cuts press conference short after being questioned about allegations of bullying against senator Greens leader Adam Bandt has cut a press conference in Perth short after declining to answer a series of questions about steps his office had made to investigate allegations made against the party\u2019s WA senator, Dorinda Cox. Bandt was responding to a Sydney Morning Herald report on alleged bullying by Cox. The report said 20 staff had quit her office in three years and that several had lodged formal complaints with the parliamentary workplace support service and Bandt\u2019s office alleging a hostile culture. Bandt told reporters any time a staff member came to him or his team with an issue, it was taken \u201cvery seriously\u201d, while neglecting to say whether Cox would keep her First Nations portfolio or if an investigation would be launched. Senator Dorinda Cox, who was not present at the press conference, told Guardian Australia she was \u201cvery proud\u201d of her team and the \u201chard-working people\u201d that had been a part of it since her election in 2022. I have continued to work respectfully and collaboratively with my colleagues and team, and will continue to work to incorporate a holistic work life balance to our offices. I continue to be very grateful to the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service (PWSS) for the work they do in helping offices across the country, including mine, despite what can be challenging circumstances both politically and personally. Continued in next post. NSW Greens: democracy has \u2018won the day\u2019 The New South Wales Greens have backed the supreme court\u2019s decision for a pro-Palestine protest to go ahead as a vigil, declaring democracy has \u201cwon the day\u201d. Earlier, it was revealed a NSW police application to prohibit pro-Palestine assemblies in Sydney on 6 and 7 October had failed. Following a day of hearings and negotiations between police and the Palestine Action Group (PAG), it was agreed the assemblies would go ahead as a vigil and police would withdraw its application. Greens MP and spokesperson for justice, Sue Higginson, said the NSW police force had used \u201cpoor judgment and use of public resources\u201d. Once again a grassroots community justice movement has stood up for and defended our democracy and the fundamental right to protest in the courts against the strong-arm of an emboldened law-and-order state. The right of all individuals to exercise freedom of speech and the right to assemble peacefully has won the day, but the reality is, it should never have been on trial. If protest was enshrined into law in NSW as it is in other states and territories, the NSW police force would not be so emboldened to attempt to remove these rights. The pro-Palestine vigil planned for 7 October will be going ahead after organisers revealed it has become a standing vigil, which does not require a form 1 application. They also revealed that the protest schedule for Sunday has been approved by police after organisers made changes to the route of the procession in last-minute negotiations. On the steps of the NSW supreme court, Amal Naser of the Palestine Action Group claimed victory in their stoush with NSW police, saying all of the plans will be going ahead. This is a good moment for democratic rights as well as the fight for Palestinian liberation. We ultimately got everything we wanted. We had a strong case and we were going to win anyway. We\u2019ve reached a good outcome, and it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been saying all along. We have the right to protest, and we need to protest now more than ever. The route we are marching is a route we have marched dozens of times before, and it\u2019s a route we are happy with. Thanks for your work Cait Kelly. It\u2019s Caitlin Cassidy here (Cait #2) until stumps. Parties engaged in \u2018good faith process\u2019 during difficult time, judge says In the supreme court, the parties have reached an agreement, but we are waiting for more detail on that. The summons was dismissed and there is about to be a press conference outside court. We will bring you that as it comes. Before court was adjourned, the judge said: Can I just say this, it is apparent to me from the evidence that over the course of the last typical 51 weeks, the commissioners, the defendants \u2026 have engaged in very difficult times, in a good faith process to seek to manage the balance, on the one hand, of a right to peaceful assembly with on the other hand, legitimate concerns about public safety. It is to the credit of the parties that they have done so. Melbourne Symphony Orchestra responds to news of legal action by pianist The MSO has responded to news pianist Jayson Gillham is taking action against it in the federal court. In a statement, MSO said: The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra has today been served with a statement of claim by Jayson Gillham commencing proceedings in the Federal Court. The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra is reviewing the court documents and will respond at the appropriate time. IMF: phasing out tax breaks could create a fairer tax system The International Monetary Fund has found \u201ctax breaks, including from capital gains tax discount and superannuation concessions, could be phased out to generate a more equitable and efficient tax system\u201d. In a statement, Greg Jericho, chief economist at the Australia Institute said: The IMF has just confirmed what everyone knows \u2013 the tax concessions on superannuation and the capital gains discount make Australia less fair and should be reformed. The capital gains discount and negative gearing have distorted Australia\u2019s housing market for a quarter of a century. As a result, home ownership rates are declining as fewer and fewer people can afford to buy a house. Reforming these tax concessions would allow more Australians to realise their ambitions of owning a home and make Australia a fairer country. Back in the NSW supreme court, Palestine Action Group spokesperson Josh Lees is being asked whether their marshals will be able to handle the planned protests on the weekend if they go ahead. Lees says \u201cthey\u2019ve managed very well\u201d if you look at the record of the past 50 weeks of protests. Lachlan Gyles, representing the police, suggested they had not managed a crowd \u201cof this nature\u201d where there was a lot of heightened emotions. Lees said: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. We\u2019ve been dealing with a whole series of very emotional and devastating moments. For the last year. Man charged over FriendlyJordies firebombing granted bail A man charged over the firebombing of Jordan Shanks-Markovina \u2013 better known by his online alias of FriendlyJordies \u2013 has been granted bail, AAP reports. Andre Stepanyan is one of two men charged over an alleged arson attack on Shanks-Markovina\u2019s Bondi home in November 2022. Stepanyan, who is charged with destroying property in company and participating in a criminal group, appeared for a bail hearing in the NSW supreme court on Thursday. The 38-year-old was allegedly the driver behind the wheel of a black Mercedes that took at least two passengers to the house. His lawyer Bianca Barnes said: I think an issue at trial is going to be whether or not he had any knowledge of what was happening. There was no evidence Stepanyan was associated with any criminal groups at the time of the firebombing in November 2022, Barnes added. Sydney Metro maintenance workers to strike on Friday morning over pay increases Maintenance workers on the Sydney Metro service are set to strike and picket the entrance of Tallawong metro station from 7am to 9am tomorrow after contractor Alstom\u2019s refusal to provide reasonable wage increases, the Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union says. AMWU NSW state organiser Nathan Everson said commuters needed safe, reliable transport and rail workers deserved a fair pay deal. Workers at Alstom have been maintaining rolling stock for the past five years, delivering an essential service to the community. The protected action will undoubtedly have an impact on the new service. Workers would prefer not to have to take protected industrial action, particularly following the NSW Government showcasing the new Metro service in August, but they don\u2019t feel as if they have a choice at this stage. Private contracting on major transport projects has become a prominent issue for our workforce. Workers are undervalued and unsafe as a result. This comes as no surprise considering how the Minns Government have been treating Nurses, Teachers, and Firies. Workers deserve better, commuters deserve better, and we call on the NSW government to step in and do something about it. Planned protest a \u2018tinderbox\u2019, police assistant commissioner tells Sydney court In the supreme court hearing on the pro-Palestine protest in Sydney this weekend, the assistant commissioner, Peter McKenna, who is the police commander for the area, said the situation was a \u201ctinderbox\u201d because the planned protest would go near the Great Synagogue in Sydney\u2019s CBD. McKenna: It would be provocative to re-enter near the Great Synagogue, especially given the significant number of people I expect. Hard for police to ensure public safety. Things that come to us that would see clear provocation or even placing people in positions where often it only takes one or two people to say the wrong thing \u2026 it could be a tinderbox and something significant we would have to deal with. It\u2019s understood the protest has previously gone near the synagogue. The AFP has put out a statement about protesters allegedly carrying photos of Hezbollah flags and portraits of leader Hassan Nasrallah during weekend protests in Melbourne against Israel\u2019s attacks on Lebanon. In a statement, the AFP said: The AFP\u2019s Counter Terrorism and Special Investigations Command (in Victoria) has established Operation Ardvarna, which is investigating nine complaints of allegedly publicly displayed prohibited symbols in Victoria while potentially inciting or advocating violence, or hatred, based on race and religion. The nine reports originate in Victoria and have been provided by Victoria Police (3) and to the National Security Hotline (1), Report of Crime (portal) (4) and proactive investigation into a media article (1) allegedly identifying an individual. It is likely the number of investigations will increase, and some state and territory police agencies have their own investigations underway. The process for AFP investigators includes triaging and assessing referrals, identifying persons of interest, developing investigation plans to assist ongoing investigations and to provide strategies for disruption and/or overt activity. While state and territory police agencies primarily focus on public order management for protests, the AFP has offered or is providing support to agencies ahead of expected protests over the coming days. The nine investigations undertaken by the AFP are a priority. However, the community can be assured that the AFP is also continuing to focus on its primary role that it does 365 days a year \u2013 that includes investigating and disrupting terrorism, radicalisation, foreign interference and espionage. The AFP is committed to keeping the community informed on protest investigations. The NSW supreme court hearing has returned. Lachlan Gyles, representing the police, said what they are effectively dealing with is an informal form 1, based on what is proposed. He said the difference between this and the prior proposal is \u201cthere is less controversy about it\u201d in terms of the \u201csuitability\u201d. He also said the \u201carea of contention is going to be much narrowed.\u201d Arjun Chhabra, representing the organisers, earlier said the 6 October protest would begin at Hyde Park, rather than Town Hall. He said clients were seeking protection, not authorisation for the 6 October rally. Because the onus is on plaintiff to obtain prohibition, as opposed to the defendant, currently, authorisation. Thanks for joining me on the blog today, Cait Kelly will take you through the rest of the NSW supreme court hearing \u2013 and the rest of our rolling coverage today. Take care. The court has adjourned for another 10 minutes. The hearing has now resumed in the NSW supreme court. Arjun Chhabra, representing the organisers, said part of the amended form 1 proposal included beginning the 6 October protest at Hyde Park, rather than Town Hall. He said organisers have abandoned their plans to hold a pro-Palestine vigil on Monday 7 October. Parties hoping resolution on Sunday\u2019s protest can be reached outside court In the NSW supreme court, senior counsel Lachlan Gyles \u2013 representing the police \u2013 said there has been a proposal for an \u201calternative manner of operation\u201d for Sunday\u2019s event, and parties wish to discuss whether a resolution may be able to be reached. Arjun Chhabra, representing the defendants, requested 15 minutes to discuss this. Justice Jeremy Kirk said the choice he had was \u201cbinary\u201d \u2013 either he makes a prohibition order or he does not. He recognised that there were \u201clegitimate and weighty concerns on both sides\u201d and having some discussion was \u201csensible\u201d, granting a 15-minute adjournment. Court will return at 2.20pm. Supreme court hearing begins The hearing has begun at the NSW supreme court into two events planned for 6 and 7 October, which the NSW police are attempting to prevent. A pro-Palestine rally is planned for Sunday, and a candlelight vigil for Monday, which is a public holiday in NSW. As Mostafa Rachwani reported yesterday, Sydney police told organisers they had safety concerns over the expected crowd size and potential hazards at Town Hall including \u201cthe recent addition of over a dozen planter boxes\u201d. But protest organisers have said the move to block events from going ahead was \u201ca political attack on our right to protest\u201d \u2013 and said pointing to the planter boxes was an \u201cobvious red herring\u201d. We\u2019ll bring you the latest as the hearing continues. A crowd of pro-Palestine protesters have gathered outside the NSW supreme court, with the hearing into NSW police\u2019s attempt to block the protest this weekend due at 2pm. People have arrived with banners and flags to show their support for the cause and to protest against the police submission to have the rallies organised for 6 and 7 October cancelled. Chants of \u201cFree, free Palestine\u201d and \u201cHands off Lebanon\u201d have started around the entrance to court. A traditional tablah drum has begun ringing out across the square, in time with the chanting. A strong police presence surrounds the entry to court, with members of the Palestine Action Group, the organisers of the rallies, due to arrive soon. Hybrid vehicles in fast lane as petrol cars slow down Motorists are putting the brakes on new vehicle purchases, with sales of petrol, diesel and electric cars slowing down significantly in Australia. But as AAP reports, hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicle sales continue to accelerate despite the downturn, and large vehicles remain the most popular models for consumers. Figures from the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries show petrol vehicle sales fell 17.5% during the month, diesel vehicles were down 12.3%, but hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles bucked the trend. Motorists bought more than 13,500 hybrid vehicles in September \u2013 a 34.4% rise compared to the same period in 2023 \u2013 and more than 2400 plug-in hybrid cars, representing a rise of 89.9%. A hybrid vehicle, the Toyota RAV4, also claimed the title of Australia\u2019s bestselling vehicle for September, followed by Ford Ranger and Toyota HiLux utes. Electric vehicles did not fare as well as their low-emission cohorts during the month. Combined sales figures from the FCAI and the Electric Vehicle Council showed Australians bought more than 6,400 EVs during the month, down 27%, which represented 6.6% of all new vehicle sales. Minns defends decision to attend vigil with Jewish community on 7 October The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, has defended his decision to attend a candlelight vigil on 7 October to show solidarity with the Jewish community, while insisting a vigil for Palestine planned for the same night should not go ahead. At his press conference earlier, Minns said he would go to the vigil with the Jewish community and that \u201csome\u201d Muslim leaders \u201cmay expect me\u201d to attend. So the suggestion that me attending a rally for the Jewish community would somehow upset the sensibilities of the Muslim community \u2013 there were many Muslim leaders in NSW that issued a public condemnation of that terrorist activity on that day, who were concerned about it [and] saw it as a crime, and offered sympathy and solidarity with the Jewish community in Sydney as a result. So some of them may expect me to be there. Minns said the organisers of the pro-Palestine and Lebanon vigil planned for Monday night had said in submitting the paperwork required to lawfully hold the gathering that they were expecting 200 people to attend. But he said a \u201creasonable person would suggest\u201d it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that only 200 people would go, and there was \u201cgenuine police scepticism\u201d that the event could be contained. Twelve months ago in Sydney, there was meant to be a vigil in the days following the October 7 terrorist attacks, this is prior to Israeli activity in Gaza. It ended up being an unlawful march through the streets and a major protest \u2013 some would term it violent protest \u2013 on the steps of the Opera House. I think that would cause huge harm to social harmony in NSW and it\u2019s reasonable for the government and the police to try and prevent those scenes being repeated. More than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, died on 7 October. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza, mostly civilians, one in 55 of the prewar population. More than 700 people have died in Lebanon in the recent wave of Israeli attacks. The lord mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore, has said \u201cshutting down protests is not the answer\u201d and has called for protests in Sydney to be allowed to go ahead. A pro-Palestine rally is scheduled for Sunday and a candlelight vigil for Monday, but the NSW police have brought a case to the supreme court to try to block these. The hearing kicks off at 2pm, in about half an hour. In a statement, Moore said: We don\u2019t approve or facilitate protests or rallies in our LGA \u2013 NSW Police are responsible for permits and ensuring safe management \u2013 but we stand ready to help. If we\u2019re required to move planter boxes to ensure safety, for example, we will. The community has been gathering, peacefully, every week for the past year. I know that larger crowds are expected this weekend, but I am hopeful that the Police permit and support the community to do so once again. The statement comes as an open letter has been signed by 42 human rights groups and community organisations, calling on the NSW police commissioner to facilitate the protests. Signatories include the Human Rights Law Centre, Community Legal Centres NSW, Amnesty International Australia, NSW Council for Civil Liberties, and Jewish Council of Australia. Aussie women say they\u2019re not educated on contraception The vast majority of Australian women fear they have insufficient education on contraception despite more than two-thirds opting to use some form of birth control, AAP reports. The fresh insight has been released by assistant minister for health and aged care, Ged Kearney, in the new national Contraceptive Choice 2024 survey. Of the more than 1,000 Australian women aged 18 to 45 questioned, 34% said they were not using any form of contraception. Seventy per cent said they believed they did not have correct or enough education on contraception and 32% of those under 24 regularly experienced anxiety about their current method. In the survey, 36% of women said they had experienced a pregnancy scare and 42% said they had taken emergency contraception. Among the barriers for women in trying a new method, 42% cited side effects while 21% were worried about costs and the time needed to switch methods. A separate 17% said they didn\u2019t know enough to make informed decisions about new options. Acclaimed pianist Jayson Gillham has filed legal proceedings against the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in the federal court. Gillham, whose performance with the MSO was cancelled after a dedication on stage to Palestinian journalists who had died in the Gaza conflict, alleged that he was \u201csilenced for speaking the truth \u2013 that Israel targets journalists\u201d. In a statement regarding the legal action, Gillham said: This situation goes beyond just artistic freedom; it strikes at the heart of our right to free speech and the role of art in addressing important social issues. The MSO\u2019s extreme reaction to factual statements highlights a disturbing trend of silencing voices that speak to uncomfortable truths. The pianist argues that MSO\u2019s actions constitute direct discrimination based on political belief, violating his human and workplace rights protected by the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Victoria) and Fair Work Act 2009 (Commonwealth). Gillham said he was compelled to pursue legal action \u201cafter the MSO rejected reasonable requests to remedy the situation\u201d. He said: This battle is about ensuring that artists can perform with integrity and without fear of censorship or reprisal. More broadly, it\u2019s about defending everyone\u2019s right to express opinions on important issues without being silenced. The MSO has been contacted for comment. Returning to the press conference Chris Minns held earlier today, the NSW premier claimed that stopping the pro-Palestine and Lebanon rally planned for Sunday could protect Sydney\u2019s \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d. When a journalist put to Minns that the police wouldn\u2019t be able to stop people from congregating en masse in Sydney\u2019s CBD if they chose to go ahead with the protest, the premier said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t make that claim\u201d. I\u2019m not going to go through chapter and verse what police tactics will be. But it does give the police the power to ensure that a mobile protest doesn\u2019t take place through Sydney streets as it would be an unauthorised march. And that may be important in protecting critical infrastructure for the city, or ensuring that we don\u2019t have an unfortunate conflict on Sydney\u2019s streets. NSW police have vowed to stop a protest planned for Sunday 6 October and a candlelight vigil scheduled for Monday 7 October from going ahead. Two peregrine falcon chicks hatch at Collins Street skyscraper in Melbourne Two peregrine falcon chicks have hatched in Melbourne, witnessed by all who watch the iconic Collins Street live feed. The two chicks hatched early this morning, as observed on the live feed. The mother is currently huddling over her chicks, dutifully waiting for a third to hatch. Peregrine falcons have treated a ledge on top of 367 Collins Street as home for more than three decades, but cameras made them a social media phenomenon. The cameras were turned back on in August for the new breeding season, as the first egg was laid. As Adeshola Ore reported, last year\u2019s eggs were unable to hatch after the female stopped incubating, likely due to a territorial dispute \u2013 but there was high hopes for this season. You can follow along with the livestream here, or read more about the yearly tradition below: Australians in Lebanon facing difficult decisions as authorities urge them to leave Australians are being urged to leave Lebanon and take up offers of more than 500 extra commercial airline seats, but for some families, it\u2019s not that simple. AAP has spoken with one Lebanese Australian, who wished to remain anonymous for privacy reasons, who described the heartbreak and emotional toll of worrying about her relatives. Both sides of her family are from Lebanon, with three generations living across Beirut and the nation\u2019s north. Thankfully, those in the mountainous north are safe, she says, but a full-scale invasion could change this. \u201cThose in Beirut are going hour by hour, day by day,\u201d she told AAP through tears, saying the airstrikes were not in their areas, but they could hear the constant explosions. Some of our relatives are elderly and frail and won\u2019t be able to leave. No one in my family would travel out here and leave their mothers, their fathers, their cousins, their aunts, the elderly. Her family would \u201cmove heaven and earth\u201d to evacuate elderly people to the northern village they\u2019re from, but this may not be feasible even in the worst-case scenario due to the 24-hour care requirement they\u2019re receiving in Beirut, she said. Qantas freight workers will be almost $7,000 a year better off thanks to a deal struck by the Australian Services Union (ASU) which would see the wages of Australian Air Express workers lifted to match those of their Qantas Freight counterparts. ASU national secretary Emeline Gaske said the deal was another win for the union\u2019s \u201csame job, same pay\u201d campaign: Workers at Australian Air Express, a wholly owned Qantas subsidiary, work alongside their colleagues at Qantas Freight doing identical work every day. Yet those working for Australia Air Express have been receiving significantly lower wages than their counterparts at Qantas. For far too long, employment loopholes like these have been exploited by unscrupulous employers to short-change workers, and it\u2019s time these dodgy arrangements ended. Queensland police have faced questions on 4BC Radio about the naming of a man by Chinese media outlets as someone who allegedly poured hot coffee on a baby in Brisbane. A warrant was previously issued for the arrest of a 33-year-old foreign national, accused of the alleged attack at Hanlon Park in Stones Corner on 27 August. QPS acting assistant commissioner Andrew Massingham was asked about the Chinese media outlets reports, and said the international search is continuing. Sometimes these posts can be a distraction to what we\u2019re attempting to achieve, but that search will continue until we locate that person. Asked if the reports would affect the investigation, Massingham responded: Those things always need to remain confidential up until the time we go public with the information. In a statement, Queensland police said they were \u201cunable to provide any further information or context around this investigation at this time\u201d. Here\u2019s some more details from Peter Hannam on the latest International Monetary Fund assessment report, which said extra government spending could inject \u201cadditional stimulus\u201d into the Australian economy and risk the RBA having to lift interest rates: LNP leader makes health announcement as Labor premier forgets candidates\u2019 name Queensland premier Steven Miles and opponent David Crisafulli have spent another day in the regions. Miles made a major gaffe in Mirani, near Rockhampton, when he forgot the name of the local Labor candidate, Susan Teder. The Labor leader held press conferences yesterday and today in the Katter\u2019s Australian party-held electorate without her. Miles said he would \u201cfind out\u201d where she was, before being prompted by deputy leader Cameron Dick. Meanwhile, LNP leader David Crisafulli stayed in the Rockhampton area for the second day straight, where he made a youth mental health commitment. Crisafulli said he would spend $50m building two new step-up step-down clinics, one of them in central Queensland: The reason why is there\u2019s currently no facilities for young people between Cairns and Brisbane that\u2019s a very, very big area, and to have a dedicated one in Rockhampton is a big step forward in acknowledging how serious the challenges are and how vast that distance is, and also the pressures that the Rockhampton hospital is under. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, has said the candlelight vigil scheduled for 7 October in Sydney should not go ahead. Speaking to reporters earlier, he said: We remain committed to the idea that holding a protest on Monday \u2013 which is obviously the anniversary of October 7, which was a devastating terrorist attack on Israel and has had huge ramifications for those who live in Sydney who are concerned about family, friends and community members in that part of the world \u2013 is not the right thing to do. [It\u2019s] hugely unsympathetic to those who are going through pain at the moment and not in keeping or in recognition of the fact that, yes, there\u2019s have been protests taking place in Sydney, but surely one of the other 364 days of the year would be more appropriate. It\u2019s worth noting that a protest is planned for Sunday 6 October and a candlelight vigil is scheduled for Monday 7 October. Josh Lees, a member of the Palestine Action Group Sydney, told ABC RN earlier today that the vigil was \u201cmainly about the chance for Palestinian and Lebanese people to come and grieve for the thousands of people who have died\u201d. More than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, died on 7 October. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza, mostly civilians, one in 55 of the prewar population. More than 700 people have died in Lebanon in the recent wave of Israeli attacks. Nedd Brockmann to begin record attempt today Nedd Brockmann, one of the fastest to run across Australia, will begin his attempt at a record today \u2013 hoping to become the fastest time to cover 1,000 miles (1,610km) on foot. The current record stands at 10 days, 10 hours, 30 minutes and 36 seconds, set in 1988. In a May social media post, Brockmann said he was aiming to raise $10m to help Aussies experiencing homelessness, writing: This record has stood since 1988, and for good reason. To break it down, that\u2019s roughly 160 kilometres a day for 10 days in order to break the record \u2026 Yes, 403 laps of the 400m Olympic park track a day. He\u2019s set to begin the run at 4pm, which will be live streamed on TikTok. Brockmann made headlines in 2022 when he ran from Cottesloe to Bondi in 46.5 days, as part of an epic 3,800km charity run. A previous version of this post said Brockmann was the fastest to run across Australia. Chris Turnbull, from Sydney, is the fastest, completing the run in 39 days. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has responded to Peter Dutton\u2019s comments about a pro-Palestine protest planned for the anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel. Dutton argued that Allan has the power to halt the protests. This is despite Victoria police saying they do not have the power to prevent the protest from going ahead, after NSW police launched legal action to prevent the demonstration in Sydney from occurring. Speaking to reporters, Allan said police \u201calready have all the powers they need\u201d to respond to protest activity: Attending a protest on October 7 is not something that is appropriate in any way. I\u2019m not going to cut across operational decisions. Allan said police have the powers to arrest people who may be displaying terrorist flags and are in discussions with the Australian federal police. Anthony Albanese and Allan have urged pro-Palestine protesters not to hold demonstrations on the anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel. Damaging winds forecast for parts of Eyre Peninsula The severe weather warning for damaging winds about South Australia has been updated to include parts of the Eyre Peninsula. The Bureau of Meteorology said damaging winds around 60-70km/h, with peak gusts in over 90km/h, are forecast this morning and afternoon, with the risk easing in the late afternoon. NTEU says restructure plan for ANU \u2018another kick in the guts\u2019 for staff The National Tertiary Education Union has labelled the ANU\u2019s restructure plans \u2013 which includes job cuts \u2013 as \u201canother kick in the guts\u201d for staff. Earlier, we brought you news that the ANU was proposing a restructure amid financial challenges, with \u201cunavoidable\u201d job losses as part of that. NTEU ANU branch president Millan Pintos-Lopez said today\u2019s announcement was \u201ccompletely inconsistent\u201d with recent actions taken in relation to the College of Health and Medicine. Under the proposal, this would be disestablished despite the university spending $16.75m on land for a new health precinct in July 2023. Only three weeks ago, the ANU announced the appointment of Christine Nixon to lead a review of gender equity and culture within the College. Two weeks ago, the Dean, Professor Russell Gruen, stepped down. Staff are right to feel let down by the chaos and confusion. Division secretary Dr Lachlan Clohesy said that communication and consultation has been \u201cpoor throughout\u201d. Staff are sick of these pronouncements from the Chancelry tower, with little to no consultation, which have a huge effect on people\u2019s lives. Pace of rental price growth slowing, as Sydney remains most expensive capital to rent a home The latest PropTrack market insight report, released today, shows the pace of rental price growth is slowing as more available stock comes to market. Median advertised rents rose by 7% over the past year to $610 per week, representing the weakest annual rental price growth since September 2021, the report said. Other key findings include: Capital city advertised rents rose 1.6% to $640 per week over the quarter, while regional rents grew by 1.9% to $540 per week. Capital city rents increased 6.8% over the year, the weakest growth since December 2021, while regional rents rose 8% year-on-year. Annual growth in unit rents (9.1%) remained stronger than annual growth in house rents (6.9%), with the gap narrowing to just $20 per week. Hobart, regional NSW and regional Tasmania were the only markets to see stronger rental growth over the past year compared with the year prior. The report said Sydney remains the most expensive capital city to rent a home, with the median advertised rent unchanged over the quarter and 5.8% higher over the year, taking rents to $730 per week. Melbourne had the cheapest rent out of all the capital cities (median advertised rent of $570) except for Hobart. The report states: Although the pace of rental growth is slowing and more stock is available for rent, supply remains low. However, we anticipate more balanced conditions in the coming months The Australian National University has proposed a reorganisation of its academic structure, with vice-chancellor Professor Genevieve Bell admitting the university is facing \u201ca substantial financial challenge\u201d. The university has proposed a restructure. It said all 42 schools, centres and institutions would be retained, with eight to be moved to different colleges within the university. The number of colleges will be reduced from seven to six, with the College of Health and Medicine to be disestablished. The new College of Science and Medicine will host the university\u2019s science and medicine activities, and three colleges will be renamed to reflect new or expanded areas of focus. Bell said it was \u201c not going to be possible to grow our way out of persistent operating deficits by enrolling more students\u201d. This change proposal has not been taken lightly. We will make all attempts to minimise the impact on our community, however some job losses will be unavoidable. We recognise this is hard, but these are changes we have to make. Without structural intervention, the University will not be financially sustainable. The changes will take effect from 1 January 2025. Peter Dutton claimed that the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has the ability to stop a pro-Palestine protest from taking place this weekend, ahead of 7 October on Monday. But yesterday, Victorian Police said they have no powers to halt the rally. (See more in yesterday\u2019s blog here). Dutton pointed to the Covid-19 pandemic response when police were deployed, and said the premier should \u201chave the same resolve in relation to this issue\u201d. He said: I think the premier of Victoria had great capacity \u2013 she was part of a government that deployed the police force here in Victoria during the course of Covid to enforce the rule of law, and I think the Victorian Labor party should have the same resolve in relation to this issue, and I\u2019m sure there are laws available and that will be an issue for the premier. Asked if the Coalition would provide military aid to Israel if elected, Peter Dutton said: We provided support to Israel in the past in terms of intelligence sharing, and I don\u2019t think Israel requires the support of Australia in terms of defence material and supplies. But the best thing that we can do at the moment is to provide Israel with that moral support because they\u2019re at threat from an attack from people who don\u2019t share our values. Dutton echoes calls for Australians in Lebanon to leave Peter Dutton echoed calls from the government for Australians in Lebanon to leave \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d It\u2019s been going on for months. It was predictable that we were going to see the circumstance we\u2019re seeing in Lebanon \u2026 But I would just say to people, please, heed the advice of the Smart Traveller website, of the prime minister, of the minister for foreign affairs and exit Lebanon as quickly as you can, and as safely as possible. Dutton said he was happy with news the government has planes in place for Australians to leave. We support the government in the work that they\u2019re doing in that regard. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is speaking to reporters in Melbourne. He was asked about Richard Marles\u2019s call for a 21-day ceasefire in the Middle East, and responded: If he wants to go down the appeasement path of Anthony Albanese that\u2019s an issue for him. Frankly, I think he diminishes himself by being at odds with the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and our partners otherwise. The calls for a 21-day ceasefire were backed by the US and France, as well as the UK, Canada, the European Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Masseuse charged with three counts of sexual touching in NSW A masseuse has been charged with sexual touching in central west New South Wales. In June, police began investigating reports a man \u2013 who worked as a masseuse at the time \u2013 had allegedly inappropriately touched a 38-year-old woman during an appointment in Orange. In August police received a second report that a 55-year-old woman had allegedly been inappropriately touched at the same premises. And in September, police received a third report a 34-year-old woman was allegedly inappropriately touched at the premises. Yesterday police arrested a 60-year-old man at Orange police station and charged him with three counts of sexually touching another person without consent. He was granted conditional bail to appear before Orange local court on 24 October. Faruqi calls on media outlets to conduct independent racism reviews The deputy leader of the Greens, Mehreen Faruqi, says all media outlets should conduct anti-racism training and commission independent racism reviews. This follows the release of the Race Reporting Handbook today \u2013 developed by the Australian Human Rights Commission and Media Diversity Australia \u2013 as well as the racism review conducted by the ABC. You can read more about this below: Faruqi said the ABC\u2019s independent review found systemic racism at the national broadcaster, but \u201cthe ABC are not the only ones\u201d. People of colour are dehumanised daily in Australian media, and we\u2019ve seen more and more diverse journalists leave the profession due to their workplaces being unsafe. This has to change, and it has to change now. Faruqi said the handbook was a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d but \u201cthe impetus for change must come from the media outlets.\u201d The consequences of not dealing with the racism in Australian media is the further erosion of audience trust. The International Monetary Fund has just concluded its annual \u201cmission\u201d to examine the state of the Australian economy, and it\u2019s delivered comments that the Albanese government probably won\u2019t be too happy about. Yes, the economy remains \u201cresilient\u201d and GDP growth should start to accelerate. However, the time for cutting official interest rates hasn\u2019t yet arrived: The RBA\u2019s decision to maintain its restrictive policy stance in the near-term is appropriate. A key reason is that underlying inflation is not on a certain path to drop back to within the 2%-3% target range, and governments at all levels aren\u2019t doing as much as they might to help. In doing so, early interest rate cuts are less likely. \u201cThe FY2024/25 Commonwealth budget is projected to deliver a positive fiscal impulse based on the mission\u2019s estimates,\u201d it said, adding that \u201cstate and territory budgets have proven more expansionary than expected in the near-term, incorporating further cost-of-living support and infrastructure spending\u201d. We\u2019ll shortly get a briefing from Lamin Leigh, IMF\u2019s Australia mission chief, who will be asked about these and other conclusions. Treasurer Jim Chalmers, though, said the fund had \u201cendorsed the Albanese Government\u2019s responsible economic management\u201d. He said: The government\u2019s primary focus is to get on top of our inflation challenge without ignoring the risks to growth and the IMF has backed this strategy. A worker is dead and another is seriously injured after a machinery incident at a central Queensland mine, AAP reports. Paramedics were called to the Oaky Creek coalmine at Tieri, west of Rockhampton, following reports of injuries after a machinery incident about 4.30pm yesterday. A man in his 30s suffered significant head injuries and died at the scene, Resources Health and Safety Queensland said. A second man in his 20s suffered life-threatening head, arm and leg injuries and was airlifted to Rockhampton Hospital. Resources Health and Safety Queensland is investigating, with chief executive Rob Djukic stating \u201cour thoughts are with the colleagues, friends and families of both workers.\u201d An RSHQ coal inspector has issued a directive to isolate the incident scene while we investigate. Glencore, the operator of the mine, said the incident occurred when the two employees were carrying out maintenance works. Glencore\u2019s Australian coal arm CEO Ian Cribb said: Our deepest sympathies go out to both workers\u2019 families, friends and colleagues. This is devastating for our entire Oaky Creek workforce, and we are providing support services and counselling. Operations at the mine have been suspended while authorities investigate. Wong questioned on whether changes needed to Australia\u2019s protest laws Penny Wong was questioned on Australia\u2019s laws relating to protest, with a reporter noting that Victoria police said they can\u2019t move people on from protesting as they would not be breaking the law. (See more in yesterday\u2019s blog here). Asked if all states and territories should have uniform laws in place for protests, Wong said: Well, I would hope we wouldn\u2019t need them. I would hope that, you know, we would exercise our rights in this democracy for peaceful protests respectfully and peacefully. I would hope we wouldn\u2019t need to change the law and that\u2019s what I would urge for all Australians. Wong condemns alleged flying of Hezbollah flags at protest The foreign affairs minister said she condemned the alleged flying of Hezbollah flags at a rally last weekend. Wong said: People need to understand what they are saying when they do that \u2013 they are promoting an organisation that is a terrorist organisation. That is not conducive to harmony in Australia, to social inclusion and social cohesion. Penny Wong was also asked how concerned she is about protests planned for 6 and 7 October. She echoed comments from the PM yesterday, and said it is \u201cnot an occasion for protest\u201d. October 7 was the greatest loss of Jewish lives in a single day since the Holocaust. It\u2019s a day of grieving and a day of remembrance and should be honoured as such, and I would hope that Australians would ensure that it can be honoured with respect and solemnity. It is a solemn occasion. It\u2019s not an occasion for protest. The Palestine Action Group says it has planned a candlelight vigil for 7 October in Sydney. A rally is scheduled for Sunday 6 October. Wong says Israel has \u2018right to defend itself\u2019 but urges adherence to international law Taking questions from reporters, Penny Wong was asked how Israel should respond to the missile attack from Iran. She said that \u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself against Iran\u2019s attack\u201d and continued: We continue to condemn Iran\u2019s behaviour in region, its destablisation of the region, its support for many of the actors in the region including Hezbollah. I again make the point that all \u2013 we always urge adherence to international law in all of our statements in relation to the Middle East. Penny Wong also reiterated calls for Australians in Lebanon to leave, and take \u201cwhatever option is available to you\u201d. She said 1,700 Australians and their immediate family are registered with Dfat and have indicated they wish to leave Lebanon. Wong confirmed that 80 seats have been secured on flights that are leaving today, and only 35 of those seats have been taken up. She also said an additional 500 seats have been secured for Australians and their immediate family on two flights to Cyprus, which will be leaving on Saturday. What I would say to Australians who wish to leave \u2013 please take whatever option is available to you. Please do not wait for your preferred route \u2026 If you are able to secure a seat on a flight, please take that seat. If you have a seat on today\u2019s flight, don\u2019t delay. Now is not the time for you to wait and see, now is the time to leave. Penny Wong addressing the media in Geelong The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, is speaking to the media in Geelong in Victoria. Commenting on the escalation of violence in the Middle East, Wong said the strikes by Iran are \u201ca dangerous escalation and we condemn them fully\u201d. It is rightly condemned by all who seek de-escalation and a ceasefire. Under international law, Israel has a right to defend itself against these attacks and as you know Australia always urges adherence to international law \u2026 We have been clear that the cycle of violence cannot continue and we have urged all parties to show restraint and de-escalate. Man shot four times in Sydney\u2019s west as police probe possibility of gang links A man has been shot four times in various parts of his body overnight amid questions about whether there are links to Sydney\u2019s underworld. As AAP reports, the 28-year-old was found with gunshot wounds about 10.50pm last night in Winston Hills, near Parramatta, according to police. He was taken to hospital in a serious but stable condition where he remains under police guard. Specialist forensic police are expected to examine the scene this morning. The circumstances pointed to a targeted shooting but it was too early to tell if it was gang-related, police told AAP. The link to a car fire in nearby Northmead is also being investigated. An SUV was found alight about 11pm and could not be salvaged, despite firefighters\u2019 best efforts. Search for sailor continues after boat washed ashore near Hobart Tasmanian police are continuing their search for a 70-year-old man after an unoccupied boat washed ashore Kingston Beach yesterday. The man has been reported as missing by his family, with indications he boarded the vessel alone in the morning. Acting inspector Peter Borish said a white flybridge cruiser with a small inflatable dingy attached washed onto the beach around 2pm yesterday. Police conducted a \u201csignificant search of the area\u201d yesterday, he said, \u201cand these search efforts will continue today\u201d. Marine resources and the Westpac Rescue Helicopter were used. Information to date indicates the man boarded the vessel alone at the Derwent Park Marina and departed around 7am. The man, aged in his 70s, has now been reported as missing by his family. Anyone with information is urged to contact police. The push by NSW police to stop two pro-Palestine demonstrations from taking place this long-weekend will be heard in the state\u2019s supreme court today. The matter is listed for 2pm. The Palestine Action Group has said on Instagram it will hold a rally outside the court at 1.30pm. For more on the court action, you can read this piece from Mostafa Rachwani below: The first plane has taken off and landed at what will be Australia\u2019s next international airport, AAP reports. A test pilot hit the milestone in a Piper PA-30 Twin Comanche aircraft at Western Sydney International airport after completing a series of landing and take-off runs during daylight, dusk and evening conditions yesterday. The trial comes ahead of the introduction of larger passenger planes which are scheduled to begin using the runway from late 2026. The airport will open with one runway and will be able to cater for up to ten million passengers a year from day one of operations. Weather warnings in WA, SA and NT Let\u2019s take a look at some of the weather warnings across the country today. In Western Australia, a severe weather warning for damaging winds is in place for much of the south coast. Damaging winds around 60-70km/h with peak gusts around 100km/h are likely along the coastal fringe. The system is expected to be windier than typical and unusual for this time of year, the Bureau says. There is also a separate coastal hazard warning for damaging surf conditions. In South Australia, a severe weather warning for damaging winds is in place for western parts of the state today. The risk is expected to ease by the mid to late afternoon. Locations which may be affected include Ceduna, Wudinna, Maralinga, Cook, Nullarbor and Streaky Bay. And in the Northern Territory, a severe heatwave warning remains in place for Daly and the Tiwi Districts. Maximum temperatures in the high thirties to low forties are forecast. Severe heatwave conditions are set to persist until at least early next week in Daly. Josh Lees said rally organisers were asking those attending not to bring Hezbollah flags, because \u201cthey could be deemed illegal, and because we don\u2019t want people to face arrest or legal troubles.\u201d I personally would not fly that flag, I don\u2019t politically agree with Hezbollah, but we defend people\u2019s right to hold pieces of cloth, yes, and I don\u2019t think that the way it\u2019s being talked about is at all reasonable in the media. As I said, there\u2019s no discussion of banning the Israeli flag, whereas that is a state that\u2019s actually carried out far greater acts of terrorism and is right now starting another war on Lebanon, the fourth invasion of Lebanon in Israel\u2019s history. So we should have some perspective [when] we\u2019re talking about Hezbollah and flags, about what\u2019s really going on. For more on this topic, you can read our explainer from Tory Shepherd below: Josh Lees, a member of the Palestine Action Group Sydney, also spoke with ABC RN about the planned pro-Palestine rally in Sydney, scheduled for Sunday. He said the group would be going ahead with the protest \u201cregardless of what happens in the court\u201d. He also said the event planned on Monday 7 October would be \u201ca small candlelight vigil to commemorate those that have been killed over the past year\u201d. It\u2019s mainly about the chance for Palestinian and Lebanese people to come and grieve for the thousands of people who have died, and for their loved ones \u2026 Host Patricia Karvelas asked whether victims of the 7 October Hamas attack would also be recognised at the vigil. Lees said people were welcome to mourn whoever they want: October 7 is also when the genocide in Gaza began. That\u2019s when Israeli leaders proclaimed their intention to go in and level Gaza, to starve it, to bomb it to hell. So this is also the date that marks the beginning of the genocide in Gaza. And you know, I wonder if you are putting the same question to those organising memorials for the Israeli victims of October 7, are you demanding that they mourn the 42,000 dead Palestinians? Marles weighs in on pro-Palestine protest planned in Sydney The deputy prime minister was also asked about comments from the PM yesterday, that 7 October is \u201cnot a time for demonstrations to occur.\u201d Richard Marles said he \u201ccondemn[s] in the strongest possible terms\u201d anyone \u201cseeking to protest in support of terrorist organisations\u201d, including Hezbollah and Hamas. I think it\u2019s also worth observing that October 7 is the anniversary of a tragic and solemn day, a day on which innocent people lost their lives, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust. It is a moment to commemorate that, and to commemorate that with all the solemnity which is appropriate for that occasion \u2026 There are laws applied that will apply here as well. And the authorities, principally the state authorities who implemented these laws, are clearly acting as we speak. Now, that\u2019s where we\u2019re at at this moment. The Australia Palestine Advocacy Network president, Nasser Mashni, previously said the protests were essential \u201cexpressions of solidarity\u201d for communities in Australia looking to oppose Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza and Lebanon. Marles calls for diplomacy to address growing violence in Middle East Richard Marles continued, clarifying his stance to ABC RN and saying it was \u201ccompletely appropriate\u201d to call for diplomacy: Countries have a right to defend themselves. No one is suggesting anything different to that, and we have been consistent about Israel\u2019s right to defend itself from the outset. The engagement in one\u2019s own defence, it is important that that is done proportionately, and that is because we do not want to see steps taken which give rise to an escalation in this conflict, and that is exactly why we condemn the actions of Iran in firing these missiles. That said, it is really important that we \u2013 as a member of the international community \u2013 are articulating in the strongest possible voice the need for diplomacy to be engaged in to see it into the hostilities. And we\u2019re doing that as well, and that\u2019s that\u2019s completely appropriate. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, is speaking with ABC RN from New Zealand where he is meeting with regional counterparts. Asked about the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East, and whether \u201cceasefire negotiations in Gaza are now dead\u201d, Marles said the \u201ccontinued violence in the Middle East is obviously giving rise to enormous threat to civilian life\u201d. I think the international community is desperate to see an end to this violence, and certainly that\u2019s how we\u2019re exercising our international voice. Marles was asked if he agrees with US president Joe Biden, that the IDF should respond with a proportional response. He responded that Israel has been the subject of attacks from Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas, and \u201cwe condemn those attacks in the strongest possible terms\u201d. He said: Israel has a right to defend itself. Every country has a right to defend itself, and to do so in a proportionate way. That said, we are calling for a ceasefire, along with the United States, along with other members of the international community. The continued violence in the Middle East is giving rise to \u2026 unacceptable numbers of civilian lives lost, and the ongoing violence is a threat to civilian life. And we, along with international community, urge an end to this. Marles said that \u201cthis is the moment for diplomacy\u201d and \u201cwe need to see every effort being made to try and bring about an end to the hostilities in the Middle East, because because of the extraordinary loss of civil in life that we\u2019ve seen as a result of this.\u201d Palestine advocate says planned protests \u2018not provocative\u2019 Nasser Mashni, president of the Australian Palestine Advocacy Network, spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier and was asked about comments from the prime minister yesterday that 7 October was \u201cnot a time for demonstrations to occur\u201d. A pro-Palestine protest is planned for 6 October in Sydney and a vigil planned for 7 October \u2013 but NSW police have applied to the state\u2019s supreme court to attempt to prevent these from going ahead. Mashni said he doesn\u2019t accept a rally would be \u201cprovocative\u201d: We have [been protesting for] 51 weeks in a row, [and it\u2019s been] absolutely peaceful. Millions of Australians have come out, it\u2019s not provocative at all. What\u2019s provocative is the fact that our government isn\u2019t listening to tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of Australians, who have signed petitions, called their MPs, have done everything they\u2019re supposed to do within this democratic framework to say \u2018enough\u2019 \u2026 If my neighbour was beating his dog I can\u2019t keep saying [something]. At some point I\u2019m compelled to jump the fence and grab his hand. Asked about the supreme court decision, Mashni said he has \u201cfaith in our judicial system\u201d. A new report from the Victorian coroners court shows that 547 Victorians died from overdose last year. This is close to the 550 overdose deaths recorded in 2022, which marked the highest annual number recorded in the past decade. Some key findings included in the report include: Men are on average twice as likely as women to die from overdose, and people aged between 35 and 54 are most at risk. Metropolitan Melbourne accounts for approximately three-quarters of overdose deaths. A majority (71.5%) of overdose deaths involved multiple drugs in 2023. The five top contributing drugs to overdose deaths were diazepam (213 deaths), heroin (204 deaths), methamphetamine (164 deaths), alcohol (153 deaths) and pregabalin (78 deaths). From 2014\u201323 the proportion of Victorian overdose deaths involving illegal drugs increased, from 41.3% in 2014 to 59% in 2023. Most overdose deaths are unintentional. In 2023, 395 of the 547 overdose deaths were unintentional, 114 were intentional and in 38 cases intent was unable to be determined based on the evidence available at the time of coding. The Victorian state coroner, John Cain, said the overdose deaths were \u201cpreventable\u201d and that \u201cwe must strengthen our public health response and increase access to supports and treatment\u201d. Drug-related harms are complex and are driven by a variety of factors including changes in drug use, availability and regulation. That is why coronial data is so integral to understanding how best to target resources and save lives. Lifeline: 13 11 14 Alcohol and drug hotline: 1800 250 015 Advocates concerned aged care homes not meeting direct care targets Cota Australia, a leading advocacy group for older people, says it is concerned by new data showing six out of 10 aged care homes are falling short on their mandatory minutes of direct care and registered nurse targets. Data from April to June, released today, shows many aged care homes are failing to meet their direct care targets. Chief executive Patricia Sparrow said increasing the mandatory minutes of care was a key recommendation of the royal commission into aged care, and a \u201csubstantial\u201d piece of reform last year. The fact that too many older people are still not getting the mandated minutes of care is a real concern \u2026 Basic direct care isn\u2019t a \u2018nice to have\u2019, it\u2019s crucial and the absolute minimum we should expect for older Australians in aged care. Care minutes are the amount of direct care people in residential care receive from RN, enrolled nurses and nursing assistants. This month aged care providers are expected to increase their care minutes to an average of 215 minutes per resident, per day, including at least 44 minutes of care provided by a registered nurse. Sparrow said it was especially concerning compliance rates in for-profit aged care homes are significantly lower than those run by not-for-profit providers \u2013 only 23% of for-profit providers met both their RN and total care minutes in the quarter. High fire danger rating for Queensland today In Queensland today, the fire danger rating is sitting at high in most parts of the state. The high fire danger rating means there is a heightened risk of fire, with people urged to stay alert in their area. The fire department said: If you had plans to grind, slash or mow today please reconsider \u2026 If work needs to happen today, be alert and make sure you have water on hand to extinguish any spot fires. And happy Thursday \u2013 many thanks to Martin for kicking things off for us. I\u2019m Emily Wind, and I\u2019ll be taking you through our rolling coverage for most of today. If you have any thoughts, tips or feedback, you can reach out via X, @emilywindwrites, or send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. Let\u2019s go. Impromptu haka leaves Jahrome Hughes with a tear in his eye after Dally M An emotional Jahrome Hughes has admitted he had a tear in his eye after Melbourne teammates launched into a haka to honour his Dally M Medal, AAP reports. In scenes reminiscent of fellow New Zealander Roger Tuivasa-Sheck\u2019s win in 2018, Melbourne winger Will Warbrick took over the Dally Ms to celebrate Hughes\u2019 award. After holding off James Tedesco by one vote and landing the first big individual honour of his career, Hughes watched as Warbrick launched into a haka alongside Storm second-rower Eliesa Katoa and Canberra prop Joseph Tapine. \u201cThat meant a lot,\u201d Hughes said. To see that brought a tear to my eye. For them to do that is truly special. For myself, my culture and family, it just topped off an awesome night. For more on the awards read our full report: Queensland premier Steven Miles and opposition leader David Crisafulli will lock horns in an election debate as Queenslanders prepare to head to the polls, AAP reports. The top-job hopefuls will go head-to-head on the Nine Network at 7.30pm (AEST) in Brisbane tonight before a second debate at the Queensland Media Club 10 days before the election. Both leaders kicked off their campaigns in regional centres where key issues such as cost-of-living, health, housing and crime are pertinent. Polls are pointing to a change of government on 26 October, with the Liberal National party leading 56% to 46% on a two-party preferred basis. The premier and senior ministers announced on day two of the campaign that Labor would establish a state-wide publicly-owned energy retailer if re-elected. The retailer would use existing infrastructure and be up and running within 12 months, the premier said. Crisafulli pledged $30m towards an agriculture innovation fund to attract research opportunities to improve the sector. The Albanese government is looking at cracking down on \u201cdodgy discounts\u201d by supermarkets who reduce product sizes but maintain or increase prices as part of its campaign against misleading and deceptive pricing in the sector. The government will consult on changes to strengthen the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission\u2019s Price Unit Code, which requires larger supermarkets and grocers to provide cost per unit breakdowns on price tags within stores and online. The code means, for example, price tags for laundry detergents are broken down by cost per litre to allow consumers to compare products. Fresh produce price tags must also show price per kilogram or grams. The government announced it would consult on the following changes: Improving readability and visibility of unit pricing in stores, Addressing inconsistent use of units of measure across supermarkets, Whether to expand the scope of retailers covered by the code, More specific prominence and legibility requirements, and Improving the use of unit pricing in cross-retailer price comparisons. The ACCC will also be funded to launch a consumer awareness campaign on how unit pricing can help Australians get better deals. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese said \u201ctackling \u2018shrinkflation\u2019 through stronger unit pricing and new penalties is part of our plan to get a better deal for Australians\u201d. We are also making changes to make sure the ACCC is a tough cop on the beat, while also encouraging more competition and making sure there are significant consequences for supermarkets who do the wrong thing. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it\u2019ll be Emily Wind with the main action. Annual rent increases for houses have hit multi-year lows in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide, suggesting a relentless stretch of rising rents may have peaked, a new report has found. Renters are still feeling the pinch from record high prices but the data from Domain revealed the lowest September quarter growth rate since 2019 for houses and 2020 for units. Speaking of cost-of-living issues, the Albanese government is looking to crack down on shrinkflation, the phenomenon where items in your shopping basked get smaller while staying the same price. More on that in a few minutes. Peter Cain, the ACT\u2019s shadow attorney general, has apologised \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d for a 2002 workbook he wrote which paints an ahistorically rosy picture of how Christian settlers helped First Nations peoples. Queensland\u2019s premier, Steven Miles, will promise his state\u2019s households they will always have the cheapest power prices of all mainland states in the national electricity market if Labor is elected this month. He will announce a plan today to use the firm to create an \u201cenergy price guarantee\u201d that Queensland household bills would remain the lowest outside Western Australia. Later he faces off against his LNP rival David Crisafulli in a televised debate.",

NSW police this week launched supreme court action to have both events deemed unlawful, citing concerns over expected crowd size and potential hazards including \u201cplanter boxes\u201d at Town Hall. But after a hearing on Thursday, police and protesters agreed the events could proceed \u2013 with alterations. The protest on 6 October has been allowed after organisers made changes to the route which will now start at Hyde Park. The 7 October event will be a standing vigil, which does not require a so-called \u201cform 1\u201d application that is needed for protests. Speaking on the steps of the NSW supreme court, Amal Naser of the Palestine Action Group (PAG) said the rally organisers had \u201cgot what they wanted\u201d. Naser said it was \u201ca good moment for democratic rights as well as the fight for Palestinian liberation\u201d. \u201cWe ultimately got everything we wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had a strong case and we were going to win anyway.

Police also raised issues with the route proposed for the rally, claiming it would bring protesters into close proximity of the Great Synagogue on Elizabeth Street in Sydney. But Naser claimed outside court that the initial route was one proposed by police on Tuesday and PAG had simply agreed to it. There was no indication during negotiations that police had an issue with it, Naser said. Police had also initially cited concerns over expected crowd size and potential hazards including \u201cplanter boxes\u201d at Town Hall before expanding on those concerns in court. On Thursday afternoon, organisers told the supreme court they had withdrawn their application for a planned authorised public assembly on Monday. Organisers later clarified they did not need to lodge a form 1 application once they realised it was not required for a standing vigil. Organisers also agreed to a different route on Sunday which avoids the section of Elizabeth Street the synagogue is on. The assistant commissioner Peter McKenna earlier told the court the force was concerned there was a \u201cmore aggressive feeling\u201d at last weekend\u2019s rally in Sydney after the expansion of the Middle East conflict and Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon. \u201cWe are concerned there will be a much larger crowd [now],\u201d he said in court. The assistant commissioner alleged Sunday\u2019s rally saw people carrying \u201cprohibited items\u201d \u2013 namely Hezbollah flags \u2013 and he said police had deployed capsicum spray when surrounded by a group of men. McKenna disputed the person pepper-sprayed was 13 years old. The police\u2019s barrister, Lachlan Gyles SC, acknowledged that previous rallies held over the past 12 months in Sydney had occurred \u201cin a way that has not been a concern in terms of public order, breaches of the peace and public safety\u201d. But this week could involve \u201cdifferent types of participants \u2026 who could be hostile to the cause and be there to provoke reactions\u201d, he told the court. Joshua Lees from the Palestine Action Group told the court there had been \u201ca big spike\u201d in protest numbers last Sunday and he expected a similar crowd this weekend. He said a realistic estimate was 5,000 people \u2013 but there had been much larger rallies over the past year. Lees said organisers had urged anyone attending this weekend \u201cnot to bring [prohibited] flags or symbols\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to get in trouble with the law. We don\u2019t want that at our protests.\u201d Lees said marshals last Sunday had asked anyone with such materials \u201cto put them away\u201d. The judge on Thursday noted there had been significant \u201chostilities in the territory of Lebanon from Israel that had caused some exacerbation of tensions and concerns amongst a range of communities in Australia\u201d. Before the hearing, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said a pro-Palestine event on 7 October \u2013 the anniversary of the Hamas attacks in Israel \u2013 would be \u201cseen as incredibly provocative\u201d, adding he was \u201cworried about social cohesion\u201d. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said on Thursday that he feared the vigil could turn into a major protest and \u201cthat would cause huge harm to social harmony in NSW and it\u2019s reasonable for the government and the police to try to prevent [that]\u201d. But Naser said these concerns were just attempts at \u201crepressing dissent\u201d and that it was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d. \u201cThere has been ongoing attacks on Palestinian protests since we started this movement last year in October, they\u2019ve attempted to shut down our rallies on numerous occasions. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously very, very terrified that the masses are denouncing this genocide and denouncing Australian complicity in this genocide, and they want to repress all forms of dissent, and it\u2019s \u2026 absolutely ridiculous.\u201d The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said on Thursday that 7 October marked one year since the greatest loss of Jewish lives in a single day since the Holocaust and it was not a time for protest. \u201cIt\u2019s a day of grieving and a day of remembrance and should be honoured,\u201d she told reporters.

      "body": "<p>In an arena in the southern French village of Raph\u00e8le-l\u00e8s-Arles on a torpidly hot July afternoon, a young black bull paws the floor next to the exit door. Eight <em>raseteurs</em> \u2013 the white-clad runners whose job is to seize tokens fixed to the animal \u2013 yell to get its attention. This is an event dedicated to working out if these uncastrated juveniles have the nasty streak needed to become stars of <em>course camarguaise</em>, the non-fatal sport that is the cousin of bullfighting.</p> <p>Much of the Camargue, the delta region at the terminus of the Rh\u00f4ne river, is crazy about anything with two horns, a nose-ring and a problem with the colour red. Lighter and more fleet-footed than its Iberian counterpart, with upright, lyre-shaped horns, the Camargue bull is lionised in the sports sections of local newspapers and commemorated with statues at the entrance to many villages<em>.</em></p> <p>\u201cWe have a special relationship with the bull that is hard to explain\u201d, says Alexis Chabriol, president of the Youth Union of Provence and Languedoc for the Defense of Our Traditions. \u201cFor me, when I capture a bull, it\u2019s not to take a photo for the social networks. It\u2019s not to do it any harm. It\u2019s to have this contact with the bull, this inexplicable frisson. It\u2019s something we really have deep inside.\u201d</p> <p>Bull aficionados such as Chabriol believe they are keeping alive not so much a sport as an art. The likes of Picasso, Lorca and Hemingway saw these activities as part of a Mediterranean continuity that stretches back to ancient times.</p>    <p>A bull helped birth the continent itself, according to myth: Zeus took the form of one to impregnate the Phoenician princess, Europa; their son was the Cretan king Minos, who had the labyrinth that housed the minotaur built.</p> <p>In the confrontation between, and enmeshing of, man and bull, Picasso saw the essence of the artistic struggle with nature: \u201cIf all the ways I have been along were marked on a map and joined up with a line, it might represent a minotaur,\u201d he said in 1960. </p> <p>But the south of France\u2019s \u201ctaurine culture\u201d \u2013 <em>la bouvino</em>, as it\u2019s referred to in Proven\u00e7al \u2013 is as much on the defensive as the bull inside the Raph\u00e8le-l\u00e8s-Arles arena, who is stubbornly sticking to his safe space by the bolted door.</p> <p>In recent years, ranchers have faced increasingly vocal attacks from animal rights activists, in large part focused on the profession\u2019s association with the deadlier <em>corrida</em><em> \u2013</em> bullfighting \u2013 which still takes place in nearby Arles, N\u00eemes, B\u00e9ziers and other municipalities. There is growing pressure to reform practices the ranchers say are essential, such as branding by hot iron and ear-tagging.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Picasso and Hemingway saw these activities as part of a Mediterranean continuity that stretches back to ancient times</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The sport is in outwardly decent health, with audiences actually increasing during the pandemic period and afterwards, to about 400,000 spectators a year by 2023. But it is increasingly corralled into a rural hinterland, which now votes mostly Rassemblement National, and alienated from the urban decision-making enclaves from which much animal rights activism emerges. The nearest major city, Montpellier, destroyed its last arena in 1968.</p> <p>The financial state of many arenas and <em>manades</em> (ranches) is brittle, with both heavily reliant on volunteers to function. Respect for the supposed star attraction, meanwhile, is declining. Spectators to the <em>abrivados</em>, the horse-flanked processions down to the arenas that precede bull-running, no longer know how to behave, says Chabriol. They often throw fireworks or manhandle the bulls, increasing the number of accidents.</p> <p>This is causing tensions with the insurers of these events, making them harder to organise, which in turn hits the <em>manades</em>\u2019 bank balances. \u201cThe new generation are coming to these traditional events more for the sensationalist side rather than because it\u2019s really their passion,\u201d says Chabriol. The way out of the quagmire, he reckons, is to head back to the past. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go into reverse, stop all that, and go back to the essential.\u201d</p>    <p>But embrace history too tightly and it leads to stagnation, as the ranchers here know full well from their cattle breeding. The Camargue folk customs in their present form are in fact not so very ancient: it was in the early 20th century that its \u201cinventor\u201d, Folco de Baroncelli, re-established dilapidated cattle farming customs dating back to the middle ages and codified haphazardly organised games in local arenas that were becoming a target for republican reformists. Now <em>la bouvino</em>\u2019s new challenge is to redefine itself all over again.</p> <p>\u201cToday, I see it as a challenge to live up to what he did. But it\u2019s hard because he set the bar so high,\u201d says B\u00e9renger Aubanel, De Baroncelli\u2019s great-grandson and co-head of the Aubanel-Baroncelli <em>manade</em>. We are sitting in what was once De Baroncelli\u2019s front room in a house in Le Cailar, a village surrounded by the best pastures in the Camargue. Around us is the paraphernalia of the De Baroncelli legend: photographs of him with Buffalo Bill at the latter\u2019s travelling roadshow, stylised tauromachy prints by the artist Hermann-Paul, the spurred tips of bull-herding tridents, a dowdy stuffed flamingo.</p> <p>Aubanel himself is a living example of the need to evolve. He splits his time, working at the <em>manade</em> and also an IT director for Groupe RG, a manufacturer of personal protective equipment. It\u2019s one answer to the financial tightrope many Camargue ranchers are now walking: only his brother and son, not him, draw a salary from the <em>manade</em>.</p> <p>Another modern business strategy with a taurine ring could be key to revitalising the Camargue traditions: branding. Since 2018, major Camargue figures have mounted a campaign to have the region\u2019s bull-ranching traditions recognised by Unesco on its Intangible Cultural Heritage list.</p> <p>Claire Mailhan has been leading the Unesco campaign that will hopefully result in greater recognition and funding. An initial attempt, which made a case based solely on the <em>course camarguaise</em>, was rejected; it\u2019s hard not to suspect that the close proximity to the inflammatory practice of Spanish bullfighting, which was refused Unesco classification in 2020, was a factor. Now her association is addressing this image problem with a new dossier that emphasises bull-ranching\u2019s role in supporting the wider ecosystem.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that our activities and our traditions impact an extensive, semi-wild farming area allows us to maintain that environment,\u201d Mailhan says, over a coffee in a business park just outside N\u00eemes. \u201cWe\u2019re responsible for the upkeep of open spaces. We\u2019re involved in the struggle against the rising saltwater. It allows us to maintain biodiversity in the delta and beyond, because the project doesn\u2019t just concern the Rh\u00f4ne\u2019s two branches.\u201d As well as the bull-related heritage, her team are also highlighting other traditional activities in the region, such as thatching and saddle-making.</p>    <p>According to Mailhan, there is a general \u201cpanic\u201d about how to represent the interests of the taurine community. Question marks remain about how effectively current political structures \u2013 including the special Camargue committee at the French parliament \u2013 are representing the interests of a region historically neglected by Paris.

This is despite historically important female <em>manadiers</em><em> </em>(ranchers) such as Fanfonne Guillierme, who died in 1989 and was still riding in her 80s, as well as the increasing number of women, like Mailhan, shepherding from horseback in the bull pastures.</p> <p>There has even been one recent attempt to get women bull-running.

But former <em>raseteur</em> Richard Ribeira believed it was possible if women were trained separately, with bulls and cows of appropriate size and aggression. So at the start of 2020, he launched a dedicated school for women <em>raseteurs</em> in the village of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Maguelone, just south of Montpellier. Unfortunately, Covid stopped it in its tracks, and only half of its 10 pupils wanted to continue afterwards. What really killed it, Ribeira thinks, was a general lack of belief in the concept: \u201c[The taurine world] was being criticised because there was nothing for women there.

Chabriol is also critical of the establishment who govern bull-running, believing they are letting it slide into decline. The breeding stock of the Camargue race is so limited now, he says, that it is increasingly difficult to find high-quality bulls for competition.

      "bodyText": "In an arena in the southern French village of Raph\u00e8le-l\u00e8s-Arles on a torpidly hot July afternoon, a young black bull paws the floor next to the exit door. Eight raseteurs \u2013 the white-clad runners whose job is to seize tokens fixed to the animal \u2013 yell to get its attention. This is an event dedicated to working out if these uncastrated juveniles have the nasty streak needed to become stars of course camarguaise, the non-fatal sport that is the cousin of bullfighting. Much of the Camargue, the delta region at the terminus of the Rh\u00f4ne river, is crazy about anything with two horns, a nose-ring and a problem with the colour red. Lighter and more fleet-footed than its Iberian counterpart, with upright, lyre-shaped horns, the Camargue bull is lionised in the sports sections of local newspapers and commemorated with statues at the entrance to many villages. \u201cWe have a special relationship with the bull that is hard to explain\u201d, says Alexis Chabriol, president of the Youth Union of Provence and Languedoc for the Defense of Our Traditions. \u201cFor me, when I capture a bull, it\u2019s not to take a photo for the social networks. It\u2019s not to do it any harm. It\u2019s to have this contact with the bull, this inexplicable frisson. It\u2019s something we really have deep inside.\u201d Bull aficionados such as Chabriol believe they are keeping alive not so much a sport as an art. The likes of Picasso, Lorca and Hemingway saw these activities as part of a Mediterranean continuity that stretches back to ancient times. A bull helped birth the continent itself, according to myth: Zeus took the form of one to impregnate the Phoenician princess, Europa; their son was the Cretan king Minos, who had the labyrinth that housed the minotaur built. In the confrontation between, and enmeshing of, man and bull, Picasso saw the essence of the artistic struggle with nature: \u201cIf all the ways I have been along were marked on a map and joined up with a line, it might represent a minotaur,\u201d he said in 1960. But the south of France\u2019s \u201ctaurine culture\u201d \u2013 la bouvino, as it\u2019s referred to in Proven\u00e7al \u2013 is as much on the defensive as the bull inside the Raph\u00e8le-l\u00e8s-Arles arena, who is stubbornly sticking to his safe space by the bolted door. In recent years, ranchers have faced increasingly vocal attacks from animal rights activists, in large part focused on the profession\u2019s association with the deadlier corrida \u2013 bullfighting \u2013 which still takes place in nearby Arles, N\u00eemes, B\u00e9ziers and other municipalities. There is growing pressure to reform practices the ranchers say are essential, such as branding by hot iron and ear-tagging. The sport is in outwardly decent health, with audiences actually increasing during the pandemic period and afterwards, to about 400,000 spectators a year by 2023. But it is increasingly corralled into a rural hinterland, which now votes mostly Rassemblement National, and alienated from the urban decision-making enclaves from which much animal rights activism emerges. The nearest major city, Montpellier, destroyed its last arena in 1968. The financial state of many arenas and manades (ranches) is brittle, with both heavily reliant on volunteers to function. Respect for the supposed star attraction, meanwhile, is declining. Spectators to the abrivados, the horse-flanked processions down to the arenas that precede bull-running, no longer know how to behave, says Chabriol. They often throw fireworks or manhandle the bulls, increasing the number of accidents. This is causing tensions with the insurers of these events, making them harder to organise, which in turn hits the manades\u2019 bank balances. \u201cThe new generation are coming to these traditional events more for the sensationalist side rather than because it\u2019s really their passion,\u201d says Chabriol. The way out of the quagmire, he reckons, is to head back to the past. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go into reverse, stop all that, and go back to the essential.\u201d But embrace history too tightly and it leads to stagnation, as the ranchers here know full well from their cattle breeding. The Camargue folk customs in their present form are in fact not so very ancient: it was in the early 20th century that its \u201cinventor\u201d, Folco de Baroncelli, re-established dilapidated cattle farming customs dating back to the middle ages and codified haphazardly organised games in local arenas that were becoming a target for republican reformists. Now la bouvino\u2019s new challenge is to redefine itself all over again. \u201cToday, I see it as a challenge to live up to what he did. But it\u2019s hard because he set the bar so high,\u201d says B\u00e9renger Aubanel, De Baroncelli\u2019s great-grandson and co-head of the Aubanel-Baroncelli manade. We are sitting in what was once De Baroncelli\u2019s front room in a house in Le Cailar, a village surrounded by the best pastures in the Camargue. Around us is the paraphernalia of the De Baroncelli legend: photographs of him with Buffalo Bill at the latter\u2019s travelling roadshow, stylised tauromachy prints by the artist Hermann-Paul, the spurred tips of bull-herding tridents, a dowdy stuffed flamingo. Aubanel himself is a living example of the need to evolve. He splits his time, working at the manade and also an IT director for Groupe RG, a manufacturer of personal protective equipment. It\u2019s one answer to the financial tightrope many Camargue ranchers are now walking: only his brother and son, not him, draw a salary from the manade. Another modern business strategy with a taurine ring could be key to revitalising the Camargue traditions: branding. Since 2018, major Camargue figures have mounted a campaign to have the region\u2019s bull-ranching traditions recognised by Unesco on its Intangible Cultural Heritage list. Claire Mailhan has been leading the Unesco campaign that will hopefully result in greater recognition and funding. An initial attempt, which made a case based solely on the course camarguaise, was rejected; it\u2019s hard not to suspect that the close proximity to the inflammatory practice of Spanish bullfighting, which was refused Unesco classification in 2020, was a factor. Now her association is addressing this image problem with a new dossier that emphasises bull-ranching\u2019s role in supporting the wider ecosystem. \u201cThe fact that our activities and our traditions impact an extensive, semi-wild farming area allows us to maintain that environment,\u201d Mailhan says, over a coffee in a business park just outside N\u00eemes. \u201cWe\u2019re responsible for the upkeep of open spaces. We\u2019re involved in the struggle against the rising saltwater. It allows us to maintain biodiversity in the delta and beyond, because the project doesn\u2019t just concern the Rh\u00f4ne\u2019s two branches.\u201d As well as the bull-related heritage, her team are also highlighting other traditional activities in the region, such as thatching and saddle-making. According to Mailhan, there is a general \u201cpanic\u201d about how to represent the interests of the taurine community. Question marks remain about how effectively current political structures \u2013 including the special Camargue committee at the French parliament \u2013 are representing the interests of a region historically neglected by Paris. Both Mailhan and Chabriol speak of the need to better educate new generations in the meaning of these traditions in order to revitalise them. This outreach work already takes place, but largely in local villages where the amount of new converts is limited. Women are one obvious recruiting demographic for la bouvino, but there is ambivalence on this score in what remains a macho and cloistered milieu. It\u2019s still the case that only men are admitted to the Nacioun Gardiano, the ceremonial organisation for the Camargue\u2019s gardiens, or herders, created by De Baroncelli in 1904. This is despite historically important female manadiers (ranchers) such as Fanfonne Guillierme, who died in 1989 and was still riding in her 80s, as well as the increasing number of women, like Mailhan, shepherding from horseback in the bull pastures. There has even been one recent attempt to get women bull-running. Some, including Mailhan, question that they are physiologically suited to this perilous sport, in which gorings are frequent and fatalities not uncommon. But former raseteur Richard Ribeira believed it was possible if women were trained separately, with bulls and cows of appropriate size and aggression. So at the start of 2020, he launched a dedicated school for women raseteurs in the village of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Maguelone, just south of Montpellier. Unfortunately, Covid stopped it in its tracks, and only half of its 10 pupils wanted to continue afterwards. What really killed it, Ribeira thinks, was a general lack of belief in the concept: \u201c[The taurine world] was being criticised because there was nothing for women there. But as soon as we did something, no one supported it.\u201d Ribeira says the sport\u2019s organising body, the French Federation of Course Camarguaise (FFCC), originally insisted he set up a mixed, not a women-only school. He believes they thought it would bring them too much trouble for too little payoff. (The current FFCC administration were not involved and say they support women\u2019s development within the sport.) Chabriol is also critical of the establishment who govern bull-running, believing they are letting it slide into decline.

Their lovingly observed 1974 movie is closer in time to the 1931 James Whale/Boris Karloff classic \u2013 whose lab equipment props Brooks actually re-used \u2013 than we are now to this film. In some ways it can now be considered not as satire or spoof, but a continuation of the Frankenstein genre, a connoisseur development or theme-variation not so far removed from the Hammer or Warhol riffs, and a whole lot more successful and intuitive than Kenneth Branagh\u2019s deadly serious, deadly dull treatment from 1994 with Robert De Niro as the creature. Interestingly, though Wilder said that Young Frankenstein is based on the Karloff classic and its three sequels, the opening credits resoundingly declare that it is based on the Mary Shelley novel. A tongue-in-cheek joke, of course, but true in its way.</p> <p>We begin the action in the present day where Wilder plays Dr Frederick Frankenstein, a distinguished neurophysiologist, deeply embarrassed by the crazy theories of his grandfather Victor Frankenstein, so much so that he insists on pronouncing his own name \u201cFronk\u2013en\u2013steen\u201d to distinguish himself from his evil ancestor. But then he receives a legal package containing documents conferring on him the title to Castle Frankenstein in Transylvania (evidently a German-speaking area of Hungary). After bidding farewell to his alluring yet sex-averse fiancee Elizabeth (a wonderfully wisecracking Madeline Kahn), Frederick arrives in the heart of Old Europe, via train from New York, to be greeted at the station by Igor (pronounced \u201cEye-gor\u201d), the grandson of his grandfather\u2019s old manservant, played by Marty Feldman, in colossal Groucho Marx mode.

It is played by Peter Boyle as aggressive and threatening, but possessed of a poignantly vulnerable and sensitive side. Frederick discovers that by playing a sweet tune on a violin, he can soothe the creature, who goes into a fey, wide-eyed, childlike trance, darting about as if catching imaginary fireflies; it is a very funny moment. </p> <p>There is a lot of really unsubtle material (before revisiting this, I\u2019d actually forgotten about the penis-size gags) and it comes close to Carry On mode for a line where Inga simperingly misunderstands Frederick exclaiming about the \u201cbig knockers\u201d on the door of Castle Frankenstein.

Hailing from a \u201crattled, scratching, always-in-debt\u201d family, Kismet is a&nbsp;gothy and gifted teenager, destined for&nbsp;greatness beyond the town\u2019s limits, at least as far as her sugar beet hauler mother, Crystal, is concerned. Crystal\u2019s aspirations are dashed when Kismet succumbs to the allures of troubled jock-with-a-heart Gary Geist. He\u2019s the&nbsp;son of the wealthiest landowning family around; indeed, the Geists own&nbsp;the farm on which Crystal works.&nbsp;Gary haphazardly proposes to&nbsp;Kismet&nbsp;in a silly set piece involving an errant champagne cork. Against her&nbsp;better judgment, mesmerised by&nbsp;his inscrutable vulnerability, Kismet accepts.</p> <p>Kismet finds herself a conflicted and reluctant bride, not only due to the&nbsp;presence of her mother-in-law, high-pitched Winnie Geist, but also because of the intractable \u201cpsychic magnetism\u201d she feels towards nerdy Hugo. Much of the central act of the novel focuses on Kismet\u2019s attempts to&nbsp;quiet the unease she feels as a new member of the Geist household, and her tortured attempts to make her marriage work. Throughout, Kismet\u2019s reading of Madame Bovary \u2013 a present from Hugo \u2013 is comically symbolic.</p> <p>It\u2019s not only Kismet and Gary\u2019s relationship that is on the rocks: Crystal\u2019s long-term partner, Martin, is an itinerant theatre arts teacher whose self-absorption and expensive tastes are in sharp contrast with Crystal\u2019s frugality and vaunted selflessness. Martin\u2019s fiscal carelessness reaches outlandish proportions when he seemingly absconds with the local church\u2019s renovation fund, leaving innocent Crystal and Kismet as town pariahs.</p> <p>Within this gossipy and garrulous text, locals debate Crystal\u2019s culpability in fevered whispers and yelps. But there are even bigger debates among the residents: ideological discussion about the nature of landownership, which is&nbsp;pertinent as many of the characters have First Nations heritage; and heated conversation about the use of pesticides and their deleterious effect on the town\u2019s richly described wildlife.</p> <p>With its environmental concerns, its realist commitment to showcasing the existential threats faced by contemporary farmers, and its gentle send-up of parochialism, the novel seemed to me a curious mashup of The&nbsp;Archers and Schitt\u2019s Creek. Like both, it is packed to bursting with peripheral characters, from Hugo\u2019s feral little sisters, Trudy and Gerta, to&nbsp;the sinister priest Father Flirty, who&nbsp;\u201cwas anything but\u201d. Subplots are&nbsp;plentiful, too, most notably an accident involving Gary and his sporty stooges, \u201ca thing nobody wants to talk about or think about\u201d.</p> <p>Arguably, there\u2019s a bit too much going on here, and the reader isn\u2019t given much help to discern what really matters, or indeed what we might need to dwell on, as the book sprints toward its rather skittish and unsatisfying denouement. Some pivotal scenes are so protracted and overblown that the tension slackens, while the crowded design and lurching plotting doesn\u2019t allow for&nbsp;sufficiently engaging character growth to pull the reader through.</p> <p>But the narrative voice is the redeeming quality. It takes a while for the reader to settle into storytelling as tonally mixed as Kismet\u2019s quilt, but Erdrich\u2019s achievement is pretty remarkable: a&nbsp;voice with brio and lightness that wends and weaves, as the titular river does, between modes and moods. It\u2019s unpredictable and multifaceted, whether sharing an anecdote about Gary taking questionable dick pics or revelling in the high camp of book group blow-ups about Eat, Pray, Love.

Over the summer, the salary cap <a href=\"https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/nhl-boosts-salary-cap-to-88-million-for-2024-25-season-1.2132168\">went up</a> and the unveiling of the new Fanatics jerseys went well.

The NHL series, filmed throughout the 2023-24 season is along the same lines, a never-before-seen look at the sport\u2019s biggest names, on and off the ice. \u201cThis generation of NHL superstars are modern day gladiators unlike anything ever seen before, with big personalities and even bigger playmakers, and we have the perfect partners to capture that energy for an unparalleled sports docuseries,\u201d the NHL\u2019s chief content officer, Steve Mayer, <a href=\"https://www.nhl.com/news/prime-video-announces-nhl-docuseries-chronicling-life-on-and-off-ice\">said in the spring</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w0WJTua0n4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-w0WJTua0n4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Indeed, expectations are high for Faceoff. The official trailer, released in late September, has already confirmed some speculation. It features a viral clip from the Toronto Maple Leafs round one loss to the Bruins, when William Nylander, sitting next to Mitch Marner on the bench, told his teammate to \u201cstop fucking crying, bro,\u201d as Marner threw his gloves off in frustration. The clip itself emerged immediately after the game, and, like Marner\u2019s status on the Leafs, was the subject of intense and often mean-spirited chatter throughout the summer \u2013 including guesses as to what Nylander actually said. \u201cOH MY GOD THEY ACTUALLY GOT IT,\u201d one X user <a href=\"https://x.com/nylanderthews/status/1838293780056928660\">posted gleefully</a> alongside the clip from the Amazon trailer, confirming all earlier lip-readings.

And like any modern business focused on growth, it\u2019s no surprise that the NHL, as it looks to expand its audience and revenues, is turning to shareable content to make that happen, specifically the kind that\u2019s anchored <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2019/game-changer/\">on individual athletes</a>\u2019 journeys.

Twenty-four years later, Nobody still isn\u2019t quite sure whether to laugh or not.</p> <p>Born David Henry Brown Jr, Nobody\u2019s big break as a performance artist in New York started in the late 1990s when he was working with the British artist Dominic McGill on <a href=\"https://coleccionsolo.com/artists/david-henry-brown-jr/\">Carpet Rollers</a>. The pair would wear black tie and take a van to spots around Manhattan including Trump Tower and the Plaza hotel and roll out a red carpet. Then they would wait as a crowd assembled and rumors spread about what or who was coming. People would ask why they were standing there, what they were doing? Nobody and McGill never commented but rumors started anyway. Was it the Queen of Spain? Was it Trump? The idea was to \u201ccreate a failure in which no one shows up in order to turn members of the crowd into momentary social critics\u201d.</p> <p>When the paired discussed work, Trump\u2019s name came up a lot. Nobody was working before Trump hit the spotlight with The Apprentice, the reality TV show that arguably laid the groundwork for his presidency. But Trump was still everywhere, on TV, in the tabloids, making movie cameos.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea of meeting Trump as many times as possible was almost like a joke passed around by me and my friends,\u201d laughs Nobody. \u201cHe was just the cheesiest guy of all time. He struck me as a big galoot. He always had this team of people around him and he\u2019d walk like this,\u201d says Nobody, hunching his shoulders and clomping like Frankenstein around his studio. \u201cHe\u2019s all-American kitsch. I just thought he was a cheeseball. I didn\u2019t know he was a fascist yet. But behind cheese is fascism.\u201d</p> <p>In 1999, Nobody managed to grab some time with the future US president six times, once when the magician David Blaine was being <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOar_YwGATE\">\u201cburied alive\u201d</a> at a Trump property.

As he chatted to the crowd, Nobody heard music. The film-maker Michael Moore was making a video for Rage Against the Machine\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl4wkIPiTcY&amp;t=2s\">Sleep Now in the Fire.</a> Nobody can be briefly spotted in the crowd waving his \u201cDonald J Trump for President 2000\u201d sign as lead singer Zack de la Rocha sings: \u201cAnd smother the rest in greed.\u201d He has never been credited by the band or Moore for his appearance, which continued to crop up in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/3ld0h0/1999_rage_against_the_machine_video_has_a_trump/\">Reddit forums</a> and even in the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/23/mysterious-man-sported-trump-for-president-sign-in-15-year-old-rage-against-the-machine-video/\">Washington Post</a> years after the event.</p> <p>People\u2019s reactions to his sign surprised him at the time \u2013 they would prove to be prophetic. \u201cThere was a guy who said to me, \u2018Hell yeah!

Posing as Alex von Furstenberg, the son of fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, Nobody wheedled his way into celebrity parties, getting his picture taken with Bill and Hillary Clinton, Ivana Trump, Sean Combs, Sarah Jessica Parker and others. He managed to maintain the fiction of being what he calls \u201ca fantastic nobody\u201d for a year and became fascinated by the soon-to-metastasize allure of celebrity culture and its hangers-on.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I realized when you meet famous people is that you hallucinate because you\u2019ve seen someone\u2019s image thousands and thousands of times in mediated form, like in video and photos,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like an information hallucination almost.\u201d</p>    <p>Celebrities themselves didn\u2019t really interest Nobody. \u201cThey are generally so boring,\u201d he says. But at the opening of Nobody\u2019s von Furstenberg show he realized he had tapped into a dark vein. The exhibition made the news and triggered a scandal. Someone threw a pie in his face at the opening, lies and disinformation started spreading. \u201cPeople thought I was a millionaire, they thought the whole crowd were all fake people, that the camera crew was fake. And that\u2019s when I realized I looked into the heart of America, just the delusion of the whole thing.\u201d</p> <p>In some ways, says Nobody, these were simpler, less overwhelming times. The stars he was seeing in real life were glimpsed on TV, at the movies, in magazines but there wasn\u2019t the always on, always available access to celebrity that now coats our life. \u201cBack then, when you would go to the movie theater you would leave the theater and then walk around and for a little while, everything in life would resemble the movie theater or the movie that you just saw. But the internet is actually doing that to you 24/7, and we don\u2019t even realize how much it\u2019s doing to us.\u201d</p> <p>For a long time, the reaction of the von Furstenberg pieces eclipsed the Trump work. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think much about it until he became president in 2016. Then I got calls from a bunch of people saying: \u2018Holy shit dude, you predicted the future!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I did it before The Simpsons.\u201d The Simpson\u2019s episode Bart to the Future <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/simpsons-predicted-president-trump-back-to-the-future\">referencing a Trump presidency</a> aired in March 2000, months after Nobody\u2019s project began.</p> <p>These days Nobody works mainly in video and photography, making portraits that are somewhere between <a href=\"https://www.nga.gov/content/dam/ngaweb/Education/learning-resources/an-eye-for-art/AnEyeforArt-GiuseppeArcimboldo.pdf\">Giuseppe Arcimboldo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/article/2024/jul/08/cindy-sherman-little-girls-play-dress-up-but-i-was-always-trying-to-be-a-monster-instead-of-a-fairy\">Cindy Sherman</a> and Nickelodeon.

      "bodyText": "Australian TV host Fiona MacDonald, known for her work on shows including It\u2019s A Knockout and the children\u2019s program Wombat, has died aged 67 of motor neurone disease (MND). MacDonald was diagnosed with MND in November 2021, a terminal degenerative disorder that causes people to lose the use of their limbs and ability to speak, swallow and breathe. There is no cure; those with MND die, on average, 27 months after diagnosis. On Thursday, MacDonald\u2019s sister posted a written statement from MacDonald herself to the former TV host\u2019s Instagram to announce the death. \u201cFarewell my friends. My sister Kylie is posting this because I have left the building - Hopefully I\u2019m looking down from a cloud. Last night brought an end to a very tough few months. Was very peaceful the boys and Kylie stayed with me to say goodbye. While I\u2019ve never wanted to die, the thought of leaving my tortured body was a relief,\u201d she wrote. She described her last months as \u201ctough\u201d, detailing the problems she had been having with tube feeding and food intolerances. \u201cI have been slowly starving, growing weaker and weaker. I\u2019ve also developed terrible back pain because my muscles aren\u2019t supporting my frame,\u201d she wrote. She entered palliative care \u201cafter much soul-searching\u201d, she said. \u201cThe black humour that served me well through the first years of this journey turned to despair \u2026 When you love life as much as I do, it takes a great deal of courage to make choices that lead to farewell,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cI carry your love and laughter with me and hope you\u2019ll remember mine.\u201d MacDonald was known for her warm, bubbly presenting style, hosting the children\u2019s show Wombat with a wise-cracking hand puppet named Agro.

      "bodyText": "Australian British pianist Jayson Gillham is suing the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra over the cancellation of a concert in August. The pianist has filed legal proceedings in the federal court, alleging MSO management cancelled the 15 August concert in Melbourne in an attempt to silence him over his stance on the conflict in Gaza. \u201cI was silenced for speaking the truth \u2013 that Israel targets journalists,\u201d Gillham said in statement released on Thursday. \u201cThis situation goes beyond just artistic freedom; it strikes at the heart of our right to free speech and the role of art in addressing important social issues. \u201cThe MSO\u2019s extreme reaction to factual statements highlights a disturbing trend of silencing voices that speak to uncomfortable truths.\u201d Gillham is taking the legal action following accusations by the MSO that making a public political statement on stage was improper and an abuse of the performer\u2019s position. At a concert in the Iwaki Auditorium in Southbank on 11 August, Gillham played a short piece written by Connor D\u2019Netto called Witness, which is dedicated to journalists who have lost their lives in the Gaza conflict. Introducing the work, the pianist addressed the audience, stating more than 100 Palestinian journalists had been killed, and that the targeting of journalists in a conflict was a war crime under international law. The MSO has previously issued a statement saying Gillham had not been discriminated against because of his political views, and that the action management took in response to the artist\u2019s on-stage comments was \u201cnot and never has been about free speech\u201d. In a statement on Thursday, the MSO confirmed Gillham had commenced federal court proceedings. \u201cThe Melbourne Symphony Orchestra is reviewing the court documents and will respond at the appropriate time,\u201d the statement said.",

TNS, who have always been registered with the Football Association of Wales, returned for pre-season in May and have played eight European games since July, including in Hungary, Lithuania, Moldova and Montenegro.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think many people believed we could do it,\u201d says Harris. \u201cThe gravitas of the game is still sinking in.\u201d</p>    <ul> <li><p>European team\u2019s pennants, souvenirs from TNS\u2019s previous European exploits, hang above the bar at Park Hall.</p></li> </ul>      <ul> <li><p> The Cymru Premier trophy, one of the many on display (above left), a photograph, mounted on the corridor wall at Park Hall, shows TNS in Champions League qualifying action against Legia Warsaw in 2013 (above right).</p></li> </ul> <p>Everyone wants to play. Connor Roberts, the 31-year-old goalkeeper who is among the Manchester United fans in the TNS squad, hopes to share a pitch with David de Gea, who joined Fiorentina in August. Roberts has asked Eric Ramsay, the former United first-team coach and TNS youngster now in charge of Minnesota United, to play the role of fixer.</p> <p>\u201cHe speaks fluent Spanish so I\u2019ve asked him to get in touch with De&nbsp;Gea to give me five minutes, or at least his shirt,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to try and chew his ear off. I need to ask him about his save at Old Trafford against Real Madrid, to prevent Cristiano Ronaldo from scoring [in October 2018], because it was just incredible. He made it look like it was a simple volley. He is arguably one of the best shot-stoppers the Premier League has had.\u201d</p>    <ul> <li><p>Connor Roberts, TNS goalkeeper (above), Craig Harrison, TNS head coach (below left) and Danny Redmond, TNS captain (below right).</p></li> </ul>      <p>Ramsay\u2019s brother, Alex, works as a part-time goalkeeper coach at TNS and puts Roberts through his paces before a seven-a-side game at the end of the session. Earlier, Harrison walked through defensive set plays. \u201cDefend it till the death,\u201d he says, stressing the importance of reacting to the second phase. Later, Harrison poses as an awkward target man jostling against his centre-backs Jack Bodenham and Blaine Hudson. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to get as good as that tomorrow,\u201d Harrison says, a broad grin on his&nbsp;face.</p> <p>The razzmatazz of the tie is obvious. \u201cWatching Gazzetta Football Italia in the 90s was a huge thing, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d says Harrison. \u201cEveryone watched Serie A, the Batistutas of this world. I think Italian football was at its best then, probably better than the Premier&nbsp;League.</p> <p>\u201cPaul Gascoigne went out to play there \u2013 he moved to Lazio when he was the best player in England \u2013 and when he came back, we played together at Middlesbrough. We\u2019re from the same Gateshead area, we played for the same Redheugh boys\u2019 club.\u201d</p> <p>For the 46-year-old Harrison, in his second stint in charge of TNS after spells with Hartlepool, Bangor City and Connah\u2019s Quay Nomads, that scouting trip to Fiorentina offered a bizarre moment. \u201cI texted [the chief operating officer] Ian Williams when I saw the LED advertising hoardings around the pitch flashing up \u2018Fiorentina v The New Saints\u2019, the two badges and the date of the game. It was: \u2018Wow, we\u2019ve done all right here.\u2019\u201d</p>    <ul> <li><p>A training session at Park Hall.</p></li> </ul> <p>Danny Redmond, the captain, says the players\u2019 WhatsApp group was buzzing at the draw. There was a commotion in Monaco, where the draw was held, too. \u201cA bit of noise came from our party when our name came out,\u201d says Harrison. \u201cSearge went: \u2018Yes.\u2019 The whole auditorium was like: \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 It is an amazing David v Goliath game.\u201d</p> <p>TNS are the only professional club in the Welsh top flight and operate on an annual budget of \u00a31.2m \u2013 their highest-paid player takes home about \u00a31,200 a week \u2013 but Davies is one of three members of full-time first-team staff. The coaches Simon Spender, who played with Gareth Bale for Wales Under-21s, Simon Smith and Seargeant also fulfil roles in the academy.</p> <p>Harrison is adamant no Conference League team will have fewer hands. \u201cTransfermarkt value Fiorentina\u2019s squad at about \u20ac300m, ours at \u20ac3m,\u201d says Harrison, who had to cope with last season\u2019s top goalscorer, Brad Young, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/sep/02/brad-young-leaves-the-new-saints-to-join-al-orobah-in-record-deal\">departing for the Saudi Pro League</a> last month for \u00a3190,000, a record Welsh top-flight sale.</p>        <ul> <li><p>The players take part in a training session at Park Hall and TNS assistant manager Chris Seargeant collects up all the balls after the training session (above right). </p></li> </ul> <p>Last season, Davies spent three months moonlighting as a sports scientist. \u201cVery often I\u2019m gluing players\u2019 boots back together,\u201d he says, grabbing a pair in the treatment room, a cave of tape, strappings, lotions and medical solutions. \u201cI could be taking someone\u2019s toenail off, squeezing someone\u2019s blood blister \u2026 I\u2019ve been out there trying to take coaching sessions with injured players. I\u2019m there doing drills and they will look at me like: \u2018You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 And they\u2019re right. But you do pick things up.\u201d</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Chelsea are favourites to win the Conference League. For TNS, it is a case of role&nbsp;reversal. The Invincibles banner at the ground says as much; last season TNS went unbeaten across the 32-game season (winning 30, drawing two) en route to a 16th league title. Domestically, TNS are undoubtedly the biggest fish, and therefore the biggest scalp; Harris tells of league rivals being ecstatic at earning a draw against them.</p> <p>Regardless of the challenge and relentless schedule (TNS face 10 games in October), Harrison is confident his side can reach the knockout phase. \u201cSeven points and a good goal difference will probably get you through,\u201d he says. \u201cEight definitely will. We\u2019re not there just to tick off a box: \u2018I\u2019ve&nbsp;played at Fiorentina.\u2019\u201d The basic facts make them feel they have a chance. \u201cIt\u2019s just a field with lines on and 22 players going at it,\u201d Roberts says.</p> <p>At the same time, there is no masking the size of the occasion. \u201cIt is up there as the biggest game of our lives,\u201d says Redmond, the former Everton, Wigan and Hamilton Academical midfielder. Adrian Cieslewicz, a former Manchester City youngster who joined TNS a decade ago, recognises the strides made.</p>    <ul> <li><p>The club\u2019s crest in the home team\u2019s dressing room at Park Hall.</p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe dream has been to get through to the group stage in Europe \u2013 it has been a long time coming for any Welsh team,\u201d says the 33-year-old, whose son, another United fan, has helped with his pre-match homework on De Gea.</p> <p>Harris says TNS have gained followers from South Africa, North America and beyond. \u201cMy mum is Italian, so it\u2019s the best draw we could\u2019ve got,\u201d says Leach. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t follow football but she knows Fiorentina because she went to university in Florence.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/01/champions-league-leverkusen-see-off-milan-as-barcelona-bounce-back-in-style\">Champions League: Leverkusen see off Milan as Barcelona bounce back in style</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is another, unlikely, subplot. Davies\u2019s partner Rachel\u2019s late grandmother, Francesca, grew up in Florence; Francesca was on a train in Trieste when it was intercepted by Nazis. Francesca was allowed out of a concentration camp because she spoke numerous languages and could act as an interpreter, a role which enabled her to meet someone from the British Red Cross, who took her to Rhosllanerchrugog, a village four miles from nearby Wrexham.</p> <p>From Flint to Florence, via Ferencvaros, TNS are determined to savour a special occasion. They will fly back from Pisa to Manchester at 10.30am on Friday before travelling to south Wales the following afternoon, braced for a shift in surroundings. \u201cI joked with my missus: \u2018If you want to come to Florence, then you\u2019ve got to come to Briton Ferry on the Sunday as well,\u201d says Roberts, laughing. \u201cThe away changing rooms are a little tight \u2013 you\u2019re pretty much getting changed outside.\u201d</p> <p>As Harrison, fresh from debating his team selection with Seargeant and Davies, heads out of his office, I wish him all the best for the trip to Italy. \u201cWe might need it,\u201d comes the reply.</p>",

TNS, who have always been registered with the Football Association of Wales, returned for pre-season in May and have played eight European games since July, including in Hungary, Lithuania, Moldova and Montenegro. \u201cI don\u2019t think many people believed we could do it,\u201d says Harris. \u201cThe gravitas of the game is still sinking in.\u201d European team\u2019s pennants, souvenirs from TNS\u2019s previous European exploits, hang above the bar at Park Hall. The Cymru Premier trophy, one of the many on display (above left), a photograph, mounted on the corridor wall at Park Hall, shows TNS in Champions League qualifying action against Legia Warsaw in 2013 (above right). Everyone wants to play. Connor Roberts, the 31-year-old goalkeeper who is among the Manchester United fans in the TNS squad, hopes to share a pitch with David de Gea, who joined Fiorentina in August. Roberts has asked Eric Ramsay, the former United first-team coach and TNS youngster now in charge of Minnesota United, to play the role of fixer. \u201cHe speaks fluent Spanish so I\u2019ve asked him to get in touch with De Gea to give me five minutes, or at least his shirt,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to try and chew his ear off. I need to ask him about his save at Old Trafford against Real Madrid, to prevent Cristiano Ronaldo from scoring [in October 2018], because it was just incredible. He made it look like it was a simple volley. He is arguably one of the best shot-stoppers the Premier League has had.\u201d Connor Roberts, TNS goalkeeper (above), Craig Harrison, TNS head coach (below left) and Danny Redmond, TNS captain (below right). Ramsay\u2019s brother, Alex, works as a part-time goalkeeper coach at TNS and puts Roberts through his paces before a seven-a-side game at the end of the session. Earlier, Harrison walked through defensive set plays. \u201cDefend it till the death,\u201d he says, stressing the importance of reacting to the second phase. Later, Harrison poses as an awkward target man jostling against his centre-backs Jack Bodenham and Blaine Hudson. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to get as good as that tomorrow,\u201d Harrison says, a broad grin on his face. The razzmatazz of the tie is obvious. \u201cWatching Gazzetta Football Italia in the 90s was a huge thing, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d says Harrison. \u201cEveryone watched Serie A, the Batistutas of this world. I think Italian football was at its best then, probably better than the Premier League. \u201cPaul Gascoigne went out to play there \u2013 he moved to Lazio when he was the best player in England \u2013 and when he came back, we played together at Middlesbrough. We\u2019re from the same Gateshead area, we played for the same Redheugh boys\u2019 club.\u201d For the 46-year-old Harrison, in his second stint in charge of TNS after spells with Hartlepool, Bangor City and Connah\u2019s Quay Nomads, that scouting trip to Fiorentina offered a bizarre moment. \u201cI texted [the chief operating officer] Ian Williams when I saw the LED advertising hoardings around the pitch flashing up \u2018Fiorentina v The New Saints\u2019, the two badges and the date of the game. It was: \u2018Wow, we\u2019ve done all right here.\u2019\u201d A training session at Park Hall. Danny Redmond, the captain, says the players\u2019 WhatsApp group was buzzing at the draw. There was a commotion in Monaco, where the draw was held, too. \u201cA bit of noise came from our party when our name came out,\u201d says Harrison. \u201cSearge went: \u2018Yes.\u2019 The whole auditorium was like: \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 It is an amazing David v Goliath game.\u201d TNS are the only professional club in the Welsh top flight and operate on an annual budget of \u00a31.2m \u2013 their highest-paid player takes home about \u00a31,200 a week \u2013 but Davies is one of three members of full-time first-team staff. The coaches Simon Spender, who played with Gareth Bale for Wales Under-21s, Simon Smith and Seargeant also fulfil roles in the academy. Harrison is adamant no Conference League team will have fewer hands. \u201cTransfermarkt value Fiorentina\u2019s squad at about \u20ac300m, ours at \u20ac3m,\u201d says Harrison, who had to cope with last season\u2019s top goalscorer, Brad Young, departing for the Saudi Pro League last month for \u00a3190,000, a record Welsh top-flight sale. The players take part in a training session at Park Hall and TNS assistant manager Chris Seargeant collects up all the balls after the training session (above right). Last season, Davies spent three months moonlighting as a sports scientist. \u201cVery often I\u2019m gluing players\u2019 boots back together,\u201d he says, grabbing a pair in the treatment room, a cave of tape, strappings, lotions and medical solutions. \u201cI could be taking someone\u2019s toenail off, squeezing someone\u2019s blood blister \u2026 I\u2019ve been out there trying to take coaching sessions with injured players. I\u2019m there doing drills and they will look at me like: \u2018You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 And they\u2019re right. But you do pick things up.\u201d Unsurprisingly, Chelsea are favourites to win the Conference League. For TNS, it is a case of role reversal. The Invincibles banner at the ground says as much; last season TNS went unbeaten across the 32-game season (winning 30, drawing two) en route to a 16th league title. Domestically, TNS are undoubtedly the biggest fish, and therefore the biggest scalp; Harris tells of league rivals being ecstatic at earning a draw against them. Regardless of the challenge and relentless schedule (TNS face 10 games in October), Harrison is confident his side can reach the knockout phase. \u201cSeven points and a good goal difference will probably get you through,\u201d he says. \u201cEight definitely will. We\u2019re not there just to tick off a box: \u2018I\u2019ve played at Fiorentina.\u2019\u201d The basic facts make them feel they have a chance. \u201cIt\u2019s just a field with lines on and 22 players going at it,\u201d Roberts says. At the same time, there is no masking the size of the occasion. \u201cIt is up there as the biggest game of our lives,\u201d says Redmond, the former Everton, Wigan and Hamilton Academical midfielder. Adrian Cieslewicz, a former Manchester City youngster who joined TNS a decade ago, recognises the strides made. The club\u2019s crest in the home team\u2019s dressing room at Park Hall. \u201cThe dream has been to get through to the group stage in Europe \u2013 it has been a long time coming for any Welsh team,\u201d says the 33-year-old, whose son, another United fan, has helped with his pre-match homework on De Gea. Harris says TNS have gained followers from South Africa, North America and beyond. \u201cMy mum is Italian, so it\u2019s the best draw we could\u2019ve got,\u201d says Leach. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t follow football but she knows Fiorentina because she went to university in Florence.\u201d There is another, unlikely, subplot. Davies\u2019s partner Rachel\u2019s late grandmother, Francesca, grew up in Florence; Francesca was on a train in Trieste when it was intercepted by Nazis. Francesca was allowed out of a concentration camp because she spoke numerous languages and could act as an interpreter, a role which enabled her to meet someone from the British Red Cross, who took her to Rhosllanerchrugog, a village four miles from nearby Wrexham. From Flint to Florence, via Ferencvaros, TNS are determined to savour a special occasion. They will fly back from Pisa to Manchester at 10.30am on Friday before travelling to south Wales the following afternoon, braced for a shift in surroundings. \u201cI joked with my missus: \u2018If you want to come to Florence, then you\u2019ve got to come to Briton Ferry on the Sunday as well,\u201d says Roberts, laughing. \u201cThe away changing rooms are a little tight \u2013 you\u2019re pretty much getting changed outside.\u201d As Harrison, fresh from debating his team selection with Seargeant and Davies, heads out of his office, I wish him all the best for the trip to Italy. \u201cWe might need it,\u201d comes the reply.",

      "body": "<p>In 2005 or 2006, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/dec/09/artist-nairy-baghramian\">Nairy Baghramian</a> arrived for a&nbsp;site&nbsp;visit at Kunsthalle Basel&nbsp;in&nbsp;Switzerland to find the pioneering artist Gustav&nbsp;Metzger was there, too. He&nbsp;was&nbsp;scheduled to do a show before her&nbsp;and was walking around the imposing space with the director Adam Szymczyk, when he suddenly became excited at a temporary wall that had been erected. \u201cOh my God!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that this is built in now. Otherwise it would&nbsp;be a totally fascist building, it\u2019s&nbsp;huge. I&nbsp;love this <em>unterbrechung</em>\u201d.</p> <p>An <em>unterbrechung</em> is an interruption or an intermission. Metzger, the Jewish artist and activist who fled to&nbsp;the UK from Nazi Germany as a child in 1939, found the idea of disrupting this example of monumental neoclassical architecture to be politically potent. Baghramian would go on to base her whole show on&nbsp;that sentence. She left most of the space empty, arranging just a few pieces around that wall.</p> <p>At first Szymczyk questioned the&nbsp;decision: \u201cDo you know how big the space is and&nbsp;you only have these works?\u201d he asked. But she insisted that Metzger\u2019s neat summation of \u201ca political experience of a space and&nbsp;also an architectural experience\u201d was the only prompt she needed.</p> <p>Baghramian is always looking for openings. For ways of letting the outside in. She was&nbsp;born in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/oct/29/iran-holiday-guide-tehran-isfahan-persepolis-yazd\">Isfahan</a>, Iran, in 1971, and&nbsp;after the revolution fled to Berlin&nbsp;with her family in 1984. She has&nbsp;been exhibiting since the late 1990s, but it was taking part in the once-a-decade M\u00fcnster Sculpture Project <a href=\"https://artmap.com/skulpturprojekte/exhibition/skulptur-projekte-muenster-2007-2007\">in 2007</a> that pushed her firmly into the spotlight.</p>    <p>From the outset, she has made her&nbsp;playful, deliciously tactile work in&nbsp;a&nbsp;constant back and forth between photography and sculpture. In her latest show, portraits of a young child&nbsp;sit alongside sculpted elements in stone and metal. It stops her from&nbsp;getting stuck on any one idea: \u201cIt&nbsp;keeps my artistic dominance in check, so that nothing becomes too tight and everything can just be what&nbsp;it is.\u201d</p> <p>This is more than the high-level theorising of an artist steeped in abstraction. In fact, as one critic recently put it, Baghramian\u2019s work \u201cpops\u201d the very notion of art existing in a bubble. For her forthcoming exhibition, the artist is occupying the&nbsp;various spaces of Camberwell\u2019s South London Gallery with large colourful sculptural&nbsp;pieces from her&nbsp;Misfits series. The show takes its&nbsp;title, Jumbled Alphabet, from that&nbsp;of a double photographic portrait&nbsp;of a little girl in a blue jumper,&nbsp;also on&nbsp;display. The child has&nbsp;tousled blond hair and yellow beads round her&nbsp;neck. She poses head-on (albeit from behind) and then&nbsp;from the side.&nbsp;When you can&nbsp;glimpse her face, you see she is looking directly ahead.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that the girl looks unhappy. But she is not gurning for the camera, either. \u201cWhen people take photos of&nbsp;children, they always ask them to&nbsp;smile,\u201d says Baghramian. \u201cBut if&nbsp;you just leave a child be, they\u2019ll often&nbsp;look the way she looks here.\u201d With girls, she says, it\u2019s even more common that they\u2019ll be asked to \u201csmile, love\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Two years ago, Amanda Vandervort was unveiled as the first president of a new fully professional women\u2019s league, the USL Super League, in the United States. For a country with a thriving professional league, the NWSL, there were many questions. How? Why? Where? Would it take off? Many of those questions were answered on the opening weekend just under seven weeks ago. A sellout crowd of more than 10,000 at the American Legion Memorial Stadium watched Carolina Ascent beat DC Power 1-0. Two more sellout crowds watched Spokane Zephyr\u2019s 1-1 draw with Fort Lauderdale United and Tampa Bay Sun\u2019s draw with Dallas Trinity. The crowds have naturally dipped a little but have still averaged 2,929 for the 12 of 14 subsequent fixtures that have had attendances announced \u2013 a total of 35,152 fans. The scorer of the eight-team Super League\u2019s first goal was a fitting one, going a long way towards answering the \u201cwhy\u201d question. Thirty-year-old defender Vicky Bruce is a product of the impressive college system but after playing for the North Carolina Tar Heels and Davidson Wildcats college teams, she was not drafted by an NWSL team. Bruce was lucky that with a father born in England she had a UK passport and that meant her desire for a professional career was not over. She played in Scotland, Iceland, Cyprus, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, England and Australia. Now, she is home, playing professionally in front of family and friends week-in, week-out for the first time after becoming Carolina Ascent\u2019s first signing. This is who the league serves. There is a huge talent pool developed by the college system but only 14 professional NWSL teams. The USL\u2019s amateur W-League, which folded in 2015, was relaunched as the USL W League in 2022 as a pre-professional women\u2019s league with 80 teams in 10 divisions. A professional league above them was a logical next step. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the USL ecosystem it\u2019s an elite development pathway that leads to professional women\u2019s soccer and the standards, the alignment, is all clear and driven collectively and consistently from us at the league,\u201d says Vandervort from the USL office in Tampa, Florida. She sees Tampa Bay Sun shirts while out and about, and regards that as testament to the connection the side has built with the community. Many consider the Super League a competitor to the NWSL, particularly with it aligning with the calendars of top European leagues by beginning in August and not having a draft system (which the NWSL has recently ditched). \u201cThere\u2019s only 14 NWSL teams,\u201d Vandervort says. \u201cThere\u2019s over 100 men\u2019s professional teams in the United States \u2026 that alone tells a story that women have historically not been given the opportunities men have.

But it sustained its devotion to excess for 180 episodes, and excess was, mostly, the point. The episodes boomerang between farce and high drama, between tragedy, pratfalls and comic nudity. \u201cIt\u2019s like my grandmother always said: an erect penis doesn\u2019t have a conscience,\u201d says Gabrielle, early on, to give a taste of its many bon mots.</p>    <p>It is easy to see the problems with it retrospectively, just as Friends, for example, is regularly pulled up for jokes that wouldn\u2019t pass muster today. I had also forgotten just how young Gabrielle\u2019s gardener and secret lover John is supposed to be: at one point she tries to call him, only for him to let her know that he\u2019s in algebra class. Gabrielle\u2019s husband, meanwhile, tells her that if one of his colleagues wants to grope her, she\u2019d better let it happen. Watch it alongside those documentaries about the terrible tabloid culture of the 00s, and you feel more empathy for women in the public eye, and women in general. It jokes that Mary Alice told everyone she was a size 6, but on going through her clothes after her death, the women learn that she was an 8. Talk about secrets! Neighbour Edie (Nicollette Sheridan, who attempted to <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2018/03/08/nicollette-sheridan-desperate-housewives-lawsuit-interview\">sue the show after her character</a> was killed off, saying it was retaliation for her making a complaint about Cherry) was the Samantha-esque maneater who competes with her neighbours for new conquests. \u201cSusan had met the enemy, and she was a slut,\u201d narrates Mary Alice, still judgmental even from the afterlife.</p> <p>But for all of its \u201cI can\u2019t believe they went there\u201d moments (and there are many of those), it has a lightness of touch.

      "bodyText": "The Australian federal police has launched a taskforce to investigate at least nine allegations of prohibited symbols being displayed in Victoria, in response to Hezbollah flags being flown at pro-Palestine and Lebanon protests on Sunday. In a statement, the AFP said Operation Ardvarna would investigate the display of prohibited symbols \u201cwhile potentially inciting or advocating violence, or hatred, based on race and religion\u201d. The AFP said three of the reports had been provided by Victoria police, while one was made to the national security hotline and four others came via a crime-reporting portal. One was based on a investigation into a media article that allegedly identified an individual, the AFP said. \u201cIt is likely the number of investigations will increase, and some state and territory police agencies have their own investigations under way,\u201d the AFP said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The AFP\u2019s counter-terrorism and special investigations command in Victoria established the taskforce. Australia has designated Hezbollah \u2013 a Lebanese Shia Islamist political party and militant group \u2013 as a terrorist organisation since 2021. The display of prohibited symbols is outlawed when carried with intent to incite hatred or violence. Protesters in Sydney and Melbourne over the weekend flew the Hezbollah flag after the group\u2019s chief Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Saturday. Victoria police said on Wednesday it had made a number of referrals to the Australian federal police relating to protests allegedly involving prohibited symbols. New South Wales police on Wednesday charged a 19-year-old woman after a Hezbollah flag was allegedly displayed at a pro-Palestine and Lebanon protest in Sydney on the weekend. NSW police said the woman handed herself in at Kogarah police station after the force released images of her and appealed for her to come forward. The AFP said it was providing support to state and territory police agencies ahead of expected protests that will coincide with the one-year anniversary of the 7 October anniversary of Hamas attacks on Israel. It said the nine investigations were a priority and the agency could continue its regular role of investigating terrorism, radicalisation, foreign interference and espionage. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, on Thursday said Victoria police had the necessary powers to deal with people who \u201cmay be displaying terrorist flags\u201d. \u201cIn terms of what happens operationally on the ground, those are operational decisions in the moment,\u201d she said.",

Responding to a report suggesting Payman\u2019s party could be launched in weeks, Glenn Druery quibbled with the timing but did not deny the plan to run for the Senate, and possibly lower house candidates in select seats. \u201cWhere there\u2019s smoke sometimes there\u2019s fire,\u201d Druery told Guardian Australia. \u201cOr, as Senator Payman has said herself, watch this space.\u201d In July Payman quit Labor to sit on the crossbench after crossing the floor to vote for a Greens motion in the Senate to recognise Palestine. Payman has discouraged Muslim Australians from creating a religious political party, arguing a new movement would need a \u201cbroader base\u201d to succeed. In September Payman hired Druery \u2013 renowned in Australian politics as the \u201cpreference whisperer\u201d who used deals under the old Senate voting system to help elect micro-parties \u2013 as her chief of staff. In an ABC Australian Story episode that month, Druery said Payman launching her own political party was a conversation that needed to be had. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cI maintain that if anyone is to be elected or re-elected to the Senate they need a political party,\u201d Druery said on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for an independent to be elected \u2013 Nick Xenophon and Brian Harradine are the exception.\u201d Given disenchantment with the major parties, Druery argued it was \u201cvery likely that the sixth Senate spot will be available in every state\u201d so a \u201csmart minor party stands to do well\u201d. There could even be two Senate seats up for grabs in Queensland, he added, citing nervous Labor operatives who fear a repeat of the 2019 election (in which just one Labor senator was elected from the state). Payman\u2019s term is not due to expire until 2028, although she could be up for re-election sooner if the government called a double dissolution. Any Payman political party would face stiff competition, with the Greens holding Senate seats in every state, and One Nation well-established in Queensland and a frequent contender in other states. The Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie has lost her fellow senator Tammy Tyrrell to the crossbench, but intends to run other candidates including the former senator Rex Patrick in South Australia. Druery said the Greens and Coalition had done an \u201cexceptionally good job wedging the government\u201d on legislation such as the nature positive bill, but \u201cmany Greens voters don\u2019t like these games\u201d. Since moving to the crossbench, Payman has taken a series of populist positions outflanking Labor on both the right, by opposing its ban on live sheep exports, and left, by calling for more action to fix housing affordability. Payman is locked in a struggle with Anthony Albanese for two extra staff, to bring her allocation in line with other independent senators. In September, Payman said the prime minister had \u201cstill not given me my full staffing allocation\u201d making it \u201creally difficult\u201d to get on top of critical legislation.",

The former Italian prime minister Mario Draghi recently presented a <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/mario-draghi-report-says-eu-must-spend-twice-as-much-after-wwii/\">400-page blueprint,</a> commissioned by von der Leyen, on revamping Europe\u2019s competitiveness.

Given the plan\u2019s integrationist, perhaps even federalist approach, an even moderately more nationalist and Eurosceptic Europe is unlikely to execute Draghi\u2019s prescriptions. </p> <p>But at least the EU has a plan that enables it to get up on its feet economically, capitalise on its partnership with the US, stand up to competition with China and address Russia\u2019s threat.

There is also a commissioner for international partnerships, who will be focusing mainly on Africa.

It has also been shockingly oblivious to the outcry in many countries of the global south to the protectionist effects of EU legislation, such as its carbon border adjustment mechanism and its flagship deforestation regulation. Both measures have a sound internal logic. Yet they were discussed and approved with hardly any external consultation, with potentially damaging effects on several African, Asian and Latin American countries.</p> <p>All this is happening while there is no end in sight to the destruction of Gaza. Violence mounts in the West Bank, and Israel has moved to all-out war against Lebanon (and perhaps Iran). After months of division on the question of a ceasefire in Gaza, the EU is in agreement that there should be one, but hardly any members are willing to do anything about it \u2013 for instance, by suspending arms sales to Israel. There will be even less appetite for this in light of direct confrontation between Israel and Iran. </p> <p>At the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdx9z96ldveo\">UN general assembly, </a>where the vast majority of countries worldwide backed a resolution supporting the international court of justice\u2019s opinion demanding Israel\u2019s compliance with international law in the occupied Palestinian territory, Europe\u2019s show was pitiful once again: 13 countries voted in favour, 12 abstained and two \u2013 Hungary and the Czech Republic \u2013 voted against the resolution. Time and time again, Europe is given the opportunity to turn the page, and to start rebuilding its reputation in the global south.

It has also been shockingly oblivious to the outcry in many countries of the global south to the protectionist effects of EU legislation, such as its carbon border adjustment mechanism and its flagship deforestation regulation. Both measures have a sound internal logic. Yet they were discussed and approved with hardly any external consultation, with potentially damaging effects on several African, Asian and Latin American countries. All this is happening while there is no end in sight to the destruction of Gaza. Violence mounts in the West Bank, and Israel has moved to all-out war against Lebanon (and perhaps Iran). After months of division on the question of a ceasefire in Gaza, the EU is in agreement that there should be one, but hardly any members are willing to do anything about it \u2013 for instance, by suspending arms sales to Israel. There will be even less appetite for this in light of direct confrontation between Israel and Iran. At the UN general assembly, where the vast majority of countries worldwide backed a resolution supporting the international court of justice\u2019s opinion demanding Israel\u2019s compliance with international law in the occupied Palestinian territory, Europe\u2019s show was pitiful once again: 13 countries voted in favour, 12 abstained and two \u2013 Hungary and the Czech Republic \u2013 voted against the resolution. Time and time again, Europe is given the opportunity to turn the page, and to start rebuilding its reputation in the global south. At every turn, it misses the opportunity.

      "body": "<p>Keir Starmer was in Brussels yesterday on a charm offensive, as the government tries to reset the UK\u2019s fractious post-Brexit relationship with its neighbours across the Channel. \u201cWe\u2019re putting our relationship with Europe on a more solid, stable footing. That\u2019s what British people want,\u201d he told reporters last night.</p> <p>The prime minister won the hearts of many Labour members in 2018 by insisting that a referendum to reverse Brexit must be kept on the table. But by the time Starmer won the leadership four years ago, Boris Johnson had won a crushing general election victory promising to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Starmer insisted the subject was now closed.</p> <p>In its general election manifesto, Labour promised to make the UK \u201ca leading nation in Europe once again, with an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners\u201d \u2013 but it wants to do so without rejoining the single market or the customs union, or revisiting freedom of movement.</p> <p>For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent <em><strong>Jennifer Rankin</strong></em> about what was at stake in Starmer\u2019s meetings with senior EU policymakers \u2013 and what happens next.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Middle East</strong></em> | Israeli strikes on a central Beirut medical centre have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/israel-strikes-beirut-lebanon-death-toll-hezbollah-war\">killed at least six people</a>.

Mark Chavez, 54, is the third to plead guilty over the Friends star\u2019s fatal 2023 overdose.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: \u2018People are pleased that Keir Starmer wants to set a pro-European tone\u2019</h2>    <p>After years of scratchy relations between the UK and the EU, culminating in the 2016 Brexit referendum and the long, painful divorce talks that followed, Jennifer says the Labour government\u2019s warmer approach is being welcomed. \u201cThere is enthusiasm and people are pleased that Keir Starmer wants to set a pro-European tone,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The prime minister, who was shadow Brexit secretary in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s top team, is also well known in Brussels, and as the author of a textbook on European human rights law understands the legal frameworks that underpin the way the EU functions. Starmer met the heads of all three of its key institutions \u2013 commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European council chair Charles Michel, and European parliament president Roberta Metsola \u2013 in what Jennifer took to be a sign of seriousness on the UK\u2019s part.</p> <p>There is some appreciation in Brussels too, she says, of the domestic challenges Starmer faces in confronting the forces of Euroscepticism \u2013 including former MEP Nigel Farage. Yet despite the positive mood music, and the mutual sympathy, Jennifer has significant doubts about whether Labour can achieve a closer relationship with the EU on the terms it hopes for.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>\u2018Setting the tone\u2019</strong></p> <p>One key stumbling block has already emerged. The EU wants to discuss the possibility of a youth mobility agreement, which could see a set number of young people travel to the UK and stay for a limited period, perhaps to study or work. The UK already has an arrangement like this with several other countries, including Australia and Canada \u2013 in these cases allowing 18- to 35-year-olds to come here and work for up to two years, provided they have a certain level of savings.</p> <p>Such a scheme could be reciprocal, allowing UK citizens to spend time in an EU country; but Labour has previously ruled out the idea, fearful that it could be portrayed as akin to \u201cfree movement\u201d, widely seen by politicians as one of the drivers of the discontent behind the Brexit vote. With Reform earning the third-most votes (but winning just five seats) in July\u2019s general election, Labour is wary of inflaming anti-migration sentiment.</p> <p>However, Jennifer says this issue could be key to opening up potential discussions on the post-Brexit relationship \u2013 because it would show that the UK is willing to meet the EU on its own terms.</p> <p>\u201cThe youth mobility scheme will be front and centre because it\u2019s really important for member states to have something tangible to show for improving the relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cGoing to the UK was always such a popular thing, especially for young people.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about a youth mobility scheme after yesterday\u2019s meetings, Starmer said it was \u201cnot a discussion that went into the details at this stage\u201d, but was rather about \u201csetting the parameters, setting the tone\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>A waiting game</strong></p>    <p>Rather than cross-channel youth exchanges, Labour hopes that foreign and security policy can be the starting point for conversations with the EU. The foreign secretary, David Lammy, has already met several of his EU counterparts and is keen to pursue an agreement on shared policy goals \u2013 including tackling the climate crisis, as well as aiding Ukraine.</p> <p>Jennifer says many EU diplomats welcome the notion of a foreign and security pact \u2013 Theresa May was negotiating such a deal as part of Brexit talks, before Boris Johnson ditched the idea. But she suggests the UK will have to make some more concrete proposals before much progress can be made. \u201cThere\u2019s a general sense of \u2018this is a good thing, but we need to see the detail\u2019 \u2013 so it\u2019s a bit of a waiting game.\u201d</p> <p>There were signs after Wednesday\u2019s talks that the two sides are starting to do the groundwork. A joint statement said the EU and UK would work \u201cat pace\u201d on an \u201cagenda of strengthened cooperation\u201d, mentioning issues including energy, security, resilience and the economy, with a UK-EU summit to be held \u201cideally early in 2025\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Labour\u2019s red lines</strong></p> <p>When it comes to the economic relationship, Labour\u2019s red lines \u2013 no to the single market, no to the customs union \u2013 will constrain its ambitions. Jennifer says even some of the limited changes proposed in the party\u2019s manifesto will be tricky to negotiate. Mutual recognition of professional qualifications, so that lawyers or bankers could work across the UK and the EU, is something the bloc does offer to some non-member states \u2013 but only after extensive negotiations. She points out that the EU recently agreed mutual recognition of architectural qualifications across member states, but it took three years to finalise.</p> <p>A veterinary agreement, aimed at cutting down checks at the EU border, is also a clear possibility \u2013 the EU has one with Switzerland, for example \u2013 but again it will take time. \u201cThere\u2019s a view here that it\u2019s a bit more complicated than it might appear at first glance and it\u2019s not something you can just stroll up and negotiate over a weekend.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has suggested the UK seek \u201cbespoke\u201d arrangements with the EU in key industries such as chemicals, accepting EU regulations as the quid pro quo. But Jennifer believes that approach is unlikely to fly. \u201cThe EU have just said so many times that they want to protect the integrity of the single market,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce you start having an a la carte approach, their fear is that you start to pick holes in it.\u201d</p> <p>So while Keir Starmer may have left Brussels with the warm glow of a friendship rekindled, the detailed work is yet to begin, and Labour\u2019s self-imposed red lines will limit its room for manoeuvre.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Jennifer says, \u201cagainst all the difficulty and the complexity of all these issues, broadly people are appreciative of this new prime minister and hopeful that it could mean a better relationship\u201d.</p> <p><em>For more reporting on Europe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/this-is-europe-sign-up-guardian-email-updates\">sign up here</a> to get This Is Europe straight into your inbox every Wednesday</em></p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>As stage parents across the country prime Generation Alpha for the upcoming <strong>Harry Potter</strong> TV castings, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/02/a-moment-that-changed-me-fluffed-final-harry-potter-audition-felt-dismay-remorse-shame-relief\">Jamie Clifton reflects on</a> his near miss at the lead role and the tradeoff between teenage megastardom and anonymity. <em><strong>Jason Okundaye, assistant editor, newsletters</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>\u201cPolicy karaoke for wannabe prime ministers with no original material\u201d \u2013 as the <strong>Conservative</strong><strong> conference</strong> drew to a close in Birmingham on Wednesday, Rafael Behr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/02/badenoch-cleverly-jenrick-tugendhat-tories-wilderness\">argued convincingly</a> that none of the four leadership contenders have really understood the scale of their party\u2019s rejection by the electorate \u2013 or what they might need to do to win voters back. <em><strong>Heather</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>I love <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/02/the-flygerians-recipes-for-jollof-pasta-and-nigerian-shawarma\">these recipes from The Flygerians</a> showcasing the fusion of <strong>Nigerian food</strong> with other world cuisines \u2013 I have fond memories of eating shawarma in Lekki last December, and jollof pasta is the best kept secret of west African households. <em><strong>Jason</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Here in the UK, City banks and consultancies are well known as high pressure work environments \u2013 but in India, it seems the demands made on young recruits to corporate jobs are even more extreme.

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer was in Brussels yesterday on a charm offensive, as the government tries to reset the UK\u2019s fractious post-Brexit relationship with its neighbours across the Channel. \u201cWe\u2019re putting our relationship with Europe on a more solid, stable footing. That\u2019s what British people want,\u201d he told reporters last night. The prime minister won the hearts of many Labour members in 2018 by insisting that a referendum to reverse Brexit must be kept on the table. But by the time Starmer won the leadership four years ago, Boris Johnson had won a crushing general election victory promising to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Starmer insisted the subject was now closed. In its general election manifesto, Labour promised to make the UK \u201ca leading nation in Europe once again, with an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners\u201d \u2013 but it wants to do so without rejoining the single market or the customs union, or revisiting freedom of movement. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin about what was at stake in Starmer\u2019s meetings with senior EU policymakers \u2013 and what happens next. Five big stories Middle East | Israeli strikes on a central Beirut medical centre have killed at least six people. Eight Israeli soldiers were killed and others wounded in three exchanges with Hezbollah militants inside Lebanon. Joe Biden said he would not support an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites, as the US sought to temper Israel\u2019s response to Iran\u2019s missile attack. Armed militant groups in the Iran-backed \u201caxis of resistance\u201d have called for further attacks against Israel. Labour | The Labour peer Waheed Alli is under investigation by a parliamentary watchdog over a potential breach of the code of conduct. Alli is being investigated after a complaint that he has not registered his interests correctly. Conservatives | The former home secretary James Cleverly has seized the momentum in the Conservative leadership contest, calling on his party to be \u201cmore normal\u201d after a tumultuous few days for his two main rivals, Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick. UK news | Two teachers who were stabbed repeatedly by a 13-year-old girl in a school playground in south Wales believed they were going to be killed in the attack, a jury has heard. Entertainment | One of two doctors charged in the investigation of the death of Matthew Perry pleaded guilty on Wednesday to conspiring to distribute the surgical anaesthetic ketamine. Mark Chavez, 54, is the third to plead guilty over the Friends star\u2019s fatal 2023 overdose. In depth: \u2018People are pleased that Keir Starmer wants to set a pro-European tone\u2019 After years of scratchy relations between the UK and the EU, culminating in the 2016 Brexit referendum and the long, painful divorce talks that followed, Jennifer says the Labour government\u2019s warmer approach is being welcomed. \u201cThere is enthusiasm and people are pleased that Keir Starmer wants to set a pro-European tone,\u201d she says. The prime minister, who was shadow Brexit secretary in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s top team, is also well known in Brussels, and as the author of a textbook on European human rights law understands the legal frameworks that underpin the way the EU functions. Starmer met the heads of all three of its key institutions \u2013 commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European council chair Charles Michel, and European parliament president Roberta Metsola \u2013 in what Jennifer took to be a sign of seriousness on the UK\u2019s part. There is some appreciation in Brussels too, she says, of the domestic challenges Starmer faces in confronting the forces of Euroscepticism \u2013 including former MEP Nigel Farage. Yet despite the positive mood music, and the mutual sympathy, Jennifer has significant doubts about whether Labour can achieve a closer relationship with the EU on the terms it hopes for. *** \u2018Setting the tone\u2019 One key stumbling block has already emerged. The EU wants to discuss the possibility of a youth mobility agreement, which could see a set number of young people travel to the UK and stay for a limited period, perhaps to study or work. The UK already has an arrangement like this with several other countries, including Australia and Canada \u2013 in these cases allowing 18- to 35-year-olds to come here and work for up to two years, provided they have a certain level of savings. Such a scheme could be reciprocal, allowing UK citizens to spend time in an EU country; but Labour has previously ruled out the idea, fearful that it could be portrayed as akin to \u201cfree movement\u201d, widely seen by politicians as one of the drivers of the discontent behind the Brexit vote. With Reform earning the third-most votes (but winning just five seats) in July\u2019s general election, Labour is wary of inflaming anti-migration sentiment. However, Jennifer says this issue could be key to opening up potential discussions on the post-Brexit relationship \u2013 because it would show that the UK is willing to meet the EU on its own terms. \u201cThe youth mobility scheme will be front and centre because it\u2019s really important for member states to have something tangible to show for improving the relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cGoing to the UK was always such a popular thing, especially for young people.\u201d Asked about a youth mobility scheme after yesterday\u2019s meetings, Starmer said it was \u201cnot a discussion that went into the details at this stage\u201d, but was rather about \u201csetting the parameters, setting the tone\u201d. *** A waiting game Rather than cross-channel youth exchanges, Labour hopes that foreign and security policy can be the starting point for conversations with the EU. The foreign secretary, David Lammy, has already met several of his EU counterparts and is keen to pursue an agreement on shared policy goals \u2013 including tackling the climate crisis, as well as aiding Ukraine. Jennifer says many EU diplomats welcome the notion of a foreign and security pact \u2013 Theresa May was negotiating such a deal as part of Brexit talks, before Boris Johnson ditched the idea. But she suggests the UK will have to make some more concrete proposals before much progress can be made. \u201cThere\u2019s a general sense of \u2018this is a good thing, but we need to see the detail\u2019 \u2013 so it\u2019s a bit of a waiting game.\u201d There were signs after Wednesday\u2019s talks that the two sides are starting to do the groundwork. A joint statement said the EU and UK would work \u201cat pace\u201d on an \u201cagenda of strengthened cooperation\u201d, mentioning issues including energy, security, resilience and the economy, with a UK-EU summit to be held \u201cideally early in 2025\u201d. *** Labour\u2019s red lines When it comes to the economic relationship, Labour\u2019s red lines \u2013 no to the single market, no to the customs union \u2013 will constrain its ambitions. Jennifer says even some of the limited changes proposed in the party\u2019s manifesto will be tricky to negotiate. Mutual recognition of professional qualifications, so that lawyers or bankers could work across the UK and the EU, is something the bloc does offer to some non-member states \u2013 but only after extensive negotiations. She points out that the EU recently agreed mutual recognition of architectural qualifications across member states, but it took three years to finalise. A veterinary agreement, aimed at cutting down checks at the EU border, is also a clear possibility \u2013 the EU has one with Switzerland, for example \u2013 but again it will take time. \u201cThere\u2019s a view here that it\u2019s a bit more complicated than it might appear at first glance and it\u2019s not something you can just stroll up and negotiate over a weekend.\u201d Similarly, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has suggested the UK seek \u201cbespoke\u201d arrangements with the EU in key industries such as chemicals, accepting EU regulations as the quid pro quo. But Jennifer believes that approach is unlikely to fly. \u201cThe EU have just said so many times that they want to protect the integrity of the single market,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce you start having an a la carte approach, their fear is that you start to pick holes in it.\u201d So while Keir Starmer may have left Brussels with the warm glow of a friendship rekindled, the detailed work is yet to begin, and Labour\u2019s self-imposed red lines will limit its room for manoeuvre. Nevertheless, Jennifer says, \u201cagainst all the difficulty and the complexity of all these issues, broadly people are appreciative of this new prime minister and hopeful that it could mean a better relationship\u201d.

Here\u2019s a snippet from Emma Graham-Harrison\u2019s earlier analysis:</p> \n  <p>The assassination of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was a tactical achievement that will hobble the group for now, and may cripple it longer term, but not a strategic one that will eliminate the threat to Israel from inside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon\">Lebanon</a>.</p> \n  <p>Israel has targeted generations of militant leaders, whose organisations survived or evolved after the assassinations. Both Nasrallah and the Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, killed earlier this year in Tehran, replaced leaders who had also been killed by Israel.</p> \n  <p>Attacks of the last few weeks have been particularly wide-ranging, taking out whole echelons of Hezbollah commanders. But even if the damage proved fatal to the group in its current form, its collapse would not offer any guarantee of greater security.</p> \n  <p>After the Palestine Liberation Organisation was forced out of Lebanon in the early 1980s, Hezbollah expanded there. Other conflicts offer grim examples.</p> \n  <p>Islamic State grew out of al-Qaida in Iraq. The US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/21/us-airstrike-taliban-leader-mullah-akhtar-mansoor\">killed the Taliban leader, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor</a>, in 2016 with a drone, hoping to pave the way for a peace deal; five years later, Taliban fighters swept into Kabul and took control of the country.</p> \n  <p>Nor do Israel\u2019s destructive opening salvoes against Hezbollah offer any guarantee it will win a longer war.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it \u201cconducted a precise strike in Beirut\u201d. An apparent Israeli airstrike started a fire in an apartment in the residential Bashoura district, AP reported, not far from the UN headquarters, the prime minister\u2019s office and parliament. There was no warning issued ahead of the strike.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said 46 people were killed and 85 were wounded in Israeli strikes on Lebanon in the past 24 hours. </strong>Israeli strikes have killed more than 1,000 people in Lebanon over the past two weeks, many of them women and children, according to the ministry.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israel will respond to Iran\u2019s missile attack and its forces can strike anywhere in the Middle East,</strong> its military chief said. \u201cWe have the capability to reach and strike every location in the Middle East and those of our enemies who have not yet understood this, will understand this soon,\u201d <strong>Herzi Halevi, </strong>chief of the general staff,<strong> </strong>said in a video on Wednesday. \u201cIran made a big mistake tonight \u2013 and it will pay for it.\u201d Israel\u2019s foreign minister <strong>Israel Katz </strong>threatened Israeli retaliation for Iran\u2019s \u201cbrutal\u201d missile attack.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Iran braced itself for likely Israeli attacks on its nuclear sites as the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urged the west to leave the Middle East. </strong>The unprecedented Iranian salvo of more than 180 ballistic missiles came less than 24 hours after the <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> ordered the largest ground incursion into southern Lebanon in a generation.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Amir Saied Iravani, said Tuesday\u2019s missile attacks against Israel were \u201cnecessary to restore balance and deterrence\u201d</strong>,<strong> </strong>adding that they were a \u201cproportionate response to Israel\u2019s continued terrorist aggressive acts over the past two months\u201d. \u201cExperience has proven that Israel only understands the language of force,\u201d he told the council as he defend Tehran\u2019s actions in line with the UN Charter. <strong>Abbas Araghchi,</strong> Iran\u2019s foreign minister, earlier made a round of diplomatic calls, insisting that Iran was not seeking escalation. Part of the purpose of Araghchi\u2019s calls was to convey the limits of the Iranian operation, and to urge the US and Europe to insist in turn that Israel show restraint in its response.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Joe Biden, the US president, said he would not support an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites,</strong> as the US sought to temper Israel\u2019s response to Iran\u2019s missile attack on Tuesday and contain a rapidly escalating regional conflict. Israel\u2019s prime minister, <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu, </strong>convened a meeting of his top security officials at the Israeli defence headquarters, the Kirya in Tel Aviv, on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the country\u2019s options after a round of conversations with Washington.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Biden and G7 leaders \u201cunequivocally\u201d condemned the Iranian missile attack on Israel during a call on Wednesday, </strong>the White House said. In a readout of the call, the White House said Biden joined the call with the G7 to discuss the Iranian attack and \u201cto coordinate on a response to this attack, including new sanctions\u201d.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>More than 70 people have been killed in a series of intensive ground operations and airstrikes by the Israel Defense Forces in southern Gaza,</strong> Palestinian medical officials said on Wednesday. The health ministry in Gaza said at least 51 people were killed and 82 wounded in the operation in Khan Younis that began early on Wednesday. Records at the European hospital show that seven women and 12 children, as young as 22 months old, were among those killed. Another 23 people, including two children, were killed in separate strikes across Gaza, according to local hospitals.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>At least 41,689 Palestinians have been killed and 96,625 others injured in Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip since 7 October, </strong>Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Wednesday. Israel has continued to strike what it says are militant targets across Gaza nearly a year after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack triggered the war in the territory, and even as attention has shifted to Lebanon and Iran.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The son-in-law of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was reportedly killed in an Israeli airstrike. </strong>The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that <strong>Hassan Jaafar Qasir</strong> was among three people killed by the attack, which flattened a building in the Mazzeh district, an area favoured by Hezbollah militants and officers of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Hamas\u2019s armed wing, the al-Qassam brigades, claimed responsibility for a shooting and knife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/something-terrible-has-happened-israelis-in-jaffa-recall-shock-of-terror-attack\">attack </a>in Tel Aviv on Tuesday that killed at least seven people. </strong>Across the country, there was a sense of apprehension on Wednesday as Israel vowed to retaliate against Iran for the missile strike.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Eight Israeli soldiers have been killed and a number of others wounded in three exchanges with Hezbollah in heavy fighting inside Lebanon,</strong> according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The deaths appeared to signify the first substantial clashes between IDF soldiers and Hezbollah since Israel said it had initiated a limited ground incursion into Lebanon to target Hezbollah\u2019s infrastructure along the border.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Hezbollah said it inflicted casualties on a group of Israeli soldiers attempting to assault the Lebanese village of Odaisseh, not far from the border. </strong>The Iran-backed group also said its fighters wounded and killed a group of Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon after detonating an explosive device. It also claimed it had destroyed three Israeli Merkava tanks with guided rockets in the Lebanese border town of Maroun el-Ras.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The IDF claimed to have destroyed \u201cover 150 terror infrastructures\u201d, which it said included \u201cHezbollah headquarters, weapons storage facilities and rocket launchers\u201d inside Lebanon.</strong> Israel\u2019s military also reported a continued barrage of projectiles fired into the country from Lebanon.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, on Wednesday condemned Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel, telling the security council the \u201cdeadly cycle of tit-for-tat violence must stop\u201d. </strong>\u201cTime is running out,\u201d he told the council. Earlier on Wednesday, Israel\u2019s foreign minister <strong>Israel Katz</strong> said he was barring Guterres from entering the country because he had not \u201cunequivocally\u201d condemned Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel. The UN has decried the Israeli government\u2019s decision to ban Guterres from entering the country as a \u201cpolitical statement\u201d and \u201cone more attack on the United Nations staff that we\u2019ve seen from the government of Israel\u201d.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>A charter flight to evacuate Britons from Lebanon landed in Birmingham late on Wednesday. </strong>The Dan Air plane landed at Birmingham international airport just before 8.40pm, having stopped off in Bucharest en route.

You can follow our new blog here The coincidental timing of an emergency meeting of Gulf foreign ministers in Doha with a visit to the same city by the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, for talks with Qatar\u2019s emir raises questions about how the Gulf states will react if Israel pushes ahead with its plan to use its recent military success not just to weaken Iran, but reorder the Middle East. This Sunni coalition of six Gulf monarchs is not naturally well disposed to Iran or its Shia proxies, and only in 2016 labelled Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation. But they also oppose further Israeli escalation, and believe it is ultimately only Washington that has the means to restrain the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. They insist the establishment of an independent Palestinian state is the only path to regional stability, integration and prosperity. \u201cPalestinian statehood is a prerequisite for peace, rather than its byproduct,\u201d the Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan wrote in Wednesday\u2019s Financial Times, without making any reference to the Israeli-Iran conflict, or the likelihood that Joe Biden, in the twilight of his presidency and a month out from an election, is going to put the thumbscrews on Israel. The reality is that Gulf state leaders, despite popular support in their countries for the Palestinian cause, are unlikely to change their own collective year-long strategy of not providing Palestinians anything other than humanitarian aid and political support. Almost all of the nearly half a million residents of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs have fled since last week, escaping Israeli bombing. Lebanese authorities say that nearly 1 million people have been displaced by the bombing over the last two weeks. \u201cIsrael is hitting the civilian population because they think it will break their will. But people don\u2019t want Israel to win, so they are saying that their will won\u2019t break,\u201d said Dr Ali Ahmad, a professor at the Lebanese University and a Dahiyeh resident who had accompanied international journalists on the Hezbollah-organised tour of the Beirut suburb. Though there was no guarantee of safety as Israeli drones buzzed overhead, many took advantage of the presence of international reporters to check on their homes. One resident, a dental assistant who was displaced to east Beirut by Israeli strikes, said she was hoping to catch a glimpse of her apartment building to see if it was still standing. Ahmad spoke as he stood at the foot of a building that had housed a Lebanese TV station, al-Sirat TV, levelled in an Israeli airstrike on Monday. Staffers at the channel said they were ordered to evacuate by Israel, which said it was being used to store Hezbollah weapons. Hezbollah\u2019s head of media relations, Mohammad Afif, speaking to the journalists, denied the claims. Israeli bombing of Dahiyeh has been an almost nightly occurrence since Friday, when dozens of 2,000lb bunker-busters used in airstrikes that killed the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and flattened a city block signalled the intensified campaign. Lebanon\u2019s foreign minister claims that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had agreed to a 21-day ceasefire pushed by the US and France just days before he was killed by Israel in a massive attack on Beirut. \u201cHe [Nasrallah] agreed, he agreed,\u201d Abdallah Bou Habib told Christiane Amanpour in an interview on CNN broadcast on Wednesday. He continued: We agreed completely. Lebanon agreed to a ceasefire but consulting with Hezbollah. The [Lebanese House] Speaker Mr Nabih Berri consulted with Hezbollah and we informed the Americans and the French what happened. And they told us that Mr. [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu also agreed on the statement that was issued by both presidents [Biden and Macron.] Habib said White House senior adviser Amos Hochstein was then set to go to Lebanon to negotiate the ceasefire. They told us that Mr Netanyahu agreed on this and so we also got the agreement of Hezbollah on that and you know what happened since then. Iran\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, was reported to have said on Sunday that Iran had refrained from retaliating for the Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran because of \u201centirely false\u201d US and European promises that a Gaza ceasefire was imminent. \u201cGiving such criminals more time will only embolden them to commit even more atrocities,\u201d he told a cabinet meeting according to Turkey\u2019s Anadolu news agency. Australian foreign minister Penny Wong has said her government has booked 500 seats on commercial aircraft for Australian citizens, permanent residents and their families to leave Lebanon on Saturday. The seats are available to the Australians and their families known to be in Lebanon on two flights from Beirut to Cyprus, Wong said. \u201cWhat I would say to Australians who wish to leave, please take whatever option is available to you,\u201d Wong told reporters, adding \u201cplease do not wait for your preferred route.\u201d Here\u2019s our full report on the latest developments: Israeli strikes on a central Beirut medical centre have killed at least six people, after Israel\u2019s military suffered its deadliest day on the Lebanese front in a year of clashes with Iran-backed Hezbollah. Residents in Beirut heard a missile flying above the city before hearing the sound of the explosion. Videos showed the floor of an apartment building burning. Residents living in nearby areas began to flee, driving away quickly in scooters and cars. The Israeli strike hit a medical centre belonging to the Hezbollah-linked Islamic Health Organisation in the early hours of Thursday. The attack was the second airstrike on central Beirut this week, with most strikes having previously been confined to suburbs in the city\u2019s south. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was targeting Beirut and issued evacuation warnings for various locations throughout the night. Three missiles also hit the southern suburb of Dahiyeh, where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed last week, and loud explosions were heard, Lebanese security officials said. At least six people were killed and seven wounded, Lebanese health officials said, adding that a further 46 people had been killed in Israeli attacks on the city in the previous 24 hours. A day after Iran fired more than 180 missiles into Israel, the wider region awaited Israel response to the attack, with US president Joe Biden saying he would not support an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites, as he attempted to contain a rapidly escalating regional conflict. Francesca Albanese, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian Territories, has offered a full-throated defence of UN security general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, after Israel announced it was barring him from entering the country on Wednesday. I express my solidarity to the UN Secretary General @antonioguterres, from the heart of his own country, Portugal - which I am visiting. We would not be here today, with unrestrained hubris is in full display, had Israel, in 76 years of history, been held accountable at least once. Not once has Israel faced consequences of its intl wrongdoings. Time to act to restore the primacy of intl law is now. A distant tomorrow may be too late. Israel\u2019s foreign minister Israel Katz declared the UN chief persona non grata and accused him of bias against the country and being an \u201canti-Israel secretary-general who lends support to terrorists\u201d. UN spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric later told reporters that Katz\u2019s declaration was \u201cone more attack on the United Nations staff that we\u2019ve seen from the government of Israel\u201d. After a fortnight of military triumph, what is Israel\u2019s endgame? Here\u2019s a snippet from Emma Graham-Harrison\u2019s earlier analysis: The assassination of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was a tactical achievement that will hobble the group for now, and may cripple it longer term, but not a strategic one that will eliminate the threat to Israel from inside Lebanon. Israel has targeted generations of militant leaders, whose organisations survived or evolved after the assassinations. Both Nasrallah and the Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, killed earlier this year in Tehran, replaced leaders who had also been killed by Israel. Attacks of the last few weeks have been particularly wide-ranging, taking out whole echelons of Hezbollah commanders. But even if the damage proved fatal to the group in its current form, its collapse would not offer any guarantee of greater security. After the Palestine Liberation Organisation was forced out of Lebanon in the early 1980s, Hezbollah expanded there. Other conflicts offer grim examples. Islamic State grew out of al-Qaida in Iraq. The US killed the Taliban leader, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor, in 2016 with a drone, hoping to pave the way for a peace deal; five years later, Taliban fighters swept into Kabul and took control of the country. Nor do Israel\u2019s destructive opening salvoes against Hezbollah offer any guarantee it will win a longer war. In 2003, the US-led invasion of Iraq swiftly toppled Saddam Hussein but paved the way for a bloody civil war and the rise of factions linked to Washington\u2019s regional foe, Iran. George W Bush\u2019s declaration of victory under a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner on an aircraft carrier was intended as an enduring image of American power, and became instead a icon of US hubris. The Palestinian news agency Wafa has more details on the deaths of Palestinians on Wednesday in Gaza, as Israel continues its deadly onslaught on the devastated territory. Citing figures from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, Wafa reported that in addition to the massacre in Khan Younis, where at least 12 children were killed, another ten people were killed in Israeli airstrikes on the Nuseirat and al-Bureij refugee camps in the central Strip. In Gaza City, nine civilians were killed in Israeli strikes on Muscat school and the al-Amal orphanage, which were housing displaced people. At least 20 people were injured in the attacks, Wafa reported. Another three people were killed in a raid on the town of Khuza\u2019a, east of Khan Younis, Wafa said. A child was killed and two other civilians injured when Israeli forces shelled a house belonging to the al-Helou family in the Tel Al-Hawa neighbourhood, south-west of Gaza City, on Wednesday evening, Wafa reported. It is not possible to independently verify death tolls in Gaza as Israel has barred foreign media from entering. More than 70 people have been killed in a series of intensive ground operations and airstrikes by the Israel Defense Forces in southern Gaza, Palestinian medical officials said on Wednesday. Israel has continued to strike what it says are militant targets across Gaza nearly a year after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack triggered the war in the territory, and even as attention has shifted to Lebanon and Iran. The health ministry in Gaza said at least 51 people were killed and 82 wounded in the operation in Khan Younis that began early on Wednesday. Records at the European hospital show that seven women and 12 children, as young as 22 months old, were among those killed. Another 23 people, including two children, were killed in separate strikes across Gaza, according to local hospitals. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has previously accused Hamas of exploiting civilian facilities for military purposes, a tactic the militant Islamist organisation denies using. A spokesperson for Nasser hospital said: \u201cYesterday, the Israeli army started a sudden ground operation in the eastern areas of Khan Younis. The areas were attacked with a very violent aerial bombardment \u2026 The martyrs and the wounded arrived at the European hospital and here.\u201d Residents said Israeli planes had carried out heavy airstrikes as its ground forces staged an incursion into three neighbourhoods in Khan Younis. Mahmoud al-Razd, who said four relatives were killed in the raids, described heavy destruction and said first responders had struggled to reach destroyed homes. \u201cThe explosions and shelling were massive,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people are thought to be under the rubble, and no one can retrieve them.\u201d US congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American in Congress and a fierce critic of US support for Israel, has also made an apparent comment on the death of Kamel Ahmad Jawad, a US resident who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Lebanon. In an Instagram post she said: We should be saving lives no matter faith or ethnicity. We should have used our leverage to demand a ceasefire. We have already lost one American who was the father of four. How many more have to die before our country stops sending more US bombs and funding this madness? If you\u2019re just joining us, Israeli airstrikes are still being reported across Beirut and the Lebanese health ministry says at least six people have been killed and seven injured in an Israeli attack on a health centre in the central suburb of Bachoura. It is a war crime to target health workers. The medical centre belonged to the Hezbollah-linked Islamic Health Organisation. It is the second time central Beirut has been targeted since Israel began its bombing campaign a couple of weeks ago. The area is home to the Lebanese parliament and the UN\u2019s regional headquarters. The southern district of Dahiyeh, which is where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed last week, has also been repeatedly targeted. The IDF has issued warnings to people in several neighbourhoods but in some cases these are reportedly not coming in time for people to flee. Israeli airstrikes have killed paramedics across Lebanon over the last two weeks, including airstrikes that killed 14 emergency health workers over the weekend. On Monday, six more paramedics were killed in the west Bekaa, all of them belonging to the Islamic Health Organisation. Israel has also been accused of targeting health workers in Gaza, including by killing them in airstrikes on hospitals and ambulances as well as arresting and torturing them. It denies targeting medics and claims Hamas uses civilians as human shields. Al Jazeera has reported some comments from the head of Hezbollah\u2019s media office, Mohammad Afif, in which he says the group is ready to \u201csacrifice our blood and soul for our homeland by the grace of God\u201d. Afif said the group had enough fighters, weapons and ammunition to push back against Israel, adding: \u201cWe assure you, the enemy, that this is only the first round. \u201cWhat happened in \u2026 Maroun al-Ras and other areas, including Odaisseh, was nothing but the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he said, referring to villages in southern Lebanon where deadly clashes apparently took place between the two sides on Wednesday. Afif also said Israel\u2019s air superiority would \u201cturn into losses on the ground\u201d. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has reiterated its support for Lebanon and called for the implementation of a 2006 UN resolution that calls for Lebanese troops and UN peacekeepers to be the only armed forces south of Lebanon\u2019s Litani river. Neither Israel nor Hezbollah has ever fully respected the resolution, which helped to end their 2006 conflict. In a statement issued after an extraordinary meeting in Doha, the GCC also noted it support for the 21-day ceasefire plan put forward by the US and France, shortly before Israel escalated the conflict further by launching a massive strike on Beirut that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The council, which is made up of countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, urged the international community to \u201cfulfill its responsibilities to maintain security and stability in the region\u201d. It condemned \u201cIsraeli aggression\u201d in Gaza and the West Bank and \u201creaffirmed the centrality of the Palestinian issue, the need to end Israeli occupation, and the support for the sovereignty of the Palestinian people over all Palestinian territories occupied since June 1967.\u201d The Israeli military says it has intercepted a \u201csuspicious aerial target\u201d off the coast of Tel Aviv. The death toll in the Israeli attack on a medical centre in the Bashoura neighbourhood of central Beirut has risen to five, AFP reports citing Lebanese health officials. BBC correspondent Nafiseh Kohnavard is reporting a further two Israeli airstrikes on the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh. A US resident from Dearborn, Michigan, has been killed in Lebanon, the American government has said according to Reuters, with the man\u2019s friend and neighbours saying he died in an Israeli airstrike. \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the death of Kamel Ahmad Jawad and our hearts go out to his family and friends. His death is a tragedy, as are the deaths of many civilians in Lebanon,\u201d a White House spokesperson said. The US has supported Israel in its attacks on Lebanon, even as it calls for diplomacy and even as civilians including children are killed. Jawad was in Lebanon taking care of his elderly mother, according to the Detroit News. His friend Hamzah Raza and local Dearborn groups said on social media that Jawad was killed in an Israeli air strike and called him \u201cone of the kindest and most generous humans.\u201d Reuters was unable to confirm the circumstances of Jawad\u2019s death. Earlier in the day, a state department spokesperson, when asked about reports of an American\u2019s death in Lebanon, said: \u201cIt\u2019s our understanding that it was a legal permanent resident, not an American citizen [who got killed in Lebanon] but we obviously offer our sincerest condolences to the family.\u201d Israel\u2019s recent military campaign in Lebanon has killed hundreds, wounded thousands and displaced over a million. Israel claims it is targeting Iran-backed Hezbollah militants. Here are some of the latest pictures coming to us of the devastation in Beirut caused by Israeli attacks: The IDF\u2019s Arabic language spokesperson has issued another warning to residents of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, warning people in the vicinity of a particular building in the suburb of Hadath to flee and posting a map. They have also issued warnings to people in the neighbourhoods of Haret Hreik and Burj al-Barajneh. More on that Israeli strike on the medical centre in central Beirut: two people were killed and 11 wounded, according to an initial report by the Lebanese ministry of health. An apparent Israeli airstrike hit a medical centre belonging to the Hezbollah-linked \u201cIslamic Health Organisation\u201d in central Beirut, in the early hours of Thursday morning. The strike was the second airstrike on central Beirut this week, with most attacks previously having been confined to suburbs south of the city. Residents of Beirut heard a missile flying above the city before hearing the sound of the explosion. Videos showed the floor of an apartment building burning. Residents living in nearby areas began to flee, driving away quickly in scooters and cars. Israeli airstrikes have killed paramedics across Lebanon over the last two weeks, including airstrikes that killed 14 emergency health workers over the weekend. On Monday, six more paramedics were killed in the west Bekaa, all of them belonging to the Islamic Health Organisation. Most of the paramedics killed by Israeli bombing since the beginning of the war were affiliated with Islamic health services, whether Hezbollah or other parties. International human rights groups have stressed that the killing of any healthcare workers is unlawful, regardless of political affiliation, as long as they are not taking part in combat or facilitating it. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: Israel launched more airstrikes on Beirut, including in the centre of the Lebanese capital, early on Thursday. Multiple explosions were heard in Dahieh, a suburb in southern Beirut, and one huge blast near the downtown. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it \u201cconducted a precise strike in Beirut\u201d. An apparent Israeli airstrike started a fire in an apartment in the residential Bashoura district, AP reported, not far from the UN headquarters, the prime minister\u2019s office and parliament. There was no warning issued ahead of the strike. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said 46 people were killed and 85 were wounded in Israeli strikes on Lebanon in the past 24 hours. Israeli strikes have killed more than 1,000 people in Lebanon over the past two weeks, many of them women and children, according to the ministry. Israel will respond to Iran\u2019s missile attack and its forces can strike anywhere in the Middle East, its military chief said. \u201cWe have the capability to reach and strike every location in the Middle East and those of our enemies who have not yet understood this, will understand this soon,\u201d Herzi Halevi, chief of the general staff, said in a video on Wednesday. \u201cIran made a big mistake tonight \u2013 and it will pay for it.\u201d Israel\u2019s foreign minister Israel Katz threatened Israeli retaliation for Iran\u2019s \u201cbrutal\u201d missile attack. Iran braced itself for likely Israeli attacks on its nuclear sites as the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urged the west to leave the Middle East. The unprecedented Iranian salvo of more than 180 ballistic missiles came less than 24 hours after the Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the largest ground incursion into southern Lebanon in a generation. Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Amir Saied Iravani, said Tuesday\u2019s missile attacks against Israel were \u201cnecessary to restore balance and deterrence\u201d, adding that they were a \u201cproportionate response to Israel\u2019s continued terrorist aggressive acts over the past two months\u201d. \u201cExperience has proven that Israel only understands the language of force,\u201d he told the council as he defend Tehran\u2019s actions in line with the UN Charter. Abbas Araghchi, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, earlier made a round of diplomatic calls, insisting that Iran was not seeking escalation. Part of the purpose of Araghchi\u2019s calls was to convey the limits of the Iranian operation, and to urge the US and Europe to insist in turn that Israel show restraint in its response. Joe Biden, the US president, said he would not support an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites, as the US sought to temper Israel\u2019s response to Iran\u2019s missile attack on Tuesday and contain a rapidly escalating regional conflict. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, convened a meeting of his top security officials at the Israeli defence headquarters, the Kirya in Tel Aviv, on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the country\u2019s options after a round of conversations with Washington. Biden and G7 leaders \u201cunequivocally\u201d condemned the Iranian missile attack on Israel during a call on Wednesday, the White House said. In a readout of the call, the White House said Biden joined the call with the G7 to discuss the Iranian attack and \u201cto coordinate on a response to this attack, including new sanctions\u201d. More than 70 people have been killed in a series of intensive ground operations and airstrikes by the Israel Defense Forces in southern Gaza, Palestinian medical officials said on Wednesday. The health ministry in Gaza said at least 51 people were killed and 82 wounded in the operation in Khan Younis that began early on Wednesday. Records at the European hospital show that seven women and 12 children, as young as 22 months old, were among those killed. Another 23 people, including two children, were killed in separate strikes across Gaza, according to local hospitals. At least 41,689 Palestinians have been killed and 96,625 others injured in Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip since 7 October, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Wednesday. Israel has continued to strike what it says are militant targets across Gaza nearly a year after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack triggered the war in the territory, and even as attention has shifted to Lebanon and Iran. The son-in-law of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was reportedly killed in an Israeli airstrike. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Hassan Jaafar Qasir was among three people killed by the attack, which flattened a building in the Mazzeh district, an area favoured by Hezbollah militants and officers of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Hamas\u2019s armed wing, the al-Qassam brigades, claimed responsibility for a shooting and knife attack in Tel Aviv on Tuesday that killed at least seven people. Across the country, there was a sense of apprehension on Wednesday as Israel vowed to retaliate against Iran for the missile strike. Eight Israeli soldiers have been killed and a number of others wounded in three exchanges with Hezbollah in heavy fighting inside Lebanon, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The deaths appeared to signify the first substantial clashes between IDF soldiers and Hezbollah since Israel said it had initiated a limited ground incursion into Lebanon to target Hezbollah\u2019s infrastructure along the border. Hezbollah said it inflicted casualties on a group of Israeli soldiers attempting to assault the Lebanese village of Odaisseh, not far from the border. The Iran-backed group also said its fighters wounded and killed a group of Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon after detonating an explosive device. It also claimed it had destroyed three Israeli Merkava tanks with guided rockets in the Lebanese border town of Maroun el-Ras. The IDF claimed to have destroyed \u201cover 150 terror infrastructures\u201d, which it said included \u201cHezbollah headquarters, weapons storage facilities and rocket launchers\u201d inside Lebanon. Israel\u2019s military also reported a continued barrage of projectiles fired into the country from Lebanon. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, on Wednesday condemned Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel, telling the security council the \u201cdeadly cycle of tit-for-tat violence must stop\u201d. \u201cTime is running out,\u201d he told the council. Earlier on Wednesday, Israel\u2019s foreign minister Israel Katz said he was barring Guterres from entering the country because he had not \u201cunequivocally\u201d condemned Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel. The UN has decried the Israeli government\u2019s decision to ban Guterres from entering the country as a \u201cpolitical statement\u201d and \u201cone more attack on the United Nations staff that we\u2019ve seen from the government of Israel\u201d. A charter flight to evacuate Britons from Lebanon landed in Birmingham late on Wednesday. The Dan Air plane landed at Birmingham international airport just before 8.40pm, having stopped off in Bucharest en route. Beirut\u2019s international airport remains open but ministers and officials are preparing contingency plans for sea and air rescues via Cyprus should the security situation in Lebanon deteriorate to the point at which commercial flights are stopped. Thousands of foreign nationals have left Lebanon since Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah just over a fortnight ago. Slovakia is preparing to evacuate its nationals from Lebanon, and has received permission from the Lebanese government to use a military plane for the purpose. China\u2019s state-owned news agency Xinhua reported that over 200 Chinese nationals have been evacuated from Lebanon. The US state department said it organised a flight from Beirut to Istanbul on Wednesday to allow Americans to leave Lebanon. French nationals in Iran have been recommended to leave temporarily once international air traffic resumes. Germany\u2019s foreign ministry also urged its citizens to leave Iran. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah to flee Lebanon days before he was killed in an Israeli strike last week, according to a report. In the immediate aftermath of the attack that targeted pagers used by Hezbollah members on 17 September, Khamenei sent a message with an envoy to beseech Nasrallah to leave Lebanon for Iran, a senior Iranian official told Reuters. An Israeli strike hit within Beirut\u2019s city limits, not far from downtown, a security source told Reuters. A Lebanese security source told the BBC that a cruise missile was fired from the sea at a \u201chealth centre\u201d belonging to Hezbollah in Salim Slam street close to downtown Beirut. The BBC said Israeli media reported that Israeli warships in the Mediterranean sea are targeting the Lebanese capital. A massive blast was heard across Beirut just now, according to multiple reports. From Timour Azhari of Reuters: And the BBC\u2019s Nafiseh Kohnavard: A charter plane carrying British nationals from Lebanon has landed in Birmingham. The plane touched down at Birmingham international airport shortly before 8.40pm local time, PA News reported. It departed from Beirut early on Wednesday and stopped off in Bucharest. A separate scheduled Middle East Airlines service also brought Britons back to the UK. Further flights are planned for Thursday and over the coming days, according to the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, David Lammy. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said 46 people were killed and 85 were wounded in Israeli strikes on Lebanon in the past 24 hours. Israeli strikes have killed more than 1,000 people in Lebanon over the past two weeks, many of them women and children, according to the ministry. The son-in-law of Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah who was killed last week in a massive Israeli strike in Beirut, has also been killed in an Israeli raid in Damascus on Wednesday, according to a report. Hassan Jaafar al-Qasir was \u201camong two Lebanese victims of the Israeli raid which targeted an apartment in a residential building in the Al Mazzeh district of the Syrian capital\u201d, AFP reported, citing the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A source close to Hezbollah confirmed the report to the news agency. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has confirmed it is carrying out a \u201ctargeted\u201d airstrike in Beirut. \u201cThe IDF conducted a precise strike in Beirut,\u201d the IDF said in a statement. It said more details would follow. Three huge explosions have been reported from Beirut\u2019s southern suburb, with footage posted to social media showing a large plume of smoke over the area. From AP\u2019s Ali Hashem: And the BBC\u2019s Nafiseh Kohnavard: Several loud explosions have been reported in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Reports are trickling in that an Israeli airstrike in Damascus today may have killed Hassan Jaafar Qasir, the son-in-law of Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah whom Israel killed last Friday in southern Beirut. Hassan Jaafar Qasir is the brother of Muhammad Jaafar Qasir. He was killed in another Israeli strike on Beirut yesterday that took place during the brief flurry when Iran launched almost 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted. The Jerusalem Post has just published this snippet, citing Sky News Arabic, and telling its readers to await developments. The Guardian has not yet independently verified this news. Hadi Hachem told the emergency meeting of the UN security council today that the Lebanese government wants the enforcement of a UN security council resolution that was supposed to end the last Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. It called for all armed groups, including Hezbollah, to be disarmed and the deployment of Lebanese forces to the southern border with Israel. None of this has happened, the Associated Press reports. The Lebanese ambassador said fully implementing the resolution is the only solution to the ongoing war and Israel\u2019s \u201cbarbaric aggression\u201d. He said Lebanon is opening enlistment for 1,500 new soldiers to strengthen the national army\u2019s presence in the south. Lebanon today is stuck between the Israeli destruction machine and the ambitions of others in the region,\u201d Hachem said, alluding to Iran\u2019s support for Hezbollah. Lebanon\u2019s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Hadi Hachem, says the country wants to ramp up the nation\u2019s military presence in the south of the country, where Lebanon meets its neighbor Israel, in an effort to end the current conflict with Israel. Lebanon\u2019s official military is separate from, and much weaker than, the forces of the most potent body in the country, Hezbollah. Speaking at the UN security council meeting in New York today, convened to try to reduce rising aggression in the Middle East in recent days, Hachem said the Lebanese people and government \u201creject the war\u201d, referring to the attacks by Israel in response to the many months of weapons launches at Israel by Hezbollah, in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza, its fellow Iran-backed proxy, Al Jazeera reported. Lebanon wants to deploy troops along \u201cour ground borders\u201d, with the support of the UN, he said. The UN has decried the Israeli government\u2019s decision to ban its secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, from entering the country. Earlier today, Israel\u2019s foreign minister Israel Katz declared the UN chief persona non grata and accused him of being an \u201canti-Israel secretary-general who lends support to terrorists\u201d. UN spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric later told reporters that Katz\u2019s declaration was \u201cone more attack on the United Nations staff that we\u2019ve seen from the government of Israel\u201d. Dujarric said that the UN chief has repeatedly condemned the Hamas attacks and sexual violence, and stressed that the UN still engages with Israel \u201cat the operational level and other levels\u201d. The UN is making preparations for a second round of polio vaccinations for about 640,000 children in the Gaza Strip to start in mid-October, according to the UN\u2019s spokesperson, St\u00e9phane Dujarric. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, personally ordered a barrage of about 200 missiles to be fired at Israel on Tuesday, a senior Iranian official told Reuters. Tuesday\u2019s missile attack on Israel was in retaliation for the deaths of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Abbas Nilforoushan, the Revolutionary Guards said in a statement. The news agency reported that sources told them that Nasrallah\u2019s assassination \u2013 as well as the weeks of Israeli strikes that have destroyed weapons sites, eliminated half of Hezbollah\u2019s leadership council and decimated its top military command \u2013 has led to Iran\u2019s fears for the safety of its supreme leader and loss of trust within Hezbollah and Iran\u2019s establishment. This has resulted in a situation that could complicate the effective functioning of Iran\u2019s ani-Israel Axis of Resistance alliance, the agency reported. It is also making it hard for Hezbollah to choose a new leader, fearing the ongoing infiltration will put the successor at risk, according to Lebanese sources. Nasrallah\u2019s assassination has spread mistrust between Tehran and Hezbollah, and within Hezbollah, an Iranian official told Reuters. \u201cThe trust that held everything together has disappeared,\u201d they said. Khamenei, who has remained in a secure location inside Iran since Saturday, \u201cno longer trusts anyone\u201d, a source close to the Iranian establishment said. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned the head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, to flee Lebanon days before he was killed in an Israeli strike last week, according to a report. In the immediate aftermath of the attack that targeted pagers used by Hezbollah members on 17 September, Khamenei sent a message with an envoy to beseech Nasrallah to leave Lebanon for Iran, a senior Iranian official has told Reuters. Khamenei, in his message to Nasrallah, cited intelligence that suggested Israel had operatives within Hezbollah and was planning to kill him, the source said. According to the source, the messenger was a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander, Brig Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, who was with Nasrallah in his bunker when it was hit by Israeli bombs and was also killed. US officials are not privately trying to persuade Israel to hold back on retaliating against Iran following Tuesday\u2019s missile attack, CNN is reporting, citing two senior US officials. A senior Biden administration official said: No one\u2019s saying don\u2019t respond. No one\u2019s saying \u2018take the win.\u2019 The Biden administration currently assesses that it is unlikely Israel would strike Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, CNN reported. One senior official said Israel still hasn\u2019t decided, adding: They are doing the smart thing and taking a beat and thinking about it. \u201cThey have the [Rosh Hashanah] holiday so that buys time and space,\u201d one senior US official said. Qatar\u2019s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, has said that Doha will continue mediation efforts to end the war in Gaza amid a heightening of regional tensions. The Qatari emir, at a joint press conference on Wednesday with Iran\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said Doha had warned of escalation in Lebanon since the beginning of the war in Gaza. Pezeshkian insisted that Iran is \u201cnot looking for war\u201d but pledged a stronger response if Israel retaliates for its missile attack. He told reporters: If [Israel] wants to react, we will have a stronger response, this is what the Islamic Republic is committed to. We are not looking for war, it is Israel that forces us to react. A meeting of Israel\u2019s security cabinet convened by Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday agreed that it would respond forcefully to Iran\u2019s missile attack on Tuesday, according to Israeli media. An image shared by the Israeli prime minister\u2019s office showed Netanyahu meeting with the director of Shin Bet, Ronen Bar; the Mossad director David Barnea; Israel\u2019s chief of staff, Maj Gen Herzi Halevi; and defence minister Yoav Gallant. Israel\u2019s response to Iran\u2019s missile attack will aim to cause \u201csignificant financial damage\u201d, the Times of Israel reported, citing an Israeli source. The feeling is that the response \u201cmust be significant, and it must come soon\u201d, the source said. The US state department said it organised a flight from Beirut to Istanbul on Wednesday to allow Americans to leave Lebanon. About 7,000 US citizens in Lebanon had registered with the US government to receive information about leaving the country, US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a briefing. The flight on Wednesday had a capacity of about 300 and carried about 100 Americans and their family members, he said. The US hopes to organise more flights in the coming days, he added. Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Amir Saied Iravani, said Tuesday\u2019s missile attacks against Israel were a \u201cproportionate response to Israel\u2019s continued terrorist aggressive acts over the past two months\u201d that was \u201cnecessary to restore balance and deterrence\u201d. The strikes on Tuesday were in full accordance with Tehran\u2019s \u201cinherent right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter and a direct response to the regime\u2019s repeated acts of aggression against Iran, including the violation of Iran\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity during the past months\u201d, the UN reported him saying. \u201cExperience has proven that Israel only understands the language of force,\u201d he told the council, adding that \u201cdiplomacy has repeatedly failed as Israel views restraint not as a gesture of goodwill, but as a weakness to exploit\u201d. He added: Iran is fully prepared to take further defensive measures, if necessary, to protect its legitimate interests and defend its territorial integrity and sovereignty against any acts of military aggression and the illegal use of force. He further condemned the \u201cUS regime\u201d for their aim to \u201cembolden Israel\u2019s criminal actions\u201d through their military support and political backing, thereby paralysing the security council from effective decision-making, and called on the council to act. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, has urged the UN\u2019s security council to condemn Iran\u2019s \u201cunprovoked\u201d missile attack on Israel and impose \u201cserious consequences\u201d. Addressing the council on Wednesday, Thomas-Greenfield described Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel as a \u201csignificant escalation\u201d of tensions in the Middle East. She said: Let me be clear: The Iranian regime will be held responsible for its actions. And we strongly warn against Iran \u2013 or its proxies \u2013 taking actions against the United States, or further actions against Israel. She reiterated US support for Israel and blamed Iran\u2019s support of its proxies for contributing to the crises in Gaza and Lebanon. Hamas\u2019s armed wing, the al-Qassam brigades, has claimed responsibility for a shooting and knife attack in Tel Aviv on Tuesday that killed at least seven people. Several others were injured when a gunman opened fire at members of the public in the Jaffa area of the Israeli capital. Local police said the attack began in a rail carriage and continued on the platform. The gunman and another attacker armed with a knife were \u201cneutralised\u201d by members of the public, it said. In a statement on Wednesday, the al-Qassam brigades said it took responsibility for the operation. Joe Biden, the US president, has said he does not support an attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites as Israel vowed to respond to Iran\u2019s missile attack on Tuesday. \u201cThe answer is no,\u201d he said in response to the question. We\u2019ll be discussing with the Israelis what they\u2019re going to do, but all seven of us [G7 nations] agree that they have a right to respond but they should respond proportionally. Biden also told reporters that there would be more sanctions imposed on Iran and said he would speak \u201crelatively soon\u201d with the Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu. Here\u2019s the clip: Joe Biden joined a call with G7 leaders on Wednesday to coordinate a response to Iran\u2019s attack on Israel, according to the White House. In a readout of the call, the White House said Biden joined the call with the G7 to discuss the Iranian attack and \u201cto coordinate on a response to this attack, including new sanctions\u201d. It added: President Biden and the G7 unequivocally condemned Iran\u2019s attack against Israel. Biden expressed the US\u2019s \u201cfull solidarity and support\u201d to Israel and reaffirmed his country\u2019s \u201cironclad commitment to Israel\u2019s security\u201d, the statement continued. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: Israel will respond to Iran\u2019s missile attack and its forces can strike anywhere in the Middle East, its military chief said. \u201cWe have the capability to reach and strike every location in the Middle East and those of our enemies who have not yet understood this, will understand this soon,\u201d Herzi Halevi, chief of the general staff, said in a video on Wednesday. \u201cIran made a big mistake tonight \u2013 and it will pay for it,\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu told a meeting of his security cabinet late on Tuesday. Israel\u2019s foreign minister Israel Katz threatened Israeli retaliation for Iran\u2019s \u201cbrutal\u201d missile attack. Iran is bracing itself for likely Israeli attacks on its nuclear sites as the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urged the west to leave the Middle East. The unprecedented Iranian salvo of more than 180 ballistic missiles came less than 24 hours after the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu ordered the largest ground incursion into southern Lebanon in a generation. Abbas Araghchi, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, made a round of diplomatic calls, insisting that Iran was not seeking escalation. Unlike Israeli attacks in Lebanon, Iran\u2019s targets had been strictly military and not civilian, he claimed. Part of the purpose of Araghchi\u2019s calls was to convey the limits of the Iranian operation, and to urge the US and Europe to insist in turn that Israel show restraint in its response. At a meeting of the UN security council in New York later on Wednesday Iran is expected to defend its actions in line with the UN Charter. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that seven more of its soldiers have been killed in a series of clashes with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon on Wednesday. The commandos were all killed during a gun battle with Hezbollah operatives in a southern Lebanon village, according to a report. The deaths mark the first significant casualties taken by the IDF since Israel launched its ground incursion into Lebanon earlier this week. Earlier, the IDF said another soldier had died during the campaign, bringing the total death toll to eight. The IDF claimed to have destroyed \u201cover 150 terror infrastructures\u201d which it said included \u201cHezbollah headquarters, weapons storage facilities and rocket launchers\u201d inside Lebanon. Israel\u2019s military also reported a continued barrage of projectiles fired into the country from Lebanon. Three people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a neighbourhood in western Damascus on Wednesday, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The strike was the second in as many days on the Mezzah suburb in the western part of the Syrian capital. Wednesday\u2019s strike hit about 500 metres from Tuesday\u2019s strike. Israeli media reported that Israel\u2019s military said Iran did succeed in striking Israeli airbases with missiles during yesterday\u2019s attack, but the attack was \u201cineffective\u201d. No aircraft were damaged and the Israeli air force (IAF) was able to continue to operate, it said. Impacts were said to have damaged office buildings and other maintenance areas. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, on Wednesday condemned Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel, telling the security council the \u201cdeadly cycle of tit-for-tat violence must stop\u201d. \u201cTime is running out,\u201d he told the council. Earlier on Wednesday, Israel\u2019s foreign minister said he was barring Guterres from entering the country because he had not \u201cunequivocally\u201d condemned Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel. The US will focus its engagements with the Israelis to try to align its perspectives on any potential response to the Iranian attack on Israel, the US deputy secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, said on Wednesday. He said the Middle East region was at \u201ca moment of peril\u201d and \u201con a knife\u2019s edge\u201d. John Healey, the UK defence secretary, said two RAF Typhoon jets were in the air \u201cready to engage\u201d in the Middle East on Tuesday night as Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel, but they had no suitable targets to hit. In a carefully worded statement on Tuesday night, Healy suggested British forces were involved in thwarting Iran\u2019s missile attack against Israel. He also said he had spoken to his Israeli opposite number, Yoav Gallant, on Wednesday morning and had assured him \u201cwe totally condemn the Iranian missile attacks overnight, and we will stand steadfast with Israel in their right to security\u201d. Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip killed at least 60 Palestinians overnight, including in a school sheltering displaced families, medics in the territory said. Gaza\u2019s health ministry said Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 41,689 Palestinians and wounded 96,625 since 7 October. The UK\u2019s foreign secretary, David Lammy, said on Wednesday the first charter flight taking British nationals out of Lebanon has departed. \u201cWe have arranged another flight for tomorrow, and further flights over the coming days for as long as there is demand and it is safe to do so,\u201d he said, adding that British nationals still in Lebanon should register with the Foreign Office and leave the country immediately. French nationals in Iran have been recommended to leave temporarily once international air traffic resumes. The French embassy in Iran said French citizens who are permanent citizens in the country or visiting Iran should leave immediately. Germany\u2019s foreign ministry also urged its citizens to leave Iran. Slovakia is preparing to evacuate its nationals from Lebanon, and has received permission from the Lebanese government to use a military plane for the purpose. China\u2019s state-owned news agency Xinhua reported that over 200 Chinese nationals have been evacuated from Lebanon. Bosnia said it had raised its security alert level for weapons and ammunition storage facilities over concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could affect the Balkan country\u2019s stability. Defence minister Zukan Helez said measures were preventive and \u201cthe security situation in our country is stable and there is no information or indication that it will be disturbed\u201d. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of involvement in two explosions near the Israeli embassy in Copenhagen in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Three people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a neighbourhood in western Damascus on Wednesday, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The strike was the second in as many days on the Mezzah suburb in the western part of the Syrian capital. Wednesday\u2019s strike hit about 500 metres from Tuesday\u2019s strike, AFP reported. At least three people were killed, two of them foreigners, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It said: An Israeli airstrike targeted a flat in a residential building in the Mazzeh neighbourhood frequented by Hezbollah leaders and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Six people were killed in the Israeli strike on Tuesday, it said. They included three civilians and three Iran-backed fighters, one of them from Hezbollah, it said. According to the Syrian state-run Sana news agency, a military source said that \u201cthe Israeli enemy launched an airstrike \u2026 targeting one of the residential buildings in the Mezzah neighbourhood\u201d. Three civilians were killed and three wounded, the source said. The US deputy secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, said the Biden administration will focus its engagements with the Israelis over the next few days to try to align its perspectives on any potential response to the Iranian attack on Israel. Campbell described the current situation in the Middle East as \u201ca moment of peril\u201d at a virtual event by the Carnegie Endowment on Wednesday, Reuters reported. He said: I think we recognise as important as a response of some kind should be, there is a recognition that the region is really on a knife\u2019s edge, and real concerns about an even broader escalation or a continuing one. France\u2019s embassy in Iran recommended on Wednesday that French nationals who are permanent residents in the country should leave temporarily once international air traffic resumes, because of heightened tensions in the Middle East. The message from the embassy, which also urged French nationals visiting Iran to leave immediately, is similar to messages given earlier this year when tensions increased between Iran and Israel. John Healey, the UK defence secretary, said that two RAF Typhoon jets were in the air \u201cready to engage\u201d in the Middle East on Tuesday night as Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel, but they had no suitable targets to hit. The fighter planes had previously shot down Iranian drones in April, during a previous attack by Tehran, but on this occasion were not needed because Typhoons do not have the capability to eliminate high speed ballistic missiles. \u201cThe nature of the attack was different. Last night, UK planes were in the skies. They were ready to engage. They did not need to do so,\u201d the defence minister said on a visit to the RAF Akrotiri base Cyprus, where British air crews are stationed. Healey said that he had spoken to his Israeli opposite number Yoav Gallant on Wednesday morning and had assured him \u201cwe totally condemn the Iranian missile attacks overnight, and we will stand steadfast with Israel in their right to security\u201d. The UK\u2019s major concern, he added, was that \u201cto avoid this conflict spiralling into a wider regional war\u201d and he said he urged Gallant to support plans for a 21-day ceasefire, though there is no sign of either side calling a halt to fighting. Bosnia said on Wednesday it had raised its security alert level for weapons and ammunition storage facilities over concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could affect the Balkan country\u2019s stability. \u201cSadly, we are seeing an escalation of war events in the Middle East and in Ukraine, with potential reflections on Bosnia and Herzegovina,\u201d defence minister Zukan Helez wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cI have ordered increased security measures for command facilities, units, facilities and storage of weapons and ammunition \u2026in order to protect the [personnel], facilities and material assets.\u201d In his post, Helez said measures were preventive and \u201cthe security situation in our country is stable and there is no information or indication that it will be disturbed\u201d. Hezbollah said on Wednesday it had destroyed three Israeli Merkava tanks with guided rockets in the Lebanese border town of Maroun el-Ras. Israel will respond to Iran\u2019s missile attack and its forces can strike anywhere in the Middle East, its military chief said on Wednesday. \u201cWe will respond. We can locate important targets and we can hit them precisely and powerfully,\u201d said the Chief of the General Staff Herzi Halevi, in a video from an air force base in central Israel, one day after Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel. \u201cWe have the capability to reach and strike every location in the Middle East and those of our enemies who have not yet understood this, will understand this soon.\u201d The Israel Defense Forces have announced that seven more of its soldiers have been killed in a series of clashes with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon on Wednesday. The deaths mark the first significant casualties taken by the IDF since Israel launched its ground incursion into Lebanon earlier this week. Earlier, the IDF said another soldier had died during the campaign, bringing the total death toll to eight. The soldiers who were named on Wednesday include four members of a commando unit, two members of a reconnaissance unit, and one member of the engineering corps. The commandos were all killed during a gun battle with Hezbollah operatives in a southern Lebanon village, according to a report in the Times of Israel. Five other soldiers were seriously wounded in the incident. Hezbollah earlier on Wednesday claimed that it had killed a \u201clarge number\u201d of Israeli soldiers during some of the first direct clashes between the two sides since the Israeli operation began late on Monday evening. A spokesperson for the group accused the IDF of orchestrating a \u201ccover-up\u201d to prevent public opinion from turning against the war. The ground incursion into southern Lebanon is Israel\u2019s largest since it fought a 2006 war against Hezbollah. That war ended with an Israeli in large part due to mounting casualties among Israeli troops. United Nations secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres on Wednesday condemned Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel, telling the security council the \u201cdeadly cycle of tit-for-tat violence must stop.\u201d \u201cTime is running out,\u201d he told the council. The 15-member council met after Israel killed the leader of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah and began a ground assault against the Iran-backed militant group and Iran attacked Israel in a strike that raised fears of a wider war in the Middle East. \u201cI again strongly condemn yesterday\u2019s massive missile attack by Iran on Israel,\u201d Guterres told the council. Earlier on Wednesday, Israel\u2019s foreign minister said he was barring Guterres from entering the country because he had not \u201cunequivocally\u201d condemned Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel, Reuters reported. In a letter to the security council on Tuesday, Iran justified its attack on Israel as self-defence under article 51 of the founding UN charter, citing \u201caggressive actions\u201d by Israel including violations of Iran\u2019s sovereignty. \u201cIran \u2026 in full compliance with the principle of distinction under international humanitarian law, has only targeted the regime\u2019s military and security installations with its defensive missile strikes,\u201d Iran wrote to the council. The UK\u2019s foreign secretary David Lammy said the first charter flight taking British nationals out of Lebanon has now departed. \u201cWe have arranged another flight for tomorrow, and further flights over the coming days for as long as there is demand and it is safe to do so,\u201d he added. He urged British nationals still in Lebanon to register with the Foreign Office and leave the country immediately. In a statement the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has confirmed that two Royal Air Force Typhoon fighter jets and a Voyager air-to-air refuelling tanker took part in defending Israel against Iranian missiles yesterday. It said: Last night, two Royal Air Force Typhoon fighter jets and a Voyager air-to-air refuelling tanker played their part in attempts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East, demonstrating the UK\u2019s unwavering commitment to Israel\u2019s security. Due to the nature of this attack, they did not engage any targets, but they played an important part in wider deterrence and efforts to prevent further escalation. The defence secretary has thanked our personnel involved in the response. The UK\u2019s recently appointed defence secretary, John Healey, has been at the UK\u2019s RAF Akrotiri base on Cyprus today. Here are some of the latest images from Beirut in Lebanon, which has been repeatedly targeted by Israeli airstrikes in the last few days. Reuters has a quick snap that Slovakia is preparing to evacuate its nationals from Lebanon, and has received permission from the Lebanese government to use a military plane for the purpose. The IDF has announced that the Home Front Command is relaxing some restrictions in northern Israel and the Golan Heights, permitting gatherings of up to 50 people outside. The previous restriction was 10 people only. Hezbollah has claimed, according to reports in Israeli media, that it targeted an Israeli unit with an explosive device near the southern Lebanon border village of Yaroun. It claims there were casualties. Earlier Israel announced the death of one soldier killed in combat inside Lebanon. More details soon \u2026 An unspecified number of the Iranian missiles fired against Israel on Tuesday night impacted near Israeli airbases, damaging office buildings and other maintenance areas but not aircraft or personnel. The admission changes the understanding of the Iranian attack, which it said had been aimed at Israeli military facilities including two sprawling major airbases at Nevatim and Tel Nof. Video filmed near the bases on Tuesday night during the attack had suggested some missiles had detonated during the latest Iranian assault. While Israel and its allies immediately pointed to the Iran attack as a failure, the fact that a number of 181 missiles launched in two large waves managed to reach their targets underscores a long-running concern in Israeli security circles that a large-scale ballistic missile attack launched by Iran, Hezbollah or a combination of Iran and its allies would have the effect of overwhelming Israel\u2019s sophisticated missile air defences, allowing some rockets to get through. Despite the relatively little damage, the fact that Iran had said the attack was targeting the airbases and managed to strike them will be of concern to Israeli planners in the event of future strikes moving to areas with a high civilian concentration. Israel\u2019s war time civil planning has seen key health care centres and emergency services trained to anticipate exactly this scenario in the event of urban areas being hit during a mass wave of missiles, with one emergency planner telling the Guardian earlier this year his hospital had been told to anticipate mass casualty events occurring over few hours in such a situation. \u201cThere was no damage that stopped the air force\u2019s operation at any stage,\u201d the military said, adding damage to infrastructure and property in civilian areas were \u201conly minor\u201d and likely caused by shrapnel from the interception of missiles. According to Haaretz, the military declined to quantify what the interception rate to avoid \u201cgiving Iran and Hezbollah information that will help them learn lessons\u201d saying only air defences had \u201coperated impressively, with high rates of interception\u201d. The read out confirms what observers, including Guardian reporters, could see during the attack; the sheer number of missiles, and so closely grouped, in the two waves meant that not all were intercepted. According to officials in the air force and the Intelligence corps, the missiles Iran fired on Tuesday were the most advanced type it has, although it did not include claimed hypersonic weapons. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of involvement in two explosions near the Israeli embassy in Copenhagen in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Police said that two of the men were arrested on a train at Copenhagen central station. The other man was arrested in the Danish capital. Writing on X, Copenhagen police said: \u201cFollowing the night\u2019s explosions near the Israeli embassy in Hellerup, we have arrested three people. Two men were arrested on a train at Copenhagen central station. In addition, earlier in the day we arrested a man elsewhere in Copenhagen.\u201d They added: \u201cWe currently have no further comments.\u201d Two blasts near the Israeli embassy in Copenhagen on Wednesday were likely caused by hand grenades, a Danish police spokesperson told a press conference. It has just gone 3pm in Tel Aviv, Beirut and Gaza City. Here are the latest headlines \u2026 Israeli media reports that Israel\u2019s military has said Iran did succeed in striking Israeli airbases with missiles during yesterday\u2019s attack, but the attack was \u201cineffective\u201d. No aircraft were damaged and the IAF was able to continue to operate. Impacts were said to have damaged office buildings and other maintenance areas Israel\u2019s foreign minister Israel Katz has threatened Israeli retaliation for Iran\u2019s \u201cbrutal\u201d missile attack yesterday in a post to social media thanking world leaders for their support One person in the Israeli-occupied West Bank was killed by falling debris from an intercepted missile, and two people were lightly wounded by shrapnel in Tel Aviv Iran\u2019s president Masoud Pezeshkian said \u201cIf the Zionist regime does not stop its crimes, it will face harsher reactions\u201d. Pezeshkian has left Tehran for a scheduled visit to Qatar Israel has announced the death of a soldier in Lebanon. It said the 22-year-old, part of a commando brigade, \u201cfell during combat in Lebanon\u201d. Earlier Hezbollah claimed that it had inflicted casualties on Israeli troops it engaged in Maroun al-Ras, a Lebanese village in the south of the country which is opposite Avivim and Yir\u2019on in Israel. Israel has announced that additional troops are to join its ground invasion, and issued another message that residents in over 20 Lebanese villages should flee their homes to avoid being attacked The IDF claims to have destroyed \u201cover 150 terror infrastructures\u201d which it says includes \u201cHezbollah headquarters, weapons storage facilities, and rocket launchers\u201d inside Lebanon. Israel\u2019s military also reported a continued barrage of projectiles fired into the country from Lebanon. There have been no reports of any casualties today but Israeli media reports that 10 houses have been damaged by rockets or artillery fire in Metula, an Israeli community which is right up against the UN-drawn blue line that separates Israel and Lebanon Israel\u2019s military has said that its chief of staff, the head of Shin Bet and the head of the Mossad all met at the Kirya in Tel Aviv Foreign minister Katz has also said on social media that he has declared UN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres a \u201cpersona non grata\u201d and banned him from entering the country, although it is unclear whether this is official government policy Germany\u2019s foreign ministry has urged its citizens to leave Iran. China\u2019s state-owned news agency Xinhua reports that over 200 Chinese nationals have been evacuated from Lebanon Russia has said the situation in the Middle East is developing in \u201cthe most alarming direction\u201d and Egypt\u2019s cabinet has condemned what it called a \u201cdangerous\u201d Israeli escalation in southern Lebanon Police in Denmark have said they are investigating two blasts in Copenhagen overnight that were near the Israeli embassy Yemen\u2019s Houthis in a statement have said they will not hesitate in broadening their operations against Israel Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip killed at least 60 Palestinians overnight, including in a school sheltering displaced families, medics in the territory said. The Hamas-led Gaza health ministry said Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 41,689 Palestinians and wounded 96,625 since 7 October. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict Israel has announced the death of a soldier in Lebanon during what it has described as its \u201climited\u201d ground operation inside the neighbouring company. It said the 22-year-old, part of a commando brigade, \u201cfell during combat in Lebanon.\u201d Earlier Hezbollah claimed that it had inflicted casualties on Israeli troops it engaged in Maroun al-Ras, a Lebanese village in the south of the country which is opposite Avivim and Yir\u2019on in Israel. Israel\u2019s military has said that its chief of staff, the head of Shin Bet and the head of the Mossad all met at the Kirya in Tel Aviv. It issued a picture of the meeting, where it was likely the trio were discussing Israeli plans to respond to Iran\u2019s attack yesterday. Israeli media reports that Israel\u2019s military has said Iran did succeed in striking Israeli airbases with missiles during yesterday\u2019s attack, but the attack was \u201cineffective\u201d. Writing for the Times of Israel, Emanuel Fabian reports: The impacts damaged office buildings and other maintenance areas in the bases that do not impact the IAF\u2019s functioning, according to the military. No Israeli Air Force aircraft were damaged in the attack and all of the missile impacts in Israeli airbases are deemed by the IDF as \u201cineffective,\u201d meaning that no harm was caused to the continuous operations of the IAF. In the report it is noted that the Israeli air force was able to continue activities after the Iranian attack, continuing to launch airstrikes on targets in Lebanon and Gaza. One person in the Israeli-occupied West Bank was killed by falling debris from an intercepted missile, and two people were lightly wounded by shrapnel in Tel Aviv. Those are the only known casualties of the attack. Earlier Iran\u2019s defence minister, Brig Gen Aziz Nasirzadeh, had claimed that 90% of Iran\u2019s missiles had been able to breach Israel\u2019s defences, and that it had only targeted military installations. Germany\u2019s foreign ministry has urged its citizens to leave Iran, saying the situation there was volatile and could change at any time, Reuters reports. Reuters is carrying some quotes from Iran\u2019s president Masoud Pezeshkian, who said some words as he departed on a scheduled visit to Qatar. He told state media in Iran \u201cIf the Zionist regime does not stop its crimes, it will face harsher reactions.\u201d Pezeshkian said one of the goals of the visit to Doha was \u201cto discuss how Asian countries can prevent Israeli crimes in the region, and prevent enemies from causing uproar in the Middle East.\u201d Earlier my colleague Patrick Wintour put together this article about Iran\u2019s stance since it launched the attack. Yanir Cozin, who is a diplomatic correspondent at Israeli Army Radio, has suggested on social media that foreign secretary Israel Katz may have jumped the gun earlier in announcing that he had declared UN general secretary Ant\u00f3nio Guterres \u201cpersona non grata\u201d and banned him from entering the country. Cozin reports that sources familiar with the matter at the Population and Immigration Authority have told him that no such decision has been conveyed to them, and that in any instance, it would be down to the interior security minister, not the foreign minster, to make the call. Israel\u2019s defense minister Yoav Gallant has published a picture of himself visiting Israel\u2019s air defences, which played their part in intercepting Iranian missiles yesterday. Alongside the picture he posted a message saying: The air defence fighters saved many lives. Thanks to them we can continue our just war, and come to terms with anyone who tries to harm us. The IDF reports that in the last hour at least 40 projectiles have crossed into Israel from Lebanon. There are no reports of any casualties. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Gaza, Israel, the occupied West Bank and Lebanon. My colleague Oliver Holmes has put together an explainer on Iran\u2019s attack on Israel \u2026 Iran\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, is reported to have departed Tehran for a scheduled visit to Qatar. Qatar has been acting as one of the brokers trying to engineer a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Israel\u2019s military has issued an operational update on its campaign inside Lebanon. In it, the IDF claims to have destroyed \u201cover 150 terror infrastructures\u201d which it says includes \u201cHezbollah headquarters, weapons storage facilities, and rocket launchers.\u201d The Israeli military has issued photographs which it says show its troops on the ground in unspecified locations during the Lebanese incursion, as well as rocket launchers and other weaponry it says it found in southern Lebanon. In another image released to the media by Israel\u2019s military, journalists were shown weapons that the IDF claimed were seized Hezbollah weapons, without specifying when and where they were confiscated. The claims have not been independently verified. Hezbollah has claimed that it has inflicted casualties on Israeli troops it engaged in Maroun al-Ras, a Lebanese village in the south of the country which is opposite Avivim and Yir\u2019on in Israel. Since Monday Israeli troops have been carrying out what the IDF has described as a \u201climited\u201d operation inside Lebanon, the first time Israeli troops have invaded the neighbouring country since the 2006 war. One strange story that has been floating around today was social media rumours that Israel\u2019s ambassador to Cyprus had been kidnapped. He has not, but Oren Anolik has felt the need to publish a video denying the story, describing it as \u201ca very creative way to make the whole world call me and text me and wish me a happy new Jewish year!\u201d Israel has declared the UN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres a \u201cpersona non grata\u201d and banned him from entering the country, and said he would be remembered \u201cas a stain on the history of the UN\u201d. Announcing the decision on social media, Israel\u2019s foreign minister Israel Katz said: Today, I have declared UN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres persona non grata in Israel and banned him from entering the country. Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran\u2019s heinous attack on Israel, as almost every country in the world has done, does not deserve to step foot on Israeli soil. This is a secretary-general who has yet to denounce the massacre and sexual atrocities committed by Hamas murderers on 7 October, nor has he led any efforts to declare them a terrorist organization. A secretary-general who gives backing to terrorists, rapists, and murderers from Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and now Iran \u2013 the mothership of global terror \u2013 will be remembered as a stain on the history of the UN. Israel will continue to defend its citizens and uphold its national dignity, with or without Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. In October 2023 Guterres said \u201cI have condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented 7 October acts of terror by Hamas in Israel. Nothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnapping of civilians \u2013 or the launching of rockets against civilian targets. All hostages must be treated humanely and released immediately and without conditions.\u201d However, he angered Israelis by, in the same speech, saying \u201cIt is important to also recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation.\u201d Guterres continued on that occasion to say Palestinians \u201chave seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished. But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.\u201d Last month UN members overwhelmingly backed a non-binding motion calling for Israel to end its near six decade long occupation of the Palestinian West Bank territories. The Times of Israel reports that overnight the IDF mounted an operation in Israeli-occupied Hebron in the West Bank \u201cto measure the homes of the Palestinian terrorists who carried out the deadly shooting and stabbing attack in Jaffa, ahead of potential demolitions.\u201d Describing the same operation, Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that five people were detained, and that three Palestinian paramedics were injured by Israeli security forces who \u201cseverely beat\u201d them. The claims have not been independently verified. The Hamas-led Gaza health ministry said Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 41,689 Palestinians and wounded 96,625 since 7 October. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. In more diplomatic reaction to yesterday\u2019s missile strikes by Iran, only the second time the country has directly attacked Israel, and Israel\u2019s ongoing miltary campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon, Russia has said the situation in the Middle East is developing in \u201cthe most alarming direction\u201d and called on all sides to exercise restraint. Reuters also reports that Egypt\u2019s cabinet has condemned what it called a \u201cdangerous\u201d Israeli escalation in southern Lebanon, and rejected any attempts to impose a \u201cnew situation\u201d on the ground that violates Lebanese sovereignty. Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy minister meanwhile, speaking in Berlin, said his country is hoping for de-escalation and dialogue. Hezbollah has claimed to have carried out several attacks on Israeli forces involved in the IDF operation in the north of Israel which has seen Israel deploy ground troops into Lebanon for the first time since 2006. Reporting for Al Jazeera from Hasbaiyya in Lebanon, Imran Khan writes: Israeli forces came into Lebanese territory [in the town of Odaisseh] but were repelled in ground fighting. It was an ambush that forced the Israelis back. Hezbollah also bombed the Shtula settlement, where Israeli forces are staging on the border, and hit a large infantry force in the Misgav Am settlement with missiles and artillery. The claims have not been independently verified. Al Jazeera has been banned from operating inside Israel by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. The Sky News security and defence editor Deborah Haynes has posted another video from northern Israel, close to the UN-drawn blue line that separates the country from Lebanon, in which can clearly be heard an ongoing exchange of fire. China\u2019s state-owned news agency Xinhua reports that over 200 Chinese nationals have been evacuated from Lebanon. The Lebanese government has staed that a fifth of the country\u2019s population \u2013 about one million people \u2013 have been displaced from their homes by Israeli airstrikes. Reuters reports that in a statement Hezbollah has claimed to have targeted areas north of Israel\u2019s city of Haifa with a large missile salvo. Warning sirens have been repeatedly sounding in northern Israel. Israeli media reports that 10 houses have been damaged by rockets or artillery fire in Metula, an Israeli community which is right up against the UN-drawn blue line that separates Israel and Lebanon. The information minister in Lebanon\u2019s caretaker government, Johnny Corm, has promised that the country is working hard to \u201cavoid communication paralysis\u201d while it is under attack from Israel. Posting a video of telecomms equipment in south Beirut that had been destroyed in an Israeli airstrike, he said: This is one of the cellular transmission stations that was destroyed by the Israeli aggression on the southern suburb of Beirut. We strongly condemn this attack and are working hard to ensure that services are provided to citizens and to avoid communication paralysis. This image sent to us over the news wires shows smoke rising again over Beirut after another Israeli airstrike on Lebanon\u2019s capital earlier today. Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip killed at least 60 Palestinians overnight, including in a school sheltering displaced families, medics in the territory said. Reuters reports that local media said Israeli tanks carried out a raid on several areas in eastern and central Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, before partially retreating, leaving at least 40 people killed and dozens wounded. At least 22 Palestinians were killed in Gaza City, including a strike on a school sheltering displaced families that killed 17. Israel\u2019s military has repeatedly claimed to be targeting Hamas rather than civilians in its operation inside Gaza. Palestinian sources put the number of dead in Gaza at well over 40,000. Around 350 Israeli troops have been killed. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. Israel\u2019s foreign minister Israel Katz has threatened Israeli retaliation for Iran\u2019s \u201cbrutal\u201d missile attack yesterday in a post to social media thanking world leaders for their support. Katz said: The support and solidarity from leaders and nations around the world will never be forgotten. We know who our friends are. The Ayatollah regime has crossed the red line \u2013 and the state of Israel will not remain silent in the face of Iran\u2019s brutal attack on our citizens. The entire free world must stand with Israel to stop the Iranian axis of evil \u2013 before it\u2019s too late. He was responding to US senator Tom Cotton saying \u201cPray for Israel and then back Israel to the hilt to destroy our common enemies.\u201d To date it is known that two Israelis were lightly wounded in the attack yesterday by Iran, and one person was killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank by the attack. Israeli media reports that about 100 rockets have been launched into Israel from the direction of Lebanon so far today. There are no reports of any casualties. AFP reports that Iran\u2019s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said Wednesday that Tehran has warned the US against intervening after Iran launched missiles into Israel yesterday. \u201cWe have \u2026 warned the US forces to withdraw from this matter and not to intervene,\u201d Araghchi told state television, adding that the message was relayed through the Swiss embassy in Tehran. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday called on Iran and Hezbollah to immediately end their attacks on Israel and warned that Iran risks inflaming the entire region. Reuters reports Scholz said \u201cIran is risking setting the entire region on fire - this must be prevented at all costs. Hezbollah and Iran must immediately cease their attacks on Israel.\u201d He added that Germany would continue to work with its partners towards a ceasefire. Israel has vowed to retaliate after Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at targets across Israel. The Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed by an Israeli strike on Beirut on Friday. Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon, which the IDF says are targeting Hezbollah, have killed about 1,000 people and wounded 6,000 more in the past couple of weeks, with one million people said to be displaced from their homes. Israel has ordered residents of more than 20 villages in the south of Lebanon to flee their homes in order to save their lives. Authorities in Gaza report that over 40,000 people have been killed there by the Israeli military campaign against Hamas over the last year. Yemen\u2019s Houthis in a statement have said they will not hesitate in broadening their operations against Israel. Reuters reports they also threatened US and UK shipping interests on account of the nations\u2019 \u201ccontinuous\u201d support of Israel. The Houthis claim to have targeted a military post deep inside Israel with rocket fire. Security and defence editor at Sky News, Deborah Haynes, has reported \u201cThere seems to be a lot more firing \u2013 Israeli outgoing rounds, Hezbollah incoming rockets\u201d in the north of Israel where she is positioned, and she just posted a video of her and her team having to run for cover. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that 40 civilians have been killed in Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip, where Israel continues its military campaign against Hamas. It reports: Medical teams recovered the bodies of 40 fatalities, most of them children and women, and dozens of causalities after a ground incursion and airstrikes launched by the occupation army on the southeastern areas of Khan Younis. The family of journalist Ahmed al-Zard said that a number of family members were killed, including his brother, uncle and cousins, while Ahmed was seriously injured along with his mother and brother. The claims have not been independently verified. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. Police in Denmark have said they are investigating two blasts in Copenhagen overnight that were near the Israeli embassy. \u201cIt is too early to say if there is a link\u201d the police said, adding \u201cnobody was wounded.\u201d AFP notes the Israeli embassy is among several foreign missions, including Iran, Thailand, Turkey and Romania, that are clustered together in the north of the Danish capital. Israel has announced that additional troops are to join its ground invasion into southern Lebanon. In a message posted to its official Telegram channel, the IDF said: The 36th Division, including soldiers of the Golani Brigade, 188th Armored Brigade, 6th Infantry Brigade, and additional forces are joining the limited, localised, targeted raids on Hezbollah terror targets and terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon that began on Monday. It says, in addition, that \u201cThe soldiers are being accompanied by the IAF and the 282nd Artillery Brigade.\u201d Following our update on airline cancellations: Abu Dhabi\u2019s Etihad Airways has said it is re-routing a number of its flights on Wednesday in response to airspace restrictions in parts of the Middle East. Etitad said it is continuously monitoring security and airspace updates as the situation develops. Meanwhile, all flights in Iran will remain cancelled until 5am Thursday local time, the country\u2019s civil aviation organisation announced. Israel\u2019s military has issued another message that residents in over 20 Lebanese villages should flee their homes to avoid being attacked. Avichay Adraee\u2019s message states that \u201cThe IDF does not intend to harm you\u201d but claims that \u201cHezbollah\u2019s activities force the IDF to act against it forcefully\u201d and tells people in the villages listed to \u201csave your lives\u201d by moving, and insists they do not travel south. It continues: Anyone who is near Hezbollah elements, installations, and combat equipment is putting their life at risk. Any house used by Hezbollah for its military needs is expected to be targeted. Evacuate your homes immediately. Be careful, you must not go south. Any southward movement may put you in danger. It ends by telling citizens of a neighbouring sovereign country \u201cWe [i.e. the IDF] will let you know when it is safe to return home.\u201d As we just reported, the scale of the damage on Israel after Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack remains unclear. No injuries have been reported in Israel, but one person was killed in the occupied West Bank, authorities there said. There are however multiple images of craters in central and southern Israel. PBS foreign affairs and defense correspondent, Nick Schifrin posted this report from close to the Mossad headquarters on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, showing a large crater. There continues to be very little information about how much damage Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel caused. In its attack on Tuesday, Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles, Israel\u2019s government said. Some of the missile fired by Iran were hypersonic Fattah missiles, with a maximum speed estimated at 10,000mph. According to the Revolutionary Guards, 90% of its missiles successfully hit their targets. Israel however says most missiles were intercepted by its air defence and that statement appears to be backed up by comments from the UK and US who played a role in Israel\u2019s defence. Images from central Israel show officials inspecting an impact crater. No injuries were reported in Israel, but one man was killed in the occupied West Bank, authorities there said. Images show missiles fallen in Ramallah, in the West Bank. The IDF\u2019s Daniel Hagari said there were \u201ca small number\u201d of hits. The Israeli military published video of a school in the central city of Gadera that was heavily damaged by an Iranian missile. In the United States, vice-presidential candidates Tim Walz and JD Vance have faced off in the first VP debate of this election. The first question was about the current issues in the Middle East; both candidates were asked whether they would support or oppose a pre-emptive strike by Israel on Iran. Walz said Israel\u2019s ability to defend itself is \u201cabsolutely fundamental\u201d and said \u201csteady leadership\u201d is fundamental. Walz noted that Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, John Kelly, said the president was \u201cthe most flawed human being he\u2019d ever met\u201d and that Trump\u2019s secretaries of defence and his national security advisers \u201csaid he should be nowhere near the White House\u201d. For his part, Vance said Donald Trump \u201cconsistently made the world more secure\u201d and that Trump, as president, recognised that \u201cyou needed peace through strength\u201d. Vance said that it is up to Israel to do what they need to do to keep their country safe, adding \u201cwe should support our allies wherever they are when they\u2019re fighting the bad guys.\u201d You can follow the ongoing reaction to the debate here. Air raid alerts have been issued for several locations in northern Israel, with sirens sounding in a number of towns in the Upper Galilee. The IDF has issued new warnings for residents in southern Lebanon, saying heavy fighting was taking place against Hezbollah. Images coming into the newsroom show Israeli mobile artillery units firing from northern Israel towards Lebanon. Earlier, Hezbollah said it had confronted Israeli forces infiltrating the Lebanese town of Adaisseh and forced them to retreat. Adaisseh sits on the Lebanese side of the border with Israel, just 200 metres from the Israeli town of Misgav Am, where air alert sirens were active in the last few hours. Danish police said on Wednesday morning that they were investigating two blasts in the vicinity of Israel\u2019s embassy in Copenhagen. \u201cNo one has been injured, and we are carrying out initial investigations at the scene,\u201d Copenhagen police said in a statement. They said a \u201cpossible connection\u201d to the Israeli embassy, which is located in the area, was being investigated. Israel will launch a \u201csignificant retaliation\u201d to Iran\u2019s missile attack within days, according to Axios reporter Barak Ravid, who was quoting security officials. According to Ravid\u2019s report, Israel could target oil production facilities inside Iran and other strategic sites. He quotes security officials as saying the response will be much more significant than the limited strike against Iran that followed the Iranian missile attack on Israel in April. The IDF has issued a new warning, reporting heavy fighting taking place in southern Lebanon against Hezbollah. For your personal safety, we ask you not to travel by vehicle from the area north of the Litani River to the south of it. The IDF will disrupt the movements of Hezbollah elements and prevent them from carrying out their attacks. This warning is in effect until further notice. In the last hour, Hezbollah said it had confronted Israeli forces infiltrating the Lebanese town of Adaisseh early on Wednesday early, and forced them to retreat. Adaisseh sits on the Lebanese side of the border with Israel, just 200 metres from the Israeli town of Misgav Am, where air alert sirens were active in the last hour. Many airlines have suspended flights to the region or are avoiding use of affected air space. Lebanon\u2019s airspace will be closed to air traffic for a two-hour period on Tuesday, transport minister Ali Hamie said on X. Israel\u2019s neighbours closed their airspace and airline crews sought diversions after Iran fired a salvo of ballistic missiles on Tuesday. A spokesperson for tracking service FlightRadar24 said flights diverted \u201canywhere they could\u201d, and a snapshot of regional traffic showed flights spreading in wide arcs to the north and south, with many converging on Cairo and Istanbul. FlightRadar24 data showed about 80 flights - operated by the likes of Emirates, British Airways, Lufthansa and Qatar Airways \u2013 bound for major Middle East hubs such as Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi, were diverted to places such as Cairo and European cities. Iran\u2019s chief of staff has vowed to hit infrastructure across Israel if its territory is attacked, after Tehran fired almost 200 missiles on Tuesday. The barrage \u201cwill be repeated with bigger intensity and all infrastructure of the regime will be targeted\u201d, Maj Gen Mohammad Bagheri said on state TV. Elsewhere a report on Iran\u2019s semi-official Tasnim news agency said Iran told the United States not to get involved following its missile attack on Israel, the country\u2019s foreign minister reportedly said. Hezbollah has said it confronted Israeli forces infiltrating the Lebanese town of Adaisseh early on Wednesday early, and forced them to retreat. The Guardian was unable to immediately verify these claims. Adaisseh sits on the Lebanese side of the border with Israel, just 200 metres from the Israeli town of Misgav Am, where air alert sirens were active in the last hour. At least nine Palestinians were killed and 20 injured in an Israeli air strike on a school and institute housing displaced people in Gaza, according to a report from Palestinian news agency WFA. In a statement earlier, the IDF said the Israeli air force launched strikes on Hamas targets who were \u201coperating in a command and control complex established in the area that was previously used as the Brig High School in the center of the Gaza Strip\u201d. The IDF claimed that \u201csteps were taken to reduce the chance of harming civilians\u201d. It is unclear whether the IDF statement refers to the same strike on Gaza that WFA reported as killing 9 people. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has said he spoke with the Israeli minister of defence, Yoav Gallant, telling him that the attack from Iran was an \u201coutrageous act of aggression\u201d. The Minister and I expressed mutual appreciation for the coordinated defense of Israel against nearly 200 ballistic missiles launched by Iran and committed to remain in close contact. At least five Israeli strikes hit Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in the early hours of Wednesday, a Lebanese security source told the AFP news agency. The Israeli military issued multiple evacuation orders for buildings in the city, saying it is targeting Hezbollah sites. Reuters and AFP correspondents reported multiple explosions and smoke rising in at least one area while a fire appeared to burn. Israel has repeatedly bombarded Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs since last week. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s continuing coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. Israel launched strikes across Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in the early hours of Wednesday, with the Israeli military issuing multiple evacuation orders for buildings in Beirut, saying it was targeting Hezbollah sites. The strikes came hours after Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at targets across Israel, in a dramatic intensification of a conflict that some fear could escalate into a regional war. Meanwhile Benjamin Netanyahu told a meeting of his security cabinet that \u201cIran made a big mistake tonight \u2013 and it will pay for it.\u201d The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to retaliate against our enemies.\u201d More on that in a moment, first here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s other main events. The Israeli military spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, spoke on television reacting to what the country called a \u201cserious attack\u201d on Israel by Iran today. Hagari, the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), pledged that the attack \u201cwill have consequences\u201d. He added that the country remained on high alert. There continues to be very little information about how much damage Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel caused. In its attack on Tuesday, Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles, Israel\u2019s government said. No injuries were reported in Israel, but one man was killed in the occupied West Bank, authorities there said. Images show missiles fallen in Ramallah, in the West Bank. Late on Tuesday, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran\u2019s action was \u201cconcluded unless Israeli regime decides to invite further retaliation\u201d. In a statement on X, he said: \u201cIsrael\u2019s enablers now have a heightened responsibility to rein in the warmongers in Tel Aviv instead of getting involved in their folly.\u201d Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, gave the order to launch the missiles at Israel, a senior Iranian official told Reuters, adding that Tehran \u201cis fully ready for any retaliation\u201d. Meanwhile, the Iranian mission to the United Nations has defended the country\u2019s missile launches against Israel today, calling it a response to \u201cterrorist acts\u201d by Israel. US destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea took down multiple missiles launched by Iran, US defence officials said. The UK defence secretary, John Healey, said that British forces \u201cplayed their part in attempts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East\u201d. Six people were killed and 10 wounded in a shooting and knife attack on the Israeli seaside city of Jaffa that occurred minutes before Iran launched its attack. Five of the wounded were described as being in a serious condition, including an IDF soldier. CCTV footage showed two men, reportedly armed with an assault rifle and a knife, dressed in black emerging from a train near the light-rail stop along Jerusalem Boulevard where they opened fire on passersby as well as on a second nearby street. Emmanuel Macron has condemned Iran\u2019s attack on Israel and said France mobilised its \u201cmilitary resources in the Middle East to counter the Iranian threat.\u201d France\u2019s president also called on Israel to end its military operations in Lebanon \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>From degraded fields being brought back to fertile life to community gardens flourishing as food co-operatives, a growing revolution is happening in countries across the African continent.</p> <p>The climate crisis, conflict and the dominance of multinationals with industrial-scale production for export have popularised the concept of agroecology \u2013 promoting small-scale farming and farmers, protecting biodiversity and adapting traditional methods that do away with the need for chemicals and expensive fertilisers.</p> <p>The Guardian spoke to five devotees of greener, better food.</p> <h2>Asmelash Dagne, Ethiopia</h2> <p>In a single year, a farm boasting little more than a pair of forlorn-looking coffee trees was transformed into a lush place of thriving and diverse crops, all playing a role in the mini ecosystem. Fennel protects the salad leaves from pests while sweet potato plants hold water in the soil. Soon, neighbouring farmers came knocking to find out what the secret was, says Asmelash Dagne, who trains farmers in Ethiopia in agroecology.</p> <p>An environmentalist with a science background, Dagne believes balanced environments that do not draw excessive water, pollute or need costly chemicals or energy supplies are crucial. He says the lack of fertiliser supplies, as a result of stocks being delayed by the Ukraine war, was a lesson in how vulnerable farmers can be unless they adapt.</p>    <p>\u201cBig companies give seed, fertilisers, pesticides and this becomes the business. Governments tell farmers: you need to use this, you need to do it this way to feed ourselves better. But we already have existing practices which feed from generation to generation,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Dagne is proud that farmers he works with have been able to avoid the need for pumping water for irrigation by collecting rainwater. A traditional method has been adapted using a system of intersecting trenches.</p> <p>He says that over time the water seeps into the soil, adding to the groundwater that helps crops to flourish.</p> <p>\u201cThe feedback from farmers is these methods are productive. They can feed their families. They can eat more diverse food. They are resilient because the soil is so rich with organic matter that it can hold water for longer, so the drought seasons are not affecting them that much,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>Themba Chauke, South Africa</h2> <p>In Limpopo in north South Africa, everyone ate what they could grow. Now the supermarket reigns supreme with convenient, longlife produce. But that costs money and Themba Chauke saw many of his neighbours become indebted purely trying to feed their families on low salaries.</p> <p>\u201cWe also learned our lesson during Covid to produce our own food because people were told to stay at home and they didn\u2019t have access to food,\u201d Chauke says.</p> <p>Chauke had been working with community radio for his Tsonga ethnic group, but moved into creating community gardens that provide education and space for people to grow quality food.</p>    <p>They largely use traditional farming techniques, with some adaptations, moving from growing just one crop a year to using the winter season for cash crops such as spinach, tomatoes, cabbages and onions.</p> <p>Everything is planted together, a traditional method of intercropping that he says helps the gardens thrive, with some crops warding off pests and others enriching the soil.</p> <h2>Ska Moteane, Lesotho</h2> <p>Beans had always been a staple of the Basotho kitchen but Ska Moteane found they were steadily being replaced by meat and fast food. Her people were even forgetting their own recipes.</p> <p>Despite being a chef, she did not know how to cook the dishes she had grown up on, and her education at culinary school in South Africa had focused on European cuisine. So she decided to document what was at risk of being lost.</p>    <p>Now Moteane serves those dishes herself and encourages others to cook them, sourcing ingredients directly from the farmers growing beans and crops such as sorghum that are central to Basotho culture but not bought by supermarkets, which stock their shelves with imported products seen as superior.</p> <p>\u201cSorghum is considered for poor people. You have people who still have that mindset. That\u2019s what we are fighting against,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She does see progress and believes that promoting Basotho culture helps to save traditional crops and allows local people to grow them.</p> <p>\u201cWe used to see that the farmers would have bales and bales of sorghum or maize until it would go bad. Now they are able to sell pretty much everything. So there is a shift, and it can only get better.\u201d</p> <h2>Stephan Katongole, Uganda</h2> <p>When Stephan Katongole\u2019s father returned to Uganda in the early 2000s after decades abroad, he planted coffee trees on the family\u2019s hitherto abandoned farmland with the aim of commercial production.</p> <p>Despite having no agricultural experience, Katongole took over the land 13 years ago, when his father was too old to manage it. He saw that the old ways were not working \u2013 coffee on the commodity market earned very little money for producers, but speciality coffee, grown through agroforestry, would be more successful.</p>    <p>Katongole slowly transformed the vast lines of coffee trees to a more diverse space, where they coexist with other plants. He says monocropping \u2013 large farms producing a single crop \u2013 should no longer be seen as a solution.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to try to mimic what was there before we came into the system. We brought nature out of balance with what we were doing. So my advice would be, try to do everything you can to mimic those forests which were already there by planting trees.\u201d</p> <h2>Edie Mukiibi,<strong> </strong>Slow Food International</h2> <p>A drought showed Edie Mukiibi the shortcomings of industrial scale agriculture. He was part of a trial that encouraged farmers to invest in a breed of maize that they were all told would be drought resistant with the help of the fertilisers they were sold. Then drought came and they lost everything.</p> <p>Mukiibi grew up learning traditional farming methods, but at university he was taught that technology and large-scale agriculture were the solution for Africa.</p> <p>Now he is pushing back against \u201cbig agriculture\u201d, promoting more time-tested and diverse methods of farming.</p>    <p>Mukiibi farmed in Uganda but is now the president of Slow Food International, promoting more sustainable production and consumption globally.</p> <p>There have been challenges, he says, with agriculture giants claiming agroecology cannot deliver at scale. He believes this message is undermining and unwelcome, and that the agroecology movement is having success across Africa.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve travelled to more than 30 African countries, meeting farmers in the communities, and many express the fear and worry that they cannot catch up with the seed system controlled by big business,\u201d says Mukiibi.</p> <p>\u201cIt is so important not to lose the argument because then we hand our future to the corporations and their intention is not to feed anyone.</p> <p>\u201cIt is to feed their revenue streams, to stamp their control over food and to dictate who should produce what and when.\u201d</p>",

He says the lack of fertiliser supplies, as a result of stocks being delayed by the Ukraine war, was a lesson in how vulnerable farmers can be unless they adapt. \u201cBig companies give seed, fertilisers, pesticides and this becomes the business. Governments tell farmers: you need to use this, you need to do it this way to feed ourselves better. But we already have existing practices which feed from generation to generation,\u201d he says. Dagne is proud that farmers he works with have been able to avoid the need for pumping water for irrigation by collecting rainwater. A traditional method has been adapted using a system of intersecting trenches. He says that over time the water seeps into the soil, adding to the groundwater that helps crops to flourish. \u201cThe feedback from farmers is these methods are productive. They can feed their families. They can eat more diverse food. They are resilient because the soil is so rich with organic matter that it can hold water for longer, so the drought seasons are not affecting them that much,\u201d he says. Themba Chauke, South Africa In Limpopo in north South Africa, everyone ate what they could grow. Now the supermarket reigns supreme with convenient, longlife produce. But that costs money and Themba Chauke saw many of his neighbours become indebted purely trying to feed their families on low salaries. \u201cWe also learned our lesson during Covid to produce our own food because people were told to stay at home and they didn\u2019t have access to food,\u201d Chauke says. Chauke had been working with community radio for his Tsonga ethnic group, but moved into creating community gardens that provide education and space for people to grow quality food. They largely use traditional farming techniques, with some adaptations, moving from growing just one crop a year to using the winter season for cash crops such as spinach, tomatoes, cabbages and onions. Everything is planted together, a traditional method of intercropping that he says helps the gardens thrive, with some crops warding off pests and others enriching the soil. Ska Moteane, Lesotho Beans had always been a staple of the Basotho kitchen but Ska Moteane found they were steadily being replaced by meat and fast food. Her people were even forgetting their own recipes. Despite being a chef, she did not know how to cook the dishes she had grown up on, and her education at culinary school in South Africa had focused on European cuisine. So she decided to document what was at risk of being lost. Now Moteane serves those dishes herself and encourages others to cook them, sourcing ingredients directly from the farmers growing beans and crops such as sorghum that are central to Basotho culture but not bought by supermarkets, which stock their shelves with imported products seen as superior. \u201cSorghum is considered for poor people. You have people who still have that mindset. That\u2019s what we are fighting against,\u201d she says. She does see progress and believes that promoting Basotho culture helps to save traditional crops and allows local people to grow them. \u201cWe used to see that the farmers would have bales and bales of sorghum or maize until it would go bad. Now they are able to sell pretty much everything. So there is a shift, and it can only get better.\u201d Stephan Katongole, Uganda When Stephan Katongole\u2019s father returned to Uganda in the early 2000s after decades abroad, he planted coffee trees on the family\u2019s hitherto abandoned farmland with the aim of commercial production. Despite having no agricultural experience, Katongole took over the land 13 years ago, when his father was too old to manage it. He saw that the old ways were not working \u2013 coffee on the commodity market earned very little money for producers, but speciality coffee, grown through agroforestry, would be more successful. Katongole slowly transformed the vast lines of coffee trees to a more diverse space, where they coexist with other plants. He says monocropping \u2013 large farms producing a single crop \u2013 should no longer be seen as a solution. \u201cWe have to try to mimic what was there before we came into the system. We brought nature out of balance with what we were doing. So my advice would be, try to do everything you can to mimic those forests which were already there by planting trees.\u201d Edie Mukiibi, Slow Food International A drought showed Edie Mukiibi the shortcomings of industrial scale agriculture. He was part of a trial that encouraged farmers to invest in a breed of maize that they were all told would be drought resistant with the help of the fertilisers they were sold. Then drought came and they lost everything. Mukiibi grew up learning traditional farming methods, but at university he was taught that technology and large-scale agriculture were the solution for Africa. Now he is pushing back against \u201cbig agriculture\u201d, promoting more time-tested and diverse methods of farming. Mukiibi farmed in Uganda but is now the president of Slow Food International, promoting more sustainable production and consumption globally. There have been challenges, he says, with agriculture giants claiming agroecology cannot deliver at scale. He believes this message is undermining and unwelcome, and that the agroecology movement is having success across Africa. \u201cI\u2019ve travelled to more than 30 African countries, meeting farmers in the communities, and many express the fear and worry that they cannot catch up with the seed system controlled by big business,\u201d says Mukiibi. \u201cIt is so important not to lose the argument because then we hand our future to the corporations and their intention is not to feed anyone. \u201cIt is to feed their revenue streams, to stamp their control over food and to dictate who should produce what and when.\u201d",

The images, taken by Arthur William Hobart in the 1930s as he leant out of a biplane, capture people moving about on horse-drawn vehicles as well as in motorised ones, and rivers teeming with working boats. There are striking images of industrial sites hemmed in by the terraces that housed their employees, and scenes of the British seaside that look a lot more genteel and less crowded than some of today\u2019s brash resorts. Historic England is releasing pictures from Hobart\u2019s Air Pictures Portleven collection after organising and digitising them. The collection features 242 images showing national landmarks, towns and cities, industrial sites, construction projects, cliffs and beaches, documenting the era between the two world wars. Born in 1882 in London, Hobart worked as a baker, commercial traveller and draper\u2019s clerk before turning to aerial photography around 1920. He was commissioned by the construction industry, industrial sectors and the press, but also took pictures to be sold as postcards to people who were intrigued by a view of their country from a new perspective.

      "body": "<p>The widening of the Middle East war has a multiplicity of woeful causes and grim consequences. Many have the potential to become even more intractable in the weeks to come. Fresh human suffering in Israel, Lebanon and beyond is only the start of it. Donald Trump is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idqOh9fA3nQ\">wrong to claim</a> we are on the brink of a third world war. But these events have global implications. Remember what happened after 9/11.</p> <p>The latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/02/israel-iran-attacks-latest-updates-live-hezbollah-lebanon-beirut-strikes\">bombings and missile attacks</a> mark a historic failure for politics and diplomacy. This is not the first such failure in the Middle East. But wishing that diplomacy could prevail will not make it happen, and even fragile ceasefires are a long way off right now. As angry populations rally behind the respective combatants the prospects for desperately needed political solutions are almost negligible. You can\u2019t stop a war if those on all sides are determined to fight.</p> <p>On the global scale, the implications for Britain and for Keir Starmer\u2019s government come a long way down the list of the escalation\u2019s most important consequences. In domestic terms, however, they still matter very much indeed. The Gaza war has already made a powerful impact on British politics. Israel\u2019s latest conflict with Iran and its proxies is likely to do the same. The shadow of the Iraq war is a lasting one, more than 20 years on.</p> <p>Yet Britain is not some touchline observer of events in the Middle East. British listening stations in Cyprus monitor the Middle East 24/7. British jets, based in Cyprus, fly over Syria and Iraq almost daily. Those same British jets flew missions to help protect Israel in April, and did so again this week in response to Iran\u2019s missile attacks. Like it or not, Britain also has a history in the region.</p> <p>All of which underscores the high seriousness of the strategic choices that Starmer faces in foreign policy. Like all European nations, Britain now exists in an unstable world shaped by Chinese power, the threat from Russia, US political uncertainty and climate change. It has expelled itself from the European Union. Starmer was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/eu-pushes-keir-starmer-to-open-door-to-youth-mobility-scheme-as-pm-heads-to-brussels\">in Brussels</a> today to try to make the best of these volatile realities.</p> <p>No one should kid themselves that this is not a difficult hand to play. The difficulty lies behind the escapist and trivialising foreign policy solutions in which Boris Johnson and Liz Truss took refuge, in office and afterwards. Starmer\u2019s seriousness offers a quite different response to theirs but it brings another sort of danger. It puts him at risk of not challenging some inherited orthodoxies of British foreign policy at a newly unstable time for which they are no longer adequate. Dean Acheson\u2019s 1962 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/century/1960-1969/Story/0,,105633,00.html\">comment</a> that Britain had lost an empire but not yet found a role still echoes.</p> <p>Starmer himself has little background in foreign policy. He gets day-to-day advice from his national security adviser, Tim Barrow, and his foreign policy adviser, Ailsa Terry. It is hard to say from the outside if they are the ideal team for the biggest foreign policy call he faces as prime minister. That call is not, though, over the Middle East war, or the defence of Ukraine. It is not even over the relationship with the EU. It is over the relationship with the US.</p> <p>British foreign policy always seeks to hug America close. But a month from now, the US reaches a fork in the road. Trump and Kamala Harris offer radically different approaches to the country\u2019s global role. These differences will shape Washington\u2019s approach to every important global issue \u2013 including Ukraine, the Middle East, China, climate, and digital regulation \u2013 for the coming four years. They will be reflected, too, in the way the US operates towards international bodies including the United Nations, Nato, the International Monetary Fund and the international criminal court.</p> <p>The outcome will shape British foreign policy too. A Harris victory would permit something like business as usual. But a Trump win would not. Trying to hug Trump close risks being unsuccessful, dangerous and damaging. Even trying to influence him would require a very special skill set, notably the ability to catch Trump\u2019s attention on Fox News. And Harris would be operating in a more volatile world, too, in which constrained US power might not give priority to British and European interests.</p> <p>That is why, for Starmer, there is an umbilical link between the pressures of a massive event such as the Middle East war and an otherwise relatively niche decision, like who should be the next UK ambassador to the US. Seen through the global lens, the imminent appointment of Karen Pierce\u2019s successor in Washington is relatively minor. Seen through the UK lens, however, it is one of the hinges on which the success or failure of Starmer\u2019s government will depend.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, No 10 has said the Washington job \u2013 the special relationship\u2019s most special post \u2013 will only be allocated after the US election. But it will be a defining moment all the same. Politicians including David Miliband, Catherine Ashton and Peter Mandelson have been mentioned. So have current ambassadors, including Menna Rawlings (now in Paris) and Barbara Woodward (now at the UN). Whitehall veterans such as Tom Scholar (former head of the Treasury) and Vijay Rangarajan (now head of the Electoral Commission) may be in the frame too.</p> <p>It\u2019s a job that Labour, nowadays full of West Wing wannabes, has always taken especially seriously. Peter Jay, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/sep/23/peter-jay-obituary\">died last month</a>, was appointed to the ambassador\u2019s luxurious Massachusetts Avenue residence by his Labour prime ministerial father-in-law, James Callaghan, in 1977. \u201cWe want you to get up the arse of the White House and stay there,\u201d were the instructions from New Labour in 1997, when the late Christopher Meyer was despatched to be Tony Blair\u2019s man in Washington.</p> <p>The appointment rests very personally with Starmer. He has surely now learned that the global agenda will also determine Labour\u2019s future, whether Trump or Harris wins. The appointee therefore needs to be someone with the ear of the president but with the ear of the prime minister as well. That\u2019s why, in the end, my prediction is that the job will go to a man who, untypically, did not reply to my inquiries on the subject this week.</p> <p>A generation ago, as Blair\u2019s chief of staff, it was he who gave Meyer those robust instructions. It was also he who played a key role in the hard-won peace process in Northern Ireland. At a time when another peace process is again so urgent, it is hard to think of a stronger candidate than Jonathan Powell.</p> <ul> <li><p>Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is hard to say from the outside if they are the ideal team for the biggest foreign policy call he faces as prime minister. That call is not, though, over the Middle East war, or the defence of Ukraine. It is not even over the relationship with the EU. It is over the relationship with the US. British foreign policy always seeks to hug America close. But a month from now, the US reaches a fork in the road. Trump and Kamala Harris offer radically different approaches to the country\u2019s global role. These differences will shape Washington\u2019s approach to every important global issue \u2013 including Ukraine, the Middle East, China, climate, and digital regulation \u2013 for the coming four years. They will be reflected, too, in the way the US operates towards international bodies including the United Nations, Nato, the International Monetary Fund and the international criminal court. The outcome will shape British foreign policy too. A Harris victory would permit something like business as usual. But a Trump win would not. Trying to hug Trump close risks being unsuccessful, dangerous and damaging. Even trying to influence him would require a very special skill set, notably the ability to catch Trump\u2019s attention on Fox News. And Harris would be operating in a more volatile world, too, in which constrained US power might not give priority to British and European interests. That is why, for Starmer, there is an umbilical link between the pressures of a massive event such as the Middle East war and an otherwise relatively niche decision, like who should be the next UK ambassador to the US. Seen through the global lens, the imminent appointment of Karen Pierce\u2019s successor in Washington is relatively minor. Seen through the UK lens, however, it is one of the hinges on which the success or failure of Starmer\u2019s government will depend. Unsurprisingly, No 10 has said the Washington job \u2013 the special relationship\u2019s most special post \u2013 will only be allocated after the US election. But it will be a defining moment all the same. Politicians including David Miliband, Catherine Ashton and Peter Mandelson have been mentioned. So have current ambassadors, including Menna Rawlings (now in Paris) and Barbara Woodward (now at the UN). Whitehall veterans such as Tom Scholar (former head of the Treasury) and Vijay Rangarajan (now head of the Electoral Commission) may be in the frame too. It\u2019s a job that Labour, nowadays full of West Wing wannabes, has always taken especially seriously. Peter Jay, who died last month, was appointed to the ambassador\u2019s luxurious Massachusetts Avenue residence by his Labour prime ministerial father-in-law, James Callaghan, in 1977. \u201cWe want you to get up the arse of the White House and stay there,\u201d were the instructions from New Labour in 1997, when the late Christopher Meyer was despatched to be Tony Blair\u2019s man in Washington. The appointment rests very personally with Starmer. He has surely now learned that the global agenda will also determine Labour\u2019s future, whether Trump or Harris wins. The appointee therefore needs to be someone with the ear of the president but with the ear of the prime minister as well. That\u2019s why, in the end, my prediction is that the job will go to a man who, untypically, did not reply to my inquiries on the subject this week. A generation ago, as Blair\u2019s chief of staff, it was he who gave Meyer those robust instructions. It was also he who played a key role in the hard-won peace process in Northern Ireland. At a time when another peace process is again so urgent, it is hard to think of a stronger candidate than Jonathan Powell.

Michael Woodhouse, the chief executive of ACON, a NSW health organisation for LGBTQ+ communities, urged those at risk to get fully vaccinated. \u201cOur communities have a long history of doing what it takes to protect ourselves and our partners,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is one of those times.\u201d The Western Sydney local health district sexual health specialist, Dr Rohan Bopage, said mpox spreads through close skin-to-skin contact, including sexual contact, and often starts with small pimple-like skin lesions. It also spreads through sharing items such as bedding, towels or clothes, he said, and can spread to others until lesions resolve. He urged people to be aware of symptoms, including mild fever, headache, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, mouth ulcers and rectal pain. While most cases are mild, he urged people with any symptoms to contact their GP or sexual health service.",

The third season of the TV adaptation of Alice Oseman\u2019s enormously popular graphic novels follows much the same path as its predecessors.

Viewers may be surprised to learn that, initially, this involves saying that they love each other.

I was tempted to go back to check.</p> <p>I wonder if this sense of the relationship being more advanced than it is speaks to the fact that some of the stars have broken out on to a far bigger stage. Watching it is a reminder that while Connor and Locke have already gone to Hollywood, this is a cosy, snug drama, resistant to almost all bells and whistles. The extent of its showiness is the occasional cartoonish flourish and a fondness for celebrity cameos.

Otherwise, this Netflix series would be right at home on the BBC (and I don\u2019t mean that as an insult).</p> <p>Each episode follows the same loose formula. There is a momentous or seasonal event \u2013 GCSE results, a summer holiday, Christmas, a birthday \u2013 and the teenagers work out how they feel about an issue, be it Tori recognising her need for companionship now that Charlie is in love, or high-achieving Tara (Corinna Brown) working out how to balance her relationship with her mother\u2019s desire for her to go to a top university.</p> <p>Early on, it seems as if this season might need to find a little more grit for its oyster. The tension of Charlie and Nick\u2019s will-they-won\u2019t-they has long since dissipated.

Nick is essentially the safe dream boyfriend for teenage viewers \u2013 an apparition of calmness, romance and support, packaged in a willingness to wear a vest, or go topless, whenever duty calls. Charlie\u2019s decline unfurls at a steady pace and maintains an appearance of truth.

While Tao\u2019s vast enthusiasm for his role as boyfriend is mildly irritating, there are intricacies to their relationship that are explored with real care.</p> <p>The teenagers of Heartstopper all have their issues, and face self-doubt and uncertainties, but they explain what is happening to them as if they are examining every facet of their behaviour from a great distance. While I don\u2019t doubt that real teenagers are articulate, this comprehension of what is happening offers the solace of a fantasy, without the rough edges of reality. Ultimately, everything here feels just about manageable, even at its worst. This is part of what makes it so comforting to watch.</p> <p>Smartphone natives will find its frenetic pace more bearable than those of us who grew up with Snake on a Nokia, but, in truth, this is not for us.

      "bodyText": "A former top environment official has said the EU\u2019s credibility on its climate commitments has been damaged by plans for a one-year delay to a law to combat deforestation that followed intense lobbying from companies and governments around the world. Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius, a Lithuanian MEP who was the environment commissioner until mid-July, said postponing the deforestation regulation would be \u201ca step backward in the fight against climate change\u201d. In a sharp rebuke to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, Sinkevi\u010dius, who drafted the legislation that was agreed in 2023, said the 12-month delay would put 80,000 acres (32,375 hectares) of forest at risk each day, fuel 15% of global carbon emissions, break trust with the EU\u2019s global partners and damage its credibility on its climate commitments. On Wednesday, the European Commission proposed a 12-month delay to the law, which has been hailed by its advocates as the most ambitious in the world to combat deforestation. The law will ban the sale in the EU of commodities linked to deforestation such as cocoa, coffee, soya, palm oil and rubber, as well as products including chocolate, leather and furniture. Companies are required to use satellite monitoring and other checks to ensure their products have not been produced on land deforested or degraded after 31 December 2020. The delay must be approved by the EU ministers and the European parliament to take effect. If approved, the law would come into force on 30 December 2025 for large companies and 30 June 2026 for micro and small enterprises. The call for a delay followed intense lobbying from governments and companies around the world, which argued that the law unfairly penalised exports to Europe and would harm small farmers and businesses. In a statement released on Wednesday, the commission said a 12-month delay \u201cto phase in the system\u201d was a balanced solution that would support operators around the world in \u201csecuring a smooth implementation from the start\u201d. Countries including Brazil and Australia had pushed for a delay, arguing that EU officials were using the wrong data to measure forests, while Indonesia and Ivory Coast have said it could penalise small farmers and harm their exports. \u201cGlobal partners have repeatedly expressed concerns about their state of preparedness,\u201d most recently during the United Nations general assembly in New York last week, the commission said. \u201cThe extension proposal in no way puts into question the objectives or the substance of the law,\u201d it added. The law was adopted by a large majority of MEPs and member states in April 2023, but since then there has been a growing backlash about the costs of environmental legislation that has led the commission, for example, to scrap plans for pesticides regulation. Environmental campaigners said Von der Leyen, who is soon to begin a second five-year term as commission president, was undermining one of the key achievements of her term, the European green deal. Anke Schulmeister-Oldenhove, a senior forest policy officer at WWF, said: \u201cPresident Von der Leyen is effectively giving her green light for deforestation to continue for another 12 months at a time when urgent action is needed to stop it. By undermining one of the key achievements of the European green deal, this decision casts serious doubt on the commission president\u2019s commitment to delivering on the EU\u2019s environmental promises.\u201d Nicole Polsterer at the campaign group Fern said: \u201cUrsula von der Leyen has bowed to constant pressure from companies and countries who knew the regulation was coming for years but haven\u2019t prepared properly for it.

Deforestation, Liese added, \u201cis a disaster for the global climate as for other things, but we have to do it the right way and get those affected by the law more involved\u201d. The VDMA, which represents Europe\u2019s mechanical engineering industry, described the law as \u201ca prime example of well-intentioned but badly done regulation\u201d that was likely to make all affected products scarcer and more expensive. \u201cObtaining the required geolocation data may be easy for cattle and products made from them.

Campaigners are calling for a \u201crapid rescue package for UK nature\u201d, as government delegates head to Cop16, the international nature summit, which will take place from 21 October in Colombia. They intend to ask other countries to stick to ambitious nature targets. The commitment to protect 30% of land for nature by 2030 \u2013 sometimes called the 30x30 commitment \u2013 was made in 2020 by the then prime minister, Boris Johnson. But according to a report by Wildlife and Countryside Link (WCL), the amount of land in England that can be said to be effectively protected for nature has fallen to just 2.93%, while the amount of sea protected is at 9.92%. The land figure is down from last year\u2019s update, which the WCL put at 3.11%, while 8% of sea in England was effectively protected for nature in 2023.

National parks should be areas where land is in good condition, but previous reports show that nature within these sites is often no better than outside them. Currently only designated nature sites such as SSSIs within national parks count as protected for nature as the parks themselves are not specifically designed for nature but for recreation, unique views and other attributes. There are small improvements in the protection of England\u2019s seas because of new laws to prohibit destructive fishing. In March 2024, ministers introduced bylaws prohibiting bottom-towed fishing gear across some marine protected areas (MPAs).

Her opponents were thrown in prison and the press was censored. This was the soft aspect of her rule. The truly harrowing story unfolded in the villages and towns, where the prime minister\u2019s son, Sanjay, fixated on curbing India\u2019s population, launched a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-30040790\">mass sterilisation programme</a>. More than six million men were subjected to forced surgical procedures in one year: some were mutilated. Sanjay\u2019s drive to beautify India\u2019s cities resulted in forced displacement of innumerable people. In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkman_gate_demolition_and_rioting\">Delhi, the police opened fire</a> on the residents of a slum who attempted to resist peacefully. The memory of the \u201cEmergency\u201d \u2013 as the period is universally remembered \u2013 can still make people shudder today.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2024/event/the-imaginary-institution-of-india-art-1975-1998\">The Imaginary Institution of India</a>, opening at the Barbican in London, uses the declaration of the Emergency in 1975 as a starting point of the story of India\u2019s voyage through decades of political tumult, culminating in the country\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhran-II#:~:text=One%20fusion%20and%20two%20fission,I%20through%20to%20Shakti%2DV.\">successful nuclear test in 1998</a> \u2013 an event that, following extensive condemnation by western powers in possession of vast nuclear arsenals of their own, led to India being described as an \u201cemerging great power\u201d. The artworks on display \u2013 forged in a period of social instability, sectarian strife, state-sanctioned violence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/14/bhopal-toxic-gas-leak-chemical-environmental-disaster-waiting-for-justice-union-carbide-dow\">history\u2019s worst industrial calamity at Bhopal</a>, followed by economic liberalisation, a proliferation of wealth and intense urbanisation \u2013 vivify India\u2019s extraordinary metamorphosis.</p>    <p>This transformation supplied a new stimulus to artists. The show hauntingly illuminates the civic engagement artists and Indian society took part in while, rattled by the Gandhi family\u2019s abuse of power, they reckoned with the reality of the terms of their nationhood. Indira Gandhi\u2019s assault on the constitution had the effect of intensifying individual and collective activism, which confronted the establishment subtly from the studio and stridently from the street.</p> <p>The artist and poet <a href=\"https://www.vadehraart.com/artists/69-gulammohammed-sheikh/\">Gulammohammed Sheikh</a> painted one of his first political artworks, Speechless City, in response to the excesses of the Emergency. Post-apocalyptic in its vision, India\u2019s urban landscape, ordinarily overrun with all forms of life, is emptied out. Stacks of jaunty modernist housing, swaddled in an ominous saffron hue, show no trace of their inhabitants. Doors and windows are left ajar, and feral dogs and flocks of birds scavenge the cityscape.</p> <p>The image, from 1975, looks remarkably prescient today. The fiery pigment, a colour associated with the Hindu right, seems to radiate a warning of the coming communitarian violence that was to erupt with fury in the 1980s and the early 1990s. The 1980s was an especially violent decade. The combination of crises \u2013 militant separatist movements, militaristic responses by the state, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Indira_Gandhi#:~:text=Indian%20prime%20minister%20Indira%20Gandhi,on%20the%20orders%20of%20Gandhi.\">assassination of Mrs Gandhi in 1984</a>, and the pogrom of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8306420.stm\">Sikhs that followed in Delhi</a> \u2013 seemed to shatter the cultural and religious syncretism held up by Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi as a core tenet of the modern Indian republic.</p>    <p>Artistic concerns went beyond religious division and addressed the perilous status of India\u2019s marginalised groups. The experience of queer communities, criminalised in law and stigmatised by society, were piercingly evoked in Bhupen Khakhar\u2019s vivid paintings, in which early Renaissance perspectives folded into miniature flatness, and tender photographs by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/nov/22/this-was-my-own-tribe-pride-before-it-went-commercial-in-pictures-sunil-gupta\">Sunil Gupta</a>. Gieve Patel and Sudhir Patwardhan considered daily wage workers, while others, such as Jangarh Singh Shyam brought to the fore and innovated indigenous visual culture. These depictions, when put on display, tended sometimes to incite the very forms of oppression they sought to expose. Khakhar\u2019s portrayals of intimate same-sex embraces, for instance, had to be hidden to maintain the peace.</p> <p>Savindra Sawarkar not only addressed India\u2019s caste system but also centred Dalit communities (formerly Untouchables) \u2013 making him a pioneer in an art world that was still dominated by the upper castes. In his etchings from the mid 80s, Dalit figures forged from a scratchy matrix of black lines, so dense that they appeared to be annihilating the individuals to which they gave shape, were shown with the brooms carried to sweep away their footprints and the pots fastened around their necks to collect their saliva, considered a pollutant by upper castes.</p> <p>The plight of India\u2019s oppressed communities was thrown into agonising relief by <a href=\"https://feminisminindia.com/2021/09/02/mathura-rape-case-1972-watershed-moment-india-rape-laws/\">the rape in custody</a>, in 1972, of a teenage Adivasi girl called Mathura. The protests ignited by the acquittal of the policemen who raped her also became the spark for the women\u2019s movement that crystallised by the end of that decade. The anti-dowry rallies, sit-ins and street plays that exploded in Delhi launched <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/research/in-focus/seven-lives-dream-sheba-chhachhi\">Sheba Chhachhi\u2019s long-term photography project</a>, which chronicled the activism of seven women between 1980 and 1991. \u201cThese women moved from their personal tragedies into the larger realm of changing conditions for women,\u201d Chhachhi tells me. \u201cMany of them are no longer with us. They were friends, but they live on in the work, and they offer that possibility of resistance and change.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/chhachhi-sathyarani-staged-portrait-supreme-court-delhi-p81158\">Sathyarani \u2013 Staged Portrait</a>, a photograph of a mother seeking justice for her daughter burnt to death over her dowry, encapsulates the sustained campaign for legal reform. The elderly woman, draped in a sari, sits on the stairs of the supreme court in Delhi, the stacks of files strewn before her a testament to her tenacity and the obtuseness of the system.</p>    <p>The exhibition\u2019s curator, Shanay Jhaveri, has attempted to follow each artist\u2019s progression over the period covered by the show. The works he has chosen show aesthetic changes and realignment of practices in response to the events between 1975 and 1998.</p> <p>The sixth of December 1992, when the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-42219773\">Babri mosque was razed</a> by Hindu supremacists in full view of the authorities, is often regarded as a moment of rupture in the history of Indian art. Just as there was a before and after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/dec/02/arts.artsnews1\">Duchamp\u2019s Fountain</a>, Indian art can be periodised into before and after this cataclysmic event. The riots that flared up across the country were captured extensively by a media culture that had transformed exponentially after the opening up of India\u2019s economy the year before. Sheela Gowda, a formidable artist based in Bangalore, questioned her practice after seeing a photograph of fatal religious clashes in Hyderabad in central India. \u201cI couldn\u2019t continue in the same way,\u201d Gowda told me. \u201cThe political was not being reflected in the paintings I was doing.\u201d The artist <a href=\"https://www.talwargallery.com/exhibitions/rummana-hussain#tab:slideshow\">Rummana Hussain</a> abandoned painting altogether for performance and object-based installations which, including shards of smashed terracotta pots, alluded to the shattering of civic society.</p> <p>Gowda, searching for something \u201cimmediate and meaningful\u201d, adopted a new material, cow dung, sculpting it into installations and applying it to paper. Dung, a material of utilitarian and spiritual value in India, also bespoke the contradictions in an increasingly fractured country. A surge of foreign investment generated explosive patterns of consumption in what the Indian economist Jean Dr\u00e8ze called \u201cislands of California\u201d, while most of the rest of India remained \u201ca sea of sub-Saharan Africa\u201d; most Indians struggled to make ends meet as food prices rose and the government pared back public investment to make up for the generous tax cuts it gave to corporations.</p> <p>The show\u2019s chronology enables the audience to move through themes, but it would be inaccurate to regard the period it isolates as artistically unique. Art in India has long been inextricably linked to politics, and there is a lofty artistic tradition of engaging with social upheavals, not only at home but also abroad. In 1971, many Indian artists, including Khakhar, reacted forcefully to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/10/bangladesh.photography\">the Bangladesh war</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/apr/03/52-years-bangladesh-birangona-women-mass-rape-surviviors\">atrocities</a> that gave rise to it. The drawings of Vivan Sundaram, another artist included in this show, are some of the sharpest artistic responses to the Gulf war of 1991.</p> <p>Despair, disillusionment and defiance leap from many of the works here. The show\u2019s timing, staged just as India begins to settle into the third consecutive term of Modi\u2019s strongman rule, seems fitting. India in recent years has been the site of some of the largest democratic protests in its history \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/10/india-braces-for-protests-over-citizenship-bill-excluding-muslims\">the women-led sit-in </a>against the government\u2019s introduction of a religious test of citizenship, to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/12/farmers-protests-india-why-laws-caused-anger\">farmers\u2019 uprising</a> that compelled Modi to reverse course, to the demonstrations by unemployed youth in a country where economic inequality is thought to have grown worse over the past decades than it was under the British Raj. The exhibition is a reminder that the struggle for human dignity is in fact a never-ending battle.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2024/event/the-imaginary-institution-of-india-art-1975-1998\">The Imaginary Institution of India: Art 1975\u20131998 is at the Barbican, London, 5 October to 5 January</a></p></li> </ul>",

The show hauntingly illuminates the civic engagement artists and Indian society took part in while, rattled by the Gandhi family\u2019s abuse of power, they reckoned with the reality of the terms of their nationhood. Indira Gandhi\u2019s assault on the constitution had the effect of intensifying individual and collective activism, which confronted the establishment subtly from the studio and stridently from the street. The artist and poet Gulammohammed Sheikh painted one of his first political artworks, Speechless City, in response to the excesses of the Emergency. Post-apocalyptic in its vision, India\u2019s urban landscape, ordinarily overrun with all forms of life, is emptied out. Stacks of jaunty modernist housing, swaddled in an ominous saffron hue, show no trace of their inhabitants. Doors and windows are left ajar, and feral dogs and flocks of birds scavenge the cityscape. The image, from 1975, looks remarkably prescient today. The fiery pigment, a colour associated with the Hindu right, seems to radiate a warning of the coming communitarian violence that was to erupt with fury in the 1980s and the early 1990s. The 1980s was an especially violent decade. The combination of crises \u2013 militant separatist movements, militaristic responses by the state, the assassination of Mrs Gandhi in 1984, and the pogrom of the Sikhs that followed in Delhi \u2013 seemed to shatter the cultural and religious syncretism held up by Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi as a core tenet of the modern Indian republic. Artistic concerns went beyond religious division and addressed the perilous status of India\u2019s marginalised groups. The experience of queer communities, criminalised in law and stigmatised by society, were piercingly evoked in Bhupen Khakhar\u2019s vivid paintings, in which early Renaissance perspectives folded into miniature flatness, and tender photographs by Sunil Gupta. Gieve Patel and Sudhir Patwardhan considered daily wage workers, while others, such as Jangarh Singh Shyam brought to the fore and innovated indigenous visual culture. These depictions, when put on display, tended sometimes to incite the very forms of oppression they sought to expose. Khakhar\u2019s portrayals of intimate same-sex embraces, for instance, had to be hidden to maintain the peace. Savindra Sawarkar not only addressed India\u2019s caste system but also centred Dalit communities (formerly Untouchables) \u2013 making him a pioneer in an art world that was still dominated by the upper castes. In his etchings from the mid 80s, Dalit figures forged from a scratchy matrix of black lines, so dense that they appeared to be annihilating the individuals to which they gave shape, were shown with the brooms carried to sweep away their footprints and the pots fastened around their necks to collect their saliva, considered a pollutant by upper castes. The plight of India\u2019s oppressed communities was thrown into agonising relief by the rape in custody, in 1972, of a teenage Adivasi girl called Mathura. The protests ignited by the acquittal of the policemen who raped her also became the spark for the women\u2019s movement that crystallised by the end of that decade. The anti-dowry rallies, sit-ins and street plays that exploded in Delhi launched Sheba Chhachhi\u2019s long-term photography project, which chronicled the activism of seven women between 1980 and 1991. \u201cThese women moved from their personal tragedies into the larger realm of changing conditions for women,\u201d Chhachhi tells me. \u201cMany of them are no longer with us. They were friends, but they live on in the work, and they offer that possibility of resistance and change.\u201d Sathyarani \u2013 Staged Portrait, a photograph of a mother seeking justice for her daughter burnt to death over her dowry, encapsulates the sustained campaign for legal reform. The elderly woman, draped in a sari, sits on the stairs of the supreme court in Delhi, the stacks of files strewn before her a testament to her tenacity and the obtuseness of the system. The exhibition\u2019s curator, Shanay Jhaveri, has attempted to follow each artist\u2019s progression over the period covered by the show. The works he has chosen show aesthetic changes and realignment of practices in response to the events between 1975 and 1998. The sixth of December 1992, when the Babri mosque was razed by Hindu supremacists in full view of the authorities, is often regarded as a moment of rupture in the history of Indian art. Just as there was a before and after Duchamp\u2019s Fountain, Indian art can be periodised into before and after this cataclysmic event. The riots that flared up across the country were captured extensively by a media culture that had transformed exponentially after the opening up of India\u2019s economy the year before. Sheela Gowda, a formidable artist based in Bangalore, questioned her practice after seeing a photograph of fatal religious clashes in Hyderabad in central India. \u201cI couldn\u2019t continue in the same way,\u201d Gowda told me. \u201cThe political was not being reflected in the paintings I was doing.\u201d The artist Rummana Hussain abandoned painting altogether for performance and object-based installations which, including shards of smashed terracotta pots, alluded to the shattering of civic society. Gowda, searching for something \u201cimmediate and meaningful\u201d, adopted a new material, cow dung, sculpting it into installations and applying it to paper. Dung, a material of utilitarian and spiritual value in India, also bespoke the contradictions in an increasingly fractured country. A surge of foreign investment generated explosive patterns of consumption in what the Indian economist Jean Dr\u00e8ze called \u201cislands of California\u201d, while most of the rest of India remained \u201ca sea of sub-Saharan Africa\u201d; most Indians struggled to make ends meet as food prices rose and the government pared back public investment to make up for the generous tax cuts it gave to corporations. The show\u2019s chronology enables the audience to move through themes, but it would be inaccurate to regard the period it isolates as artistically unique. Art in India has long been inextricably linked to politics, and there is a lofty artistic tradition of engaging with social upheavals, not only at home but also abroad. In 1971, many Indian artists, including Khakhar, reacted forcefully to the Bangladesh war and the atrocities that gave rise to it. The drawings of Vivan Sundaram, another artist included in this show, are some of the sharpest artistic responses to the Gulf war of 1991. Despair, disillusionment and defiance leap from many of the works here. The show\u2019s timing, staged just as India begins to settle into the third consecutive term of Modi\u2019s strongman rule, seems fitting. India in recent years has been the site of some of the largest democratic protests in its history \u2013 from the women-led sit-in against the government\u2019s introduction of a religious test of citizenship, to the farmers\u2019 uprising that compelled Modi to reverse course, to the demonstrations by unemployed youth in a country where economic inequality is thought to have grown worse over the past decades than it was under the British Raj. The exhibition is a reminder that the struggle for human dignity is in fact a never-ending battle. The Imaginary Institution of India: Art 1975\u20131998 is at the Barbican, London, 5 October to 5 January",

      "body": "<p>Somebody decided there should be a book of my Guardian columns. Yes, really. I cringed a bit at the prospect. I mean, one a week is too much for some people. So how is a whole book of them going to work? At least it wouldn\u2019t take much effort on my part, I thought. How wrong I was. For a start, I had to go back and read hundreds of them. They really are a bit much all at once. Spoons, ageing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/09/dream-job-countryside-walkers-stiles\">footpaths</a>, drinking, spectacles, death, ADHD, death again. And so on. My colleague Caroline Frost, having been persuaded to interview me about the book for a literary festival, read 60 columns at one sitting and seemed a bit shaken by the experience. It\u2019s more for dipping into, I told her. An excellent toilet book, perhaps.</p> <p>Speaking of toilets, the column I wrote about having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/21/urinal-in-my-flat-changed-my-life-so-why-are-people-appalled\">a urinal in my flat</a> was a gamechanger, in the sense that no longer am I stopped in the street and asked either about my drinking or West Brom. Now it\u2019s invariably about what I wee into at home. Only this week I was stopped at the BBC by a chap I didn\u2019t know who asked me if I minded answering a \u201csensitive question\u201d. Oh God, what now? Cringing with embarrassment, he said, \u201cIs it really true you have a urinal?\u201d I laughed and told him that I did and that I was relieved his question was about nothing serious. But his expression suggested that he considered my having a urinal really was a rather sensitive matter.</p>    <p>I still find it odd that people find the idea of a urinal weird. It\u2019s just a small toilet fitted a bit higher up a wall. Perhaps it\u2019s because they think it\u2019s like something you would find in the gents in a pub, a proper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2023/feb/15/decades-on-i-am-still-traumatised-by-my-visit-to-the-school-toilets\">big floor-to-waist-high job with a channel at the bottom</a> featuring cigarette ends you can try to chase away. It\u2019s weird, too, that I\u2019d mentioned having a urinal before, on radio, television and in other newspapers, and it had never caused much of a stir. I can only conclude that Guardian readers are more urinal sensitive.</p> <p>The reaction was mad. One newspaper even claimed that my column had caused a spike in urinal sales. I wondered if this all might bring about the offer of the lucrative product endorsement deal I\u2019d been dreaming of. No such luck. For that, I\u2019d have to wait until I wrote about the misery of having to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/29/i-am-cursed-to-wear-compression-socks-spare-a-thought-for-me-this-summer\">wear a compression sock</a>. I\u2019m pleased to report that a year after the piece came out, representatives of a manufacturer of compression wear have been in touch. I\u2019ve instructed my people to speak to their people.</p> <p>All in all, I\u2019ve been engaged in an orgy of oversharing. It was the only way I could come up with anything to write about. And in more ways than one it\u2019s changed my life. Five years ago, after I wrote about the difficulties I have bending down, the Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief asked me in for a cup of tea. She told me the piece had made her laugh. And we ended up getting married. She\u2019s not laughing now!</p> <p>It\u2019s a privilege to be able to share random stuff, and not one I take lightly. If anyone stops me in the street to tell me they\u2019ve read a column, I\u2019m pathetically grateful. Often the complimenter can\u2019t get shot of me and ends up having to pretend to have a train to catch in order to make their excuses and leave. But when my dad died, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d have coped if I hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to write about it. That said, writing about it also led to more pain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I take no credit for this \u2013 the credit is all Angela\u2019s. It was my privilege to be able to pass on her wisdom and give it the reach it deserves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>An old friend of our family, Angela, a nurse from Neath, read what I wrote about how horrifyingly unprepared I was to be with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/03/dad-last-days-life-alone-distressed-adrian-chiles\">Dad as he lay dying</a>. She sent me a text that completely floored me. She said we should try to see it as a privilege to be with someone as they died. Rarely do you read or hear something that utterly reframes how you see things. If you were with someone as they were born, as they came into the world, you\u2019d feel it was a privilege, so why not see it the same way if you\u2019re with them as they leave this world? No one, least of all Angela, was saying it\u2019s easy, but if I\u2019d managed to channel even a tiny bit of this thought it might all have been a bit less awful.</p> <p>Her wisdom came too late for me and my dad, and I\u2019ll never stop regretting that. I think every day about how I could have done it better. My only consolation is that I went on to write about this and people from all over the world got in touch to express their gratitude. I take no credit for this \u2013 the credit is all Angela\u2019s. It was my privilege to be able to pass on her wisdom and give it the reach it deserves.</p>    <p>I\u2019m also grateful to have learned \u2013 bluntly, through desperately looking for something to write about \u2013 how even the most mundane things are freighted with meaning. A hug, a stone, a handshake, a recipe, a supermarket delivery, a spoon. I always end up realising that there\u2019s a lot going on there. Or perhaps it\u2019s just me. That\u2019s my fear. But there always seems to be at least one person who feels the same way. OK, writing about a favourite spoon might have been born out of desperation, but then a woman told me about mourning the loss of the spoon with which her late mother served up food. \u201cThere was just so much love in that spoon,\u201d she said sadly.</p> <p>I have also written about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2023/aug/31/its-only-a-coat-hanger-but-it-brings-back-such-fond-memories\">my favourite coathanger</a> but on that, so far, I am alone with my feelings. I don\u2019t think that one even made the cut for the book. But if you are someone with a favourite coathanger, please do get in touch. I\u2019d really be most grateful.</p> <h2>Curiouser and curiouser: excerpts from selected columns</h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/21/urinal-in-my-flat-changed-my-life-so-why-are-people-appalled\">I have a urinal in my flat and it has changed my life \u2013 so why are people appalled?</a></h2>    <p>I\u2019m a great enthusiast for urinals in the home. This is an enthusiasm shared by very few people, especially women, who have been known to retch at the very sight of it. This baffles me. Many a chap has been chastised about his incompetent use of conventional toilets \u2013 poor aim, not putting the seat down and so on. Well, here\u2019s the answer: a receptacle at the correct height for ease of use, which is neat, tidy, clean and flushable. It changed my life. Gentlemen \u2013 or anyone with a penis \u2013 trust me: it is wonderful to have a toilet of one\u2019s own.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/29/i-am-cursed-to-wear-compression-socks-spare-a-thought-for-me-this-summer\">I am cursed to wear compression socks. Spare a thought for me this summer</a></h2>    <p>Spare a thought, if you will, for compression sock-wearers at this time of year. In shorts \u2013 or a skirt or dress, for that matter \u2013 there are no two ways about it: they\u2019re not a good look. And the class 3s only come in that awful beige, the ghastly attempt at skin colour that is a match for no one\u2019s skin.</p> <p>The one consolation is that, while my instrument of torture makes for a terrible start to the day, it is a wonderful way to finish it. Oh, the relief when the bastard thing can be peeled off as I make ready for bed.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/23/loneliness-is-awful-so-every-day-i-try-to-start-a-conversation-with-a-stranger\">Loneliness is awful \u2013 so every day I try to start a conversation with a stranger</a></h2> <p>If you\u2019ve been on the telly a lot, you tend to get recognised. Unaccountably, I suppose, this seems to motivate people to speak to you. It\u2019s a great conversation-starter, but it\u2019s always the other person doing the starting. This dawned on me a few years ago when Croatia\u2019s Davis Cup tennis team beat Great Britain at Wimbledon. I was invited to the group\u2019s celebration party at a pub in that part of London. The Croatian friend who had invited me couldn\u2019t come, so I knew not a soul there. But, no matter, I thought: I\u2019ll just turn up and win friends and influence people with great enthusiasm.</p> <p>In I walked, looking around in expectation of being engaged in conversation. Nothing happened. Nobody recognised me, therefore no one felt any urge to talk to me. OK, then I\u2019d have to start a conversation. I opened my mouth to speak to someone, but nothing came out. I\u2019d utterly forgotten how to do it.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never forgotten that awful feeling of being lonely in a crowd. So, every day I try to start a conversation with a stranger, hoping they don\u2019t edge away in alarm. And I hope I\u2019m always as open as possible to a conversation anyone sees fit to start with me.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/04/ive-no-fewer-than-17-wooden-spoons-but-i-have-a-favourite-and-id-miss-it-for-ever-if-it-went-missing\">I thought it was weird to have a favourite spoon. Then I realised I wasn\u2019t alone \u2026</a></h2>    <p>I have started getting feelings for my spoons. I blame Tim Hayward, restaurant critic for the Financial Times, for this. He wrote a brilliant piece last week about his search for the perfect spoon. At first glance this was a bit random, even for me. But before long I was with him all the way in his quest for the spoon of his dreams, a spoon of just the right depth, size, shape, length and other variables.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/24/i-worry-that-hugging-people-could-come-across-as-creepy-so-from-now-on-all-youre-getting-is-a-handshake\">I worry that hugging people could come across as creepy. So, from now on, all you\u2019re getting is a handshake | Adrian Chiles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I surveyed my spoon drawer and considered my feelings. I was disappointed to see I have no fewer than 17 wooden spoons. Disappointed because this implies a certain shallowness, as if I\u2019m some kind of spoon Lothario, collecting notches on my bedpost, focusing on quantity rather than quality. Stirring without love is just exercise, after all. But sorting through them, I realised I do have a favourite. It\u2019s more of a spatula than a spoon, but it suits me very well. I had always looked out for it without knowing I was doing so and felt a twinge of disappointment if it didn\u2019t come to hand. If ever I lost it for good, I now understood, I would miss it for ever.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/27/i-am-often-the-oldest-person-in-the-room-now-why-dont-i-feel-wiser\">I am often the oldest person in the room now. Why don\u2019t I feel wiser?</a></h2> <p>I went to the Croatian embassy recently for a gathering of Croatian professionals in the UK. Upon entering, I thought I\u2019d walked into the wrong event; it felt more like a youth club for exceptionally well-dressed people. I was a good quarter of a century older than nearly everyone there. They all seemed more confident and wiser than me. All of them spoke English far better than I spoke their language. It felt as if I didn\u2019t have a lot to offer.</p> <p>I got talking to one impressive young woman studying chemical engineering.</p> <p>\u201cPostgrad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. First degree. I\u2019m only 20.\u201d</p> <p>She turned out to be the daughter of a famous Croatian goalkeeper. Sloping off home, I checked his Wikipedia page and discovered that I\u2019m considerably older than him, too.</p> <p>When I got back, I made myself some cocoa and went to bed.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Curious Columns of Adrian Chiles is published on 10 October (Profile, \u00a310.99).

An old friend of our family, Angela, a nurse from Neath, read what I wrote about how horrifyingly unprepared I was to be with Dad as he lay dying. She sent me a text that completely floored me. She said we should try to see it as a privilege to be with someone as they died. Rarely do you read or hear something that utterly reframes how you see things. If you were with someone as they were born, as they came into the world, you\u2019d feel it was a privilege, so why not see it the same way if you\u2019re with them as they leave this world? No one, least of all Angela, was saying it\u2019s easy, but if I\u2019d managed to channel even a tiny bit of this thought it might all have been a bit less awful. Her wisdom came too late for me and my dad, and I\u2019ll never stop regretting that. I think every day about how I could have done it better. My only consolation is that I went on to write about this and people from all over the world got in touch to express their gratitude. I take no credit for this \u2013 the credit is all Angela\u2019s. It was my privilege to be able to pass on her wisdom and give it the reach it deserves. I\u2019m also grateful to have learned \u2013 bluntly, through desperately looking for something to write about \u2013 how even the most mundane things are freighted with meaning. A hug, a stone, a handshake, a recipe, a supermarket delivery, a spoon. I always end up realising that there\u2019s a lot going on there. Or perhaps it\u2019s just me. That\u2019s my fear. But there always seems to be at least one person who feels the same way. OK, writing about a favourite spoon might have been born out of desperation, but then a woman told me about mourning the loss of the spoon with which her late mother served up food. \u201cThere was just so much love in that spoon,\u201d she said sadly. I have also written about my favourite coathanger but on that, so far, I am alone with my feelings. I don\u2019t think that one even made the cut for the book. But if you are someone with a favourite coathanger, please do get in touch. I\u2019d really be most grateful. Curiouser and curiouser: excerpts from selected columns I have a urinal in my flat and it has changed my life \u2013 so why are people appalled? I\u2019m a great enthusiast for urinals in the home. This is an enthusiasm shared by very few people, especially women, who have been known to retch at the very sight of it. This baffles me. Many a chap has been chastised about his incompetent use of conventional toilets \u2013 poor aim, not putting the seat down and so on. Well, here\u2019s the answer: a receptacle at the correct height for ease of use, which is neat, tidy, clean and flushable. It changed my life. Gentlemen \u2013 or anyone with a penis \u2013 trust me: it is wonderful to have a toilet of one\u2019s own. I am cursed to wear compression socks. Spare a thought for me this summer Spare a thought, if you will, for compression sock-wearers at this time of year. In shorts \u2013 or a skirt or dress, for that matter \u2013 there are no two ways about it: they\u2019re not a good look. And the class 3s only come in that awful beige, the ghastly attempt at skin colour that is a match for no one\u2019s skin. The one consolation is that, while my instrument of torture makes for a terrible start to the day, it is a wonderful way to finish it. Oh, the relief when the bastard thing can be peeled off as I make ready for bed. Loneliness is awful \u2013 so every day I try to start a conversation with a stranger If you\u2019ve been on the telly a lot, you tend to get recognised. Unaccountably, I suppose, this seems to motivate people to speak to you. It\u2019s a great conversation-starter, but it\u2019s always the other person doing the starting. This dawned on me a few years ago when Croatia\u2019s Davis Cup tennis team beat Great Britain at Wimbledon. I was invited to the group\u2019s celebration party at a pub in that part of London. The Croatian friend who had invited me couldn\u2019t come, so I knew not a soul there. But, no matter, I thought: I\u2019ll just turn up and win friends and influence people with great enthusiasm. In I walked, looking around in expectation of being engaged in conversation. Nothing happened. Nobody recognised me, therefore no one felt any urge to talk to me. OK, then I\u2019d have to start a conversation. I opened my mouth to speak to someone, but nothing came out. I\u2019d utterly forgotten how to do it. I\u2019ve never forgotten that awful feeling of being lonely in a crowd. So, every day I try to start a conversation with a stranger, hoping they don\u2019t edge away in alarm. And I hope I\u2019m always as open as possible to a conversation anyone sees fit to start with me. I thought it was weird to have a favourite spoon. Then I realised I wasn\u2019t alone \u2026 I have started getting feelings for my spoons. I blame Tim Hayward, restaurant critic for the Financial Times, for this. He wrote a brilliant piece last week about his search for the perfect spoon. At first glance this was a bit random, even for me. But before long I was with him all the way in his quest for the spoon of his dreams, a spoon of just the right depth, size, shape, length and other variables. I surveyed my spoon drawer and considered my feelings. I was disappointed to see I have no fewer than 17 wooden spoons. Disappointed because this implies a certain shallowness, as if I\u2019m some kind of spoon Lothario, collecting notches on my bedpost, focusing on quantity rather than quality. Stirring without love is just exercise, after all. But sorting through them, I realised I do have a favourite. It\u2019s more of a spatula than a spoon, but it suits me very well. I had always looked out for it without knowing I was doing so and felt a twinge of disappointment if it didn\u2019t come to hand. If ever I lost it for good, I now understood, I would miss it for ever. I am often the oldest person in the room now. Why don\u2019t I feel wiser? I went to the Croatian embassy recently for a gathering of Croatian professionals in the UK. Upon entering, I thought I\u2019d walked into the wrong event; it felt more like a youth club for exceptionally well-dressed people. I was a good quarter of a century older than nearly everyone there. They all seemed more confident and wiser than me. All of them spoke English far better than I spoke their language. It felt as if I didn\u2019t have a lot to offer. I got talking to one impressive young woman studying chemical engineering. \u201cPostgrad?\u201d \u201cNo. First degree. I\u2019m only 20.\u201d She turned out to be the daughter of a famous Croatian goalkeeper. Sloping off home, I checked his Wikipedia page and discovered that I\u2019m considerably older than him, too. When I got back, I made myself some cocoa and went to bed. \u2022 The Curious Columns of Adrian Chiles is published on 10 October (Profile, \u00a310.99).

      "bodyText": "The Queensland state energy minister, Mick de Brenni, has told a court hearing he was not made aware of concerns that safety issues at the Callide power station posed a \u201ccatastrophic risk\u201d prior to the 2021 unit explosion that caused statewide blackouts. On the third day of the formal state election campaign, de Brenni fronted the federal court where he was grilled about his knowledge of funding difficulties, maintenance backlogs and safety concerns at the plant, near the town of Biloela in central Queensland. Asked outside the court if his appearance at the hearing would distract from the government\u2019s election pitch, de Brenni said: \u201cNo.\u201d The public examination is related to the administration of IG Power, a joint-owner of the troubled Callide C power station with CS Energy, a government-owned corporation. CS Energy runs the plant. De Brenni told the court he only became aware of concerns about maintenance and safety earlier in 2024, when he was handed the Brady review into the 2021 explosion, which documented prior issues including maintenance failures and the concerns of safety staff. De Brenni told the court he had attended the Callide C site in the days after the explosion and had been given an assurance by Andrew Bills, the former CS Energy chief executive officer, regarding prior maintenance work that \u201ceverything that was required to be done had been done\u201d. The minister told the court he only became aware of concerns raised by a safety staff member during a 2019 exit review when he read about them in the Brady review. The staff member had been a process safety manager who had sought additional funding, which was not forthcoming, he said in court. The court heard, after resigning in April 2019, the safety review member raised concern about \u201ctelltale signs that a process safety incident is quite possible\u201d and warned of \u201ccatastrophic risk\u201d. For more than 12 months afterwards, there was no process safety team in place, the court heard. De Brenni told the court funding difficulties, maintenance backlogs and safety concerns were not raised with him and that he became aware of these matters when he first read the Brady report. Guardian Australia reported soon after the Callide C explosion that the power plant had broken down eight times in the previous year.",

      "bodyText": "Google and Meta account for 70% of digital advertising and should pay a levy to fund traditional media, according to a new report on media concentration led by researchers from several Australian universities. The communications, media and internet concentration in Australia report, which tracked the country between 2019 and 2022, found it has the second-highest media concentration in the world. Its newspaper sector alone is dominated by four companies who control 84% of the market. The international study examined the economic dominance of key players in 15 markets across the world. Only Brazil had a higher media concentration than Australia. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email News Corp, Nine Entertainment, Seven West Media and Australian Community Media have increased their share, which was 78% in 2019, due to mergers and acquisitions such as Nine buying Fairfax Media in 2018. Prof Terry Flew and Dr Rob Nicholls from the University of Sydney\u2019s media and communications department say funds from a levy on digital advertising could be invested in journalism. \u201cA public interest journalism levy, at a rate of about 2%, would generate funds equivalent to or possibly slightly higher than the payments being made under the news media bargaining code,\u201d Flew said. The proposal of a mechanism to slow down the demise of the newspaper sector echoes comments by Anthony Albanese in August that social media companies shouldn\u2019t \u201cessentially ride free\u201d on the backs of traditional media. The prime minister was responding to questions about the possibility of a levy after Meta\u2019s decision to not renew media funding deals. Flew said a levy would be on advertising revenues derived independently of content, and would include News Corp and Nine\u2019s classified advertising of real estate and cars. The Global Media &amp; Internet Concentration Project\u2019s analysis of the media, telco and internet markets found that Google and Meta dominated internet advertising and were the second and eighth largest communication and media enterprises operating in Australia. The study defined media enterprises as any company involved in the communication process. It warned the increase in concentration \u2013 due to the rapid ascent of the global tech companies and the deregulation of media markets \u2013 poses a major threat to local journalism. As audiences desert traditional media for global platforms, the study noted, the ability to regulate for accuracy in news, TV and radio is compromised. \u201cCollating and analysing publicly available revenue and consumer data, we find that from 2019 to 2022, the majority of Australia\u2019s media, internet and communication markets are moderately to highly concentrated,\u201d the report said. \u201cThese results reflect a long history of media concentration in Australia and a continuing trend seen in many developed economies abroad.\u201d But Flew said journalism faces an even bigger threat than concentration: the \u201cwholesale dismantling\u201d of news driven by the growth in news deserts, the disappearance of commercial newspapers and commercial news bulletins in the regions and the threat of AI-generated online searches no longer linking to news websites. \u201cThe relationship AI will have to search is going to be quite profound,\u201d Flew said. He said an earlier study showed that the Seven and Nine networks had cut back their news and current affairs coverage from the early 2000s by 70 to 80%. News Corp closed 100 local print newspapers during the Covid pandemic. \u201cIn the digital age of data-driven capitalism and AI and with the dominance of global digital conglomerates and the possible demise of the news media bargaining code, public interest journalism is in jeopardy,\u201d the report said. Rupert Murdoch owns the biggest media company, controlling a significant share of newspapers, as well as stakes in streaming, online news and pay TV, but News Corp is not locally owned. Nine Entertainment is the largest Australian media company, with holdings in television, radio, and digital media. The major four companies in broadcast TV (Nine, Seven, ABC and Network 10) increased their market concentration from 79 to 87%. The top four players in radio (Southern Cross Media, ABC, ARN and Nova) jumped in market ownership from 57 to 77%.",

Harris enjoyed a brief polling uptick from that performance.</p> \n  <p>But on Tuesday, Walz and Vance largely avoided attacks on each other, and instead concentrated their fire on each other\u2019s running mates. It was a more policy-driven discussion than that of their running mates\u2019, but one with a few gaffes that might overshadow some of the substance in coming days.</p> \n  <p>In a key exchange over abortion, Walz, the governor of Minnesota, followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/11/abortion-harris-trump-debate\">Harris\u2019s lead</a> in using personal stories.</p> \n  <p>Trump \u201cbrags about how great it was that he put the judges in and overturned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/roe-v-wade\">Roe v Wade</a>\u201d, Walz said.

      "bodyText": "This blog is now closed, thanks for following along. You can find our latest US elections coverage here. Over 1.1m homes and businesses were still without power in the U.S. Southeast and Midwest on Wednesday after Helene slammed into the Florida Panhandle as a major hurricane on Sept. 26, according to data from PowerOutage.us. Those outages were down from about 1.7 million on Tuesday as utilities continued to restore power. In total, the storm knocked out service to about 5.5 million customers, predominantly in the south-east. Helene\u2019s winds, rain and storm surge killed more than 160 people. US President Joe Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris have visited Georgia and North Carolina, which were both acutely affected by Hurricane Helene. Biden, who was in North Carolina, announced additional funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures. Biden said the hurricane would cost billions of dollars. \u201cCongress has an obligation\u201d to make sure states have the necessary resources, he said. Harris, in Georgia, handed out meals and said she wanted to, \u201cpersonally take a look at the devastation, which is extraordinary.\u201d She expressed admiration for how \u201cpeople are coming together. People are helping perfect strangers.\u201d \u201cWe are here for the long haul,\u201d she said. Harris also toured a Red Cross relief center and received a briefing from local officials, praising those working to \u201cmeet the needs of people who must be seen and must be heard.\u201d If you\u2019re just tuning in: Donald Trump \u201cresorted to crimes\u201d in a failed bid to cling to power after losing the 2020 election, federal prosecutors said in a newly unsealed court filing that argues that the former US president is not entitled to immunity from prosecution. The filing was unsealed on Wednesday. It was submitted by special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team following a supreme court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents and narrowed the scope of the prosecution. Trump\u2019s legal team have employed a delaying strategy in all the numerous legal cases that Trump faces that has mostly been successful. The 165-page filing is probably the last opportunity for prosecutors to detail their case against Trump before the 5 November election given there will not be a trial before Trump faces the Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris. Prosecutors laid out details including an allegation that a White House staffer heard Trump tell family members that it did not matter if he won or lost the election, \u201cyou still have to fight like hell\u201d. The new filing cites previously unknown accounts offered by Trump\u2019s closest aides to paint a portrait of an \u201cincreasingly desperate\u201d president who, while losing his grip on the White House, \u201cused deceit to target every stage of the electoral process\u201d. \u201cSo what?\u201d the filing quotes Trump as telling an aide after being alerted that his vice-president, Mike Pence, was in potential danger after a crowd of violent supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6. \u201cThe details don\u2019t matter,\u201d Trump said, when told by an adviser that a lawyer who was mounting his legal challenges would not be able to prove the false allegations in court, the filing states. Per the press pool report: Governor Roy Cooper, who was seated directly to Biden\u2019s right, introduced Biden, saying that an entire region of the state was still in a \u201cdangerous situation.\u201d Cooper said he was \u201cgrateful\u201d for the \u201cquick\u201d action and the \u201cmassive surge of help.\u201d \u201cMr. President, we know we\u2019ve made a lot of asks of you \u2013 and we are grateful,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to be a long and difficult recovery.\u201d Here is what Biden said in North Carolina, according to the press pool report: \u201cIn a moment like this we put politics aside,\u201d he said. \u201cOur job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can.\u201d Biden said he\u2019d flown over a lot of disaster areas before, but was struck by the scenes he saw earlier today in the Asheville area. He said he could not \u201cimagine what it must have been like\u201d as \u201call that rain came down,\u201d remarking about how much of Asheville is underwater. Biden said the hurricane would cost billions of dollars. \u201cCongress has an obligation\u201d to make sure states have the necessary resources, he said. \u201cNobody can deny the impact of the climate crisis any more, at least I hope they don\u2019t. They must be brain dead if they do,\u201d he said. \u201cStorm like Helene are getting stronger and stronger.\u201d US president Joe Biden is in North Carolina, where he has \u201cmade additional disaster assistance available to the State of North Carolina by authorizing an increase in the level of federal funding for emergency work undertaken in the State of North Carolina as a result of Tropical Storm Helene\u201d, according to the White House. \u201cUnder the President\u2019s order today, the Federal funds for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance has been increased to 100 percent of the total eligible costs for 180 days from the start of the incident period.\u201d Here is the Associated Press\u2019s report on Kamala Harris visiting Augusta, Georgia: Harris handed out meals, embraced a shaken family and surveyed Hurricane Helene\u2019s \u201cextraordinary\u201d path of destruction through Georgia on Wednesday as she left the campaign trail to pledge federal help and personally take in scenes of toppled trees, damaged homes and lives upended. She visited Augusta, where power lines stretched along the sidewalk and utility poles lay cracked and broken. The vice president spoke from a lectern erected in front of a house with a fallen tree teetering on its roof, acknowledging those who had died in the disaster while also trying to project a tone of unity and hope for communities now facing long and expensive rebuilds. Harris said she wanted to, \u201cpersonally take a look at the devastation, which is extraordinary.\u201d She expressed admiration for how \u201cpeople are coming together. People are helping perfect strangers.\u201d The Democratic presidential nominee said that shows \u201cthe vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us,\u201d an echo of a line she frequently uses on the campaign trail. Before delivering her remarks, Harris could be seen embracing and huddling with a family of five grappling with the storm\u2019s aftermath. \u201cWe are here for the long haul,\u201d she said. Harris also toured a Red Cross relief center and received a briefing from local officials, praising those working to \u201cmeet the needs of people who must be seen and must be heard.\u201d \u201cI am now listening,\u201d she said. Walz is speaking in Reading, the Pennsylvanian city with the highest number of Latino voters. The Latino vote could be key to this election. As my colleague Joseph Contreras explains, their importance in presidential races has been steadily growing over the past 50 years, and Latinos are projected to represent nearly 15% of eligible voters nationwide by November. Historically, Latinos have ranked among the Democratic party\u2019s most reliable sources of votes, in about the same league as Black and Jewish voters. But the party\u2019s once commanding advantage has been shrinking. Hillary Clinton trounced Donald Trump among Latinos nationwide in 2016 by a factor of 81% to 16%, yet four years later the former president upped his share to one out of every four votes cast by Latinos. Tim Walz is expected to hold a campaign event in Pennsylvania any minute as he campaigns in the swing state with the highest number of electoral college votes (19) \u2013 we\u2019ll bring that to you live. This is Helen Sullivan taking over the Guardian\u2019s live US politics coverage. JD Vance took a self-proclaimed victory lap after his vice-presidential debate against the Democrat Tim Walz, appearing on Wednesday at a campaign rally in the crucial battleground state of Michigan. Vance told supporters in Auburn Hills that he thought the debate went \u201cpretty well\u201d on Tuesday, as snap polls showed viewers considered it to be a tie between the two vice-presidential candidates. Departing from the generally civil tone of the debate, Vance mocked Walz over his biggest gaffe of the night, in which the Democratic governor said he was friends with school shooters. (Walz seemingly meant to say he was friends with victims of school shootings.) \u201cThat was probably only the third or fourth dumbest comment Tim Walz made that night,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be honest, I feel a little bad for Governor Walz. And the reason I feel bad for him is because he has to defend the indefensible, and that is the record of Kamala Harris.\u201d In his prepared remarks, Vance did not touch on his weakest moment in the debate, when he refused to acknowledge Donald Trump\u2019s loss in the 2020 presidential race. But when Vance took questions from the media after his speech, a reporter did ask him about the exchange, and he again sidestepped the question. \u201cThe media is obsessed with talking about the election of four years ago. I\u2019m focused on the election of 33 days from now because I want to throw Kamala Harris out of office and get back to commonsense economic policies,\u201d Vance said. Here\u2019s where things stand: Donald Trump \u201cresorted to crimes\u201d in a failed attempt to keep power after losing the 2020 election, federal prosecutors said in newly unsealed evidence arguing that the former president shouldn\u2019t be immune from prosecution. Judge Tanya Chutkan unsealed the filing, which was submitted by submitted by special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team following a supreme court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents. Joe Biden plans to visit communities in Florida and Georgia tomorrow that have been hit by Hurricane Helene, the White House has announced. That follows his visit to the Carolinas today. The president approved a major disaster declaration for the state of Virginia amid the devastating impacts of Hurricane Helene. Implementing Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign could cost the federal government as much as $88b per year on average, according to a new analysis released on Wednesday. If elected, Trump has vowed to carry out the \u201clargest deportation operation\u201d in US history, but he has offered few concrete details about how he would achieve a campaign of such scale \u2013 and at what cost. Biden has approved a major disaster declaration for the state of Virginia amid the devastating impacts of Hurricane Helene. The White House said the president ordered federal aid to supplement commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by Helene. The vice-presidential hopefuls debated for 90 minutes on Tuesday night, but the Harris campaign wants Americans to remember one moment, a split-second reply that Tim Walz called a \u201cdamning non-answer\u201d. Just hours after the primetime event concluded, with viewers split over a winner and analysts praising JD Vance for the more polished performance, the Harris campaign has launched an ad highlighting the moment the Republican refused to say whether Trump lost the 2020 election. (He did.) Vance returned to the sharper tone that\u2019s more his norm on the campaign trail during a rally in Michigan. Walz, meanwhile, at a Pennsylvania rally said that Vance\u2019s obfuscations about Trump\u2019s policies and legacy amounted to \u201cgaslighting\u201d. The youth-led March for Our Lives gun control movement which emerged following the deadly Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school shooting in 2018 has condemned JD Vance for his \u201chypocrisy\u201d on gun violence prevention, after he suggested schools build \u201cstronger doors\u201d to prevent shooters,. There was no clear winner of last night\u2019s vice-presidential debate among registered voters quizzed in another snap poll last night, this one conducted for CNN by polling firm SSRS. After Walz and Vance had a constructive debate, CNN reported that their viewers who were polled thought better of both candidates after the debate than they had before. Monday\u2019s 60 Minutes show on CBS will feature an interview solely with Harris, after the network said Trump accepted an invitation and then backed out. \u201cA 60 Minutes candidate hour will feature only Kamala Harris after former President Donald Trump, who\u2019d previously agreed to be on the show, decided not to participate in the Monday, October 7 special,\u201d CBS reported. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel yesterday a \u201csignificant escalation\u201d in the Middle East conflict, although he said it was ultimately \u201cdefeated and ineffective\u201d, in part because of assistance from the US military in shooting down some of the inbound missiles. Biden said his administration is \u201cfully supportive\u201d of Israel and that he\u2019s in \u201cactive discussion\u201d with aides about what the appropriate response should be. 100\u201d was spelled out in giant numbers on the White House north lawn on Tuesday. It was a birthday tribute to the former US president Jimmy Carter, who served only one term after being buffeted by external events such as high inflation and a hostage crisis in Iran. The current occupant of the White House, Joe Biden, must know the feeling as he fights three fires at once. Iran has launched at least 180 missiles into Israel, six US states are still reeling from Hurricane Helene, and ports from Maine to Texas shut down as about 45,000 dockworkers went on strike. Unlike Carter, Biden already knows his fate: he is not seeking re-election next month. But what remains uncertain is whether the trio of troubles will drag down his vice-president and would-be successor, Kamala Harris. Certainly her rival, Donald Trump, smells an opportunity to tar her with the same brush of chaos. \u201cThe world is on fire and spiralling out of control,\u201d he said in a written statement. \u201cWe have no leadership, no one running the country. We have a non-existent president in Joe Biden, and a completely absent vice-president, Kamala Harris, who is too busy fundraising in San Francisco.\u201d Will it stick? No one can be sure. Democrats must again be breathing a sigh of relief that they jettisoned Biden after his miserable debate performance in June. The president steeped in foreign policy is running at one catastrophe a year: the botched Afghanistan withdrawal of 2021, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the deadly Hamas attack on Israel in 2023. In the unsealed court documents released today, prosecutors detail each time Trump tried to pressure his former vice president Mike Pence to accept that their was fraud in the 2020 elections. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has reaised more than $160m in September, according to Reuters, and have about $283m of cash on hand. The campaign raised $130 million in August \u2013 just a third of that Harris raised ($361m) that month. Melania Trump made an extraordinary declaration in an eagerly awaited memoir to be published a month from election day: she is a passionate supporter of a woman\u2019s right to control her own body \u2013 including the right to abortion. \u201cIt is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,\u201d the Republican nominee\u2019s wife writes, amid a campaign in which Donald Trump\u2019s threats to women\u2019s reproductive rights have played a central role. \u201cWhy should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman\u2019s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes. \u201cRestricting a woman\u2019s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.\u201d Melania Trump has rarely expressed political views in public. The book, which reveals the former first lady to be so firmly out of step with most of her own party, Melania, will be published in the US next Tuesday. The Guardian obtained a copy. An estimated 43.15 million viewers watched the vice-presidential debate last night, according to Nielsen. In comparison, about 67.1 million tuned into the presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in September. At his rally in Pennsylvania, Tim Walz warned that JD Vance seems much more willing than Trump\u2019s former vice-president Mike Pence to interfere with electoral integrity. \u201cThere is a reason Mike Pence wasn\u2019t on that stage with me,\u201d Walz said of his debate last night. \u201cHe chose the constitution over Donald Trump \u2026 Senator Vance made it clear he will always make a different choice.\u201d Pence certified the 2020 election results, as required by the constitution, despite Trump\u2019s suggestions that he could have resisted. Vance has said he wouldn\u2019t have done as Pence did. \u201cIf I had been vice-president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others, that we needed to have multiple slates of electors, and I think the US Congress should have fought over it from there,\u201d Vance said in an interview with ABC News earlier this year. \u201cThat is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020. I think that\u2019s what we should have done.\u201d The 165-page document details prosecutors\u2019 case against Donald Trump, who is facing criminal charges accusing him of a conspiracy to obstruct the certification of the election, defraud the US and interfere with Americans\u2019 voting rights in the 2020 election. It will likely be their last opportunity to lay out their case before the upcoming election day on 5 November. Trump, JD Vance and their supporters have continued to spread doubts about the system. My colleague Sam Levine laid out the stakes here: Donald Trump \u201cresorted to crimes\u201d in a failed attempt to keep power after losing the 2020 election, federal prosecutors said in newly unsealed evidence arguing that the former president shouldn\u2019t be immune from prosecution. Judge Tanya Chutkan unsealed the filing, which was submitted by submitted by special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team following a supreme court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents. The prosecutors argue that Trump in this case should not be immune because he was acting in the capacity of a candidate, not president, when he attempted to challenge the election results. The prosecutors allege: Working with a team of private co-conspirators, the defendant acted as a candidate when he pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt, through fraud and deceit, the government function by which votes are collected and counted \u2014 a function in which the defendant, as President, had no official role. JD Vance, who took a much less copacetic tone at his rally today than at the debate last night, again refused to admit the validity of the 2020 election results earlier in the day. Tim Walz\u2019s assessment of the debate last night: \u201cThat\u2019s gaslighting.\u201d \u201cSenator Vance is a slick talker,\u201d said Walz, who said he and his opponent had a \u201ccivil but spirited debate\u201d. But be also criticized Vance\u2019s many obfuscations last night. \u201cThe moment that really stuck out is I just asked the simplest of all questions that that every single American should be able to answer. I asked him if Donald Trump lost the 2020 election,\u201d Walz said. \u201cHe refused to answer.\u201d Tim Walz has just made his entrance at the rally in York, Pennsylvania. The crowd cheered loudly with many craning their necks to get a glimpse of the governor. Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania is currently addressing a rally in York, Pennsylvania where Tim Walz is set to make an appearance. Speaking to an energized audience, Fetterman said: \u201cYou delivered to Joe Biden in 2020 and now your next mission is to ensure that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz [wins].\u201d Federal prosecutors said they may bring additional charges against New York City mayor Eric Adams. On Wednesday, federal prosecutors said they are pursing \u201cseveral related investigations\u201d surrounding Adams\u2019s corruption probe after he was charged last week with taking bribes and foreign campaign contributions. According to the Associated Press, assistant US attorney Hagan Scotten said that it is \u201cquite likely\u201d that prosecutors will seek a superseding indictment and that it is \u201cpossible\u201d that more charges will be brought against Adams. \u201cThere are several related investigations here,\u201d Scotten told US district judge Dale Ho during a status hearing. The youth-led March for Our Lives gun control movement which emerged following the deadly Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school shooting in 2018 has condemned JD Vance for his \u201chypocrisy\u201d on gun violence prevention. In a statement released on Wednesday following last night\u2019s vice presidential debate where Vance urged schools build \u201cstronger doors\u201d to prevent shooters, the movement said: Despite clear evidence that loose gun laws lead to more deaths, Vance doesn\u2019t want to talk about guns \u2013 he wants to talk about \u2018mental health\u2019 and armed guards at schools. Let\u2019s talk about it. Vance opposed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that invested billions in school-based mental wellness, instead arguing that we should arm teachers. And from Parkland to Uvalde, time and time again, armed school officers do not prevent school shootings. Unlike Vance, who believes school shootings are a \u2018fact of life\u2019, Walz recognizes we can and must end gun violence. As the Minnesota governor, Walz signed commonsense laws that prevent gun violence long before someone picks up a gun. Abandoning the civil tone of the VP debate last night, JD Vance came out swinging against Tim Walz as he campaigned in the battleground state of Michigan this afternoon. Speaking to voters in Auburn Hills, Vance said he thought the debate went \u201cpretty well,\u201d as snap polls indicated voters considered it to be a tie between the two vice-presidential candidates. Vance then mocked Walz over the Democrat\u2019s biggest gaffe of the night, in which he said he was friends with school shooters. (Walz seemingly meant to say he was friends with victims of school shootings.) \u201cThat was probably only the third or fourth dumbest comment Tim Walz made that night,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI gotta be honest, I feel a little bad for Governor Walz. And the reason I feel bad for him is because he has to defend the indefensible, and that is the record of Kamala Harris.\u201d The Republican nominee for vice-president, JD Vance, is in Auburn Hills, Michigan, and has just taken the stage for a rally in this crucial battleground state, the day after his debate last night against his Democratic rival, Tim Walz. After his relatively amiable presentation last night in what has been dubbed a \u201cmidwest nice\u201d debate between the US senator from Ohio and the governor from Michigan, Vance returned to the sharper tone that\u2019s more his norm on the campaign trail. First, he nodded to the debate last night and said: \u201cI thought it went pretty well,\u201d as the crowd at a manufacturing facility he\u2019s visiting began chanting \u201cJD, JD, JD.\u201d Vance said he talked to the man at the top of the GOP ticket, Donald Trump, after the debate and Trump seized on Walz\u2019s presumed slip of the tongue that he is friends with school shooters \u2013 when it\u2019s widely understood he meant the victims of school shooters, having been talking at the debate about meeting with parents who\u2019d lost their children to the school shooting at Sandy Hook, Connecticut in 2012. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the third or fourth dumbest comment he made that night,\u201d Vance said, adding that he feels \u201ca bit bad\u201d for Walz because he has to defend Kamala Harris. That\u2019s something of a contrast to his relatively convivial style with Walz last night, when he was critical of Harris but less so about and to Walz. Security for America\u2019s election systems has become so robust that Russia, Iran or any other foreign adversary will not be able to alter the outcome of this year\u2019s presidential race, the head of the nation\u2019s cybersecurity agency said today. Jen Easterly told the Associated Press in an interview that voting, ballot-counting and other election infrastructure is more secure today than it\u2019s ever been. Malicious actors, even if they tried, could not have an impact at scale such that there would be a material effect on the outcome of the election,\u201d said Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Federal agencies have warned of growing attempts by Russia and Iran in particular to influence voters before the November 5 election and election conspiracy theories have left millions of Americans doubting the validity of election results. Easterly said those efforts are primarily aimed at sowing discord among Americans and undermining faith in the security of the nation\u2019s elections. Hello again, US politics live blog readers, Joe Biden is en route to the Carolinas to survey and be briefed on the appalling damage and death toll from the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Kamala Harris is en route to Georgia for the same reason. Fresh from last night\u2019s debate, JD Vance is about to speak at a rally in Michigan and Tim Walz is joining John Fetterman in Pennsylvania and will appear at a rally in about an hour. So much news to come and we\u2019ll keep you posted as it happens. Here\u2019s where things stand: Joe Biden plans to visit communities in Florida and Georgia tomorrow that have been hit by Hurricane Helene, the White House has announced. That follows his visit to the Carolinas today. Implementing Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign could cost the federal government as much as $88b per year on average, according to a new analysis released on Wednesday. If elected, Trump has vowed to carry out the \u201clargest deportation operation\u201d in US history, but he has offered few concrete details about how he would achieve a campaign of such scale \u2013 and at what cost. Biden has approved a major disaster declaration for the state of Virginia amid the devastating impacts of Hurricane Helene. The White House said the president ordered federal aid to supplement commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by Helene. The vice-presidential hopefuls debated for 90 minutes on Tuesday night, but the Harris campaign wants Americans to remember one moment, a split-second reply that Tim Walz called a \u201cdamning non-answer\u201d. Just hours after the primetime event concluded, with viewers split over a winner and analysts praising JD Vance for the more polished performance, the Harris campaign has launched an ad highlighting the moment the Republican refused to say whether Trump lost the 2020 election. (He did.) Monday\u2019s 60 Minutes show on CBS will feature an interview solely with Harris, after the network said Trump accepted an invitation and then backed out. \u201cA 60 Minutes candidate hour will feature only Kamala Harris after former President Donald Trump, who\u2019d previously agreed to be on the show, decided not to participate in the Monday, October 7 special,\u201d CBS reported. There was no clear winner of last night\u2019s vice-presidential debate among registered voters quizzed in another snap poll last night, this one conducted for CNN by polling firm SSRS. After Walz and Vance had a constructive debate, CNN reported that their viewers who were polled thought better of both candidates after the debate than they had before. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel yesterday a \u201csignificant escalation\u201d in the Middle East conflict, although he said it was ultimately \u201cdefeated and ineffective\u201d, in part because of assistance from the US military in shooting down some of the inbound missiles. Biden said his administration is \u201cfully supportive\u201d of Israel and that he\u2019s in \u201cactive discussion\u201d with aides about what the appropriate response should be. On Thursday, Joe Biden will visit communities in Florida and Georgia that have been hit by Hurricane Helene, the White House has announced. Biden\u2019s upcoming visits will follow his stops in North and South Carolina on Wednesday where he is set to survey the damage caused by the storm. More than $10m has been provided directly to those who have been affected by the storm, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, Reuters reports. Kamala Harris will be in neighboring Georgia. Helene was one of the deadliest storms in recent US history and knocked out power and cellular service for millions. The death toll is nearing 180 people. GOP leaders are vexed as Republican Senate challengers are falling behind Donald Trump in voter polling. Victoria Bekiempis reports for the Guardian: In Ohio, Trump is polling at an average of 8.7 percentage points above the Republican Senate nominee Bernie Moreno, RealClear Politics averages suggest. In Wisconsin, Trump has polled 2.2 points ahead of the Senate candidate Eric Hovde; they also both remain under 50% in the polls. In Arizona, Trump is at 49.3% compared with Kari Lake\u2019s 43.4%. In Nevada, Sam Brown is at 40.7% while Trump has 47.6%. Meanwhile, Democratic Senate contenders are still besting Republican candidates in \u201cevery key battleground\u201d in the presidential race, per the Cook Political report. But the site noted that their leads were tighter than in August, and that Wisconsin and Michigan Senate races could be prime opportunities for Republicans. For the full story, click here: Joe Biden has ordered the defense department to approve the deployment of up to 1,000 active-duty soldiers to reinforce the North Carolina National Guard amid the deadly impacts of Hurricane Helene. In an announcement issued on Wednesday, Biden said: \u201cThese soldiers will speed up the delivery of life-saving supplies of food, water, and medicine to isolated communities in North Carolina \u2013 they have the manpower and logistical capabilities to get this vital job done, and fast. They will join hundreds of North Carolina National Guard members deployed under state authorities in support of the response. Hurricane Helene has been a storm of historic proportion. My heart goes out to everyone who has experienced unthinkable loss. We are here for you \u2013 and we will stay here for as long as it takes.\u201d Kamala Harris has released the following statement on the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association port workers\u2019 strike: \u201cThis strike is about fairness. Foreign-owned shipping companies have made record profits and executive compensation has grown. The Longshoremen, who play a vital role transporting essential goods across America, deserve a fair share of these record profits. Donald Trump, on the other hand, wants to pull us back to a time before workers had the freedom to organize. As president, he blocked overtime benefits for millions of workers, he appointed union busters to the NLRB \u2013 and just recently, he said striking workers should be fired. Donald Trump makes empty promise after empty promise to American workers, but never delivers. He thinks our economy should only work for those who own the big skyscrapers, not those who actually build them. As president, I will have workers\u2019 backs and finally pass the PRO [Protecting the Right to Organize] Act. And I will fight for an opportunity economy - where every person has the chance not just to get by but to get ahead.\u201d Following last night\u2019s vice-presidential debate, JD Vance is continuing his talking point of \u201ccommon sense\u201d by tweeting on Wednesday: \u201cLast night was fun! Remember: Kamala Harris has been in power for the last 3.5 years. She opened the border. She cast the deciding vote on trillions in new spending. The border and affordability crisis is on her. Donald Trump, by contrast, governed with common sense.\u201d With only five weeks left till Election Day, the repeated messaging of \u201ccommon sense\u201d by Vance appears to be in contrast to the Harris-Walz strategy of framing their own campaign as \u201cjoy.\u201d After JD Vance refused to acknowledge Donald Trump\u2019s loss in the 2020 election during the VP debate last night, one of the former president\u2019s senior advisers doubled down on that stance this morning. When CNN anchor Jim Acosta asked Trump campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski whether Trump lost the 2020 race, Lewandowski sidestepped the question in much the same manner that Vance did last night. \u201cWhy is this so difficult for the Trump campaign to answer?\u201d Acosta asked. \u201cI mean it\u2019s 2024. Did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election? Can you answer that?\u201d \u201cJim, I think it\u2019s very simple. The American people are past the 2020 election,\u201d Lewandowski replied. \u201cWe can go back and relitigate the 2020 election, or we can look at what we can do to make America better for the everyday Americans who are struggling under Bidenomics.\u201d Acosta interjected, \u201cBut, Corey, it\u2019s not relitigating. It\u2019s just a simple question: did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election?\u201d Lewandowski replied, \u201cWhy are we talking about 2020 anymore? [Do] the American people care about the 2020 election more, or do they care about being able to put food on their table?\u201d Acosta and Lewandowski then sparred over the definition of \u201cwidespread fraud\u201d, as Trump has presented no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 race. Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign, said of the exchange: \u201cDonald Trump lost the 2020 election. It shouldn\u2019t be this hard to say.\u201d In a tweet on Wednesday following JD Vance\u2019s refusal to acknowledge that Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election during last night\u2019s vice-presidential debate, Kamala Harris wrote: \u201cOn January 6, the former president incited an attack on our nation\u2019s democracy because he didn\u2019t like the outcome of the election. If you stand for country, democracy, and the rule of law\u2014our campaign has a place for you.\u201d Implementing Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign could cost the federal government as much as $88b per year on average, according to a new analysis released on Wednesday. If elected, Trump has vowed to carry out the \u201clargest deportation operation\u201d in US history, but he has offered few concrete details about how he would achieve a campaign of such scale \u2013 and at what cost. \u201cGiven that in the modern immigration enforcement era the United States has never deported more than half a million immigrants per year \u2013 and many of those have been migrants apprehended trying to enter the US, not just those already living here\u2013any mass deportation proposal raises obvious questions: how, exactly, would the United States possibly carry out the largest law enforcement operation in world history? And at what cost?\u201d ask the authors of the analysis, published by the American Immigration Council, an advocacy group for immigrant rights. The analysis estimates the costs based on Trump\u2019s pledge to deport the roughly 11 million people living in the US who as of 2022 lacked permanent legal status and faced the possibility of removal. (Trump has suggested the eligible population is as high as 20 million people.) The largest share of the cost would be spent on building detention camps to arrest, detain, process, and remove immigrants from the US. It would also likely require the government to hire additional law enforcement officers and immigration judges. In addition to the logistical challenges, the analysis also highlights the impact it would have on the economy, especially sectors like construction and hospitality that employ large numbers of undocumented workers. \u201cDue to the loss of workers across US industries, we found that mass deportation would reduce the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by 4.2 to 6.8%,\u201d it states. \u201cIt would also result in significant reduction in tax revenues for the US government.\u201d Following last night\u2019s vice-presidential debate where both candidates kept things fairly civil, JD Vance and Tim Walz are set to return to the campaign trail today. On Wednesday, Vance is set to deliver remarks at a campaign event in Auburn Hills, Michigan at around 1:30pm ET before delivering another set of remarks in Marne, Michigan at 5:30pm ET. Meanwhile, Vance will kick off a bus tour through central Pennsylvania and will make stops in Harrisburg, Reading, and York where he will be joined by York native senator John Fetterman. Walz is set to deliver remarks in York at 3pm ET and will join a political engagement with local Latino leaders in Reading at 6pm ET. Joe Biden has approved a major disaster declaration for the state of Virginia amid the devastating impacts of Hurricane Helene. On Wednesday, the White House released a statement, saying: Yesterday, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster exists in the Commonwealth of Virginia and ordered Federal aid to supplement Commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by Tropical Storm Helene beginning on September 25, 2024, and continuing. The President\u2019s action makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Giles, Grayson, Smyth, Tazewell, Washington, and Wythe and the independent city of Galax. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster. Federal funding also is available to State and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work in the counties of Bedford, Bland, Buchanan, Carroll, Craig, Dickenson, Giles, Grayson, Montgomery, Pittsylvania, Pulaski, Russell, Scott, Smyth, Tazewell, Washington, Wise, and Wythe and the independent cities of Bristol, Covington, Danville, Galax, Norton, and Radford.\u201d The vice-presidential hopefuls debated for 90 minutes on Tuesday night, but the Harris campaign wants Americans to remember one moment, a split-second reply that Tim Walz called a \u201cdamning non-answer\u201d. Just hours after the primetime event concluded, with viewers split over a winner and analysts praising JD Vance for the more polished performance, the Harris campaign has launched an ad highlighting the moment the Republican refused to say whether Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. (He did.) During the final moments of the debate, Walz asked Vance to answer the question. Did Trump lose the 2020 election to Joe Biden? Vance replied that he was \u201cfocused on the future\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s a damning non-answer,\u201d Walz replied. The ad features that exchange, overlaid with images of the January 6 assault on the US Capitol. It ends with Walz telling viewers: \u201cAmerica, I think you\u2019ve got a really clear choice of who\u2019s going to honor democracy and who\u2019s going to honor Donald Trump.\u201d According to the Harris campaign, their internal focus group of undecided battleground state voters said the moment was Vance\u2019s worst of the night. Harris hasn\u2019t centered her campaign around democracy the way Biden had. But the issue still has high salience for voters. Tim Walz is heading directly from his debate with rival JD Vance in New York last night for the crucial election battleground of Pennsylvania today to begin a bus tour with one of the state\u2019s two Democratic US Senators, John Fetterman. Walz and Fetterman are starting out in south central Pennsylvania with a rally in the city of York. York county voted heavily for Donald Trump over Joe Biden in 2020, even as the state flipped from Republican in 2016 to Democratic in 2020. This is a further case of Dems campaigning in deeply red counties in swing states, hoping that reducing the margin of their likely loss will help to tip the finely-balanced statewide race to their party. The United Nations Security Council has called an emergency meeting today in New York to address the spiraling conflict in the Middle East. The region moved closer to a long-feared regional war on Wednesday, a day after Iran fired a barrage of missiles at Israel and Israel said it began limited ground incursions into Lebanon targeting the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia, the Associated Press reports. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, vowed late Tuesday to retaliate against Iran, which he said \u201cmade a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it\u201d. An Iranian commander threatened wider strikes on infrastructure if Israel retaliates against Iran\u2019s territory. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas\u2019 cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. The Guardian is running a global live blog on the Middle East and covering all the developments as they happen. You can follow that here. There is no sign that there will be another presidential debate before the election, between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump. We had the only planned vice-presidential debate last night between the Dems\u2019 Tim Walz and the GOP\u2019s JD Vance. Now Monday\u2019s 60 Minutes show on CBS will feature an interview solely with Harris, after the network said Trump accepted an invitation and then backed out. \u201cA 60 Minutes candidate hour will feature only Kamala Harris after former President Donald Trump, who\u2019d previously agreed to be on the show, decided not to participate in the Monday, October 7 special,\u201d CBS reported. CBS pointed out that the show has had the tradition for half a century of inviting the two presidential candidates to sit for interviews as voters head to the polls. Late last month, Harris accepted an invitation from CNN for a second debate, but Trump declined. The broad consensus is that Harris won the lone debate between her and Trump. Republican JD Vance gave more misleading statements than Democrat Tim Walz in the sole vice-presidential debate last night, according to a check of some of the main facts claimed by both candidates, carried out by Reuters. The news agency called out Vance, the US Senator from Ohio, on a key environmental point, when he said the US is \u201cthe cleanest economy in the entire world.\u201d This is false. According to the European Union\u2019s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research 2024 report, the US was second only to China as the highest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions globally last year.\u201d Vance mostly dodged talking directly about the climate crisis and related solutions. The candidates talked about school shootings, where Reuters also found fault with Vance saying: \u201cThe gross majority, close to 90% in some of the statistics I\u2019ve seen, of the gun violence in this country is committed with illegally obtained firearms.\u201d Reuters said: This is misleading. Most public mass shootings \u2013 a shooting that kills four or more people \u2013 between 1966 and 2019 were carried out by legally obtained handguns, according to research, opens new tab funded by the National Institute of Justice. Reuters did not find any of the Walz statements it examined to be false. On topics including energy production, taxes, trade, poverty and healthcare costs, Reuters found Walz to be true or mostly true, with one point it declared \u201cunknown\u201d and another \u201cit depends\u201d. There was no clear winner of last night\u2019s vice-presidential debate among registered voters quizzed in another snap poll last night, this one conducted for CNN by polling firm SSRS. After both Democrat Tim Walz and Republican JD Vance had a constructive debate, CNN reported that their viewers who were polled thought better of both candidates after the debate than they had before. Vance, who has donned a controversial, right-wing platform and persona on the campaign trail, was very measured last night, conciliatory at times. Walz was less cheery than his rally self, but more consistent with his usual reputation of being a \u201cjoyful warrior\u201d exuding reason. CNN reported: \u201cAmong debate watchers, Walz remains the candidate who\u2019s seen more positively and as more in touch with their needs and vision for the country. Vance \u2026boosted his standing \u2026 outperforming expectations and gaining ground on the share who perceive him as qualified. Both men, the poll finds, are viewed by a majority of debate watchers as qualified to assume the presidency if needed.\u201d Crucially, though, the cable TV network added that almost no respondents felt the need to change the way they\u2019ve decided to vote after watching the debate. In another interesting finding from the Politico/Focaldata snap poll conducted straight after the vice-presidential debate last night, Minnesota governor and Democratic nominee Tim Walz polled better with younger voters, despite his being 60 years old. GOP nominee and Ohio Senator JD Vance did better with voters over 55, while he was a youthful pick for running mate by Donald Trump, having just turned 40 last month. The findings track broadly with their tickets. Politico reported that: \u201cWalz\u2019s strongest ratings came from younger people, particularly those ages 25-34, those with college degrees, and Black and Latino respondents \u2013 all key components of the Democratic coalition that powered President Joe Biden\u2019s victory over Donald Trump in 2020.\u201d As we\u2019re talking ages, Kamala Harris, the Dems\u2019 nominee for president, will turn 60 later this month, having replaced Biden, 81, when the US president quit his re-election bid in July. Trump is 78. Politico found from its debate poll that: \u201cVance performed best with people over the age of 55, white voters and those without a college degree.\u201d In a snap poll after the vice-presidential debate, voters declared there was no decisive winner and were split on who performed better, the Democrats\u2019 Tim Walz or the Republicans\u2019 JD Vance, Politico reports this morning. \u201cAsked who won Tuesday\u2019s debate, voters were split 50-50 over whether it was JD Vance or Tim Walz, according to a POLITICO/Focaldata snap poll of likely voters conducted just after the two faced off in a studio in New York City,\u201d the political news site said. It added: \u201cThe dead-heat results are a fitting reflection of the country\u2019s hyper-polarized politics \u2014 particularly as it enters the final stretch of the closest presidential election in years.\u201d Democrats mostly thought Walz won and GOP-ers mostly thought Vance won. However, there was in interesting divergence when it came to independents. \u201cWalz had a commanding advantage with independents, 58 percent of whom sided with the Minnesota governor while 42 percent gave Vance the edge,\u201d the site said. Joe Biden\u2019s administration heaped pressure on US port employers to raise their offer to secure a labor deal with dockworkers on strike for a second day on Wednesday, choking half the country\u2019s ocean shipping, AP reported. The strike by the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association (ILA) union has blocked everything from food to automobile shipments across dozens of ports from Maine to Texas in a disruption analysts warn will cost the economy billions of dollars a day. More than 38 container vessels were already backed up at US ports by Tuesday, compared with just three on Sunday before the strike, according to Everstream Analytics. \u201cForeign ocean carriers have made record profits since the pandemic, when Longshoremen put themselves at risk to keep ports open. It\u2019s time those ocean carriers offered a strong and fair contract that reflects ILA workers\u2019 contribution to our economy and to their record profits,\u201d Biden said in a post on X late on Tuesday. He directed his team to monitor for potential price gouging activity that benefits foreign ocean carriers, the White House said. Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel on Tuesday, the latest in a series of rapidly escalating attacks between Israel and Iran and its Arab allies that threatens to push the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. White House National Security adviser Jake Sullivan called Iran\u2019s missile attack a \u201csignificant escalation,\u201d although he said it was ultimately \u201cdefeated and ineffective,\u201d in part because of assistance from the US military in shooting down some of the inbound missiles. President Joe Biden said his administration is \u201cfully supportive\u201d of Israel and that he\u2019s in \u201cactive discussion\u201d with aides about what the appropriate response should be to Tehran. Three weeks on from the presidential debate, Tim Walz and JD Vance took to the stage on Tuesday night for a vice-presidential head-to-head. The two candidates largely avoided attacks on each other in what was a more policy-driven discussion. If you live in a swing state such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, we would like to hear what you thought of the debate. How do you think it went and do you feel the candidates addressed the issues important to you? What other issues would you like them to have addressed in the debate? What was your favourite moment? Did anything change your mind in any way? The Democratic candidate for vice-president, Tim Walz, and his Republican counterpart, JD Vance, clashed over border policy and the January 6 Capitol attack, with Walz at one point asking point blank if Vance believed former president Donald Trump had lost the 2020 election. There was a strange feeling as the vice-presidential debate got under way in the CBS News studios on Tuesday night that only intensified as 90 minutes of detailed policy discussion unfolded: was the United States in danger of regaining its sanity? After weeks and months of being assailed by Donald Trump\u2019s dystopian evocation of a country on the verge of self-destruction, amplified by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris\u2019s dire warnings of democracy in peril, here was something very different. The two vice-presidential nominees were embracing that most endangered of American political species: agreement. \u201cTim, I actually think I agree with you,\u201d said JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, addressing his opposite number Tim Walz during the discussion on immigration. \u201cMuch of what the senator said right there, I\u2019m in agreement with him,\u201d said Walz, the Minnesota governor and Democratic nominee, as they turned to trade policy. It wasn\u2019t true, of course. The two men were no closer to agreement than their bosses, who in their own presidential debate last month showed themselves to be worlds apart. But on Tuesday it was as if the CBS News studio in midtown Manhattan had been transported back to a prelapsarian \u2013 or at least, pre-Maga \u2013 times. To an era when politicians could be civil, and to get on you didn\u2019t have to castigate your opponent as an enemy of the people. Tim Walz and JD Vance faced each other for the first and only vice-presidential debate of this election cycle \u2013 and clashed on issues including abortion, childcare, the cost of living and Trump\u2019s 2020 election claims. Here are the facts on some of the false or misleading claims offered during Tuesday\u2019s vice-presidential debate. President Joe Biden will survey the devastation in North and South Carolina on Wednesday as rescuers continue their search for anyone still unaccounted for after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage across the south-east and killed at least 166 people. Many residents in both states were still without running water, cellular service and electricity as flood waters receded and revealed more of the death and destruction left in Helene\u2019s path, AP reported. \u201cWe have to jump start this recovery process,\u201d Biden said Tuesday, estimating it will cost billions. \u201cPeople are scared to death. This is urgent.\u201d While Biden is in the Carolinas, vice-president Kamala Harris will be in neighboring Georgia. Helene, one of the deadliest storms in recent US history, knocked out power and cellular service for millions. More than 1.2 million customers still were in the dark early Wednesday in the Carolinas and Georgia. Some residents cooked food on charcoal grills or hiked to high ground in the hopes of finding a signal to let loved ones know they are alive. On Tuesday, cadaver dogs and search crews trudged through knee-deep muck and debris in the mountains of western North Carolina looking for more victims. At least 57 people were killed in Buncombe County alone, home to city of Asheville, a tourism haven known for its art galleries, breweries and outdoor activities. In Swannanoa, a small community outside Asheville, receding flood waters revealed cars stacked on top of others and trailer homes that had floated away during the storm. Roads were caked with mud and debris and pockmarked by sinkholes. Key moments from the debate JD Vance refused to say whether Donald Trump lost the 2020 election and continued to sidestep questions over whether he would certify a Trump loss this fall during the vice-presidential debate on Tuesday. The exchange brought out some of the sharpest attacks from Tim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate and Minnesota governor, in what was otherwise a muted and civil back-and-forth with the Ohio senator. Walz asked Vance directly whether Trump lost the 2020 election. Vance responded: \u201cTim, I\u2019m focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their minds in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?\u201d Walz then cut in with one of his most aggressive attack lines of the evening: \u201cThat is a damning non-answer.\u201d Vance has previously said that he would have asked states to submit alternative slates of electors to Congress to continue to debate allegations of election irregularities in 2020. By the time Congress met during the last election to consider electoral votes, courts, state officials and the US supreme court had all turned away efforts to block legitimate slates of electors from being sent to Congress. Pressed by CBS moderator Norah O\u2019Donnell on whether he would again refuse to certify the vote this year, Vance declined to answer. \u201cWhat President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020, and my own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all I\u2019ve said and that\u2019s all that Donald Trump has said.\u201d He later said that if Walz won the election with Harris, Walz would have his support. Trump has warned of a \u201cbloodbath\u201d if he doesn\u2019t win the election. He has also said supporters won\u2019t have to vote anymore if he wins in November. Both the Trump campaign and Republican allies are seeding the ground to contest a possible election loss in November. Donald Trump\u2019s senior aides saw JD Vance as having a slick debate performance over Tim Walz, according to people close to Trump, that made his campaign appear palatable despite the former president\u2019s increasingly caustic threats such as vowing to prosecute his perceived enemies. The campaign aides also believed that Vance reset the narrative over his image and likely came across in a more favorable light to undecided voters after a brutal few months of being hammered for making disparaging remarks about women as \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d. Vance\u2019s favorability issue was perhaps the principal priority for Trump\u2019s senior aides because they saw it as potentially fixable and if so, beneficial to the Trump campaign with fewer than five weeks until election day in what has become a vanishingly close race against Kamala Harris. Afterwards, Trump predictably claimed Vance won the debate, but a CBS News poll confirmed how vice-presidential debates matter increasingly less in close elections compared to ground game efforts to drive turnout. In the post-debate poll, 42% of respondents said Vance won the debate, 41% gave the win to Walz, while 17% said it was tied \u2013 suggesting the main takeaway remains that it is unlikely to play any material role in which campaign wins each of the seven battleground states in November. Tim Walz and JD Vance took to the stage on Tuesday night for a vice-presidential debate that served up less drama than September\u2019s presidential debate, but offered revealing differences on abortion, school shootings, and immigration. Three weeks ago Kamala Harris and Donald Trump had endured a contentious hour-and-a-half, with an emotional Trump being goaded into ranting about the number of people who attend his rallies and declaring the vice-president to be a \u201cMarxist\u201d, before reportedly threatening to sue one of the debate moderators. Harris enjoyed a brief polling uptick from that performance. But on Tuesday, Walz and Vance largely avoided attacks on each other, and instead concentrated their fire on each other\u2019s running mates. It was a more policy-driven discussion than that of their running mates\u2019, but one with a few gaffes that might overshadow some of the substance in coming days. In a key exchange over abortion, Walz, the governor of Minnesota, followed Harris\u2019s lead in using personal stories. Trump \u201cbrags about how great it was that he put the judges in and overturned Roe v Wade\u201d, Walz said. He noted the case of Amanda Zurawski, who was denied an abortion in Texas despite serious health complications during pregnancy \u2013 Zurawski is now part of a group of women suing the state of Texas \u2013 and a girl in Kentucky who as a child was raped by her stepfather and became pregnant. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know [women like this], you soon will. Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies,\u201d Walz said, which Vance contested. Walz also criticized the Trump-Vance position that states should decide whether women have access to abortion. \u201cThat\u2019s not how this works. This is basic human rights. We have seen maternal mortality skyrocket in Texas, outpacing many other countries in the world,\u201d he said. Good morning and welcome to the blog as we wake up to reaction to Tim Walz and JD Vance\u2019s vice-presidential debate which offered revealing differences on abortion, school shootings, and immigration. It was a debate that was surprisingly civil in the final stretch of an ugly election campaign marred by inflammatory rhetoric and two assassination attempts. The two rivals, who have forcefully attacked each other on the campaign trail, mostly struck a cordial tone, instead saving their fire for the candidates at the top of their tickets, democratic vice-president Kamala Harris and Republican former president Donald Trump. The most tense exchange occurred near the end of the debate, when Vance \u2013 who has said he would not have voted to certify the results of the 2020 election \u2013 avoided a question about whether he would challenge this year\u2019s vote if Trump loses. Walz responded by blaming Trump\u2019s false claims of voter fraud for instigating the 6 January 2021, mob that attacked the US Capitol in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election. \u201cHe is still saying he didn\u2019t lose the election,\u201d Walz said, before turning to Vance. \u201cDid he lose the 2020 election?\u201d Vance again sidestepped the question, instead accusing Harris of pursuing online censorship of opposing viewpoints. \u201cThat is a damning non-answer,\u201d Walz said. Meanwhile, CNN\u2019s snap poll has viewers split over who won the debate \u2013 but Vance narrowly wins. The poll of 574 registered voters saw 51% say that Vance won the debate, with 49% choosing Walz. Polled before the debate, 54% of voters thought Walz was likelier to win.",
