      "bodyText": "This blog is closed \u2013 thanks for following along. Here is a summary of today\u2019s key developments: Donald Trump rallied supporters in Butler, Pennsylvania, three months after a shooter attempted to assassinate him there on 13 July. He was joined by vice-presidential nominee JD Vance, son and daughter-in-law Eric and Lara Trump, and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who all railed against immigrants and the Democratic party. Kamala Harris visited North Carolina, to survey the damage caused by Hurricane Helene and receive a briefing from Fema officials. The vice-president\u2019s visit to North Carolina, as Trump rallied supporters in Pennsylvania, came amid concerns that her campaign has not held as many public events as her opponent. Harris campaign proxies toured swing states. Bernie Sanders campaigned in Michigan, while actors like Kerry Washington prepared to visit Arizona. Trump has concluded his remarks in Butler, telling rally-goers: \u201cElection day will be the most important day in the history of our country,\u201d before walking out while dancing to the Village People\u2019s YMCA. The former president spoke for an hour and a half. Vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is scheduled to appear on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d with host Shannon Bream tomorrow. Walz\u2019s appearance on the traditionally conservative channel comes as the Harris-Walz campaign gains support among establishment Republicans, like former vice president Dick Cheney. Walz in particular has drawn attention for his ability to communicate effectively with conservative audiences. As Trump slowly begins concluding his remarks in Butler, he has asked the crowd to \u201csend our prayers and support to all the families affected by Hurricane Helene\u201d. \u201cThis has been the worst hurricane response by a president and vice-president since Katrina, and this is simply not acceptable,\u201d he said. He went on to denounce Kamala Harris, calling her \u201cfurther left then crazy Bernie Sanders\u201d and \u201cthe original creator of \u2018defund the police\u2019\u201d, before returning to his usual talking points about immigration, dissolving the education department, energy independence, inflation and transgender athletes. Elon Musk tells people watching the Trump rally to register to vote, as the Musk-backed America Pac has spent nearly $14m since August to essentially run the wider ground game for the Trump campaign in the battleground states. Musk has political ambitions and recently floated the idea of running a government-efficiency commission, while Trump has said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d would consider putting Musk in his cabinet in a second administration. Elon Musk has joined Trump on stage in Butler, wearing what he calls a \u201cdark Maga\u201d hat. Musk is returning to the same core topic that Trump and his proxies have emphasized: inflammatory and unverified concerns that non-citizens will vote in the 2024 election and cast their ballots against Trump. He is encouraging the crowd to register to vote, and make sure their friends and family do the same. \u201cFight, fight, fight. Vote, vote, vote,\u201d he concludes. Musk has become a major contributor to the Trump campaign in recent months, and the two have bonded over many of their shared beliefs. Trump has resumed speaking, returning to the inflammatory rhetoric on immigration that has marked his campaign since he first ran for office in 2015. \u201cCrime rates all over the world are down, they\u2019re taking their gang members and their criminals, they\u2019re taking their people in jail, and they\u2019re releasing them into our country,\u201d he said, continuing with xenophobic comments about \u201cthe China virus\u201d and Venezuela. Despite Trump\u2019s claims, violent crime in the United States has fallen. Trump has paused his speech as first responders aid a rally-goer who appears to have fallen ill. Attendees began gathering at the rally eight hours ago. Although the temperature in Butler is only in the high 60s, attendees have collapsed at other political rallies due to heatstroke this election season. Trump is now returning to the core topics he\u2019s hammered on at previous rallies and debates: immigration, gender-affirming healthcare, fracking and his political opponents. First denouncing immigrants and transgender Americans, returning to his claim that Kamala Harris would pay for \u201ctransgender operations on illegal aliens\u201d, Trump goes on to reiterate his promise not to ban fracking, a contentious issue in Pennsylvania, where fracking contributes greatly to the state\u2019s economy. He then claims to be leading by a wide margin in the polls, although the presidential election remains closely tied, with Kamala Harris slightly ahead in national polling. Trump is now speaking about his mission to \u201cmake America great again\u201d. \u201cWe have to have a fabulous military to protect us from evil, everything has to be the best. We have to have the best schools. We have to have a strong borders. We don\u2019t want bad people coming in and hurting us,\u201d he said. \u201cYou deserve a nation that builds things again, makes things better, that aims for the stars once more, and that once again commands respect, and we want to get respect like we had it four years ago. \u201cWe are going to win the greatest election in the history of our country. Maybe the greatest election of all time.\u201d Trump is addressing the family of Corey Comperatore, a first responder who was killed at the 13 July rally in Butler. \u201cThere\u2019s one more hero could not make it back here tonight because he is no longer with us, right? You know that is, Corey, our beautiful Corey,\u201d he said. \u201cCorey Comperatore was a incredible husband and father, a devout Christian, a veteran and a proud former fire chief. Very respected in the town. \u201cWhen the sound of gunshots pierced the air on that July evening, Corey leapt into the fire one more time and in his last seconds on this earth, he threw himself on the top of his wife and daughters. He didn\u2019t want them hurt.\u201d Trump then acknowledged the time, 6.11pm ET, exactly the same as the shooting in Butler in July, and asked the crowd to observe a moment of silence before opera singer Christopher Macchio performed Ave Maria. Trump is thanking the US Secret Service for saving his life on 13 July and again from another assassination attempt two weeks ago. \u201cThey were on top of me so fast, they were on top of me, and there was not even a moment of doubt in their minds,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that moment, those agents displayed a devotion to duty that cannot be described, and they did it yet again less than three weeks ago, when they really did a fantastic job.\u201d The Secret Service is currently under investigation for security failures on 13 July. Trump has begun addressing rally-goers in Butler. Beginning with: \u201cAnd, as I was saying\u201d, Trump briefly continued with the point he had been making on 13 July about border crossings before a gunman opened fire on him. The former president continued: \u201cExactly 12 weeks ago, this evening, on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me and to silence the greatest movement, Maga, in the history of our country.\u201d Trump has taken the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, following a movie-like voiceover and Lee Greenwood\u2019s song God Bless the USA. As rally-goers in Butler, Pennsylvania, wait for Trump to take the stage, Kamala Harris is in Charlotte, North Carolina, visiting a donation center after Hurricane Helene devastated the state. Amid widespread misinformation, the White House and Fema are attempting to quell the spread of rumors about the availability of disaster relief. Scott Presler, a conservative activist, has joined Eric and Lara Trump on stage at the Trump rally in Butler, encouraging attendees to register to vote. Presler is specifically addressing Pennsylvania\u2019s union workers, Amish community, hunters, sorority sisters and fraternity brothers, asking them to vote for Trump. Lara Trump, chair of the Republican National Committee, joined her husband, Eric Trump, on stage at the Trump rally in Butler. \u201cThis is no longer a fight between Republican versus Democrat, left versus right. It is good versus evil,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you had any question whether God exists, and he performs miracles, we got our answer here on July 13, right here in Butler, Pennsylvania.\u201d Echoing Vance\u2019s language referring to Trump as a messianic figure, Lara Trump continued: \u201cHe spared Donald Trump\u2019s life because he was not finished with Donald Trump. And he did it not once, but twice. And I\u2019ve said it time and time again, but now you feel it more than ever: Donald Trump was made for such a time as this.\u201d Lara Trump went on to speak about her work \u201cmaking sure that we have free, fair and transparent elections, that only legal citizens are voting in our elections here in the United States of America\u201d. She added: \u201cIf you\u2019re an illegal citizen voting in our election, we\u2019ll track you down and prosecute you to the full extent of the law and you\u2019re leaving this country,\u201d before encouraging the crowd gathered in Butler to register to vote. Although Trump and Republicans have claimed that massive numbers of non-citizens are voting in US elections, there is no proof that non-citizens are voting, or even registering to vote, in any meaningful numbers. Eric Trump and his wife, the RNC co-chair Lara Trump, are speaking at the Trump rally in Butler. \u201cThis is a big family. They tried to take away someone we all love,\u201d Eric Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ve tried to get my father every single second since he went down that golden escalator. Lara and I have witnessed it every single day. They tried to smear us. They tried to bankrupt us. They came after us. \u201cAnd then guys, they tried to kill him. They tried to kill him, and it\u2019s because the Democratic party, they can\u2019t do anything right.\u201d John Paulson, a New York-based billionaire investor, and Steve Witkoff, a New York-based real estate investor and landlord, have both briefly taken the stage in Butler. \u201cWhen [Trump] is elected president, he will deliver the greatest economic boom to America than we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see growth in our energy sector. We will become a manufacturing powerhouse. We\u2019ll see growth in real wages, which will benefit all Americans.\u201d \u201cMy friend has stood up to tyrants and bullies, making tough decisions and always putting this country first, even when it wasn\u2019t an easy choice. That\u2019s why we need him more now than ever. This isn\u2019t about politics. It is about the soul of our country,\u201d Witkoff said, riffing off Joe Biden\u2019s former campaign slogan. During a campaign stop in Michigan yesterday, Arab American advocates asked Kamala Harris to break from Joe Biden\u2019s Israel policy and push harder for an end to the war in Gaza, CNN reports. \u201cShe pledged to work with our community, include our community, and [said] that she completely understands what we\u2019re saying. She is hopeful that if she wins, she\u2019ll be able to deliver on all of this once she\u2019s president,\u201d Wa\u2019el Alzayat, the CEO of Emgage Action, told CNN. Trump has arrived in Pennsylvania but has yet to take the stage in Butler. New York Times photographer Doug Mills has captured him hugging the family members of Corey Comperatore, a first responder who was killed at Trump\u2019s rally in Butler on 13 July. As JD Vance speaks at the Trump rally in Butler, Kamala Harris is in Charlotte, North Carolina, receiving a briefing from Fema officials on the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. \u201cI\u2019ve talked with many of you within actually hours and certainly days of Helene hitting this beautiful state. And, I thank you all for the work you\u2019ve been doing around the clock,\u201d Harris told officials in the room, the Washington Post reports. On stage in Butler, Vance speaks about his own recent visit to North Carolina \u2013 evoking the ties to Appalachia that he has built his career around. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure emergency funding goes to American citizens and not illegal aliens,\u201d he said. JD Vance has taken the stage in Butler before former president Trump\u2019s appearance. Amid chants of \u201cFight, fight, fight\u201d and \u201cUSA, USA\u201d, Vance compared Trump to a messianic figure. \u201cI believe as sure as I\u2019m standing here today that what happened was a true miracle. And on that day, America felt the truth of scripture,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI truly believe that God saved President Trump that day.\u201d Vance also noted the attendees who had been shot and killed in July, before denouncing Democrats, whom, he said, \u201ccontinued to use dangerous, inflammatory rhetoric\u201d about Trump after the assassination attempt. Although Trump initially embraced a spirit of unity after the July shooting, Vance popularized the idea that Democratic rhetoric had caused the shooting. \u201cThe media has continued to call Donald Trump, the guy who actually won his primary, a threat to democracy,\u201d Vance said, before directing his comments towards Kamala Harris, saying: \u201cHow dare you talk about threats to democracy. Donald Trump took a bullet for democracy.\u201d It\u2019s less than an hour until Trump takes the stage in Butler, and the former president has made a flyby of the rally. It\u2019s unclear how many people have gathered in Butler to hear the former president speak at the site where a gunman opened fire at him in an assassination attempt in July, but it\u2019s surely shaping up to be one of Trump\u2019s largest rallies. The Trump campaign is contending that 100,000 people are attending \u2013 which would make it nearly 10 times larger than any rally he\u2019s hosted before. Trump\u2019s obsession with crowd sizes, which dates back to as early as his 2017 inauguration, has become the butt of jokes and genuine concern among Republican party leadership. Hollywood stars are descending on Phoenix, Arizona, this weekend to campaign for Kamala Harris, the Arizona Republic reports. Actors Kerry Washington, Jessica Alba, Glenn Close and Michael Ealy will be campaigning on Sunday, just days after Jennifer Garner visited the state on behalf of the campaign. The Harris-Walz campaign reports that Washington\u2019s trip is specifically aimed at mobilizing Black voters. Washington, who is best known for her role in the ABC drama series Scandal, will attend a Black Voters for Harris-Walz Block Party alongside former US attorney general Eric Holder, former ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and Senate-hopeful Ruben Gallego. Both the Harris and Trump campaigns are ramping up events in Arizona, which remains a hotly contested swing state. Next week, the second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, will also be campaigning in the state, while Donald Trump Jr prepares for his own visit. Pre-programming at the Trump rally in Butler has begun with a prayer and the national anthem before the former president\u2019s appearance at 5pm ET today. Trump will be joined this afternoon by a host of guests including his son Eric Trump, Elon Musk, JD Vance, several attendees of the July rally where a gunman attempted to assassinate Trump, local police and Republican party officials, and congressional representatives from Pennsylvania, Florida, Texas and Missouri. Since George Floyd\u2019s death in 2020, Republican-led states have expanded riot laws to suppress protesters, the Guardian\u2019s Chris Stein reports, and Trump has a track record of calling for militarized responses to demonstrations. In an article published today, Stein investigates the stakes of the 2024 election: Since Floyd\u2019s death in May 2020, Republican-led states have enacted laws expanding the definition of rioting to encompass protesters who stayed peaceful when others did not, protecting drivers who run over demonstrators that block roads and enhancing penalties against protesters who target oil and gas infrastructure and deface monuments. The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL), which tracks the legislation, has found that hundreds of proposals have been made by state and federal lawmakers nationwide, and more than two dozen signed into law. The push comes as the GOP\u2019s standard bearer, Donald Trump, campaigns for the presidency on a platform that includes suppressing protests. He has vowed to deploy the national guard \u201cwhere there has been a complete breakdown of law and order\u201d, while simultaneously promising pardons for people convicted over the January 6 insurrection. As president, Trump reportedly encouraged the military to shoot protesters, and, this year, allies such as the speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, have said the national guard should be used against college students demonstrating over Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza. If he returned to the White House, Trump could direct a militarized response to protests and pressure congressional Republicans to pass legislation that would impose nationwide penalties like those already in effect in Tennessee. Donald Trump and Elon Musk are on their way to the rally in Butler. The former president boarded his flight to Butler from West Palm Beach, Florida, about half an hour ago. Meanwhile, the tech billionaire has shared on X that he is en route to Pennsylvania. As the Trump and Harris campaigns host events across the country today \u2013 now one month before the 5 November election \u2013 the Guardian US is averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. We will update our averages once a week, or more if there is major news. As the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine writes today: With her highest national polling average since July, Harris is now leading in five of seven key swing states. Nationally, the Guardian\u2019s tracker shows Harris with 49.3% of the vote, compared with 46% for Trump. The election is a month away, and already an estimated 1.4 million Americans have voted as of midday on Friday. The race is still extremely close. The simplest path to collecting the 270 electoral votes needed to win is still the blue wall of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. While Harris leads Trump in all three according to the Guardian\u2019s analysis (Pennsylvania by 1.2 points, Michigan by 0.1 points and Wisconsin by 2.2 points), those advantages are quite slim. JD Vance is attending a fundraising luncheon today in Gloucester, Massachusetts, before Trump\u2019s rally in Butler, which Vance will attend. According to the New York Times, which obtained a copy of the luncheon invitation, the event is being hosted by Michael and Renee Minogue. The couple run a Boston-based Christian foundation, which had $22m in assets in 2022. Bernie Sanders is campaigning in Michigan for Kamala Harris this weekend. The Vermont independent senator is scheduled for four stops in the state today and tomorrow, including a rally in Warren this morning, where he spoke alongside the United Auto Workers president, Shawn Fain. The events will focus on \u201cstrengthening the working class\u201d and \u201crally[ing] against corporate greed\u201d, Sanders says. Harris herself visited Michigan yesterday, where she spoke at a rally in Detroit. During that speech, Harris made specific references to the state\u2019s unions, including the UAW and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and denounced Trump as a union buster. Harris and Trump have been closely tied in Michigan, but Trump appears to have narrowly pulled ahead in the swing state, according to a recent statewide poll. Democratic representative Elissa Slotkin raised concerns about Harris\u2019s polling at a recent campaign event, the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: The Secret Service has beefed up security measures in Butler before Trump\u2019s rally this evening. Agents will be operating a counter-drone system and securing the building where shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks fired upon Trump in July, CNN reports. Trump will also be speaking from behind ballistic glass. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a lot more enhancements,\u201d one federal official told CNN. The Secret Service is also more closely coordinating with local law enforcement, including the Pennsylvania state police. Elon Musk will attend Trump\u2019s rally in Butler this evening, the Trump campaign has confirmed in a list of guests who will be joining the former president. \u201cI will be there to support!\u201d the tech billionaire replied to a post by Trump on Musk\u2019s social media platform, X, saying he was returning to the Butler Farm Show grounds. As rally-goers gathered in Butler this morning, Steve Bannon\u2019s War Room podcast, from the former Trump White House chief strategist, was being powered by a Cybertruck \u2013 Tesla\u2019s recall-prone, tank-like, electric truck. For more on the Trump-Musk relationship, Cybertrucks and Bannon\u2019s War Room, see reporting from our Guardian colleagues: Before Kamala Harris\u2019s scheduled visit to North Carolina today, the Federal Emergency Management Agency reports more than $110m in federal assistance has been distributed to Hurricane Helene recovery efforts. Harris will receive a briefing today from Fema administrator Deanne Criswell before surveying the damage in North Carolina. This week marks Harris\u2019s first time visiting the scene of a humanitarian crisis as vice-president \u2013 a role typically filled by Joe Biden, who this weekend is instead traveling to Camp David. Harris said this week that she wanted to \u201cpersonally take a look at the devastation, which is extraordinary\u201d. For more on the devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene, see reporting from Richard Luscombe and commentary from Rebecca Solnit in the Guardian: With election day exactly one month away, Democrats are raising concerns about Kamala Harris\u2019s relatively light campaign schedule, particularly as Trump draws crowds to rallies like today\u2019s, Politico reports. According to Politico, Harris has spent more than a third of the days since the Democratic national convention receiving briefings or conducting internal meetings. Of the remaining days, she\u2019s spent just more than half holding rallies and other public-facing campaign events. The vice-president has spent about half of her days in Washington DC since the convention, rather than campaigning in swing states. That news comes as the Washington Post reports that the Harris campaign is spending nearly three times as much as Trump, as the candidates remain closely tied. As the Trump and Harris campaigns ramp up into high gear for a final month of campaigning before election day \u2013 including at high-profile rallies such as today\u2019s in Butler, Pennsylvania, the Secret Service is at \u201ca breaking point\u201d, NBC News reports. A dozen current and former Secret Service agents told NBC News that insufficient staffing and an increased workload have contributed to errors, such as those in Butler when a gunman opened fire at Trump on 13 July. \u201cThere is a huge security risk because you already have agents that are burnt out, exhausted now having even less time to make a solid security plan and get all assets in order,\u201d a current agent told NBC. \u201cI love my agency but they are setting themselves up for another incident,\u201d said one former agent. Both current and former officials told NBC they are concerned the agency will witness a mass exodus of personnel over the next 18 months. For more context on recent Secret Service failures, see Robert Tait and Ed Helmore\u2019s reporting in the Guardian: Still hours before Trump is scheduled to speak in Butler, Pennsylvania, this evening, reporters on the ground at the rally are reporting a large and eager crowd. The Trump campaign is touting the rally as a return to \u201cthe very same ground where [Trump] took a bullet for democracy less than three months ago\u201d. A Pennsylvania voter tell Fox News: \u201cI think we\u2019re on hallowed ground today.\u201d Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are touring the country this weekend, while their proxies do the same. Perhaps most notable: Trump is scheduled today to return to Butler, Pennsylvania \u2013 where a shooter attempted to assassinate him less than three months ago. He\u2019ll be joined by the family of Corey Comperatore, a rally-goer who was shot and killed at a July rally. Meanwhile, the vice-president is traveling to North Carolina today, where Hurricane Helene has devastated much of the state, killing at least 200 people. Harris will receive a briefing on recovery efforts, and provide updates on federal actions to support the emergency response. Here\u2019s what else is happening: The Trump campaign has announced a weekend-long tour of Georgia, which will make three stops in the state today, ending in Atlanta. Joe Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, will travel to Camp David, where they will remain over the weekend.",

About 8% more of the people in those constituencies are living in deprivation compared with the national average.</p> <p>\u201cJust to add insult to injury, those lucky enough to draw their income from capital enjoy a rate of tax that is much lower than everyone else\u2019s,\u201d said Byrne. \u201cAlmost 60% of UK investment income goes to the richest 10% of households.</p> <p>\u201cThe bottom line is this. Taxes on capital income need to go up and if we do it in the right way we can use that money to help reverse the extraordinary growth of wealth inequality that now deeply divides our country.\u201d</p> <p>Reeves has said that she is aiming for a budget dedicated to investment, which is expected to be paid for with a finessing of fiscal rules to borrow more. Some tax rises and welfare cuts will form part of her budget. However, there is frustration throughout Whitehall that the government has boxed itself in by ruling out increases in incomes tax, employee national insurance contributions and VAT.</p>    <p>Reeves wants to ensure that the public spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, takes full account of the value of public investment she is set to announce on 30 October.</p> <p>Such a move would make its economic forecasts more optimistic, increasing projected revenues to the public purse as a result of higher growth. She has ruled out a new wealth tax applied directly to the \u00adrichest, as demanded by one of Labour\u2019s biggest financial backers, the Unite union. However, she is said to be looking at increasing CGT, which is now set lower than income tax. Raising CGT to the same level as income tax for higher earners could raise between \u00a38bn and \u00a316bn and was a policy pursued by Tory chancellor Nigel Lawson in 1988. However, equalising it now would see a steep rise in CGT, prompting critics to warn of an exodus from the country by the wealthy.</p> <p>New research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies has found that the \u00addisparity between the rates of income tax and CGT are \u201cunfair and create undesirable distortions\u201d. It calls for a complete overhaul of the tax, \u00adincluding the end of a rule that means CGT is not paid after someone\u2019s death. \u201cWith a reformed tax base, tax rates should ultimately be aligned across all forms of gains and income,\u201d it states. \u201cThis would involve significant increases to CGT rates.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A failure by Rachel Reeves to back a \u201cwindfall of wealth taxes\u201d in her budget risks fuelling the rise of the populist right, a former Labour cabinet minister has warned. Liam Byrne, a senior figure in the New Labour government and chair of the Commons business and trade committee, said that the rise of Reform UK at the last election meant the chancellor and Keir Starmer must urgently consider raising funds to deal with inequality. With Reeves desperately hunting for revenue-raising measures to pay for a public investment drive, Byrne said she should consider raising capital gains tax (CGT) to the same level as income tax, closing inheritance loopholes exploited by the wealthy, cutting tax breaks for rich pension savers and charging national insurance contributions on investment income. His comments come as new analysis suggests a strong correlation between wealth inequality and the popularity of Reform at the election, when it secured more than 4m votes and won five seats. Senior figures in both main parties fear that continuing disillusionment with politics among the public could see Reform\u2019s support continue to rise. The average wealth of the top 1% has risen by \u00a32.2m since 2010, about 41 times more than the rise in average wealth of the rest of society, according to new research commissioned by Byrne for the updated version of his book The Inequality of Wealth: Why It Matters and How to Fix It. Byrne said he was a \u201ccard-carrying member of New Labour\u201d, but was \u201cnow convinced\u201d that a series of wealth taxes were needed. \u201cThe way to raise the cash to rebuild Britain is to restore fairness to Britain\u2019s taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we fail, my new analysis of the 2024 election shows the demand for the snake-oil of populism will simply grow.\u201d The Reform vote is lower in areas where house prices are higher, while property prices are about a third lower than the national average in constituencies with the top 20 highest Reform votes. About 8% more of the people in those constituencies are living in deprivation compared with the national average. \u201cJust to add insult to injury, those lucky enough to draw their income from capital enjoy a rate of tax that is much lower than everyone else\u2019s,\u201d said Byrne. \u201cAlmost 60% of UK investment income goes to the richest 10% of households. \u201cThe bottom line is this. Taxes on capital income need to go up and if we do it in the right way we can use that money to help reverse the extraordinary growth of wealth inequality that now deeply divides our country.\u201d Reeves has said that she is aiming for a budget dedicated to investment, which is expected to be paid for with a finessing of fiscal rules to borrow more. Some tax rises and welfare cuts will form part of her budget. However, there is frustration throughout Whitehall that the government has boxed itself in by ruling out increases in incomes tax, employee national insurance contributions and VAT. Reeves wants to ensure that the public spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, takes full account of the value of public investment she is set to announce on 30 October. Such a move would make its economic forecasts more optimistic, increasing projected revenues to the public purse as a result of higher growth. She has ruled out a new wealth tax applied directly to the richest, as demanded by one of Labour\u2019s biggest financial backers, the Unite union. However, she is said to be looking at increasing CGT, which is now set lower than income tax. Raising CGT to the same level as income tax for higher earners could raise between \u00a38bn and \u00a316bn and was a policy pursued by Tory chancellor Nigel Lawson in 1988. However, equalising it now would see a steep rise in CGT, prompting critics to warn of an exodus from the country by the wealthy. New research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies has found that the disparity between the rates of income tax and CGT are \u201cunfair and create undesirable distortions\u201d. It calls for a complete overhaul of the tax, including the end of a rule that means CGT is not paid after someone\u2019s death. \u201cWith a reformed tax base, tax rates should ultimately be aligned across all forms of gains and income,\u201d it states. \u201cThis would involve significant increases to CGT rates.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The White House moved Saturday to quash claims that government officials control the weather, including a far-fetched rumor circulating on social media that Hurricane Helene was an engineered storm to allow corporations to mine regional lithium deposits. \u201cWe have seen a large increase in false information circulating online related to the federal response to Hurricane Helene,\u201d a statement said, pointing to a \u201cnumber of scam artists, bad-faith actors, and others who want to sow chaos because they think it helps their political interests are promoting disinformation about the recovery effort.\u201d The White House said the rumors, which include claims that emergency disaster money had been spent housing immigrants and that relief funds would be limited to $750 per claim, were \u201cwrong, dangerous\u201d and said \u201cit must stop immediately\u201d. The warning, which speaks to the intense political environment Helene figuratively crashed into, came hours after Biden told lawmakers to refill the coffers of disaster relief programs as the projected recovery and rebuilding costs related to Hurricane Helene are estimated to be as much as $200bn over 10 years. In a letter sent to congressional leaders, the president said while the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) and the Department of Defense are able to meet \u201ccritical life-saving and life-sustaining missions and will continue to do so within present funding levels\u201d, they will need additional funding. \u201cMy administration has provided robust and well-coordinated federal support for the ongoing response and recovery efforts,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cAs with other catastrophic disasters, it will take some time to assess the full requirements for response and recovery efforts, and I fully expect that the Congress will do its part to provide the funding needed.\u201d Biden said that a comprehensive disaster relief package would be necessary when Congress returns on 12 November \u2013 but said action on individual programs could be needed before then. But there are currently no plans for Congress to reconvene before the election. The request comes as Kamala Harris cut short a campaign swing through the western states to visit western North Carolina in the southern Appalachian mountains where entire towns were washed away. Biden viewed the damage and cleanup efforts in the Carolinas by air on Wednesday, and again in Florida and Georgia on Thursday. He said the work to rebuild will cost \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d and additional disaster relief funding \u201ccan\u2019t wait \u2026 people need help now\u201d. At least 225 people have been confirmed dead from Helene, and officials say they expect the death toll to continue to rise as recovery efforts continue. A police department spokesperson in Asheville, North Carolina, told CBS News in an email late on Friday that it is \u201cactively working 75 cases of missing persons\u201d. Nearly 1 million people remain without power. In his letter to lawmakers, Biden said that funding through the Small Business Administration (SBA) \u201cwill run out of funding in a matter of weeks and well before the Congress is planning to reconvene\u201d. The SBA is designed to help small business owners and homeowners recoup property and equipment through the disaster relief loan program. Administration officials told CNN that the program needs $1.6bn in additional funding to meet about 3,000 Hurricane Helene-related applications it is receiving daily. Last month, before Helene hit, the White House warned that the low funding levels could lead to the SBA \u201ceffectively ceasing operations\u201d after paying out for weather-related costs and accidents, including the Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore, the continued recovery after Maui\u2019s wildfires and tornado damage in the midwest. The damage caused by Helene could cost upwards of $34bn, according to early estimates from Moody\u2019s Analytics. The private forecaster AccuWeather put the cost of damages at $225bn to $250bn, with very little covered by private insurance. The issue of Helene costs is already deeply political. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, has said lawmakers would assess the post-Helene needs in full after the election. Former president Trump has accused Democrats of spending over $640m in Fema funds on housing migrants, a claim the White House calls \u201cbold-faced lies\u201d. On Friday, in Georgia, Trump said: \u201cA lot of the money that was supposed to go to Georgia and supposed to go to North Carolina and all of the others is going and has gone already. \u201cIt\u2019s been gone for people that came into the country illegally, and nobody has ever seen anything like that. That\u2019s a shame.\u201d Officials say those funds, authorized by Congress, was part of an entirely different program run by Fema unconnected to disaster relief but to provide housing to immigrants applying for US citizenship. The disaster agency responded to Trump\u2019s claim with a fact-check page. \u201cThis is false,\u201d Fema said in a statement. \u201cNo money is being diverted from disaster response needs.\u201d A week after the hurricane hit, more than $45m has been dispersed to communities affected by the storm.",

While the latter contains sodium bicarbonate, it is blended with other components (\u201cThe science behind sport\u2019s most popular supplements\u201d, 29 September, New Review, p24). \u2022 A feature (\u201cMagic bullet \u2013 60 years of the train that helped rebuild the idea of Japan\u201d, 29 September, p32) said the shinkansen high-speed rail network covered all four of the country\u2019s main islands; it does not in fact reach Shikoku, the smallest of the four. Also, the article said there had been no fatalities resulting from an accident anywhere on the network. This should have said none that were caused by a rail crash; there was an accidental death at a station in 1995. \u2022 Last week\u2019s article selected from the Observer archive was titled \u201cRoald Dahl on chocolate\u201d and dated 20 April 1997.

(When runners register, if they don\u2019t want to state their sex, they can specify: \u201canother gender identity\u201d or \u201cprefer not to say\u201d.) Parkrun has also removed some of its speed records from its website to avoid being \u201coff-putting\u201d to new participants. Overwhelmingly, though, the regulars love Parkrun and see its ethos \u2013 free; open to all; an event not a race \u2013 as something rare and worth cherishing. As the prosecco modestly flowed at Bushy Park, Sinton-Hewitt looked towards the future. \u201cI live with it every single day so there\u2019s no great shock in the new milestones,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s just a wonder about where we will be in 20 years\u2019 time. We\u2019re only going to get bigger. \u201cSo we\u2019re 10 million people registered now \u2013 is it going to be 15 million in 20 years\u2019 time? Or 100 million?\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Tyrell Malacia</h2> <p>The first signing of the Erik ten Hag era, ticking the key criterion of coming from the Eredivisie. It\u2019s difficult to say too much about a player who last featured in June&nbsp;2023. The left-back made a lot of appearances in his first season but a knee injury has kept him out for 16 months. <strong>Rating 1/5</strong></p> <h2>Antony</h2> <p>When the club paid \u00a385.6m for the Brazilian winger, they were expecting a world beater but got ineptitude. Antony will go down as one of the worst pound-for-pound signings. Ten Hag knew him from&nbsp;Ajax and thought he could lead the new era at Old Trafford, but he has been a painful disappointment,&nbsp;putting the blame at the Dutchman\u2019s door. Off-field issues have been a further problem for the 24-year-old who has played one Premier League minute this season, having slipped down the pecking order. <strong>1/5</strong></p> <h2>Casemiro</h2> <p>At the time, he was what United needed but came with a high price tag of \u00a350m plus add-ons for a midfielder over the age of 30. After almost a decade of success with Real Madrid, he had a winner\u2019s mentality, helping United qualify for the Champions League in his first season, but an ageing body. He has been unable to cope with the pace of the Premier League over the past 15 months. <strong>2/5</strong></p> <h2>Lisandro Mart\u00ednez</h2> <p>Another who moved with Ten Hag from Amsterdam. The combative defender has been one of the more positive arrivals, adding steel to a defence that has too often been weak. Injuries have been a problem but when available is always first choice. <strong>4/5</strong></p>    <h2>Wout Weghorst</h2> <p>A desperation signing when United needed an extra striker and could not find anyone suitable at short notice, making an available Dutchman the best option. Tried his best after joining on loan from Burnley but was never at the required standard nor did he fit into the system, netting zero goals in 17 Premier League outings. <strong>2/5</strong></p> <h2>Christian Eriksen</h2> <p>Has never looked like what United need in midfield, lacking speed and is insufficiently robust. Occasionally offers glimpses of the world-class midfielder he once was but those days are behind him. On the upside, at least he did not cost a fee. <strong>3/5</strong></p> <h2>Jack Butland</h2> <p>The goalkeeper never played but was on the substitutes\u2019 bench 20 times. <strong>N/A</strong></p> <h2>Marcel Sabitzer</h2> <p>United\u2019s financial situation has seen them dip far too regularly into the loan market. The Austrian\u2019s high point of a forgettable spell was scoring twice in a Europa League quarter-final against Sevilla but the club did not make his move permanent. <strong>2/5</strong></p> <h2>Rasmus H\u00f8jlund</h2> <p>A striker with potential but like others before him has lacked service. The \u00a372m fee seemed excessive at the time, considering Atalanta paid a quarter of that to sign him 12 months previously. A reminder that&nbsp;United have not been smart in the transfer market for a long time.&nbsp;<strong>3/5</strong></p>    <h2>Mason Mount</h2> <p>Kickstarted the second summer of transfer business but it was never particularly obvious where he would fit into the team with others already at the club who could play in his position(s). Injury meant he never got going in his first season and has&nbsp;interrupted the second already as he struggles to remind everyone of the player he once was at Chelsea.&nbsp;<strong>2/5</strong></p> <h2>Andr\u00e9 Onana</h2> <p>Was available for nothing when his former Ajax manager Ten Hag arrived at United, but let his reputation grow at Inter, forcing United to invest \u00a345m in the Cameroonian goalkeeper. Was unconvincing in the early part of his Old Trafford career but has become a steady performer in an indifferent team. <strong>3/5</strong></p> <h2>Sofyan Amrabat</h2> <p>Another familiar face to Ten Hag, joining on loan on deadline day at the end of the summer 2023 window. Never looked comfortable playing for United, not helped by playing in numerous positions, but did produce a fine FA Cup final performance against Manchester City. <strong>3/5</strong></p> <h2>Altay Bayindir</h2> <p>The Turkish goalkeeper played twice and was victorious on both occasions, giving him a 100% record as a United player. No one else can boast that. <strong>2/5</strong></p>    <h2>Jonny Evans</h2> <p>A shock signing when the veteran centre-back returned to the club aged 35, a decade after leaving. Played a lot more games \u2013 sometimes at left-back \u2013 than he expected and even earned a one-year contract extension, having rarely let anyone down. <strong>3/5</strong></p> <h2>Sergio Reguil\u00f3n</h2> <p>An underrated loan signing from Tottenham as United needed a left-back. Was allowed to return in January, which was a mistake considering his steady presence and the inability for Luke Shaw or Malacia to stay fit. <strong>3/5</strong></p> <h2>Leny Yoro</h2> <p>The 18-year-old defender is a \u00a352m long-term investment but has been prevented from making his debut after suffering a pre-season injury.&nbsp;<strong>N/A</strong></p> <h2>Manuel Ugarte</h2> <p>United\u2019s potential gamechanger in defensive midfield with Casemiro\u2019s decline. Too early to judge whether the 23-year-old Uruguayan signed from PSG will be the transformational signing but his performance against Spurs drew&nbsp;criticism from Marco van&nbsp;Basten who called him \u201cidiotic\u201d.&nbsp;<strong>3/5</strong></p> <h2>Matthijs de Ligt</h2> <p>Another who worked with Ten Hag at Ajax and has plenty of experience for a 25-year-old centre-back. The manager hopes his partnership with Mart\u00ednez can provide the stability in defence United have lacked for a long time but is yet to show the class his CV promises, giving the impression of being too slow in mind and body. <strong>2/5</strong></p>    <h2>Joshua Zirkzee</h2> <p>When an out-and-out striker to challenge Hojlund was needed, United went for a player Ten Hag describes as a \u201cnine and a half\u201d as his first signing of the past summer. Produced a wonderful finish on debut against Fulham but has not scored since and does not look likely to be prolific. <strong>3/5</strong></p> <h2>Noussair Mazraoui</h2> <p>Another of Ten Hag\u2019s former charges, the Morocco international grew up in the Netherlands, joining from Bayern Munich. The versatile defender can operate in numerous positions and is bedding into the team. <strong>3/5</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "If you follow the leader, Labor\u2019s election campaign in Queensland looks unremarkable. The premier, Steven Miles, has set up camp in north and central Queensland, touring regional tipping-point seats that historically decide who forms government. But out on the hustings, with polls suggesting Labor is on track for a heavy defeat, a fallback strategy is already playing out. Labor\u2019s volunteers have been clustered in places like Waterford \u2013 margin 16% \u2013 sandbagging to protect the party\u2019s next generation of leaders. Members of the Young Labor left faction have spent significant time in recent weeks mucking in for progressive star Shannon Fentiman, the health minister, who is considered a frontrunner to become opposition leader should the polls hold true until 26 October. Waterford, in the Logan suburbs, is the sort of very safe Labor seat that would only be lost in a 2012-scale landslide defeat. But Fentiman is understood to be nervous, evidenced by the volume of red shirts and Young Turks from the Labor left seen in the electorate in the past week. A poll in the seat, revealed by the Australian, suggested a nerve-inducing 13% swing against the government. Labor sources say resources are being sent to Gaven, at the northern end of the Gold Coast, where Australia\u2019s youngest housing minister, Meaghan Scanlon, is facing a tough campaign. Ditto in Aspley where the Labor right\u2019s rising star, Bart Mellish, is defending a slim margin. Labor MPs say the need to protect safer seats in the outer suburbs and city fringe \u2013 in addition to the regions and the inner-city \u2013 has meant resources have been stretched thin. \u201cIt\u2019s like we have sandbags but just no one to put them out,\u201d says one campaign worker who was doorknocking in the inner Brisbane suburbs this week. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email An uphill battle in the regions Paul Williams, a political scientist and commentator from Griffith University, says different campaign tactics are required in the inner city compared to the outer suburbs and the regions. Miles has spent most of his time in regional and north Queensland, despite polls suggesting these seats are write-offs, partly because it\u2019s expected of him. \u201cTo do anything else is like waving a white flag,\u201d one Labor figure says. \u201c[Miles] went to Townsville on the first day because that\u2019s what you do. If you don\u2019t go to Townsville straight away, the people of Townsville notice.\u201d Williams says that if Miles were to spend too much time in Brisbane it would \u201cconfirm the suspicions\u201d of regional people, who tend to turn on leaders seen as too heavily invested in the south-east. \u201cYou need to show the flag,\u201d he says. Labor sources believe the party is likely to lose up to a dozen seats in regional Queensland \u2013 alone enough to hand the LNP a majority \u2013 including former strongholds like Mackay and Rockhampton. Polls show that Labor\u2019s support in the outer suburbs, where they hold some seats by comfortable margins, is also flagging. Williams says he did not believe Labor was at risk of losing Waterford, like it did during the 2012 election wipeout, but that there were \u201csome cranky blue-collar voters out there\u201d. \u201cIn many respects, the political culture out there might be more like Ipswich West [where Labor was beaten via a huge byelection swing] and regional Queensland. Blue collar workers, self-employed tradies are all very much LNP rusted-on voters these days.\u201d Do the Greens have a lock on doorknocking? Closer to the city, Labor MPs face a different threat. After the success of the Greens\u2019 field campaigns at recent federal and state elections, Labor MPs have been advised to go back to basics and knock on doors. Some have spent months on the ground with only a handful of local volunteers, even putting up election signs themselves; Miller MP Mark Bailey says he\u2019s been to more than 8,000 homes. One MP says they had been buoyed by the response to the government\u2019s 50c public transport fares, describing it as \u201cthe most popular policy I\u2019ve seen in 30 years\u201d. Another says Miles was \u201cpopular among young men, but young women seem to be more likely to support the Greens\u201d. In places where the Greens are targeting wins \u2013 Cooper, McConnel, Miller and Greenslopes \u2013 the minor party has reactivated and broadened its army of volunteers from the 2022 federal election. Labor MPs say the ground efforts of its candidates in inner Brisbane has been an attempt to respond to the Greens\u2019 strategies, but Labor did not seem to have the sheer number of volunteers to cover the same ground. \u201cThey [the Greens volunteers] are all young, probably students, and seem to have time during the day to doorknock,\u201d one Labor MP says. \u201cWe are outnumbered.\u201d Williams says doorknocking was an \u201cunderrated activity\u201d and that human contact with voters was very effective. \u201cBut if the tide\u2019s out, no amount of doorknocking will retrieve it,\u201d he says. \u2018Crisafulli is going to inherit some poisoned chalices\u2019 David Crisafulli\u2019s proclamation this week \u2013 that he would resign if crime victim numbers did not decrease under an LNP government in the next four years \u2013 might have upped the stakes for Labor\u2019s defensive efforts. Williams says if Labor can avoid a rout and keep some of its best talent, the party could be leading in the polls again within 12 months. \u201cCrisafulli is going to inherit some poisoned chalices, not just youth crime but health, which he has made a tier one issue, and infrastructure for the Olympics. These are not things that can be fixed overnight. \u201c[The promise to resign] will be something Labor will raise in question time for the next four years.\u201d He says the deputy premier, Cameron Dick, or Fentiman \u2013 both considered effective communicators \u2013 would be opposition leader after the election. Fentiman was at Loganlea train station on Friday morning spruiking the 50c fares to commuters. She and other candidates in the Brisbane suburbs have shifted their \u201chigh-visibility\u201d campaigning sessions \u2013 tactics that usually involve standing at the roadside, holding signs and waving at passing traffic \u2013 to more personal meet-and-greets outside rail and bus hubs. \u201cThat policy will be responsible for saving quite a few MPs,\u201d says one Labor source.",

      "bodyText": "Every single member of Panse Saleh\u2019s extended family in Lebanon has been displaced from their home \u2013 some are sleeping in cars, others on the street or in temporary housing. Some could have to move again as Israel continues to bombard parts of Lebanon. Sydney-based Saleh fears elderly members of her family could die \u2013 whether they stay or attempt to leave Lebanon\u2019s south. Much of the southern region is populated by the Shia community and relatives in Australia \u2013 like Saleh \u2013 have watched the events of the past weeks with horror. \u201cMy uncle is sleeping in his car, fleeing from one spot to another because of how unsafe it is. Another uncle was missed by a rocket by 20 metres,\u201d she says. \u201cMy grandparents are staying in a home alongside five other families. My grandmother knew this war would be different and they left everything behind. \u201cI\u2019ve aged 10 years in the past 10 days. We spend all day and night on the news, watching, hoping we don\u2019t recognise a village or a suburb. We live in constant panic, constant dismay.\u201d Saleh rattles off story after story. A single mother running with her two sons through a village as it is bombed. Of a building full of people collapsing. Of people escaping with only US$20 in their pockets. \u201cI spend all night on the phone, I just remember someone and call them. And sometimes they don\u2019t answer. We can only depend on the news. And everyone in my community here feels it.\u201d The Lebanese Shia community in Sydney is relatively close-knit. It\u2019s smaller than their Sunni counterparts. The closeness means people feel deeply connected to what happens in Lebanon. Now, they are reeling at what they see as an invasion of their ancestral home. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads There are now 1.2 million people displaced by Israel\u2019s military action in Lebanon, according to the country\u2019s caretaker environment minister, Nasser Yassin. Israeli strikes have killed more than 1,000 people in Lebanon over the past fortnight, many of them women and children, according to the health ministry. Daily funerals and vigils are held at the handful of Lebanese Shia mosques in Sydney so people in Australia can take part in rituals for loved ones. People mourn relatives, friends, teachers, doctors, imams \u2013 and strangers. For a fortnight, a whole community has agonised over daily news from the other side of the world. \u201cI don\u2019t sleep. There is a lot of frustration and disappointment, especially knowing that speaking out won\u2019t change anything. Our anger always turns to helplessness,\u201d Saleh says. \u201cAll we have been able to do in this country is watch. We are standing still, watching.\u201d The hurt has mobilised many in the Lebanese Shia community who are now attending the weekly pro-Palestine marches in Melbourne and Sydney. The marches are no longer just about Gaza, where Israeli strikes have killed more than 40,000 people since the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 that killed 1,200 people in Israel. Last weekend\u2019s rallies were controversial because some protesters displayed Hezbollah flags. Under Australia\u2019s anti-terror laws, it can be illegal to display prohibited symbols of a listed terrorist organisation. Hezbollah garnered widespread domestic support for pushing out Israel in 2000 after almost two decades of occupation \u2013 even among Christian, Druze and Sunni Muslim sections of society outside its main Shia base in the south. It fought a five-week war with Israel in 2006. Hezbollah was listed as a terrorist organisation in its entirety in Australia in 2021. Previously just the military wing of the broad organisation \u2013 that also provides education, health and financial services \u2013 was designated. Hezbollah has conducted mass-casualty attacks on civilians but the group\u2019s reach extends beyond militancy. The Sydney Shia community leader Julie Karaki says the furore over displaying Hezbollah imagery has been a \u201cdistraction\u201d. \u201cIt is a lessening of the cause we are trying to stand for,\u201d she says. Karaki argues only a handful of flags were displayed. People carrying the image of the assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah were doing that while mourning, she says. \u201cYou have to understand that for the south Lebanese community Sayyid Hassan is like their father. Very few people from the south see them as a terrorist organisation and yet, over here, we can\u2019t even question the listing. \u201cI am not questioning the law, what I am saying is that we need to have a nuanced conversation.\u201d Karaki says the \u201cdistracting\u201d debate means her community\u2019s pain has not been acknowledged. \u201cIt feels like they [politicians] see us as second-class citizens and when they do say something it always feels superficial and dismissive. It never feels genuine. \u201cWe are hurting and it is a collective hurt. It is school holidays and no one can bring themselves to do anything happy.\u201d Gamel Kheir is the secretary of the Lebanese Muslim Association, a Sunni organisation that predominantly represents communities from north Lebanon. He says the current conflict has brought about \u201cunprecedented\u201d unity within the communities in Australia. \u201cNothing brings us together more than tragedy, and unfortunately this tragedy has been repeated many, many times before with the Lebanese. \u201cAnd the Lebanese have proven, again, how unified they are and how much solidarity they show in times of pressure. We stand by our Shia brothers and sisters.\u201d Kheir said the community was incensed by the political response in Australia to Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon. The history of Lebanese migration and social and cultural connections meant the community expected to \u201csee and hear more\u201d from politicians. \u201cThey eat our food, they engage in our culture, but they don\u2019t care about our lives? \u201cWe are disappointed with all levels of government, state and federal. All we want to see is a government official, a politician, stand up and say Lebanon has a right to defend itself. Where has that discourse gone?\u201d Kheir says comments by the federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, over the past week have been particularly infuriating. Dutton wants visa holders caught holding Hezbollah imagery to be deported and has said pro-Palestine and Lebanon rallies planned for this weekend were a \u201ccelebration of death\u201d. \u201cThis is [a] classic dog whistle,\u201d Kheir says. \u201cHe has spent a lifetime sandbagging the Lebanese community into a corner. \u201cAll he does is undermine social cohesion with such comments. He\u2019s a wannabe prime minister and that\u2019s all he\u2019ll ever be.\u201d The NSW premier, Chris Minns, did meet this week with a group of leaders from the Lebanese community from different sects and religions. But the premier\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment on the outcome of those discussions. Guardian Australia sought comment from Dutton\u2019s office.",

Trends and features over fundamentals.</p> <p>Acres of carpet in giant open plan living spaces, more bathrooms than occupants in any house, a fascination with surface rather than substance, poor construction and any house that does not genuinely attempt to connect to its landscape or context are all bugbears of mine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/08/homes-on-steroids-how-australia-came-to-build-some-of-the-biggest-houses-on-earth\">Homes on steroids: how Australia came to build some of the biggest houses on Earth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I think our houses are generally too big; they are, in design terms, a bit lazy in this sense. We\u2019d benefit enormously by cutting maybe 20% out of most new builds, and I\u2019d rather see smaller, more intensely designed homes that are personal and quirky than large spaces. It\u2019s simply quality over quantity for me. I do think this is something that is changing though.</p> <p><strong>Are you seeing any trends in </strong><strong>Australian homes which excite you?</strong></p> <p>Yes, indeed. Two things in particular. The first is the refocusing on materials in light of environmental performance. We\u2019re seeing a comeback, of sorts, of some very old building techniques, like rammed earth and hempcrete, which is changing the texture and geometry of our homes in interesting and exciting ways. Also, the application of new materials into construction as a result of trying to improve<strong> </strong>environmental performance. Both these bring with them a refocusing on the craft of construction and a need to rethink building processes precisely because they are not typical. So it\u2019s not just banging up a frame on a slab, but something like care and craftsmanship, and that gets me very excited.</p>    <p>You know a beautifully made home when you see it \u2013 actually, you feel it when you\u2019re in it. That kind of building craft does not have to be big or ostentatious, and it is out there, but can be hard to find.</p> <p>The second is less tangible, but perhaps more important. I genuinely feel people are searching for a new \u201cspirit of home\u201d in design today, which is very exciting. It\u2019s hard to pin down, and I confess I\u2019ve not fully worked this out yet, but what I hear in various versions is the idea that a home, any home, should be about more than the pragmatics of life. In some way it should make you feel good; physically, morally and emotionally. It might be about calm, or security or about family, but there is a sense of design with an emotional intelligence. It\u2019s hard to say in our current housing crisis when, for many, any roof would be a blessing, but our homes are more than just a roof over our heads. Architecture at its best it elevates the ordinary (like making a cup of coffee) into something personal and extraordinary, a little ritual perhaps. I think architects and homeowners are searching for this through design with new energy. Maybe it\u2019s a post-Covid thing, but I feel what our homes mean to us is changing after that experience.</p> <p><strong>How will Australian homes need to adapt to be livable for the long-term future? Is this kind of adaptation </strong><strong>happening fast enough?</strong></p> <p>This is a big question. I think we\u2019re at the start of maybe 20 years of experimentation and innovation in architecture at the moment, simply because we can\u2019t keep on with business as usual. So, the external pressures on the Australian home, like cost of living, costs of construction, building for different family profiles (multigenerational, single parent, ageing population) are there and driving new thinking. I see sustainability, the changing climate and the move to work from home all requiring real change in the way we think about the Australian home. And the design community is responding.</p>    <p>Already I see sustainability right at the centre of most homeowners conversations \u2013 not an add on, but an essential. Whether driven by energy prices or a sense of responsibility, this is a big positive change. I see Australian home types broadening away from the typical family home again, to models where multigenerational living is celebrated, where small communities of action are springing up (to share a common garden or bike shed, for example) which is inspiring.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/04/i-wanted-a-tiny-house-and-a-big-life-could-i-have-it-all-in-25-square-metres\">I wanted a tiny house \u2013 and a big life. Could I have it all in 25 square metres?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This kind of adaptation is under way \u2013 perhaps not quick enough, but the trailblazers are out there all around Australia working this out for the rest of us.</p> <p><strong>What do you think defines excellent residential architecture?</strong></p> <p>Excellent residential architecture to me is about creating inspiring contexts for the lives lived within. The best architecture subtly orients our attention to the things that matter and in this sense its job is to foreground our relationships; with nature, with each other, with the community, and turn them into something beautiful to experience every day.</p> <p><strong>Changing focus here, the recent public response to Sydney\u2019s new metro has been overwhelming and </strong><strong>incredibly positive. What does this say about how public architecture can make people feel? </strong></p> <p>The Sydney metro has been a wonderful success.

In the moments she\u2019s above my head and our eyes meet, it\u2019s like we are looking into each other\u2019s souls \u2013 it\u2019s profound connection, ultimate trust. I feel like we are in complete balance together. In life and in dance we know where each other\u2019s going, it\u2019s a joint instinct which is so beautiful to share. It\u2019s like we are dancing our way not just through our choreography but through our day-to-day life together. In 2022 that synchronicity brought us to Australia when we joined the Sydney Dance Company. In the studio and at home, we\u2019ve shared many scary moments together, pushing the limits of our trust for and responsibility to each other\u2019s hearts and bodies. But whether we are doing a duet or making dinner, that sense of vulnerability and nurturing each other makes me feel love. True love. Piran Scott and Naiara de Matos appear in the Sydney Dance Company\u2019s production of Momenta at the Arts Centre Melbourne, 8-12 October.",

Droving became my life</p> <footer> <cite>Bill Little</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Little, 67, has been droving for 40 years. \u201cWhen I was 26, I had cattle near Blackall [960km north-west of Brisbane] and it got dry, so I took them for a walk and I took other people\u2019s cattle to make it pay,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He has not stopped walking.</p>    <p>Stock routes in Queensland cover 72,000km but they spider across the country, having formed with Australia\u2019s pastoral expansion. The Canning stock route in Western Australia, where Indigenous stockmen outnumbered their white counterparts, was renowned as the world\u2019s longest; the Murranji as one of the most deadly, with poisonous plants and scarce water.</p>    <p>The stock routes birthed legends. In 1879 Patrick and Michael Durack, of <a href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9445010\">Kings in Grass Castles</a> fame, moved 7,250 cattle from Thylungra in Queensland to the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Two years later Nat Buchanan became famous for his record-breaking feat of droving 20,000 cattle 3,200km from southern Queensland to Glencore station in the Northern Territory.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/14/sign-up-for-rural-network-guardian-australia-email-newsletter-about-regional-affairs?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul>    <ul> <li><p>Little, on his motorbike, drives the cattle west towards a new water site, which is established every few hours.</p></li> </ul> <p>Little is the modern-day Buchanan. In 2013 he oversaw the Brinkworth drive, taking 20,000 cattle owned by South Australian pastoralist Tom Brinkworth from western Queensland to southern NSW, separating them into smaller mobs and employing contract drovers to assist. His favourite route is from Julia Creek to Roma in Queensland, where the feed is reliable and the route wide.</p> <p>Droving began to fade from the Australian psyche in the 1950s as road transport became dominant. Then, Little says,\u201cpeople realised the stock routes were still a valuable source of feed and graziers began using them as part of their management plan\u201d. That led to a droving renaissance in the 1980s.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Life is simple out here.

      "bodyText": "It is 5am and a near-full moon is dropping to the western horizon; the land is dark and quiet. A generator rattles to life and artificial lights pierce the night. From horse floats and trucks emerge stockmen and women, snuggling into coats, collars raised against the settling frost. The predawn light rolls in, revealing grasslands, scattered trees and penned steers. Steaming coffee is downed as horses are caught and saddled. More horses are released from a makeshift yard and they wander away slowly, pausing to pick at fresh grass. Dogs bark in anticipation. Kodee Judge, 17, collects the horses at sunrise ahead of a 12-hour day on horseback. The sun breaches the east; it is time to release the cattle. An electric fence is dropped and 2,000 steers make their way down a 100m-wide fenced corridor, with a sealed road down its centre. This is the long paddock, and this is Bill Little\u2019s droving team, south of Roma, 475km west of Brisbane, in central Queensland. Droving is the art of moving large mobs of livestock along stock routes, which are lands gazetted by state governments and administrated by local councils. For $0.30 a head each week, Little is granted permission to move his herd, which belongs to a company, a minimum of 8km a day between sunrise and sunset. Little sitting in the kitchen of his trailer, which travels with them for the four-month duration. Little, 67, has been droving for 40 years. \u201cWhen I was 26, I had cattle near Blackall [960km north-west of Brisbane] and it got dry, so I took them for a walk and I took other people\u2019s cattle to make it pay,\u201d he says. He has not stopped walking. Stock routes in Queensland cover 72,000km but they spider across the country, having formed with Australia\u2019s pastoral expansion. The Canning stock route in Western Australia, where Indigenous stockmen outnumbered their white counterparts, was renowned as the world\u2019s longest; the Murranji as one of the most deadly, with poisonous plants and scarce water. The stock routes birthed legends. In 1879 Patrick and Michael Durack, of Kings in Grass Castles fame, moved 7,250 cattle from Thylungra in Queensland to the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Two years later Nat Buchanan became famous for his record-breaking feat of droving 20,000 cattle 3,200km from southern Queensland to Glencore station in the Northern Territory. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Little, on his motorbike, drives the cattle west towards a new water site, which is established every few hours. Little is the modern-day Buchanan. In 2013 he oversaw the Brinkworth drive, taking 20,000 cattle owned by South Australian pastoralist Tom Brinkworth from western Queensland to southern NSW, separating them into smaller mobs and employing contract drovers to assist. His favourite route is from Julia Creek to Roma in Queensland, where the feed is reliable and the route wide. Droving began to fade from the Australian psyche in the 1950s as road transport became dominant. Then, Little says,\u201cpeople realised the stock routes were still a valuable source of feed and graziers began using them as part of their management plan\u201d. That led to a droving renaissance in the 1980s. Kodee Judge with her horse, Walter. Walter became lame after a week of droving and ended up returning home. Injuries on long droves are inevitable, for the horse and the cattle. These cattle, for example, will be on the road for four months and will then return home where a fodder crop will be waiting for them. Droving remains an integral part of Australian agriculture and is attracting a new generation. Bill has experience on his team with Gene McAuliffe (53) and Dayle Little (60) \u2013 no relation to Bill \uff0d but also employs horse-loving teenagers Riley Swanson (19), Kodee Judge (17) and Kate Staub (16). Swanson grew up in urban areas and has no family connection to agriculture. \u201cIn Brisbane I enjoyed watching westerns with my Nanny and that first gave me the idea; droving became something I wanted to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI love John Wayne.\u201d He has the look down pat: leather belt slung low over his hips, wide-brimmed hat, stockwhip casually draped across his shoulder and a packet of tobacco in his shirt pocket. Astride a two-year-old, freshly broke quarter horse, he stops to roll a smoke. \u201cLife is simple out here. It\u2019s just you and your horse looking after cattle,\u201d Swanson says. \u201cThere\u2019s no stress and you\u2019re only thinking about the next watering point. It\u2019s beautiful country and it\u2019s good to see it from the back of a horse.\u201d Staub left school at 15 and is a week into her first droving job. \u201cI saw the job advertised on Facebook and thought it would be a good experience because Bill is well known as one of the best horsemen,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s go, go, go and other times it is quiet and steady, but I\u2019d hate to be trapped in an office.\u201d Gene McAuliffe has been droving on and off for over 30 years. By 9.30am the cattle are quietly grazing or making their way to the water truck and the girls break for breakfast, swatting at flies as they rest with their horses beneath the shade of a cypress pine. They value every minute of sleep. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to work out whether you want a comfy sleep in pyjamas or to piss Bill off by being late if you take extra time to change, so I usually sleep in my work clothes,\u201d Judge says. \u201cI lost my phone in the first week, but if people really want to know I\u2019m alive they\u2019ll come and find me.\u201d Little, who is often found on a motorbike these days as age encroaches, watches them closely. \u201cThese kids are used to partying all night and sleeping all day and I\u2019ve got to turn their life around,\u201d he says. \u201cI call it two-week-itis \u2013 after two weeks the gloss has worn off, their bums are [saddle] sore and they\u2019re missing home. That\u2019s when they work out if they really want to be here.\u201d Staub clocks out at two weeks, but Swanson and Judge remain.

And more generally than that, this feels a very crude lesson in capitalism; splurge enough cash and ultimately you will get away with it.",

In the morning, it\u2019s often a few minutes before Cathie acknowledges me, such is her focus on the dog. I savour every moment.</p> <p>Cathie exhibited none of the risk factors for Alzheimer\u2019s. She had an excellent diet; an active social life; was very fit \u2013 only a few years ago we cycled from Marseille to Norway. We regularly spent months cycling in foreign lands. I\u2019m grateful now that we didn\u2019t wait until retirement to travel. Cathie still wants to see the world, still wants to explore exotic tastes and meet new people.</p> <p>Everyone reacted differently when we told them the diagnosis. Most people have been supportive, aware that regular social events are our lifeblood. Cathie lunches with friends, volunteers at the local Salvos, takes bellydance classes on Friday as a student, even though she taught it for 20 years. We have more dinner party invitations than at any time in our lives.</p> <p>Alzheimer\u2019s is not the loss of memory. A relative, on hearing Cathie\u2019s diagnosis, suggested she might have it as well because she sometimes forgets things. I sucked in a deep breath before explaining that Alzheimer\u2019s attacks more than memory. Yes, Cathie forget things. But it\u2019s the unexpected stuff that hurts. Cathie\u2019s language skills have changed dramatically. We don\u2019t care that she can\u2019t say hippopotamus, but she now rarely speaks in sentences, or can find the accurate word, or pronounce a range of simple and not-so-simple words. My worst fear is that she\u2019ll stop trying to verbalise.</p> <p>I\u2019m learning to never ask \u201ceither-or\u201d questions. Beach? Or bushwalk? Cathie will look confused for a few seconds, smile gently and say yes. I\u2019m always humbled at how often she says yes. She\u2019s up for anything, as long as Biscuit can accompany us.</p> <p>Cathie prefers colourful dresses and tops, where previously she favoured what she called the \u201cGreek grandmother look\u2019\u201d of black on black. While I cook most evenings, she\u2019s determined to keep trying. We joke whether the result will be of her usual delicious standard or a \u201cMrs Cropley\u201d.</p> <p>I hate visiting the neurology department of our hospital. They are sensitive and kind and professional, and I watch them measuring Cathie\u2019s changes. We use the word \u201cchanges\u201d. It sounds better than \u201closses\u201d. Last visit they offered Cathie a higher dose of an antidepressant, because despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/24/alzheimers-breakthrough-drugs-medicine-donanemab-aducanumab-lecanemab\">the headlines </a>of \u201cmajor Alzheimer\u2019s breakthrough\u201d, there\u2019s little the doctors can do than this, and to monitor the losses. Sorry, the changes.</p> <p>I\u2019ve made my living as a writer for 40 years. Since Cathie\u2019s diagnosis, I haven\u2019t been able to face a new manuscript. Writing a book is more than sitting at a desk each morning. It\u2019s living with the characters while walking the dog, or cycling, or doing the shopping. The emotional energy of creating \u2026 I\u2019d rather spend it with Cathie and Biscuit.</p> <p>Every day I detest Alzheimer\u2019s and what\u2019s it\u2019s doing to the person I love. And every day I\u2019m in awe of how Cathie responds to its ravages. Quietly, stoically, with patience, and sometimes tears, before hugging Biscuit and me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/30/we-encouraged-my-aunt-with-alzheimers-to-move-into-aged-care-but-what-good-is-a-safe-life-if-its-not-the-life-you-wish-to-live\">We encouraged my aunt with Alzheimer\u2019s to move into aged care.

Cathie lunches with friends, volunteers at the local Salvos, takes bellydance classes on Friday as a student, even though she taught it for 20 years. We have more dinner party invitations than at any time in our lives. Alzheimer\u2019s is not the loss of memory. A relative, on hearing Cathie\u2019s diagnosis, suggested she might have it as well because she sometimes forgets things. I sucked in a deep breath before explaining that Alzheimer\u2019s attacks more than memory. Yes, Cathie forget things. But it\u2019s the unexpected stuff that hurts. Cathie\u2019s language skills have changed dramatically. We don\u2019t care that she can\u2019t say hippopotamus, but she now rarely speaks in sentences, or can find the accurate word, or pronounce a range of simple and not-so-simple words. My worst fear is that she\u2019ll stop trying to verbalise. I\u2019m learning to never ask \u201ceither-or\u201d questions. Beach? Or bushwalk? Cathie will look confused for a few seconds, smile gently and say yes. I\u2019m always humbled at how often she says yes. She\u2019s up for anything, as long as Biscuit can accompany us. Cathie prefers colourful dresses and tops, where previously she favoured what she called the \u201cGreek grandmother look\u2019\u201d of black on black. While I cook most evenings, she\u2019s determined to keep trying. We joke whether the result will be of her usual delicious standard or a \u201cMrs Cropley\u201d. I hate visiting the neurology department of our hospital. They are sensitive and kind and professional, and I watch them measuring Cathie\u2019s changes. We use the word \u201cchanges\u201d. It sounds better than \u201closses\u201d. Last visit they offered Cathie a higher dose of an antidepressant, because despite the headlines of \u201cmajor Alzheimer\u2019s breakthrough\u201d, there\u2019s little the doctors can do than this, and to monitor the losses. Sorry, the changes. I\u2019ve made my living as a writer for 40 years. Since Cathie\u2019s diagnosis, I haven\u2019t been able to face a new manuscript. Writing a book is more than sitting at a desk each morning. It\u2019s living with the characters while walking the dog, or cycling, or doing the shopping. The emotional energy of creating \u2026 I\u2019d rather spend it with Cathie and Biscuit. Every day I detest Alzheimer\u2019s and what\u2019s it\u2019s doing to the person I love. And every day I\u2019m in awe of how Cathie responds to its ravages. Quietly, stoically, with patience, and sometimes tears, before hugging Biscuit and me. She kisses my bald head when we sit on the lounge. She never did that before the diagnosis. I know what the disease is taking, but Cathie responds with gestures such as this. When we visit our youngest son and daughter-in-law, she washes the dishes piled on the bench, or helps Joe cook, or chats to Rose about clothes and travel. I know there will come a time when Cathie no longer recognises me, or Joe, or Rose. Or our eldest son Jack and his wife Emma. Or, shudder, our precious grandson, Billy. She\u2019ll sit in a chair staring out the window, at a world shrunken and frail, Biscuit asleep on her lap. For now, I smile whenever possible. We live one moment at a time, and marvel at the accuracy of cliches. I prefer today rather than tomorrow. \u2022 Steven Herrick is the author of 28 books for children and young adults.

      "bodyText": "Thank you very much for joining me. Here is Andy Hunter\u2019s report from Goodison Park. Jordan Pickford: \u201cWe know playing against Newcastle is tough. We grafted and we\u2019re at our best, but we were resilient. We can show more quality going forward. To get a point and not lose is important. \u201cI watched the game against City and fancied him going to the keeper\u2019s left and it\u2019s come off my knee. He did not execute it perfectly. \u201cHe tried to double bluff and I got the better of him. \u201cHe asked me why I went that way and I told him because he\u2019d gone right with the past two.\u201d Pickford and Garner were really good for Everton. Not really much else to discuss from Everton. Chris Paraskevas emails: \u201cWhen the Premier League broke away from humanity in the early 90s do you think they envisaged a late Saturday / Daylight Savings kick off three decades later that so devoid of quality that it might have cured my insomnia? \u201cFeels like two points dropped because of Gordon\u2019s bad day at the office, but I think that might have just masked some familiar failings on the road: Newcastle didn\u2019t ask enough questions of a team low on confidence, didn\u2019t work Pickford anywhere near enough. They got what theh deserved and things could have been so much worse. \u201cWhere\u2019s Paul Mitchell at? Hopefully searching for a striker, assuming signing players is still allowed these days.\u201d I don\u2019t think they will be selling the VHS in either club shop. Newcastle will be left to rue the Gordon penalty miss and the fact they did not have a proper striker to finish all the chances they created. Everton will be very pleased to have a point. 90+3 mins: Calvert-Lewin is taken down by Schar around 35 yards from goal, earning the Swiss defender a booking. 90+2 mins: Everton have a chance to break but McNeil loses the ball before the counter gets going. 90 mins: Joelinton takes aim from around 25 yards but it foes nowhere near the net. Four minutes added on. 88 mins: Tarkowski beats Joelinton to the ball on the right but then loses possession and the Brazilian sweeps in, only for the referee to give Everton a free-kick. 87 mins: Another chance for Newcastle as Almiron gets the ball in the box but his poked finish is very weak. What a fully fit striker would have done for Newcastle today. 86 mins: Willock tries to get the better of Garner but, once again, the full-back does very well to stop him. Are Everton holding on here? John Davis says: \u201cI thought it was a nailed on pen at first, but on replay Burn is running straight towards the ball and makes no attempt to impede DCL (for ease of typing). Burn gets kicked as he tries to shoot. Probably not a pen. What ever the ref sees gets given. I reckon it\u2019s probably right.\u201d 84 mins: Ndiaye does well on the right and lifts a cross to the back post; it just goes over Doucoure, which puts off McNeil who completely misskicks a volley. Hall is booked for taking down Ndiaye. Ross O\u2019Connor emails: \u201cWith all the non-penalty kerfuffle nobody seems to have noticed that Gana Gueye should have buried the follow-up. Glaring miss.\u201d It was a bad miss. 82 mins: WHAT A CHANCE! Gordon just stays onside to reach a neat Almiron pass, he is one-on-one with Pickford but whacks his shot over from close range. Should Everton send on Lindstrom and Beto to liven things up? They look out of ideas in the final third. 80 mins: Fair play to Garner, he has really stuck at it as a right-back. The sort of player you want in your squad. Andy Flintoff emails about the penalty: \u201cDefenders get away with a lot if an attacker is shooting, but this was an exception - an early challenge rather than the late ones which normally go unpunished.\u201d I am sure Dyche will have strong views. 78 mins: Newcastle win their 10th corner of the match. Calvert-Lewin wins it at the front post and Gueye takes it clear. 76 mins: Garner wins the ball inside his own area and whacks it up the pitch \u2026 straight to Pope. 74 mins: Iroegbunam has slotted in alongside Gueye and Doucoure has moved into his \u2018No 10\u2019 gig. 72 mins: Everton fail to clear a cross allowing Almiron to shoot from inside the box but it hits the sidenetting. More Newcastle changes: Trippier and Tonali off, Longstaff and Livramento on. 70 mins: The upside to the non-penalty is that the crowd are once again enraged and Everton are starting to up the tempo. Trippier\u2019s sat on the floor and he is heading off. Subs: Harrison off, Iroegbunam on. Willock replaces Murphy for Newcastle. 68 mins: It\u2019s all going off! Calvert-Lewin gets the wrong side of the defence and shoots from eight yards but Pope saves, the striker goes for the rebound but goes down under a challenge from Burn. Gueye fires over. VAR checks for a penalty. It looks like a pen to me but the bods say no. He kicks the back of Burn\u2019s leg but if he is preventing a shot, then he is impeding him. 66 mins: Almiron is found by Trippier inside the box, he sends the ball across goal and Pickford is forced to turn it behind. Tonali flicks a volley from the corner but it is blocked and Everton clear. 64 mins: There is very little quality in possession from either team at the moment. This game has become scrappy. 62 mins: Pickford whacks a free-kick from just inside the Everton half straight out for a throw. Not the best. Almiron is on for Newcastle, Barnes off. 61 mins: Gueye whacks a shot over from 18 yards, I think it ended in the second tier. 59 mins: Gordon is booed as he goes down the left. It looks like Barnes is down the middle at the moment. 57 mins: Gordon and Joelinton combine on the left and the ball is worked back to Guimaraes but he digs out a shot from underneath him and sends it well over. 55 mins: McNeil does his best to wake up the Everton fans by pinging a shot from 30 yards but it flies well wide. A stat pops up to show that as the first Everton chance since the Newcastle missed penalty. Bleak. Everton are bringing on Gueye for Mangala. 53 mins: Ndiaye dribbles around 40 yards up the pitch but is then easily tackled by Guimaraes. The Senegal international has been relatively quiet thus far. 51 mins: Joelinton gets the better of Mangala down the left, he drives into the box but his pullback is blocked by Tarkowski. Trippier takes the resulting corner which Everton just about survive after Pickford pushes the ball onto Joelinton. 49 mins: Gordon chips the ball to Joelinton at the back post, he lays it into the path of Tonali whose first-time shot from 12 yards is well blocked. Everything about Everton at the moment seems quite passive. 47 mins: Newcastle have started with a high tempo. Everton need to up it here or they could be in trouble. Here we go again! K\u00e1ri Tulinius says: \u201cBoth Everton and Newcastle are much more comfortable playing on the back foot, and since neither team has felt the need to get proactive, the match has felt very tentative. I hope that one of the teams will go for it, but suspect that both sides fear that committing men forward will mean getting done on the break.\u201d \u201cWe used to have a rule for penalties playing on the streets of Newcastle \u201cNae blasters\u201d, and it\u2019s good that Anthony Gordon is following that tradition,\u201d says Brian Robson. Half-time reading. I would not say there has been a massive amount of quality but the disallowed goal and penalty save have brought plenty of entertainment. I would advise Everton improving after the break because they have brought little to the party. 45+6 mins: A lovely cross finds Gordon unmarked in the six-yard box but instead of heading for goal, he knocks it down for Joelinton who sends his effort over. 45+4 mins: Joelinton dribbles towards the edge of the box and goes down under pressure but it is certainly not a free-kick. Everton look happy to get to the break with the score goalless. Newcastle have had almost 90% in the past 10 minutes. 45+2 mins: Ndiaye does well to win the ball in his own defence third but then tries to dribble it up the pitch and loses possession. Gordon receives it in the box but is outnumbered and Tarkowski eventually whacks clear to end the attack. 45 mins: Six minutes added on. Cheers VAR. 44 mins: Another way to get the Everton fans going is to foul Gordon. Keane is the latest man to do it and everyone in blue moans at the referee. McNeil is booked for a crude challenge on Guimaraes. 42 mins: Everton survive another corner as Pickford punches clear and Tarkowski does not wrestle anyone to the ground. 40 mins: Newcastle have, overall, been the better team here but have not looked like scoring from open play. They could do with an actual striker. 38 mins: The disallowed goal and penalty save has riled up the Everton fans. It might help give the hosts an extra edge. 36 mins: Goodison erupted when Pickford saved it. Tarkowski will be very very relieved. Everton then survive a couple of corners as they look to find calm. 35 mins: Pickford dives to his left to repel former Toffee Gordon. 33 mins: PENALTY! I have no idea what Tarkowski was doing \u2013 there was no threat. Pawson awards it after looking at the screen. 32 mins: There is a penalty check for Tarkowski chucking Tonali to the ground. It is very much a foul and incredibly pointless from the Everton skipper. Pawson wanders to the screen. 30 mins: Barnes has a lot of space on the left and he is able to chip the ball to the back post. Young heads it behind for a corner, which concludes with Murphy curling a shot wide from the edge of the box. 28 mins: Gordon does well again, this time on the right and he crosses into a dangerous area but Everton scramble clear. One problem for Newcastle is there is not a central striker to finish those sorts of chances. 26 mins: Tarkowski chips the ball forward to Calvert-Lewin who chests it down on the edge of the box but he is forced backwards. 24 mins: A bit of a delay while the medics see to Garner who does get up and wanders off to the side. Looks like he took a knock to the head but seems fine. 22 mins: Gordon breezes past Doucoure in the box and moves into space but his pull-back is a poor one and Mangala intercepts. A mildly bizarre moment as Barnes and Garner clash. Both end up on the ground and wait for a foul to be given but Craig Pawson does not think an offence has been committed and eventually Barnes gets up to dribble forward. Garner waits on the ground and requires treatment. 20 mins: What a deflating moment for Goodison Park. They were in raptures until the intervention of the lads at Stockley Park. Will it be extra-motivation or bring frustration? Garner whips in the cross and Doucoure wins the header, sending it over Pope but VAR sees he is half a yard offside. The midfielder flicks home the opener. 17 mins: Murphy fails to control a cross from the left when in a good position but then gets another go but his low shot is easy for Pickford. \u201cWhat a pity Newcastle\u2019s famous black/white kit clashed with Everton\u2019s that it forced them into wear the colours of Saudi Arabia,\u201d says Gary. Very much a non-existent clash. 16 mins: Calvert-Lewin receives a long pass around 25 yards from goal. He drives at the Newcastle centre-backs and shoots from the edge of the box but it is straight at Pope. 14 mins: Gordon spins inside the Everton half but is clipped. He gets up holding his hamstring but I assume it\u2019s just an impact injury. 12 mins: It should also be said that on the previous set-piece Young was marking Burn, which sounds like a bad idea. 10 mins: OFF THE LINE! A Newcastle corner is flicked to the back post where Guimaraes is waiting. His volley beats Pickford but Ndiaye somehow blocks the shot on the line. 9 mins: Calvert-Lewin collects a long ball, takes a couple of touches and shoots wide but is then penalised for a high boot, which is a bit harsh considering Trippier is dipping his head down. 8 mins: Everton have a clear plan to be quite direct and take Newcastle by surprise with long balls out wide. 6 mins: Barnes gets the better of makeshift right-back Garner but his cross is blocked at the front post. There could be fun to be had for Newcastle wingers against Garner and Young. 4 mins: Pickford trots forward to take a free-kick from the halfway line. He lumps it into the box, Tarkowski wins the initial header but Pope comes out to punch clear. 2 mins: Tonali lifts the ball over Keane who takes him down inside the Newcastle half. There is, admittedly, next to no contact. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! The players are in the tunnel. Tarkowski gets a police escort before being greeted by former Burnley teammate Nick Pope. Arsenal had to come from behind against Southampton. \u201cStaying awake while Daylight Savings officially starts - literally as I type and send this email - means I am effectively losing an hour of sleep as the local clock passes 2:00am and becomes 3:00am,\u201d emails Chris Paraskevas. \u201cIn order to counter sleep deprivation I\u2019ve just had a second dinner (slightly undercooked cheeseburger) to \u2018keep the motor going\u2019. I just hope the players are as dedicated as I am to the cause. \u201cOur inconsistency collectively and individually this season has been infuriating: more than capable at our best and probably the competition\u2019s most tedious at our worst. \u201cTime for Anthony Gordon to properly kick start his season with a star performance. (sorry, Mary Waltz!)\u201d I am sure this energetic fixture will focus the mind. Leicester are up and running. Pass the time by reading my work from this week. Mary Waltz emails: \u201cGreetings Will. Now that we are out of the relegation position I have decided to abandon my normal pessimism and dream of the coming sunlit uplands. New owner, new stadium coming, sure we are only a point out of the dumpster and injuries have taken out our promising youngster for today\u2019s tussle with Newcastle I am going embrace a positive attitude (or denial if you want to get all technical about it.) \u201c Anthony Gordon is back at Goodison Park. It is a blow that Branthwaite is missing once more after recently returning from injury. The Everton defence is miles better with him next to Tarkowski. Pre-match reading. Isak is missing again for Newcastle, leaving Gordon to lead the line. He will quite fancy upsetting his former employers, I am sure. Everton (4-2-3-1): Pickford; Garner, Keane, Tarkowski, Young; Mangala, Doucoure; Harrison, McNeil, Ndiaye; Calvert-Lewin Subs: Virginia, Begovic, Beto, O\u2019Brien, Gueye, Lindstrom, Iroegbunam, Armstrong, Dixon Newcastle (4-3-3): Pope; Trippier, Schar, Burn, Hall; Guimaraes, Tonali, Joelinton; Murphy, Gordon, Barnes Subs: Odysseas, Ruddy, Krafth, Osula, Livramento, Almiron, Kelly, Willock, Longstaff There is some positivity back at Goodison Park after securing their first Premier League win over the season last time out.

      "body": "<p>The cloud that Anthony Gordon left Goodison Park under has not lifted. A prominent role for the Newcastle forward was inevitable on his return to Everton but being denied from the penalty spot and missing several chances to silence the jeers was not how he envisaged the script.

      "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola denied he has any concerns about Manchester City\u2019s defence after they conceded the first goal in their 3-2 win against Fulham, after doing so earlier in the season in the victories over Ipswich and Brentford. Andreas Pereira scored the opener for Marco Silva\u2019s side in the 26th minute. Against Ipswich in August Sam Szmodics did the same after seven minutes and Yoane Wissa for the Bees inside a minute at the Etihad last month. Guardiola was asked if this is a cause for worry. \u201cI would say except Wissa against Brentford, in the other ones we were playing good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not nice to come back from 0-1 but we created chances today to go 1-0 and 2-0.\u201d Pereira\u2019s goal came courtesy of Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s impressive backheeled volley. \u201cSometimes I give credit. The first goal \u2013 why don\u2019t we give credit to them rather than [be critical] defensively?\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cThere are actions we can defend better but step by step we will improve.\u201d Mateo Kovacic scored for City in each half, with J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku\u2019s 82nd-minute strike proving decisive, given Rodrigo Muniz\u2019s late goal. Guardiola praised Kovacic, who played in the No 6 role vacated by the injured Rodri. His three goals this term match his total for last season. \u201cI\u2019m very happy he scored two goals, he\u2019s not a guy to score [usually] those goals,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe started really well with two chances in two minutes and they switched immediately to five at the back.

This is known as a tronc \u2013 from the French <em>tronc des pauvres</em>, or poor box \u2013 where tips are pooled and shared out by a troncmaster.</p>    <p>Whiting is happy with his tips at Prosecco Caff\u00e8, but his previous employers have not been so enlightened. At one restaurant, the operations manager and the owner \u201cused to take all the service charge\u201d, he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not in the building. We\u2019re on the floor, we\u2019re running, we\u2019re cleaning, we\u2019re there until midnight.\u201d</p> <p>Cash tips are different, he said. Some places put it in a jar and split the cash. At others, servers keep it themselves. </p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s your prerogative,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople might think you\u2019re a little bitch for keeping it but it\u2019s your business. A lot of the time, people do tip you and say \u2018this is for you \u2013 thank you for looking after us\u2019. Cash is a free-for-all.\u201d</p> <p>Next door at Bistro 1, owner Tuncay Kurnaz offers diners a two-course mediterranean meal for \u00a319.90 and feels that the service charge helps him keep prices low.</p> <p>\u201cCash tips are always given to the staff,\u201d he said. \u201cService charge is for complimentary bread, olives, plus all the breakages \u2013 your glasses, cutlery. Lighting, heating, cooling.\u201d</p> <p>That has all changed with the new legislation, but Kurnaz is confused over what the rules mean for his restaurant. \u201cThere\u2019s no clear guideline,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to give it to the staff. But how are you going to distinguish the VAT?\u201d</p> <p>How will he account for employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 national insurance contributions, and income tax, he asks.</p> <p>Other restaurant chains have been trying to shore up this income stream in other ways. Last year. Ping Pong, a dim sum chain, scrapped service charges and introduced what it called an optional \u201cbrand charge\u201d instead.</p> <p>Miller &amp; Carter, a steakhouse chain, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/01/uk-unions-fear-not-all-staff-fair-share-tip-sharing-law\">in dispute</a> with workers over its policy of making servers pay 2% to 3% of sales into the tronc, about \u00a360 to \u00a390 per shift, according to Unite.</p> <p>Waiting staff say this is unfair since not all of those sales result in tips, so they can end up making a loss, and the policy is designed to use servers\u2019 tips to shore up wages for chefs. Mitchells &amp; Butlers, which owns the chain, said its teams could agree \u201cthrough a democratic and transparent process\u201d how tips were distributed.</p>",

This is known as a tronc \u2013 from the French tronc des pauvres, or poor box \u2013 where tips are pooled and shared out by a troncmaster. Whiting is happy with his tips at Prosecco Caff\u00e8, but his previous employers have not been so enlightened. At one restaurant, the operations manager and the owner \u201cused to take all the service charge\u201d, he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not in the building. We\u2019re on the floor, we\u2019re running, we\u2019re cleaning, we\u2019re there until midnight.\u201d Cash tips are different, he said. Some places put it in a jar and split the cash. At others, servers keep it themselves. \u201cI think it\u2019s your prerogative,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople might think you\u2019re a little bitch for keeping it but it\u2019s your business. A lot of the time, people do tip you and say \u2018this is for you \u2013 thank you for looking after us\u2019. Cash is a free-for-all.\u201d Next door at Bistro 1, owner Tuncay Kurnaz offers diners a two-course mediterranean meal for \u00a319.90 and feels that the service charge helps him keep prices low. \u201cCash tips are always given to the staff,\u201d he said. \u201cService charge is for complimentary bread, olives, plus all the breakages \u2013 your glasses, cutlery. Lighting, heating, cooling.\u201d That has all changed with the new legislation, but Kurnaz is confused over what the rules mean for his restaurant. \u201cThere\u2019s no clear guideline,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to give it to the staff. But how are you going to distinguish the VAT?\u201d How will he account for employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 national insurance contributions, and income tax, he asks. Other restaurant chains have been trying to shore up this income stream in other ways. Last year. Ping Pong, a dim sum chain, scrapped service charges and introduced what it called an optional \u201cbrand charge\u201d instead. Miller &amp; Carter, a steakhouse chain, is in dispute with workers over its policy of making servers pay 2% to 3% of sales into the tronc, about \u00a360 to \u00a390 per shift, according to Unite. Waiting staff say this is unfair since not all of those sales result in tips, so they can end up making a loss, and the policy is designed to use servers\u2019 tips to shore up wages for chefs. Mitchells &amp; Butlers, which owns the chain, said its teams could agree \u201cthrough a democratic and transparent process\u201d how tips were distributed.",

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer faces a new row in the freebies scandal as it is revealed the Premier League and top clubs handed giveaways worth more than \u00a3100,000 to MPs, including the prime minister and nine serving cabinet ministers, during the battle over a new football regulator. Premier League officials organised a spree of giveaways as they warned proposals for a tough watchdog might weaken the appeal of football in the UK. MPs were treated to hospitality at games, invitations to the Brit awards and Taylor Swift concert tickets. Analysis by the Observer reveals more than a third of the new cabinet and at least 60 MPs, including 41 from Labour, have benefited from the largesse of the Premier League and its football clubs in the past three years. Hospitality and tickets were worth up to \u00a34,000 for individual events. Clive Betts, the Labour MP and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on football, said the giveaways were \u201cclearly part of a campaign\u201d. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think they can influence the regulator being set up, but they can influence what powers it has.\u201d Labour now faces a battle over its plans to beef up the financial powers of the proposed watchdog after the Tory government\u2019s football governance bill ran out of parliamentary time because of the election. Premier League bosses are lobbying to water down its powers. The proposal for a new regulator was made in 2021 after a review of football governance by the former sports minister Tracey Crouch. A watchdog would have powers to demand real-time financial information from clubs and scrutinise owners\u2019 finances. The following year, the Premier League and its clubs, which oppose the plans, provided MPs with giveaways worth more than \u00a311,500 in 2022, rising to at least \u00a328,000 in 2023 and in excess of \u00a368,000 in the first nine months of 2024. This compares with giveaways to MPs from the Premier League and its clubs worth less than \u00a35,500 in 2018, an Observer analysis of the MPs\u2019 register of interests has revealed. All the benefits were correctly disclosed on the parliamentary register of interests. In February last year, on the day a white paper was published outlining plans for a powerful new regulator, Jonathan Reynolds, now the business secretary, accepted two tickets and hospitality worth \u00a31,000 from the Premier League for the Europa League match between Manchester United and Barcelona at Old Trafford. Reynolds said last month he had \u201cno problem\u201d with MPs accepting hospitality, saying it was \u201calways going to be the case people in public life are invited to certain events\u201d. Starmer and six other cabinet ministers have also accepted free match tickets either from the Premier League or its clubs during the lobbying campaign. While MPs debated the football governance bill earlier this year, the Premier League provided MPs with courtesy tickets to events unrelated to football worth thousands of pounds. In 2024, the Premier League gave five MPs tickets to the Brit awards and gave six Labour MPs, including Starmer, tickets to see Swift\u2019s Eras tour worth \u00a314,830. The MPs who attended the Brit awards in March were Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister a key Starmer ally; Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary; Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology; and Rupa Huq, then a member of the culture media and sport committee. Also in attendance was Jake Richards, who was elected a Labour MP on 4 July. The total value of the tickets was \u00a38,500. On the eve of a Commons debate on the football governance bill in April, the Premier League held a parliamentary reception with drinks and canapes. Richard Masters, the Premier League\u2019s chief executive, warned the assembled MPs and peers that \u201cwe are taking a big risk with a very successful industry\u201d. One key battleground will be whether the government gives the regulator power over the Premier League\u2019s parachute payments for relegated clubs. Many MPs support a proposal to include these payments in the regulator\u2019s powers to intervene in how Premier League funds are redistributed to other clubs, but this is fiercely opposed by Premier League bosses. Speaking to the Observer, former sports minister Crouch said she expected a new football governance bill to be passed by parliament which would allay any concerns over lobbying. She said: \u201cThere would be fan uproar if the prime minister and his team did a U-turn on their promise for a regulator.\u201d The Labour MP Huq said she had accepted an invitation to the Brit awards and had been shocked afterwards when told of the value in order to disclose it on her register of interests. She said: \u201cIt seems odd in the feverish run-up to increased football regulation that the Premier League are offering tickets outside their usual remit of football.\u201d Martin Bell, the former broadcast war reporter and independent MP, said: \u201cLobbying is part of politics, but it becomes suspect when money changes hands or there are benefits in kind. These have to be declared, but I think it\u2019s unwise to accept them. MPs must look to their own constituents and what they will think of their conduct.\u201d A Labour source said laws introducing a new regulator would be passed. \u201cWe are regulating the industry and hospitality doesn\u2019t change that,\u201d said the source. Starmer has vowed to overhaul the rules on accepting gifts, and has already paid back \u00a36,000 of gifts and hospitality, including the value of Swift concert tickets funded by the Premier League. A Premier League spokesperson said: \u201cThe Premier League runs a programme of stakeholder engagement with a broad range of individuals including MPs and officials. Like all industries, including many football organisations, this is normal practice.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Supporters of an assisted dying law in England and Wales are battling to stop the issue from splitting along party political lines after all four Tory leadership candidates suggested they would vote against the historic change. An all-important House of Commons vote on the issue could now be just weeks away after it was revealed that Labour MP Kim Leadbeater would be introducing a private member\u2019s bill that would give some terminally ill adults the option of being helped to end their lives. During the Tory party conference last week, leadership contenders Robert Jenrick, Kemi Badenoch, Tom Tugendhat and James Cleverly all raised concerns about a change in the law. Jenrick said he had been in favour of assisted dying legislation but had recently changed his mind. Weeks of meetings, lobbying and engagement with MPs over the political conference season had meant that campaigners in favour of a law change were confident the issue would not become divided along party lines. They have already gained the support of some Conservatives, including shadow foreign secretary Andrew Mitchell. He said it was \u201ctime for choice\u201d, revealing that he had changed his opinion after witnessing what he described as the \u201ccruelty and suffering inflicted by the blanket ban\u201d. Lord Forsyth, the former Tory cabinet minister, changed his mind after witnessing his father\u2019s death in 2020. Former chancellor George Osborne and former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson also support a change. A major operation will now take place inside parliament by both sides of the debate to persuade colleagues to back their cause. Kit Malthouse, the former Tory cabinet minister and leading advocate for an assisted dying law, is inviting colleagues to talk through any questions and concerns. While party leaders have made clear that MPs will have a free vote on the issue and there is no formal whipping operation, numbers are already being collated by both sides. Parliamentary meetings will intensify when details of the bill are announced later this month. Keir Starmer has said he supports a change, though some of his cabinet \u2013 including health secretary Wes Streeting \u2013 say they continue to have concerns. While supporters are confident that they have a much better chance of securing a majority in favour of a new law than in 2015, when the idea was comprehensively defeated, they recall a late surge of opposition ahead of that vote as some MPs became fearful of making the change. This time, wavering MPs are being presented with three main arguments for supporting the introduction of assisted dying. They are told that the status quo is a \u201chorror show\u201d in which some people feel they have to leave their families to travel abroad for help ending their lives, feel compelled to end their lives in other ways or suffer horrible deaths. MP are also being informed that while palliative care should be improved, there are some conditions that even the highest standards of care cannot combat. Finally, a law change is being presented as a win for autonomy and compassion, as expressed by broadcaster Esther Rantzen, who has said she would currently have to travel alone to Switzerland to end her life in the face of terminal cancer. \u201cThose MPs who either vote against or abstain have to recognise they are making a choice,\u201d said one Tory MP. \u201cThe status quo is a choice, and it\u2019s not a happy one.\u201d Safeguards will be crucial in securing the support of many waverers, but those opposed say these would be hard to enforce and that judging whether someone has less than six months to live is difficult in practice. Jenrick said at the Tory conference that he now has concerns about the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of an assisted dying law. Badenoch said she supported a change in principle but did not \u201ctrust any government or civil service to be able to deliver this\u201d. Tugendhat said last week that he was \u201cdeeply uncomfortable\u201d with assisted dying laws and that it was \u201cimmensely unlikely\u201d that he would support one in parliament. Cleverly voted against assisted dying in 2015 and has not changed his view.",

North of the capital, it meant building a high-speed line \u2013 HS2 \u2013 when an ordinarily fast line would do and leaving little spare cash for an upgrade of existing track on the much-neglected northern section of the rail network. Plans for new roads ignore how the tarmac is wearing thin and potholes are emerging almost everywhere else across the country. This is an argument for making what the UK has already constructed \u2013 whether that be a software network, a bridge or the provision of a school \u2013 fit for the 21st century before we start thinking about building new infrastructure. Software networks are slowing because the backbone of the UK\u2019s broadband network is weak and needs beefing up.

At Bristol\u2019s Festival of Economics gathering last week, Gavin Kelly said one of his biggest fears was that after a hiatus since the election, Labour would feel the need to grab at solutions to longstanding problems, leading to hastily constructed policies that would, after a short time, be found wanting. Kelly is a former No 10 policy adviser and chair of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, who from next year will head the Nuffield Foundation, one of the biggest funders of research in the UK. His concern is echoed in a paper for the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank that argues for more involvement from the public and a greater reliance on evidence \u2013 the kind produced by Nuffield. The academics who wrote the paper say the \u201cearly signs from Labour point to a commitment to ideas such as \u2018radical pragmatism\u2019 and a push towards stability before more ambitious change\u201d.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. Pretty comofrtable in the end for England but they\u2019ll know a much-improved show with the bat will be required as they progress. Keep an eye out for Raf\u2019s report. Thanks for keeping me company. Til next time. Finally, Heather Knight, England\u2019s captain, had this to say: It was really nice to get the win. Conditions were really tough out there, especially for batting and boundary hitting., Really pleasing to get the win. We weren\u2019t far off par but we\u2019ll be aiming for 135 if we play on that type of wicket again. It\u2019s what we prepared for but we need to find a way. it\u2019s not going to be beautiful and it\u2019s not going to be sexy all the time in these conditions, we\u2019ll have to graft a bit. It got lower and slower as it went on. We felt like Linsey [Smith] would be effective. It was a tricky decision but we feel it was the right one. Now from Bangladesh\u2019s skipper, Nigar Sultana Joty: We missed a good opportunity. Our bowlers did a great job for us, how they started in the powerplay and gained control. We needed a good partnership and not enough runs in the powerplay. We also gave our wickets away. Danni Wyatt-Hodge is the player of the match for her 41 in England\u2019s innings. It was really nice to get out there. Really delighted with the win in tough conditions. I thought we did really well to get the total. It was low and slow. I don\u2019t think conditions changed much. Every game is going to be really challenging so it\u2019s important we learn from tonight. England defend the lowest score in a T20 World Cup. And it was never in doubt. Brilliant bowling and fielding bailed out a difficult batting performance. The final over, delivered by Ecclestone, was bouncy and lively, but ended wicketless despite a close stumping call at the end. That means Fahima ends not-out on 5 with Rabeya on 2. 19th over: Bangladesh 91-7 (Fahima 1, Rabeya 0) A pair of twos to start the over but Dean had her wicket. Mostary had no choice but to throw the kitchen sink at it and perished in the fight. A straight ball, a swoosh across the line and a wicket falls! How many times have we seen this today? It\u2019s an umpire\u2019s call after a review that upholds the decision, but that felt out on first viewing. Mostary was on her haunches as she waited to learn her fate. It was a top knock but she needed a mate at the other end. 18th over: Bangladesh 87-6 (Mostary 40, Fahima 1) Mostary looks despondent. She\u2019s run out of partners and has too much left to do. Sciver-Brunt closes out with 1-20 from her four overs with this latest set costing just three singles. And another! You can\u2019t blame Ritu for having a go, but she lacks the ability and composure to land the telling blow. Another ugly swipe across the line ends with the rattle of stumps and the flashing of bails. 17th over: Bangladesh 83-5 (Mostary 38, Ritu 2) Smith signs off with 2-11 from her four overs, including a wicket maiden. A stat has just flashed on the screen that more than 67% of her deliveries would have gone on to hit the stumps. That\u2019s how it\u2019s done. And another good over, worth a wicket and just four singles, could be the one that confirms the result. Smith has another! It\u2019s a wild swipe from Taj who charged down the track and completely missed Smith\u2019s straight delivery, but full credit to the bowler. Smith is having a tremendous game. 16th over: Bangladesh 79-4 (Mostary 36, Taj 7) That\u2019s more like it! Mostary leans back and pulls Dean for a mighty six over square leg. A couple off a no-ball add three more to the total and a couple of singles add up to 12 from the over \u2013 which is above the asking rate. If they can follow that up in kind they\u2019ll have a sniff. 15th over: Bangladesh 67-4 (Mostary 26, Taj) If all the pitches play like this one, the team with the most powerful hitters will win all the marbles. There were some lovely shots in this Glenn over \u2013 Mostary\u2019s cut past point and Taj\u2019s inside out drive over cover \u2013 but both lacked the requisite punch to get them to the boundary. Instead they were worth two each. Three singles elsewhere means it\u2019s a decent haul, but nowhere near close enough to what\u2019s needed for victory. 14th over: Bangladesh 60-4 (Mostary 22, Taj 3) Sciver-Brunt returns and almost gets a wicket as Taj goes down the ground and just about clears a diving Gibson at mid-on. That bobbled away for two and there were three singles elsewhere. 13th over: Bangladesh 55-4 (Mostary 20, Taj 0) That required run-rate is now over 9. Clearly I judged England\u2019s batting performance too early. This is plainly a tricky wicket to bat on and England\u2019s bowlers are elite. Another good set from Glenn that cost just one run and picked up a wicket, brings England closer to victory. Things could fall apart here. Flat, straight and with little turn, Glenn beats Shorna who rocked back and swiped at it without real conviction. By the time she knew it was the slider, her stumps her broken. 12th over: Bangladesh 54-3 (Mostary 19, Shorna 0) An eventful over has Bangladesh\u2019s skipper run-out and England in firm control of this chase. It started with a misfield at point that cost four runs off Mostary\u2019s cutting blade, but with the required rate now above 8, it\u2019s hard to see how England lose it from here. OH NO! That is not what Bangladesh needed! Their skipper has been run-out. Excellent work from Smith who covered ground in a flash and unleashed a perfect throw. Jones had the bails off in a flash and suddenly Bangladesh\u2019s job looks a lot more challenging. 11th over: Bangladesh 45-2 (Mostary 14, Sultana 14) Really good from Smith. More of the same \u2013 flat, fizzing, wicket-to-wicket. They just can\u2019t get her away. A paddle gets a single and there are two more tucked into the leg side, but that will do England just fine. 10th over: Bangladesh 42-2 (Mostary 12, Sultana 13) Five off the over but the two batters are showing more hustle, running harder and looking for gaps. Dean is accurate and she won\u2019t mind runs coming in ones and twos. Game in the balance with England edging it. A few more overs without a wicket could make things interesting. 9th over: Bangladesh 37-2 (Mostary 8, Sultana 12) The skipper is leading by example. Sultana closes out Glenn\u2019s over by coming out her crease and unfurling a delicious lofted cover drive for four. Earlier she clobbered another boundary down the ground and showed innovation by shifting across her crease and plinking a single down to fine leg. 10 off the over. Much better from Bangladesh but they need a lot more. 8th over: Bangladesh 27-2 (Mostary 7, Sultana 3) Knight is keeping the pressure on with an attacking field. There\u2019s a slip in place and a tight ring of fielders. It means that if a gap is found there are runs to be had. Mostary flashes a drive and gets two through point, but there\u2019s only a single across the over to add to that. 7th over: Bangladesh Mostary 5, Sultana 2) It doesn\u2019t get any easier for Bangladesh as Glenn gets going. Her top-spinners are well placed and she concedes just four singles. The required rate has suddenly leaped to 7.3 an over. 6th over: Bangladesh 20-2 (Mostary 3, Sultana 0) Ecclestone joins the party and is unlucky not to grab a wicket. There\u2019s a missed stumping that Jones couldn\u2019t gather and a thick edge that evades the \u2018keeper\u2019s gloves and trickles away for two. 5th over: Bangladesh 17-2 (Mostary 0, Sultana 0) A wicket-maiden in the powerplay, that is quite something. Brilliant from Smith who has found a perfect groove, firing in low, fizzing darts that prove impossible to get away. One brings two! Shathi tries to loft Smith over long-off but doesn\u2019t get enough elevation and also picks out the tallest player on the park. Ecclestone did well to hold on. 4th over: Bangladesh 17-1 (Shathi 7, Mostary 0) Dean has bagged the breakthrough and laid out the blueprint for England\u2019s success. Flat, skiddy, fizz off the deck. More of that and England might make this paltry target look gargantuan. That is plumb! Dean comes into the attack and fizzes a full delivery with the seam up and it beats Dilara\u2019s swipe across the line. She doesn\u2019t even contemplate a review. That is dead in front and England have their first. 3rd over: Bangladesh 16-0 (Shathi 7, Dilara 6) Another half-chance goes down. Dilara swipes at Sciver-Brunt but doesn\u2019t time it. Capsey, diving at midwicket, can only brush it with her fingertips. Elsewhere, a swivelled pull down to fine leg is worth two and another hoik across the line bags Shathi a couple of her own down long leg thanks to some brilliant work from Dean at long legwho prevented the boundary. An eventful over ends with a top-edge for four that flies up and over Jones. 2nd over: 7-0 (Shathi 1, Dilara 3) Smith\u2019s sliding off-spinners open the other end and she\u2019s on the money. Good pace through the air around a fourth stump line. She strays down the leg-side, though, and concedes three wides half-way through her set. Otherwise it\u2019s a tidy start. 1st over: Bangladesh 3-0 (Shathi 1, Dilara 1) Two big chances for England. The first is a tough return catch that burst through Sciver-Brunt\u2019s hands on her follow-through. The second was an unsuccessful review for lbw. Sciver-Brunt was convinced but it was missing Dilara\u2019s leg stump by some distance. Sciver-Brunt to open. A slip in place and a catcher at short extra cover. Bangladesh\u2019s openers are ready to go. They have a famous victory within reach. \u201cA few years ago you\u2019d have thought Alice Capsey would be one of the best batters in the world by now. Just hasn\u2019t kicked on at all.\u201d A bit harsh, I feel, from Kevin Wilson. Capsey is only 20. Still plenty of her time to reach her full potential. 20th over: Ecclestone perhaps should have come out earlier. She crunches her first ball for six straight down the ground and then gets another two in the same area. Jones finishes not-out on 12 but this innings was dominated by Bangladesh\u2019s spinners after a strong opening partnership between Bouchier and Wyatt-Hodge. Will that be enough? Simple as! Fair play to Dean, she had no choice but to force the issue. A skip down the track is followed by a swipe across the line. She never threatened to make contact with it and Sultana, who has been faultless behind the stumps, removed the bails without fuss. 19th over: England 106-6 (Jones 11, Dean 1) It all started so well for England with Gibson swatting a long-hop over point for four. But Fuhima would have the final word as she nabbed Gibson off the outside edge. Jones lofted a couple over cover and then scampered another two. Gibson is gone! After getting spanked for four having dragged down a long-hop, Nahida goes fuller and forces Gibson to drive off the front foot. The England all-rounder loses her shape and can only get a fine edge on it. Sultana, standing up, makes a tough grab behind the stumps look routine. 18th over: England 97-5 (Jones 7, Gibson 3) Miserly once more from Fahima who signs off with 2-18 from her four overs. Outstanding after conceding nine runs in her first over. Between them, Jones and Gibson can only manage a single apiece. 17th over: England 95-5 (JOnes 6, Gibson 2) Marufa puts down a sitter in the deep. Jones came down the track and barely got hold of a slog across the line. Marufa was right there but couldn\u2019t hold on, even after having a second chance after a juggle. That\u2019s harsh on Rabeya who deserved a second scalp. Instead she closes out with 1-15 from her four overs. 16th over: England 91-5 (Jones 3, Gibson 1) Because England have their own arsenal of elite spinners this is not a lost cause just yet, but my goodness haven\u2019t Bangladesh put up a fight! Fahima has been brilliant, teasing with flight and varied lines, she deserves that wicket \u2013 her second of the night \u2013 and concedes just four runs from that over. GONE! Capsey shakes her head as she departs. Her third attempt at the reverse-sweep is well timed but she couldn\u2019t keep it down. It\u2019s straight at Akter at bacward point who held on well above her shoulders and Fahima dances with delight. 15th over: England 87-4 (Capsey 8, Jones 2) Just two off that Ritu over. It\u2019s as if England are batting with wet fish rather than hard-pressed blades of willow. Bangladesh are all over them. England need a big over and they need one now. 14th over: England 85-4 (Capsey 7, Jones 1) After starting with a wide down the leg-side, Rabeya, back in action, finishes strong with four dot balls. Flight and guile, Capsey has no choice but to show respect and bunt them away with soft hands. There\u2019s even a half-chance for a caught and bowled. I\u2019m not sure what England will get but I bet it\u2019ll be below what they wanted at the start. 13th over: England 81-4 (Capsey 5, Jones 1) Capsey counterpunches with a sweetly timed slog sweep that explodes off the bat for four. But that is Bangladesh\u2019s over as Wyatt-Hodge falls to a deliciously flighted Akter delivery. Jones, the new batter, is a specialist against spin and England will need her to come good here. Another one goes! And it\u2019s the set batter. Wyatt-Hodge storms out of her crease and wafts at a ball that landed in a different postcode. Sultana could have fumbled that and still completed the stumping. Not that she did. That was clinical from the Bangladesh captain who raised both arms in triumph after dislodging the bails. England are in a bit of a hole now. 12th over: England 76-3 (Wyatt-Hodge 41, Capsey 1) Brilliant from Ritu who moved the balls both ways throughout that over. She coughed up a wide, and conceded three singles and a couple off Knight past square leg, but it was that peach of a delivery that removed England\u2019s captain that will be replayed throughout this tournament. Straight through her! Wobble seam on a good length and a bit of movement back off the deck finds the gap between bat and pad and rattles the stumps. Perhaps Knight was guilty of falling over her front pad, but for my money that\u2019s just a good delivery that dragged the England skipper forward and beat her. Bangladesh are well and truly in this fight. 11th over: England 71-2 (Wyatt-Hodge 40, Knight 4) Shorna \u2013 bowling with a cap on! \u2013 is the latest spinner to twirl her arm over. They\u2019re skiddy leg-breaks with a touch of turn and some zip off the deck. A stump-to-stump line means England\u2019s batters can\u2019t free the arms. Which means Wyatt-Hodge has to think out the box and she comes down the track and smacks a ball down the ground for four. That was baseballesque. Three singles and a couple dinked into a gap at extra cover add up to nine off the over. 10th over: England 62-2 (Wyatt-Hodge 33, Knight 2) Rabeya back at it. She\u2019s got this tricky action where she bowls wrist-spin but from the front of the hand. I like it. So does Wyatt-Hodge who uses her feat and lifts an on-drive over the infield for four. But other than that there are no other runs as five dots. Miserly bowling and a much improved fielding show means it\u2019s honours even half-way through the innings. 9th over: England 58-2 (Wyatt-Hodge 29, Knight 2) Ritu replaces Rabeya. Nibbly seamers without any pace present an awkward challenge. Wyatt-Hodge squeezes a single into the covers and Knight is off the mark with a bunt to long-on. Wyatt-Hodge\u2019s lofted sweep has deep backward square interested for a moment but it lands short. Five singles off the over. The run rate has dropped dramatically since the powerplay. Massive wicket! Oh wow, this could be a huge moment in the game. Sciver-Brunt was frustrated by Fahima who was landing it on a teasing length that meant England\u2019s top batter couldn\u2019t work it away. Two dot-balls forced her hand as she charged out her crease and tried to flick it away to the leg side. She got nowhere near the pitch and the leg-spinner, that landed around middle and leg, kept a touch low and would have gone on to wicket the stumps. A hopeful review is lost and Bangladesh are on the march! 8th over: England 53-2 (Wyatt-Hodge 26). 7th over: England 50-1 (Wyatt-Hodge 24, Sciver-Brunt 1) England have sent their premier batter out at first drop. Perhaps to inject a bit of pace in the innings, perhaps to hold back Knight for the nurdling required in the middle overs. Either way, that\u2019s a good start for Rabeya who picked up the breakthrough and conceded just three singles in her first over. From zero to hero! After dropping Bouchier at backward point, Rabeya has picked up the breakthrough. It\u2019s a poor shot in truth. A drag across the line that caught the toe of the bat. It looped towards mid-on and Akter makes no mistake. Rabeya roars in delight. She\u2019ll feel a lot better about things after that. 6th over: 47-0 (Bouchier 23, Wyatt-Hodge 22) Nahida back into the attack and Wyatt-Hodge welcomes her with a skip down the track and a lash over cover for four. A full-toss is smeared into the leg side for one before Bouchier clips a single wide of mid-on. They might not always be on the same page, but these two sure do run hard between the wickets. There\u2019s another single down the ground from Wyatt-Hodge before Bouchier closes out the powerplay by mowing a boundary into the gap at cow corner. 5th over: 36-0 (Bouchier 18, Wyatt-Hodge 16) Bouchier counters Marufa\u2019s in-swing by shimmying slightly and picking up a gorgeous flick over midwicket for four. Marufa then over-corrects and offers a -spank-me\u2019 ball that\u2019s short and wide outside the off-stump. Bouchier duly obliges with a crisp cut. That should have been that for Bouchier who plopped a dolly to Rabeya at backward point but it was inexplicably shelled. That was a proper howler. Two wides at the start of the over plus four singles adds up to an expensive set. England are ticking along nicely. Guy Hornsby sums it up perfectly: Afternoon Daniel, afternoon everyone. I\u2019m sure England will feel firm favourites here but. Bangladesh have shown they are no pushover. Their cadre of incredibly slow bowlers presents a real challenge, and Marufa is like a young, quick Anya Shrubsole with her inswingers. We\u2019ll need to make 2s count with the lush outfield. And have already shown a willingness to tee up some scary run outs. Game on! Bang on, Guy. Been really impressed with Bangladesh so far. Especially Marufa who is hooping it. 4th over: 22-0 (Bouchier 8, Wyatt-Hodge 14) Fahima\u2019s leg spin is into the attack and she continues the strangle with a ring field. Wyatt-Hodge recognises that she has to innovate and moves across her stumps and lifts a swivel-pull over square leg for the first boundary of the innings. Shen then leans into a delicious cover drive and finds the fence again with a flourishing blade. 3rd over: 13-0 (Bouchier 7, Wyatt-Hodge 6) Another chance for a run-out! These two are a bit calamitous in the middle together. They survive, thanks to a misfield in the covers, but Wyatt-Hodge was stranded half-way down the track as Bouchier was caught ball-watching. Thankfully all\u2019s well that ends well. Marufa\u2019s searing in-swinging yorker is well dug out by Wyatt-Hodge as she steers a single wide of point. Marufa drags her length back and Wyatt-Hodge swishes at a cut shot but misses it by a distance. Still no boundaries. 2nd over: England 11-0 (Bouchier 6, Wyatt-Hodge 5) Nahida\u2019s slow left-arm spin opens the other end. Her first ball is a drag down which Wyatt scythes through the off-side. The slow outfield means they have to run hard and they get back for two as it\u2019s hauled in before the rope out in the covers. Five quick singles then rotate the strike but there\u2019s a review for a run-out at the non-striker\u2019s end. Wyatt was home, but a direct hit would have been tight. 1st over: England 4-0 (Bouchier 2, Wyatt-Hodge 0) Immediate swing for Marufa who has it hooping into the right handers. One ball tickles Bouchier\u2019s pad and they collect two leg-byes down to fine leg. Bouchier then makes contact and they scamper a single to mid-off. There\u2019s a direct hit, which requires a second view, but they\u2019re home safe and even pinch a second on the over-throw. Boucher and Wyatt-Hodge are padded up and ready to go. Nasser Hussain has just said that England have the best T20 record this year. Under John Lewish they\u2019ve been uber-aggressive. Today, though, they face a Bangladesh bowling attack that will bowl slow and release it low, which is exactly what England\u2019s dashers don\u2019t enjoy facing. Should be a fascinating contest. Marufa, a rare seamer today, has the ball and will look to swing it in to the right handers. The anthems are ringing out. Not long to go. As a consequence of the change of venue \u2013 for those just joining us, we were supposed to be in Bangladesh but civil unrest saw a hasty shift to the UAE \u2013 England had to chuck out a whole heap of homework. As Raf Nicholson reports, the ECB had been crunching numbers for 12 months in the hope of better understanding Bangladeshi conditions to give England an edge. Now it\u2019s all about vibes and talent, though captain Heather Knight says it\u2019s business as usual. \u201cI don\u2019t think our plans change too much,\u201d Knight said this week. We\u2019ll find out soon enough. Adding to the challenge is the fact that this is a used pitch. If you\u2019re a fan of ripping bouncers and thwacks square of the wicket and through the covers, you\u2019re out of luck. This is going to be a miserly game, one stacked with sweeps and hard-run twos and threes. Fielding will also be paramount. Bangladesh shelled four catches against Scotland on Thursday. Riding high after their win over Scotland, they\u2019ll back themselves. But they need runs. Someone in the top order has to go big and give their finishers something to aim at against England\u2019s spinners. Their own attack is varied but will rely heavily on the seam of Marufa who is a genuine wicket-taker. Bangladesh: Dilara, Shathi, Mostary, Joty (c, wk), Taj, Shorna, Ritu, Fajima, Rabeya, Nahida, Marufa. Lauren Bell misses out as they stack the side with four genuine spinners and Capsey\u2019s part-timers. That means one of them will have to use the new/newish ball. EnglandL Bouchier, Wyatt, Capsey, Sciver-Brunt, Knight (c), Jones (wk), Gibson, Dean, Glenn, Ecclestone, Smith. \u201cIt looms much easier to defend a total,\u201d says England\u2019s skipper after summing up conditions and opting to set a score. They\u2019ve gone with four spinners! Four! Should be fun. Sultana says she would have batted first as well. Bangladesh have already got their campaign underway. They beat Scotland by 16 runs in the tournament opener on Thursday. It was their first T20 World Cup in a decade but, sadly, because of unrest back home, it took place over 3,700km away from their home country despite them serving as nominal hosts. Their skipper, Nigar Sultana, later said, \u201cInitially it was very heartbreaking because we were always bearing in mind that we were able to play in front of our home crowd. But this team, the people looking here today, it was brilliant, we got quite a few people supporting Bangladesh.\u201d Would be great if they get a whole lot of love again this afternoon. Heard this one before? England have been soaking cricket balls in water in order to replicate conditions they\u2019ll face in Dubai. Given the sweaty conditions, with temperatures reaching almost 40C, gripping the ball will prove a challenge for bowlers, especially in evening games. Could this be the marginal gain that proves decisive? Australia have just spanked Sri Lanka. Catch up with Jim\u2019s OBO as he recounts the champions\u2019 resounding opening win. It\u2019s been seven long years since England\u2019s women last won an ICC event. In that time Australia have forged a dynasty, winning one 50-over jamboree and a hat-trick of T20 World Cups. Can England knock the Aussies off their perch? Hard to say. They lost a warm-up game by 33 runs last week but did beat New Zealand by five wickets in their other pre-tournament tune-up. They\u2019ve promised to go harder than they\u2019ve gone before and will lean heavily on their cohort of spinners led by the brilliant Sophie Ecclestone, the top-ranked bowler in the format and a game-changer all on her own. The batters will have to come good on low, turning tracks, but with Nat Sciver-Brunt the highest-placed member of the group at 19th on the ICC\u2019s metrics, this could be a problem area. They should have too much for the (nominal) hosts, Bangladesh. Victory won\u2019t be enough. They\u2019ll want to send out a statement. First ball at 3pm BST from Sharjah. Toss report, teams and other bits to follow.",

      "body": "<p>Mass hunger and malnutrition. A looming nuclear winter. An existential threat to the Canadian way of life. For months, the country\u2019s Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has issued dire and increasingly apocalyptic warnings about the future. The culprit? A federal carbon levy meant to curb greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>In the House of Commons this month, the Tory leader said there was only one way to avoid the devastating crisis: embattled prime minister Justin Trudeau must \u201ccall a \u2018carbon tax\u2019 election\u201d.</p> <p>Hailed as a global model of progressive environmental policy, Canada\u2019s carbon tax has reduced emissions and put money in the pockets of Canadians. The levy, endorsed by conservative and progressive economists, has survived multiple federal elections and a supreme court challenge. But this time, a persistent cost-of-living crisis and a pugnacious Conservative leader running on a populist message have thrust the country\u2019s carbon tax once more into the spotlight, calling into question whether it will survive another national vote.</p> <p>In 2018, Trudeau announced plans for the \u201cpan-Canadian climate framework\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/04/how-to-make-a-carbon-tax-popular-give-the-profits-to-the-people\">modelled after British Columbia\u2019s pioneering carbon tax</a>. Notably, the levy is revenue neutral: the government doesn\u2019t keep any money. Instead, it remits all of it back to taxpayers in the form a quarterly rebate. Any increase in costs from a tax on fuel is offset by a rebate of roughly equal value.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2024/02/canada-carbon-rebate-amounts-for-2024-25.html\">According to the federal government</a>, a family of four in Ontario will receive C$1,120 (\u00a3630) this year in rebates. Those living in a rural community receive C$1,344. A rural family of four in the province of Alberta receives C$2,160.</p> <p>Anyone willing and able to change their behaviour would end up in the black. Economists, political scientists \u2013 and the parliamentary budget officer \u2013 have <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/axe-the-tax-and-carbon-rebate-how-canada-households-affected-1.7046905\">found</a> low-income households receive more from the rebate than they pay in additional costs. But the Conservatives, with a significant lead in the polls, are keen to capture mounting frustration with the incumbent government and transform a federal vote into a referendum on Trudeau\u2019s marquee climate policy. Their campaign message, on billboards and T-shirts, has been simple: \u201caxe the tax\u201d. They argue that levy burdens Canadians at a time when rents, groceries and transportation costs have all surged.</p> <p>Kathryn Harrison, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia, who has spent years studying the effects of carbon levies on behaviour and emissions, laments the \u201coutright falsehoods\u201d peddled for political benefit.</p> <p>\u201cThe current political discourse means a lot of Canadians misunderstand how the policy affects them.

      "bodyText": "Mass hunger and malnutrition. A looming nuclear winter. An existential threat to the Canadian way of life. For months, the country\u2019s Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has issued dire and increasingly apocalyptic warnings about the future. The culprit? A federal carbon levy meant to curb greenhouse gas emissions. In the House of Commons this month, the Tory leader said there was only one way to avoid the devastating crisis: embattled prime minister Justin Trudeau must \u201ccall a \u2018carbon tax\u2019 election\u201d. Hailed as a global model of progressive environmental policy, Canada\u2019s carbon tax has reduced emissions and put money in the pockets of Canadians. The levy, endorsed by conservative and progressive economists, has survived multiple federal elections and a supreme court challenge. But this time, a persistent cost-of-living crisis and a pugnacious Conservative leader running on a populist message have thrust the country\u2019s carbon tax once more into the spotlight, calling into question whether it will survive another national vote. In 2018, Trudeau announced plans for the \u201cpan-Canadian climate framework\u201d, modelled after British Columbia\u2019s pioneering carbon tax. Notably, the levy is revenue neutral: the government doesn\u2019t keep any money. Instead, it remits all of it back to taxpayers in the form a quarterly rebate. Any increase in costs from a tax on fuel is offset by a rebate of roughly equal value. According to the federal government, a family of four in Ontario will receive C$1,120 (\u00a3630) this year in rebates. Those living in a rural community receive C$1,344. A rural family of four in the province of Alberta receives C$2,160. Anyone willing and able to change their behaviour would end up in the black. Economists, political scientists \u2013 and the parliamentary budget officer \u2013 have found low-income households receive more from the rebate than they pay in additional costs. But the Conservatives, with a significant lead in the polls, are keen to capture mounting frustration with the incumbent government and transform a federal vote into a referendum on Trudeau\u2019s marquee climate policy. Their campaign message, on billboards and T-shirts, has been simple: \u201caxe the tax\u201d. They argue that levy burdens Canadians at a time when rents, groceries and transportation costs have all surged. Kathryn Harrison, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia, who has spent years studying the effects of carbon levies on behaviour and emissions, laments the \u201coutright falsehoods\u201d peddled for political benefit. \u201cThe current political discourse means a lot of Canadians misunderstand how the policy affects them. They don\u2019t think it works. They think they\u2019re paying more than they are. And that\u2019s a very distressing thing for me, from not just a climate policy perspective, but a democratic perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a debate about how much emphasis to put on one issue or another. The unpopularity of the carbon tax is, to a large degree, driven by voters misunderstanding it and having the facts wrong.\u201d For Canada\u2019s environment minister, Steven Guilbeault, the fractious debate represents a crossroads for the country in addressing the effects of the climate crisis. \u201cThe reality is, it\u2019s easy to say \u2018axe the tax\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one likes to pay taxes. It is more complicated to explain that climate change is real, it\u2019s costing Canadians billions of dollars and carbon pricing is one of many measures we\u2019re putting in place to try and fight climate change. That\u2019s harder to communicate than a slogan.\u201d But the tenor of the debate \u2013 and the misinformation \u2013 also suggests something deeper is at stake. \u201cClimate, and more generally, the environment is now caught into this culture war where facts don\u2019t matter, where the truth has no currency,\u201d said Guilbeault. \u201cThis is an issue that speaks to the fundamental elements of our democracies around the world, many of which are being weakened by those campaigns of disinformation.\u201d Still, the perceived benefits of abandoning the tax have lured in other party leaders. Last month, the New Democratic party leader Jagmeet Singh suggested his support was waning because he doesn\u2019t want a policy that puts the \u201cburden on the backs of working people\u201d \u2013 a claim dismissed by experts. \u201cIt is surprising the federal NDP are turning their back on a very progressive policy that both reduces carbon pollution, but also delivers rebates greater than carbon payments for lower income households \u2013 the people he purports to be most supportive of,\u201d said Harrison. Guilbeault admits federal government was \u201ca bit slow\u201d in course-correcting the waves of misinformation surrounding the levy. \u201cWe could have done better, but the 2019 and 2021, and partially, the 2015 elections were fought in part on the issue of carbon pricing \u2013 and we won those elections,\u201d he said. \u201c Initially, the tax was remitted in the form of a tax cut that few people noticed when they filed their taxes. Later, the government began directly depositing the money \u2013 but couldn\u2019t get the banks to indicate the money was a rebate from the carbon tax. It took a change to the law that finally compelled banks to label government payments as the \u201cCanada Carbon Rebate\u201d or \u201cCdaCarbonRebate\u201d. As nations around the world unveil politics to blunt the effects of a rapidly changing climate, recent report from the Canadian Climate Institute found the national carbon levy, which targets both consumers and industry, is projected to reduce emissions by as much as 50% by 2030. In the event that a Conservative government abandons the national carbon levy, Canada will have \u201cno way\u201d of meeting its 2030 emissions targets,\u201d said Guilbeault, adding it \u201creduces our credibility\u201d when negotiating with other nations moving ahead with plans to lower emissions. Most of the debate right now is on the fuel charge the consumer-facing carbon price, with little focus on the industrial carbon tax, said Dale Beugin, vice-president of the Canadian Climate Institute, which \u201cdelivers three times the emissions reductions by 2030\u201d than the consumer component of the tax. Opposition party leaders, including Singh, have vaguely suggested strengthening the industrial part of the carbon tax to make up for the lost benefits of the consumer tax. \u201cBut the reality is, when you remove one policy \u2013 in this case, the consumer carbon tax \u2013 you\u2019re forced to pushing harder on other levers to go after emissions,\u201d said Beugin. \u201cAnd there aren\u2019t many sources \u2013 buildings, vehicles \u2013 that haven\u2019t been looked at yet.\u201d For Beugin, the debate underscores an uncomfortable reality about policies meant to unwind the sustained environmental damage from unfettered emissions. \u201cClimate policy isn\u2019t easy. It requires some effort to push against the things that are easy and simple politically, because that\u2019s this transformation that we need,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, technology is getting cheaper, but climate policy is inevitably hard \u2013 and you don\u2019t want to shy away from that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Claims that England\u2019s grammars will be \u201cswamped\u201d in September by pupils priced out of private schools by VAT on fees are unfounded, data from more than half of selective state schools suggests. The number of children registered to sit the 11-plus entrance tests for grammar schools next September has fallen slightly compared with last year. Figures covering 91 of the 163 grammars in England show that far from being inundated with applications from middle-class parents forced out of private schools by the imposition of 20% VAT, the total number of pupils registered to sit the tests has dropped from 80,317 last year to 80,091 this year. At most schools, registration ran during the general election period, from May until July or August, when education news was dominated by Labour\u2019s policy to close the loophole that has allowed private schools to operate VAT-free for five decades. Before the election, Conservative MPs claimed that fee hikes caused by the end of the tax exemption would lead to an influx of families trying to get their children into selective secondary state schools. Robin Walker, the then chairman of the Commons education select committee, said that heavily oversubscribed grammars would be \u201cwhere people would turn to first in many cases\u201d. Mark Francois, a Conservative MP in Essex, also warned that the VAT plan would make private schools unaffordable for all but the wealthiest, with the rest likely to \u201cswamp\u201d local grammars with applications. But data provided in response to a freedom of information request to all grammar schools in England reveals no such influx. Some have seen increases, others have experienced a drop in registrations, but total numbers fell. In Kent, the most selective county in England with 32 grammars, numbers dropped from 18,175 to 17,655. Fewer families than last year also registered for the test at six of the grammar schools in Birmingham. In Bexley, south-east London, with four selective secondaries, 600 fewer children were signed up this year. Numbers due to take the exam for entry to the five grammars in the south London borough of Sutton also dipped. In Essex, interest in the 11-plus did rise this year, but the numbers who registered were still lower than in 2022.

For many years private school fees have regularly risen above the rate of inflation without there being any decline in pupil numbers. \u201cWhat really is surprising is the amount of time and energy that has been devoted to an issue that affects very few children, while the appalling problems faced by the schools which educate 93% of our children have been almost completely ignored. \u201cWhy are the problems of a very small minority, most of whom are pretty well off, deemed more important than those of the great majority of families?\u201d The estimated \u00a31.5bn that will be raised by collecting VAT and applying business rates to the independent sector will be used to provide 6,500 teachers in state secondary schools, where staff recruitment is in crisis. On Friday, the Independent Schools Council (ISC) called again for a delay in the implementation of the policy and is considering a high court challenge if ministers press ahead. It said data collected from 1,185 ISC members showed a 1.7% drop in private school pupil numbers this September, compared with 2023. If extrapolated across all 2,500 private schools in the UK, it would amount to a drop in pupil numbers of more than 10,000, the ISC claimed. Julie Robinson, ISC\u2019s chief executive, warned that ministers had underestimated the pupil displacement from private to state. However, state school enrolments have also been falling because of the UK\u2019s declining birthrate over the past decade. The Department for Education (DfE) said there was a 2.3% fall in applications for primary places this September, and a 1.7% fall in secondary applications. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) forecasts that the addition of VAT will, over time, result in between 3% and 7% of pupils moving from the private to the state sector, but said that the decline in the birthrate meant private school rolls were likely to fall even without the VAT issue. Falling state school rolls means the state sector has capacity to absorb any outflow from the private sector, according to the DfE.",

      "body": "<p>On a hazy, dreamy afternoon at Selhurst Park, all soft sun and soft air, Liverpool produced something that seemed to fit the day, an exercise in control and the problems of control. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/crystal-palace-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">A&nbsp;1-0 victory</a> means they will stay at the top of the league heading towards the end of October. This is a high\u2011functioning entity now. They have a good manager, good players, an excellent central midfield and the fewest goals conceded in the&nbsp;league.</p> <p>At the same time Liverpool also somehow ended up hanging on at times in the second half of a game that was like an expertly staged act of euthanasia where the corpse inexplicably starts waking up after an hour trying to have a chat about things.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/crystal-palace-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Jota scrapes leaders Liverpool past Palace but Alisson exits with injury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First came the anaesthetic. For 45 minutes this was high-grade Coldplay football, a controlled, top-spec stadium experience. Score. Wait. Win. This has been the best of Arne Slot\u2019s developing Liverpool so far. Six of their eight wins have followed that pattern of take the lead, control possession and win.</p> <p>By half-time Liverpool were 1-0 up, with 73% possession and a sense of pieces being pushed around a board. They weren\u2019t exactly dominant. Dominant suggests some kind of struggle, or at least a secondary element that needs dominating. Instead Liverpool occupied Selhurst Park like a team of peacekeepers.</p> <p>This was a team in eco mode, regenerative braking football, a game of mature and sensible throttle management. That style also raises its own issues. Palace will be criticised for lacking aggression in the first half, during which they didn\u2019t commit a single foul. But Liverpool also bring this on. They\u2019re basically chloroforming you in those moments. Give in to&nbsp;it.&nbsp;Sleep.</p> <p>Teams will learn to respond to this, and there was more from Palace in the second half after Jean-Philippe Mateta came on. They might have had a penalty, but didn\u2019t quite meet the bar for holding at a corner. Eberechi Eze failed to finish a good opening after an excellent break. Liverpool become less, not more, incisive as the end loomed. The problem with bringing down the temperature is, can you always bring it back up, crank the lever when you need to? Control is hard. It\u2019s not passive or cold. It\u2019s an act of aggression too.</p> <p>It is also one that Liverpool are still learning. At the start it was interesting to see the back four constantly talking, shuttling, rearranging each other. Shape not energy is everything now.</p> <p>The only goal came from a beautifully simple move with eight minutes gone. Kostas Tsimikas played a straight through ball inside the left-back channel as the Palace defence dithered. Cody Gakpo put the cross into the most logical space. Diogo Jota produced a classic poacher\u2019s diagonal run and finished with a cool little poke of the toe.</p>    <p>This was a rational goal, an empirically sensible goal. Palace pressing high with two narrow central midfielders left space on the flank. Trevoh Chalobah in his first start would naturally need to explore the right way to work with his left wing-back. This is a tender point. We will press at it.</p> <p>For a while after that the game was like a movie where things keep threatening to happen but don\u2019t. Jota should have made it 2-0. Maybe Liverpool would suffer from \u201cnot killing the game off\u201d? But they didn\u2019t really. Instead for long periods Palace were just bolted into their own half. Liverpool can play a high line, can keep the ball, can hold that midfield box in possession.

      "bodyText": "On a hazy, dreamy afternoon at Selhurst Park, all soft sun and soft air, Liverpool produced something that seemed to fit the day, an exercise in control and the problems of control. A 1-0 victory means they will stay at the top of the league heading towards the end of October. This is a high\u2011functioning entity now. They have a good manager, good players, an excellent central midfield and the fewest goals conceded in the league. At the same time Liverpool also somehow ended up hanging on at times in the second half of a game that was like an expertly staged act of euthanasia where the corpse inexplicably starts waking up after an hour trying to have a chat about things. First came the anaesthetic. For 45 minutes this was high-grade Coldplay football, a controlled, top-spec stadium experience. Score. Wait. Win. This has been the best of Arne Slot\u2019s developing Liverpool so far. Six of their eight wins have followed that pattern of take the lead, control possession and win. By half-time Liverpool were 1-0 up, with 73% possession and a sense of pieces being pushed around a board. They weren\u2019t exactly dominant. Dominant suggests some kind of struggle, or at least a secondary element that needs dominating. Instead Liverpool occupied Selhurst Park like a team of peacekeepers. This was a team in eco mode, regenerative braking football, a game of mature and sensible throttle management. That style also raises its own issues. Palace will be criticised for lacking aggression in the first half, during which they didn\u2019t commit a single foul. But Liverpool also bring this on. They\u2019re basically chloroforming you in those moments. Give in to it. Sleep. Teams will learn to respond to this, and there was more from Palace in the second half after Jean-Philippe Mateta came on. They might have had a penalty, but didn\u2019t quite meet the bar for holding at a corner. Eberechi Eze failed to finish a good opening after an excellent break. Liverpool become less, not more, incisive as the end loomed. The problem with bringing down the temperature is, can you always bring it back up, crank the lever when you need to? Control is hard. It\u2019s not passive or cold. It\u2019s an act of aggression too. It is also one that Liverpool are still learning. At the start it was interesting to see the back four constantly talking, shuttling, rearranging each other. Shape not energy is everything now. The only goal came from a beautifully simple move with eight minutes gone. Kostas Tsimikas played a straight through ball inside the left-back channel as the Palace defence dithered. Cody Gakpo put the cross into the most logical space. Diogo Jota produced a classic poacher\u2019s diagonal run and finished with a cool little poke of the toe. This was a rational goal, an empirically sensible goal. Palace pressing high with two narrow central midfielders left space on the flank. Trevoh Chalobah in his first start would naturally need to explore the right way to work with his left wing-back. This is a tender point. We will press at it. For a while after that the game was like a movie where things keep threatening to happen but don\u2019t. Jota should have made it 2-0. Maybe Liverpool would suffer from \u201cnot killing the game off\u201d? But they didn\u2019t really. Instead for long periods Palace were just bolted into their own half. Liverpool can play a high line, can keep the ball, can hold that midfield box in possession. They will just strangle you when this works. Ryan Gravenberch was excellent again, such a lovely, easy mover, always looking around even as he barrels into the clinches. He touched the ball 40 times in the opening half-hour. It would be a surprise to hear he actually broke a sweat during this. From a distance Gravenberch looked as if he was quietly mowing the lawn or listening to a podcast while incidentally dominating a Premier League midfield. The most interesting aspect is, of course, how quickly this Liverpool team have got here, the journey from always cranking the throttle and gunning the carbon, led by a beaming petrolhead in a baseball cap, pumping the pedal in his sweat-soaked running shoes, slurping another energy drink, windows down, pomp rock classics on repeat. It is a remarkable thing to switch to the zero emission stuff so effectively, a tribute to Slot\u2019s clarity and persuasiveness. It is also worth remembering that in December 2020 Liverpool came here, won 7-0, went top of the table, then basically fell apart amid an injury crisis and didn\u2019t win at home again until March. They have a run of games now that will properly test and refine the more measured style. It seems obvious enough this is a team that will try to build those other gears on top, to find aggression out of control. Watching Liverpool win here was at times like sitting though a finely honed piece of music without emotional peaks, just waiting for a Mozart to come along and bash a few trills and swoops into it.

Annie Proulx has compared her to WG Sebald; for the <em>London Review of Books</em>, her 900-page historical epic <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/10/the-books-of-jacob-by-olga-tokarczuk-review-a-messiahs-story\">The Books of Jacob</a></em> (translated by Jennifer Croft in 2021) stands alongside \u201cthe great postmodern meganovels by Pynchon or Perec, Bola\u00f1o or Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u201d.

I\u2019ve read it five or six times since I was a teenager and every time I read it differently \u2013 it grows with the reader. What struck me was my exclusion from the novel as a reader, and a person, from the questions it asked and the answers it gave. It made me realise that when I stood in front of my father\u2019s bookshelves as a girl \u2013 at home it was my father who was dealing with books \u2013 a huge majority of the classic novels I could see dealt only with issues between men.

      "bodyText": "When the Palestine Solidarity Campaign organised its first protest against Israel\u2019s bombing campaign in Gaza, days after Hamas\u2019 deadly terror attacks on 7 October 2023, leaders expected the conflict to be over within weeks. \u201cI remember saying to my staff \u2018we are probably going to need to be responding to this through marches until potentially Christmas\u2019,\u201d recalls director Ben Jamal. \u201cI didn\u2019t see beyond that.\u201d His calculations were based on previous conflicts in the Gaza Strip. In 2021\u2019s crisis, Israeli bombing and Hamas rocket fire lasted for 11 days, while the 2014 war continued for seven weeks, and 2012 saw eight days of bloodshed before a ceasefire was reached. But after a year, the current war shows no sign of stopping and is instead spreading to Lebanon and threatening to escalate further following Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack on Israel. Protests in Britain look set to expand in response: the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) march on 5 October in London incorporated the slogans \u201chands off Lebanon\u201d and \u201cno Middle East war\u201d. It was attended by tens of thousands of people. The Metropolitan police said it appeared to have a higher turnout than recent demonstrations demanding a ceasefire in Gaza, which have become smaller and less frequent since a peak last November. But with thousands of people still attending PSC marches roughly every three weeks, both the campaign group and Scotland Yard agree that it is the biggest protest movement seen in recent British history \u2013 outstripping the historic 2010 student protests and 2003 anti-Iraq war demonstrations. The Met assistant commissioner Matt Twist says the past year has been \u201cthe busiest period in terms of protests that we\u2019ve ever had\u201d, with major demonstrations \u201chappening at a much higher tempo than we\u2019ve ever seen before\u201d. \u201cAs well as the [pro-Palestinian] marches, we now see counter protests, and then we\u2019ve had the growth in what I would call cultural nationalists, or some people characterise as the right wing, which have also been presenting an additional resourcing demand,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the widening and deepening of the conflict and what the implications are for this country, and for London in particular, across a range of issues. Our planning assumption is that these protests will continue.\u201d The Met has organised its response to all protests related to the Israel-Gaza war under the codename \u201cOperation Brocks\u201d, which has so far cost \u00a346.8m and involved 60,000 shifts by local officers and 9,600 by those loaned from forces outside London. The bulk of resources have gone into the 20 national marches so far called by the PSC, although numerous smaller demonstrations have taken place across London, organised by a range of groups and figures supporting opposing sides in the conflict. \u201cThe cost has been enormous,\u201d Twist says. \u201cThe financial cost is one thing, but the opportunity cost for London is another, because those officers are pulled from local policing in the main \u2013 so it means they\u2019re not doing other things.\u201d Police have counted more than 2,600 protests nationally linked to the Israel-Gaza war, and the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council called its response \u201cone of the longest and most resource-intensive policing operations in recent history\u201d. In London, 404 arrests had been made at protests by the end of June but only 14% had resulted in a charge, analysis by the Observer shows, with 45% of cases remaining under investigation, while over a third resulted in no further action. The largest number of arrests made in a single day was on 11 November 2023, when disorder broke out among far-right protesters claiming to protect war memorials against a regular PSC protest that fell on Armistice Day. The majority of crimes recorded by police under Operation Brocks as a whole have been breach of the peace and public order offences, but there have also been numerous alleged assaults on officers and seven arrests on suspicion of inviting support for a terrorist group. In February, two women were convicted of terror offences for wearing images of Hamas militants entering Israel on paragliders on 7 October during the PSC protest a week later. By the end of June, more than 50 arrests had also been made for hate crimes at protests, including religiously aggravated public order offences and stirring up racial hatred. Suella Braverman, then the Home Secretary, characterised the PSC\u2019s protests as \u201chate marches\u201d and was sacked by Rishi Sunak after writing an article accusing the Met of applying a \u201cdouble standard\u201d, claiming right-wing protesters were \u201crightly met with a stern response\u201d, while \u201cpro-Palestinian mobs\u201d were \u201clargely ignored\u201d. Twist rejects claims of two-tier policing as \u201cnonsense\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s become a useful soundbite for those who seek to criticise and undermine without adding constructively to the debate. We police without fear or favour, according to the law as it is \u2013 not as people might wish it to be.\u201d He says the legal threshold for banning marches, which is serious disorder, has never been met and the Met is not pushing for any new laws or increased powers. But he adds that while \u201cthe overwhelming majority of people who attend [PSC protests] do so peacefully and in a good-natured way, it is also true to say that the marches place the Jewish community in fear\u201d. \u201cWe have seen an unusually high incidence of offences linked to the Terrorism Act, in terms of supporting a proscribed organisation, and we have made arrests at almost every march linked to racial or religious hatred,\u201d Twist says. Jamal accuses critics of disproportionate focus on a \u201chandful of placards\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d chants by small groups of people in thousands-strong crowds. \u201cThe number of people being arrested on these demonstrations is very, very low,\u201d he adds. \u201cWith the individuals, of course we look at if we are seeing any patterns or something problematic. But what we get is a handful of things that happen that do not speak to the vast majority.\u201d The PSC has rejected criticism of contested slogans, such as \u201cfrom the river to the sea\u201d, and denies that its marches are making the Jewish community less safe. \u201cEvery single march we\u2019ve had hundreds, sometimes thousands, of Jewish people marching in an organised Jewish block to say \u2018we do not agree with what the state of Israel is doing\u2019,\u201d Jamal says. \u201cThey have always been warmly welcomed.\u201d But Jewish safety charity the Community Security Trust, which has been monitoring an increase in antisemitic incidents since the start of the Israel-Gaza war, believes the number of arrests for hate crimes and terror offences indicate a \u201cproblematic pattern of behaviour\u201d. Dave Rich, the charity\u2019s director of policy, says protests have been causing central London synagogues to cancel events and made Jewish people fear visiting the capital. \u201cIf [Jewish] people want to go on these marches that\u2019s fine, but the vast majority of Jewish people don\u2019t fancy coming out of a synagogue and watch 10,000 people marching past calling Israel genocidal baby-killers,\u201d he adds. The charity is now concerned that as the conflict continues, protests could \u201cspin off into smaller, hardline, direct action\u201d that would be harder for police to control and \u201chas more violent potential\u201d. While the CST has been advocating for greater restrictions on the timing and route of PSC demonstrations, Jamal says police have been imposing \u201ctorturous\u201d conditions under the Public Order Act. Meanwhile, Twist believes police are \u201cgetting it about right\u201d to minimise disruption and balance competing rights. \u201cOne side will say we\u2019re doing too much, and the other side might say we\u2019re not doing enough,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult balance and it\u2019s hotly contested.

Match report: Man City 3-2 Fulham Jamie Jackson was at the Etihad to see the champions come from behind to beat Fulham. Match report: West Ham 4-1 Ipswich Ben Bloom was our man at the London Stadium, where West Ham gave Ipswich a lesson in ruthlessness. Match report: Arsenal 3-1 Southampton Ed Aarons was at the Emirates to watch Southampton score TOO BLOODY EARLY. \u201cDundee United won 1-0 at St. Mirren, which in no way makes up for the 1987 Scottish Cup final, but I\u2019ll take it,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cDundee, clearly channeling their inner Everton, were 2-0 up at home to Kilmarnock in the 85th minute, and lost 3-2. As for those highlights from 1991, at least I can now blame Clockwatch for when my wife finds me fast asleep at 8.30 with an empty bottle of whisky on the floor.\u201d Funnily enough we covered Dundee/Everton in this week\u2019s Knowledge. Leicester 1-0 Bournemouth Ben Fisher was at the King Power Stadium to watch Facundo Buonanotte give Leicester a cathartic victory. The updated Premier League table Arsenal did it the hard way, going behind early in the second half, but they did it. Leicester have held on to secure their first Premier League win of the season. That\u2019s a big result, one that lifts them to 15th in the table. Full times: Brentford 5-3 Wolves, West Ham 4-1 Ipswich Championship Never mind the manager, Plymouth\u2019s on-field Morgan Whittaker has put them 2-1 up against Blackburn in the 97th minute! City have held on to win their first Premier League game in three. It sounds like they badly missed Rodri, even though his replacement Mateo Kovacic scored twice. Blimey. Another day of misery for Gary O\u2019Neil is complete: the substitute Fabio Carvalho has scored Brentford\u2019s fifth. Championship The Plymouth manager Wayne Rooney has been sent off, and we should all look forward to hearing what he said to merit this particular punishment. By hook or by crook, Arsenal keep winning football matches. Bukayo Saka has finished Southampton off with a crisp first-time finish. Fulham won\u2019t go quietly. The substitute Rodrigo Muniz has made it 3-2 at the Emirates; he was given a lot of time to collect Reiss Nelson\u2019s cross, turn and ping the ball into the roof of the net. It might have taken a deflection. Championship Joe Rankin-Costello has scored a late equaliser for Blackburn at Plymouth. Meanwhile\u2026 The top of the table as things stand The substitution Jeremy Doku seals an important if nervy victory for the champions. It was all his own work. He cut inside from the left, shuffled past Castagne and hammered a rising drive that flew into the centre of the goal. Bernd Leno seemed to run past the ball so maybe it moved in the air. Everton v Newcastle The team news is in for the late Premier League game. Read all about it with Will Unwin. 78 min: Arsenal 2-1 Southampton Southampton are still in this game. The teenager Tyler Dibling hits the post with a deflected shot, and the resulting corner ricochets off the crossbar after a dodgy punch from David Raya*. * Apparently, I haven\u2019t seen it 78 min: Man City 2-1 Fulham Pep Guardiola brings on John Stones for Phil Foden, a reaction to Fulham\u2019s increasing threat. 75 min: Leicester 1-0 Bournemouth Dango Ouattara has missed a very good chance to equalise, heading against the crossbar. The latest scores in our featured games Premier League Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool (FT) Arsenal 2-1 Southampton Brentford 4-2 Wolves Leicester 1-0 Bournemouth Man City 2-1 Fulham West Ham 4-1 Ipswich Bundesliga Leverkusen 2-2 Holstein Kiel (FT) Union Berlin 2-1 Dortmund (FT) Arsenal 2-1 Southampton \u201cMemo to Mikel Arteta,\u201d begins Charles Antaki. \u201cArsenal fans have been ringing reception appreciating the goals that are scored against the opposition, but are kindly requesting you to arrange, going forward, that they happen ahead of potential palpitation\u2013inducing concessions. Your prompt attention in this matter would be most appreciated.\u201d Never mind conceding goals: trying to decipher that second sentence of yours almost gave me palpitations. Man City 2-1 Fulham \u201cIf Traore could finish,\u201d says Michael Dawson of Fulham\u2019s Adama Traore on Soccer Saturday, \u201cthey\u2019d be winning five.\u201d \u201cParticularly without Odegaard, I just don\u2019t see Arsenal mounting an actual challenge at the sharp end for the title,\u201d says Dave Watton. \u201cWhen was the last time they did, 2005?\u201d Well they did take it to the last day of last season. I think they\u2019ll go the distance again this year. 70 min: Arsenal 2-1 Southampton There was a long VAR check on the Arsenal goal but it has been given. The question was whether Mikel Merino, who was in an offside position, tried to head the ball before it reached Martinelli. I can see both sides! Moyes out! This is an excellent team goal from West Ham, finished off inside the six-yard box by Lucas Paqueta. Bundesliga results Bochum 1-3 Wolfsburg Bremen 0-1 Freiburg Leverkusen 2-2 Holstein Kiel Union Berlin 2-1 Dortmund That\u2019s a helluva result for Holstein Kiel, who move off the bottom of the table after a terrific comeback in Leverkusen. They were 2-0 down after eight minutes. Too early. Far too early. The substitute Gabriel Martinelli has put Arsenal ahead, volleying in from close range after a devastating cross from Bukayo Saka. Leicester 1-0 Bournemouth Lewis Cook has had a potential equaliser ruled out for offside. Scottish Premiership Junior Hoilett has equalised straight away for Hibs. What can you do? Scottish Premiership James Humphries\u2019 reverse curse is working: Apostolos Stamatelopoulos has put Motherwell 1-0 up at Hibs. Yeah, Southampton scored too early. Kai Havertz has scored for the fourth game in a row to bring Arsenal level at the Emirates. Downes\u2019 lazy pass was intercepted by Partey, who fed the ball quickly into Havertz on the edge of the D. He moved the ball onto his left foot and lasered a shot off the inside of the post and into the net. Ramsdale had no chance. Cameron Archer has put Southampton ahead at the Emirates! Fernandes released him on the left wing with an early crossfield pass. Archer cut inside, stood Saliba (I think) up and guided a low shot into the far corner. Excellent finish. They\u2019ve scored too early, haven\u2019t they. \u201cI think you\u2019re right about the extreme specificity of the defensive midfielder role,\u201d says Phil Podolsky. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly a coincidence that Spanish football\u2019s two great DMs this century were coached by Guardiola. During Sergio Busquets\u2019s long twilight at Barcelona he kept hearing that he should be shifted forward to the Xavi role because he no longer has the athleticism for defensive duties, yet he kept saying it can\u2019t be done, the body shape you need to adopt when you receive the ball is too different!\u201d Yeah, and I guess the role is even more specific in a Pep team. West Ham are heading for their first home win under Julen Lopetegui. Michail Antonio forced the goalkeeper into a desperate clearance that was collected on the right wing by Bowen. He moved into the area and threaded a lovely left-foot shot into the far corner. 49 min: Arsenal 0-0 Southampton Mateus Fernandes has missed a really good chance to give Southampton an unlikely lead. RODRI WHO? Mateo Kovacic has scored a beautiful second goal to put City ahead. Foden\u2019s cross was controlled by Bernardo Silva, who teed up the onrushing Kovacic on the edge of the D. He skilfully ignored Berge\u2019s challenge and swept an emphatic shot past Bernd Leno. \u201cNeed Rodri?\u201d sniffs Zach Neeley. \u201cPep\u2019s teams don\u2019t need anyone! The whole endeavour is to prevent needing any one player. The players don\u2019t even need to decide what to do, Pep scripts that for them. He is a rock, he is an island. I think I have him figured out now, Pep and Paul Simon even both like cable knits.\u201d GOAL! Leverkusen 2-2 Holstein Kiel (Arp 69 pen) Long afternoon my foot! Jann-Fiete Arp\u2019s penalty has equalised for the bottom club Kiel, who were 2-0 down after eight minutes at Leverkusen Bundesliga Julian Ryerson has given Dortmund a sniff away to Union Berlin. They trail 2-1 with around 20 minutes to play. \u201cFor some reason,\u201d says Stephen Cottrell, \u201cyour admission that you hadn\u2019t seen the chance in the West Ham game reminded me of Alan Partridge not having seen Driving Miss Daisy, or indeed Bangkok Chick Boys.\u201d Diverting stuff as always in the Premier League. These are the half-time scores. Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool (FT) Arsenal 0-0 Southampton Brentford 4-2 Wolves Leicester 1-0 Bournemouth Man City 1-1 Fulham West Ham 2-1 Ipswich Wolves can\u2019t stop conceding goals. Ethan Pinnock, weirdly unmarked at a corner, has headed powerfully past Sam Johnstone to put Brentford 4-2 ahead. Mohammed Kudus gives West Ham a deserved lead just before half-time. Michail Antonio\u2019s header hit the underside of the crossbar and Kudus hung in the air for an age to head past Arijanet Muric. The top of the Premier League table (as it stands) 43 min: Arsenal 0-0 Southampton Even though Arsenal have dominated throughout, Aaron Ramsdale hasn\u2019t had a save to make. Yet. West Ham 1-1 Ipswich Two near misses for West Ham: Mohammed Kudus hits the post when he should have scored*, then Tomas Soucek has a shot cleared off the line. * Allegedly, I haven\u2019t seen it Man City 1-1 Fulham \u201cI made this point earlier, but for a top side to not have a ready-made replacement for a key player - or even one that can do 90 per cent of the role - and have to use a squarer peg in the round hole left, is bordering on negligent, doubly so if you have almost unlimited oil wealth behind you,\u201d says Andy Flintoff. Maybe the problem is that, because it\u2019s such a specific role, the back up is unlikely to start more than 10 games a season when Rodri is fit, and anyone worth a damn won\u2019t settle for that. There aren\u2019t many top-class No6s who can also play another role. Declan Rice I guess, and City did go for him didn\u2019t they? I still The latest scores in our featured games Premier League Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool (FT) Arsenal 0-0 Southampton Brentford 3-2 Wolves Leicester 1-0 Bournemouth Man City 1-1 Fulham West Ham 1-1 Ipswich Bundesliga Leverkusen 2-1 Holstein Kiel (2.30pm) Union Berlin 2-0 Dortmund (2.30pm) \u201c\ufeffIt can only be a matter of time,\u201d begins Simon McMahon, \u201cbefore James didn\u2019t he say he was working Humphries mentions the 1991 Scottish Cup final. I still break out in a rash just thinking about it. Although 1987 was worse.\u201d Who needs that lumpen galoot Rodri? His replacement Mateo Kovacic has equalised for City, rapping a deflected (I think) shot past Bernd Leno after a corner was only half cleared. 30 min: Man City 0-1 Fulham Adama Traore has missed a superb chance to make it 2-0. It sounds like Fulham are really hurting City on the counter-attack. O Rodri, Rodri, wherefore art thou Rodri? WSL match report Tom Garry was at Broadfield Stadium to watch a dramatic and controversial match. Brentford have scored straight from the kick off again, but this time it\u2019s the fifth goal of the game. The captain Christian Norgaard, back in the team today, has put Brentford ahead for the third time. Both goals came when the opposition tried to play out and lost the ball. Jorgen Strand Larsen finished smartly at the near post; Norgaard passed the ball into the net after being put through by Vitaly Janelt. But hang on, there\u2019s a fifth goal. Hello! Andreas Pereira has put Fulham ahead at the Etihad, stretching to volley past Ederson from close range after a superb backheel from Raul Jimenez. The latest scores in our featured games Holstein Keil, who were 2-0 down to Leverkusen after eight minutes, are back in the game thanks to Max Geschwill\u2019s injury-time goal. He was set up by Lewis Holtby, once of Fulham, Spurs and Blackburn. Premier League Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool (FT) Arsenal 0-0 Southampton Brentford 2-1 Wolves Leicester 1-0 Bournemouth Man City 0-0 Fulham West Ham 1-1 Ipswich Bundesliga Leverkusen 2-1 Holstein Kiel (2.30pm) Union Berlin 2-0 Dortmund (2.30pm) Bryan Mbeumo has got his weekly goal, this time from the penalty spot after a wrestling match at a Brentford corner. It was given on advice from VAR, which is unlikely to have amused Gary O\u2019Neil. Championship Jesuran Rak-Sakyi, on loan from Crystal Palace, has put promotion-sniffing Sheffield United ahead against Luton. Michael Obafemi has done likewise for Plymouth at home to Blackburn. Facundo Buonanotte has put Leicester in front at the King Power Stadium with a fine solo goal. He cut inside from the right, beat a defender through sleight of hip and rammed a rising drive past Kepa. GOAL! Union Berlin 2-0 Dortmund (Vertessen 45) Union Berlin are (un)officially eight goals better than Celtic. St Mirren 0-0 Dundee United \u201cMcMahon\u2019s awful confident about the Buddies-Tangerines game, isn\u2019t he?\u201d says James Humphries. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve seen them both get... Well beat recently.\u201d Oh that\u2019s sheer delightful wordplay. The latest Premier League scores Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool (FT) Arsenal 0-0 Southampton Brentford 1-1 Wolves Leicester 0-0 Bournemouth Man City 0-0 Fulham West Ham 1-1 Ipswich That didn\u2019t take long either. The in-form Liam Delap has equalised for Ipswich, whacking a low shot on the turn that beat Alphonse Areola at the near post. Brentford really need to stop scoring so early. The underlapping Nelson Semedo finds space in the area and cuts tbe ball back to Matheus Cunha, who mishits (I think) a shot past Mark Flekken from 12 yards. This one was inside the first minute. Jarrod Bowen dragged a low cross towards the near post, where Michail Antonio swept a first-time shot into the net. This is absolutely bonkers. Brentford didn\u2019t quite manage to score inside the first minute for the fourth game in a row, but Nathan Collins has put them ahead against his old club after 75 seconds. He wandered forward from the back, kept going after laying the ball off and eventually headed Sepp van den Berg\u2019s cross into the net from six yards. On this day in 1991\u2026 Leeds close on the early leaders Man Utd after a seven-goal thriller at Elland Road. Bundesliga A bit more news from Germany, where Kevin Vogt\u2019s penalty has given Union Berlin the lead against Dortmund. If it stays like that they\u2019ll move above Dortmund in the table. On this day in 1993\u2026 Kevin Keegan\u2019s Newcastle put S-E-V-E-N past Notts County. WSL: Brighton 4-2 Aston Villa Nikita Parris scored her first goal for Brighton in an eventful victory over Aston Villa. There were six goals, two for Villa\u2019s Rachel Daly, and a red card apiece. John Brewin was at Selhurst Park to watch Diogo Jota keep Liverpool top of the Premier League. Here\u2019s what he made of it all. \u201cJames Humphries can rest easy at work: Scotland\u2019s game of the day is in Paisley, where St. Mirren host Dundee United,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cJim Goodwin\u2019s men have made a solid start on their return to the top league, taking nine points from their opening six games, and also defeated today\u2019s opponents in the Scottish League Cup back in August. So hopes are high of at least a point today, ahead of the international break, which would keep United above the Buddies and in the top six. \u201cA comfortable St. Mirren win then, to go with Hibs beating Motherwell at Easter Road, and Kilmarnock scudding Dundee at Dens. There\u2019s also a top of the table clash in the Scottish Championship at the Falkirk Stadium as the second place Bairns host the Honest Men of Ayr, who lead them by three points but have played two games more.\u201d GOAL! Leverkusen 2-0 Holstein Kiel (Hofmann 8) Yeah, a long afternoon ahead. Jonas Hofmann has made it 2-0 after a lamentable kick/pass by the goalkeeper Timon Weiner was blocked. I\u2019ve said it before, I\u2019ll say it again: John Beck\u2019s Cambridge never had this problem. On this day in 1985\u2026 After 10 straight wins at the start of the league, Manchester United are held to a draw by Luton. Look out for an astonishing miss by Paul Elliott. Bundesliga latest Victor Boniface has scored after four minutes to put the champions Leverkusen ahead against the bottom club Holstein Kiel. Could be a long afternoon. On this day in 1997\u2026 Patrik Berger\u2019s hat-trick does for Chelsea on Super Sunday. Championship Burnley missed the chance to go top when they were held to a goalless draw. Norwich gave Hull a beating and the substitute Louie Sibley earned Oxford a point at Portsmouth. Burnley 0-0 Preston Norwich 4-0 Hull Portsmouth 1-1 Oxford \u201cWas planning to be at Easter Road today for Hibs-Well; instead, I am at work,\u201d weeps James Humphries. \u201cIn line with how this week\u2019s gone so far, then, I\u2019m predicting 3-0 Hibs and at least one long-term injury for Motherwell. Fingers crossed that the reverse jinx works, but I wouldn\u2019t put money on it.\u201d Which reminds me: you can follow all the games I don\u2019t have the brain capacity/fingers to cover with our live scoreboard. Even if Erling Haaland scores 400 goals this afternoon, Liverpool will be Premier League leaders going into the international break. Diogo Jota\u2019s excellent early goal was enough to beat Crystal Palace, although things got a bit hairy towards the end and the substitute Vitezslav Jaros had to make an important save from Ebere Eze. \u201cLooking forward to the afternoon\u2019s action,\u201d says Jeremy Boyce. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it won\u2019t be too Premier League-centric, other footie is available. But as I know you\u2019re a multi-faceted sport fan like myself (I draw the line at horses and pugilism these days) I\u2019m wondering what you make of the America\u2019s Cup/LV Challenge these days? Obviously there\u2019s a lot of joy at Sir Jim\u2019s team today, qualifying for a ritual massacring at the hands of the master Peter Burling and his band of Kiwis. \u201cI can see that it\u2019s all highly technical these days and requires an incredible amount of coordination to constantly max the incredible new boats can achieve, not to mention the dosh to fund a challenge especially developing a boat and its foils. All great, but I\u2019ve a kind of hankering to see boats that are actually sitting on the water, not flying above it, with wooden masts and hemp ropes and real people heaving canvas up and down, rather than everything being run by machines. \u201cA bit like I prefer vinyl, books, craft beer.... I admit, I did buy myself a carbon fibre road bike, but the wheels stay on the road and it\u2019s your legs and lungs that move it forwards.\u201d I\u2019m sorry to say I know the square root of bugger all about the America\u2019s Cup. If it\u2019s any consolation, I\u2019m addicted to the smell of old books. Read Barney Ronay on, well, Euston station 78 min: Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool The leaders are still ahead thanks to Diogo Jota\u2019s early goal, but their goalkeeper Alisson has just gone off with what looks like a hamstring injury. You can follow the rest of the game with Scott Murray. West Ham are unchanged. Ipswich bring in Ben Johnson and Wes Burns for Axel Tuanzebe and Chiedozie Ogbene. Phil Foden starts a league game for the first time this season. He replaces Kyle Walker in the only change from last weekend\u2019s 1-1 draw at Newcastle; Rico Lewis will move to right-back. In-form Fulham also make one change: Sander Berge is preferred to Emile Smith Rowe. One change apiece. Leicester bring in Jordan Ayew for Harry WInks; Bournemouth prefer Justin Kluivert to Dango Ouatarra. The captain Christian Norgaard replaces Fabio Carvalho in Brentford\u2019s only change. Wolves bring in Craig Dawson and Carlos Forbs for Santiago Bueno and Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. Raheem Sterling makes his first Premier League start for Arsenal. Jorginho replaces the injured Jurrien Timber, with Thomas Partey likely to move to right-back. Gabriel Jesus also starts, with Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard rested. They are joined on the subs bench by Mikel Merino. Aaron Ramsdale starts against his old club. Southampton bring in Ryan Manning, Joe Aribo and Ross Stewart for Lesley Ugochukwu, Ryan Fraser and Maxwel Cornet. Arsenal (4-1-2-3) Raya; Partey, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Jorginho; Havertz, Rice; Saka, Jesus, Sterling. Substitutes: Neto, Lewis-Skelly, Tomiyasu, Kiwior, Merino, Nwaneri, Martinelli, Trossard, Butler-Oyedeji. Championship There are three early games, and these are the half-time scores. Burnley 0-0 Preston Norwich 2-0 Hull Portsmouth 0-0 Oxford Burnley will go top if they beat Preston. Norwich\u2019s goals were scored by Marcelino Nunez and Josh Sargent. Half time: Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool Diogo Jota\u2019s ruthless finish has put the leaders ahead at Selhurst Park. You can follow the second half with Scott Murray. Hello and welcome to another busy Saturday clockwatch. Arsenal and Manchester City are among the teams in action at 3pm, and both have the chance to keep pace with/go above Liverpool, depending on the result of the early game at Selhurst Park. We\u2019ll keep an eye on the important games elsewhere, from Burnley to Leverkusen, but our main focus will be these Premier League games.

The gunpowder residue was all over our hands. Under normal circumstances, they give you a gunpowder residue test and we would have been arrested immediately.\u201d The brothers have maintained that they killed their parents out of self-defense after enduring a lifetime of physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Attorneys for the men argue that under today\u2019s understanding of sexual abuse, they would not have been convicted of first-degree murder. Prosecutors in Los Angeles announced on Friday that they are reviewing new evidence in the case. The Los Angeles county district attorney, George Gasc\u00f3n, said during a news conference that the guilt of Erik Menendez, 53, and his 56-year-old brother, Lyle Menendez, was not in question, and his office was reviewing the case with a view to resentencing. The new evidence, Gasc\u00f3n said, includes a letter written by Erik Menendez that his attorneys say corroborates the allegations that he was sexually abused by his father. The brothers\u2019 attorney Mark Geragos has said the family always believed they should have been charged with manslaughter rather than murder. But after jury trials \u2013 the brothers were tried separately \u2013 ended in deadlock, jurors in a third trial were not offered a manslaughter option. The brothers, 21 and 18 at the time of the murders, admitted they fatally shot their entertainment executive father, Jose Menendez, and their mother, Kitty Menendez, in 1989. They said they feared their parents were about to kill them to prevent the disclosure of the father\u2019s long-term sexual molestation of Erik. Prosecutors claimed the murders were motivated by greed and committed because they feared they would be cut out of their parents\u2019 will. They had gone on a luxury spending spree after the murders and before they were arrested, including spending half a million dollars on clothes, Rolex watches and cars, a pattern of behavior richly detailed in the recent Netflix drama. In a statement on X posted by his wife, Erik Menendez called the show a \u201cdishonest portrayal\u201d of what happened that has taken them back to a time when prosecutors \u201cbuilt a narrative on a belief system that males were not sexually abused, and that males experience rape trauma differently from women\u201d. Kardashian wrote in her letter that the \u201cmedia turned the brothers into monsters and sensationalized eye candy \u2013 two arrogant, rich kids from Beverly Hills who killed their parents out of greed.

She was involved in petitioning Donald Trump to sign the 2018 bipartisan First Step Act, designed to reduce excessive sentences in the federal prison system and promote rehabilitation. The brothers, she wrote, were \u201crobbed of their childhoods by their parents, then robbed of any chance of freedom by a criminal justice system eager to punish them without considering the context or understanding the \u2018why\u2019, and without caring about whether the punishment fit the crime, Erik and Lyle were condemned before the trial even began\u201d. \u201cI have spent time with Lyle and Erik; they are not monsters,\u201d she added. \u201cThey are kind, intelligent and honest men.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "At least Mikel Arteta can always rely on Kai Havertz these days. The Arsenal striker scored for the seventh successive home game to match Robin van Persie\u2019s record and inspire a dramatic comeback after his side found themselves behind against struggling Southampton. Still without a win seven matches into the new campaign after being promoted last season, Russell Martin must have been dreaming of causing a major upset when the substitute Cameron Archer silenced the home crowd early in the second half. Havertz had other ideas and his equaliser three minutes later provided the impetus for Gabriel Martinelli to score a second before the outstanding Bukayo Saka wrapped up the points on a day that was almost one to remember for Aaron Ramsdale against his former club. \u201cHe wants more and he is not satisfied with what he is doing. There is still another level from him,\u201d Arteta said of Havertz\u2019s performance. \u201cSomething has changed in him and that confidence \u2013 you really sense it.

      "body": "<p>Zeppo Marx was said to be the funniest of the Marx Brothers off screen, yet he was overshadowed by his siblings Groucho, Chico and Harpo in comic masterpieces such as <em>Duck Soup</em> and <em>Monkey Business</em>.</p> <p>His own life was no laughing matter, however. A new biography reveals the extent of Zeppo\u2019s involvement with organised crime and mobsters who were involved in high-stakes gambling, drugs, prostitution, burglary and murder.</p> <p><a href=\"https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781493087969/Zeppo-The-Reluctant-Marx-Brother\"><em>Zeppo: The Reluctant Marx Brother</em></a> will be published in the UK in December. The author, Robert S Bader, told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cThis guy was really shady. It\u2019s hard to believe, but he was on this driven mission to make more money than his brothers, and he didn\u2019t care how he did it. But he never killed anybody, as far as I know.\u201d</p> <p>Born Herbert Marx in 1901, Zeppo was the youngest of the five brothers and appeared in the first five Marx Brothers films. He went on to became a successful talent agent, representing famous actors, and was friends with Frank Sinatra, who later had an affair with Zeppo\u2019s second wife,&nbsp;Barbara. </p> <p>But Bader found that Zeppo\u2019s associates also included mobsters Gus Greenbaum and Moe Sedway \u2013 whose names were combined for the gangster character Moe Greene in the <em>The Godfather</em>. Greenbaum, who took over the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas after the murder of co-founder Bugsy Siegel in 1947, was himself murdered by mobsters who suspected him of stealing their money.</p> <p>Another associate was Pat DiCicco, who worked for Charlie \u201cLucky\u201d Luciano, the underworld\u2019s notorious drug dealer.</p>    <p>Bader said: \u201cOne night at a boxing match in Los Angeles, DiCicco got into an argument with Zeppo, who punched him in the face and knocked him out. If anybody else had done that to Pat DiCicco, they probably would have been killed. But Zeppo was so well connected that it was overlooked. They didn\u2019t do anything to him. He was not frightened at all. He was one of them.\u201d</p> <p>Bader has spent years researching his book, speaking to people who knew Zeppo and studying court records. Zeppo was called before a grand jury in 1958 to testify over missing funds in a gambling syndicate, but never named his good friend Greenbaum, the biographer said. \u201cZeppo said that he just went to Las Vegas and paid some man who told him how much he owed. It was pretty obvious it was Greenbaum. Shortly after Zeppo\u2019s testimony, the mob paid Greenbaum a visit with a butcher\u2019s knife. Greenbaum was killed because he was skimming casino profits.\u201d</p> <p>Bader said Zeppo\u2019s brothers were so worried about the company he kept and his high-stakes gambling that they considered disowning him. \u201cHe would lose $100,000 playing cards and the next night he\u2019d win $200,000. The Marx brothers were frightened of this \u2026 They didn\u2019t want to have any connection to his debt.\u201d</p> <p>But the brothers were torn because they adored Zeppo. Bader said: \u201cThey were always personally close. They called each other almost every day \u2026 That\u2019s the way they were.\u201d</p> <p>Zeppo was such a funny, gifted raconteur that he would have Groucho crying with laughter.

      "bodyText": "Zeppo Marx was said to be the funniest of the Marx Brothers off screen, yet he was overshadowed by his siblings Groucho, Chico and Harpo in comic masterpieces such as Duck Soup and Monkey Business. His own life was no laughing matter, however. A new biography reveals the extent of Zeppo\u2019s involvement with organised crime and mobsters who were involved in high-stakes gambling, drugs, prostitution, burglary and murder. Zeppo: The Reluctant Marx Brother will be published in the UK in December. The author, Robert S Bader, told the Observer: \u201cThis guy was really shady. It\u2019s hard to believe, but he was on this driven mission to make more money than his brothers, and he didn\u2019t care how he did it. But he never killed anybody, as far as I know.\u201d Born Herbert Marx in 1901, Zeppo was the youngest of the five brothers and appeared in the first five Marx Brothers films. He went on to became a successful talent agent, representing famous actors, and was friends with Frank Sinatra, who later had an affair with Zeppo\u2019s second wife, Barbara. But Bader found that Zeppo\u2019s associates also included mobsters Gus Greenbaum and Moe Sedway \u2013 whose names were combined for the gangster character Moe Greene in the The Godfather. Greenbaum, who took over the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas after the murder of co-founder Bugsy Siegel in 1947, was himself murdered by mobsters who suspected him of stealing their money. Another associate was Pat DiCicco, who worked for Charlie \u201cLucky\u201d Luciano, the underworld\u2019s notorious drug dealer. Bader said: \u201cOne night at a boxing match in Los Angeles, DiCicco got into an argument with Zeppo, who punched him in the face and knocked him out. If anybody else had done that to Pat DiCicco, they probably would have been killed. But Zeppo was so well connected that it was overlooked. They didn\u2019t do anything to him. He was not frightened at all. He was one of them.\u201d Bader has spent years researching his book, speaking to people who knew Zeppo and studying court records. Zeppo was called before a grand jury in 1958 to testify over missing funds in a gambling syndicate, but never named his good friend Greenbaum, the biographer said. \u201cZeppo said that he just went to Las Vegas and paid some man who told him how much he owed. It was pretty obvious it was Greenbaum. Shortly after Zeppo\u2019s testimony, the mob paid Greenbaum a visit with a butcher\u2019s knife. Greenbaum was killed because he was skimming casino profits.\u201d Bader said Zeppo\u2019s brothers were so worried about the company he kept and his high-stakes gambling that they considered disowning him. \u201cHe would lose $100,000 playing cards and the next night he\u2019d win $200,000. The Marx brothers were frightened of this \u2026 They didn\u2019t want to have any connection to his debt.\u201d But the brothers were torn because they adored Zeppo. Bader said: \u201cThey were always personally close. They called each other almost every day \u2026 That\u2019s the way they were.\u201d Zeppo was such a funny, gifted raconteur that he would have Groucho crying with laughter. But, away from the family, he mixed as easily with mobsters as movie stars. The late Susan Marx, widow of Harpo, told Bader that a 1940s Hollywood fundraising gala was \u201cfilled with mobsters\u201d: \u201cZeppo was walking around the room saying hello to all of them. She said to Harpo, \u2018How come Zeppo knows all these guys?\u2019\u201d Bader\u2019s detective work has also linked Zeppo to a series of 1930s jewellery heists from Hollywood stars, in which the thieves sold back the jewels to the insurance company. \u201cI\u2019ve made a pretty clear case that Zeppo was deeply involved in this. He might have even organised it because it\u2019s when he was raising money to buy into a talent agency, and he\u2019s the only two-time victim of this whole scheme. He didn\u2019t have the money, but then he suddenly had the money.\u201d After his acting career, Zeppo represented some of the biggest earners in Hollywood. In the 1940s at the height of their success, he represented Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. He put together a package that made the classic movie Double Indemnity, which starred his two biggest clients. In a statement, Tim Marx, son of Zeppo, said that Bader has \u201caccurately portrayed my father as a charming, funny but narcissistic individual\u201d. Bader added: \u201cIf the story of the Marx Brothers is a triumphant showbusiness tale, Zeppo\u2019s is a dimly lit film noir based on a gritty crime novel. He kept most of his life secret from even his closest friends, and I\u2019m thrilled to have pieced it together.\u201d",

Not because I was into \u201cfootball-related disorder\u201d \u2013 the official term \u2013 but because, during the 1980s and 90s, hooliganism was all over the news, and everyone knew someone who knew someone in decent trainers who spent their Saturdays in a rolling street-by-street fight with supporters from a different team. Even if you hated it (and I\u2019m no fan of violence), it was considered to be just part of everyday life.</p> <p>Is this sort of aggro missed today, in these modern-game times of Saudi Arabian owners, made-for-concerts stadiums and never-ending match analysis? Well, yes and no. No, because kicking people\u2019s faces in is obviously horrible. And yes, because an anything-can-happen atmosphere can bring cheap thrills into a dull life and even duller corporatism. In <em>The English Disease</em>, journalist Sam Diss allows both sides of the story to be told. He and his friends grew up with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2004/oct/03/features.review57\">The Football Factory</a></em> and he went to West Ham games with his dad, including the last match in the Hammers\u2019 old Upton Park home: \u201cIt was aggy and angry and weirdly joyous and celebratory in this strange ceremonial sort of way,\u201d he says.</p>    <p>In the first two episodes, Diss talks to academics and the writer Bill Buford (who wrote <em>Among the Thugs</em>), as well as ex-hoolies Jack, who supports West Ham, and Charlie, who\u2019s a Nottingham Forest supporter. Jack, in particular, is very articulate as to why anyone might want to be involved, though it\u2019s Charlie who comes up with the killer quote. \u201cIt\u2019s how we communicate with ourselves, through violence,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how we are born, it\u2019s how we are bred. Look at middle-class guys; they\u2019re born with richness, wealth, money, mixing \u2013 they turn out that way. But we\u2019re not. We\u2019re born in different fires. We answer to a different fucking god.\u201d</p> <p>Diss lets the subject stretch, articulates his own mixed feelings in his excellent script. It\u2019s his lyricism and understanding that makes this series more than just chin-scratching aggro porn (see: Ross Kemp). The whole show reminds me of the features in the <em>Face</em> in the 90s by writers such as Gavin Hills. It takes a particular aspect of working-class culture seriously \u2013 wondering why something is happening, picking at the data, testing the feelings as well as the facts \u2013 and in doing so, gives it a status, if not a pass. Rather than dismissing it as something to be stamped out and legislated against. Highly recommended.</p>    <p>Here\u2019s some more \u201cheyday of magazines\u201d references for you.

Hosted by Franki Cookney and Lucy Douglas, the first episode started off a little stiffly and poshly, but once Cookney and Douglas got stuck into analysing an actual issue, a 1982 edition of <em>Cosmopolitan</em>, it became richly interesting. One article, about women\u2019s contraceptive options, was written by a man, featured only male experts and didn\u2019t have any case studies; another piece featured Erin Pizzey (who started Refuge) and her then husband Jeff Shapiro offering \u201cadvice\u201d to some poor guy called David about his sex life. Pizzey and Shapiro met David face to face to do this, in 1980s Esther Perel style, except they were really mean to him and kept telling him to put up and shut up. Poor David. \u201cHe\u2019s really been stitched up,\u201d says Cookney. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unhinged,\u201d says Douglas.</p> <p>There\u2019s a fun advert section, where Cookney and Douglas read out the adverts in the magazine, which made me laugh. It\u2019s all good stuff, though it would be nice if they had the odd guest. On occasion, just because of their youth, they make assumptions that would be challenged if they talked to an editor from the time they\u2019re discussing. So they wondered if Aids would have affected the contraception piece (no, not in 1982) and commented, re a Tampax advert, that Charles made his excruciating tampon phone call to Camilla back then (that didn\u2019t come out until 1993). Still, this was an entertaining dive into the social mores of the time, which are all too easy to misremember (if you\u2019re older), or misunderstand (if you\u2019re younger).

The wider Middle East conflict that so many feared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/missile-attack-on-israel-signals-that-widely-feared-regional-conflict-has-ignited\">is igniting</a>. Almost exactly a year after Hamas\u2019s 7 October terrorist atrocities, Israel is fighting on multiple fronts. Iran is now the principal adversary. Israeli leaders, including the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, maintain that it always was. Netanyahu has long sought this showdown.</p> <p>Self-deluding boasts that Israel is \u201cwinning\u201d, bruited about after the assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, drown out calls to halt the madness. Despite their otiose talk of changing the regional balance of power, Netanyahu, his far-right allies and generals lack a credible, long-term political strategy. Their whack-a-mole tactics condemn Israel and neighbours to <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/haaretz-today/2024-09-30/ty-article/.highlight/for-netanyahus-government-the-endgame-of-war-is-war/00000192-43b3-d755-add7-63f7b7700000\">war without end</a>.</p> <p>The same may be said of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ayatollah-ali-khamenei\">Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a> and the religious extremists who dominate Iran\u2019s regime \u2013 and the surviving leaders of Iran\u2019s proxies Hamas and Hezbollah. Nor should western reactionaries such as Donald Trump escape blame. All contribute to a destructive continuum of confrontation, violence and misery that is <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/09/29/can-israel-kill-to-victory-over-hezbollah/\">intensifying once again</a>.</p> <p>On every side, the self-fulfilling prophecies and divisive agendas of regressive, intolerant forces are acted out in blood. Hard-right fanatics typically expect the worst, reject conciliation and compromise, stick to their guns. And, sure enough, the worst happens. Moderate voices, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/25/iran-masoud-pezeshkian-un-speech\">Iran\u2019s new president</a>, are shouted down. Hapless Joe Biden is humiliated. The UN is <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/2/israels-katz-bars-un-chief-from-country-over-iran-attack-response\">slandered and ostracised</a>, its aid workers killed. Peace becomes a dirty word. As&nbsp;ever, ordinary people suffer most. More than 1 million displaced in Lebanon; at least 1,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/israel-strikes-yemen-lebanon-attack-hezbollah-middle-east-war-latest\">killed in the past fortnight</a>. More than 41,000 Palestinians dead in Gaza; almost the entire population homeless. Israeli citizens murdered, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/something-terrible-has-happened-israelis-in-jaffa-recall-shock-of-terror-attack\">as in Jaffa last week</a>, and thousands forced to flee; 101 hostages still unaccounted for.</p> <p>How does this end? In short, badly \u2013 for all concerned.&nbsp;The Tehran regime has cornered itself. Iranians revile its economic failures, corruption and repression. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/address-iran-netanyahu-says-nowhere-middle-east-out-israels-reach-2024-09-30/\">Netanyahu taunts it</a>, predicting a second Islamic revolution. The US and Europe, which had sought to repair ties, give up on it. Its reformers are sidelined by war.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One scenario: Iran could go all-out to build nuclear weapons. If\u00a0that happens, the US may get involved militarily</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Will Iran\u2019s regime fall? Unlikely, given the mullahs\u2019 iron grip. Following last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/israel-iranian-oil-refineries-retaliatory-strikes\">180-missile attack</a>, Israel&nbsp;wants more than ever to destroy its nuclear programme. One scenario: Iran, shaken by Israeli successes, could go all-out to build nuclear weapons. If&nbsp;that happens, the US may get involved militarily. It may anyway, like it or not, in coming days. What price then Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cnew order\u201d?</p> <p>US regional standing has hit its lowest point since Iraq. For a superpower, it\u2019s embarrassing. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/netanyahu-not-biden-setting-agenda-middle-east-rcna173149\">The Israeli tail wags the American dog</a>. Biden is repeatedly played for a&nbsp;fool. He keeps sending arms, partly because Democrats want Jewish votes next month. Knowing this, Netanyahu&nbsp;ignores him.</p> <p>Despite numerous post-7 October visits by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/antony-blinken\">Antony Blinken</a>, Biden\u2019s secretary of state, there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-823045\">still no Gaza ceasefire</a>. The main US aim \u2013 preventing region-wide escalation \u2013 is in ruins. What are the chances of a successful diplomatic push to halt the death spiral? Right now, zilch. Last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/pms-rejection-of-lebanon-ceasefire-plan-shatters-ties-with-biden-tv-report/\">Lebanon ceasefire plan fell flat</a>. It\u2019s like 1914 out there. So many angry, misguided young men, spoiling for a fight.</p> <p>Blinken still <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/antony-blinken-americas-strategy-renewal-leadership-new-world\">talks, wishfully, about \u201cnormalisation\u201d</a> between Israel and its Arab neighbours. Yet the basic precondition, progress towards a Palestinian state, is flatly rejected by Netanyahu. At the UN, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-is-dragging-region-into-war-must-be-stopped-jordan-says-2024-09-27/\">Jordan</a> and the Saudis told Netanyahu: recognise Palestinian independence, and <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/jordanian-fm-arab-world-willing-to-guarantee-israels-security-if-palestinian-state-established/\">57 Arab and Muslim countries</a> will make their peace with the Jews. Is this so hard?</p> <p>Talking of peace, Britain\u2019s Keir Starmer wants the war to end \u2013 in the Middle East and in Ukraine, too. Fine. But how come Britain sends the RAF to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2krlgekpxo\">defend Israelis</a> but not the citizens of Kyiv and Kharkiv \u2013 or Palestinian families cowering in Gaza? These are questions for all western leaders, not just Starmer.</p> <p>Cynical opportunists don\u2019t want this to end, at least not yet. Trump exploits the horror, claiming that Kamala&nbsp;Harris, his White House rival, is presiding, with&nbsp;Biden, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/trump-blasts-harris-iran-biden-administration-leading-world-war-iii-00181938\">over a third world war</a>. Trump hopes the war&nbsp;is Harris\u2019s damaging \u201cOctober surprise\u201d. Yet he himself has no clue. If re-elected, he\u2019d give Netanyahu a&nbsp;free ride to Armageddon.</p> <p>One little-considered escalatory danger is a pro-Iranian militia <a href=\"https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/will-iraq-follow-lebanons-disastrous-path/\">takeover in divided Iraq</a>, similar to how Hezbollah turned Lebanon into a failed state. After Nasrallah, there\u2019s a vacancy at the top of the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d. Another danger: Syria\u2019s Bashar&nbsp;al-Assad, Iran\u2019s ally, could be drawn in. Israel is already <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/israeli-strike-kills-three-civilians-in-syrias-damascus-state-tv-says\">bombing Damascus</a>.</p> <p>Iran may back off for now; or, if counter-attacked by Israel, may precipitate the unconstrained conflict it says it doesn\u2019t want. In fact, neither country wants all-out war. For, in the end, it all comes back to Palestine. The absence of a long-term Israeli strategy for rehabilitating&nbsp;Gaza and working with the Palestinian Authority towards a lasting settlement is the&nbsp;fundamental problem.</p> <p>Like Iran itself, Hamas and Hezbollah are not ultimately \u201cdestroyable\u201d.

      "bodyText": "So it\u2019s finally happening. The wider Middle East conflict that so many feared is igniting. Almost exactly a year after Hamas\u2019s 7 October terrorist atrocities, Israel is fighting on multiple fronts. Iran is now the principal adversary. Israeli leaders, including the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, maintain that it always was. Netanyahu has long sought this showdown. Self-deluding boasts that Israel is \u201cwinning\u201d, bruited about after the assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, drown out calls to halt the madness. Despite their otiose talk of changing the regional balance of power, Netanyahu, his far-right allies and generals lack a credible, long-term political strategy. Their whack-a-mole tactics condemn Israel and neighbours to war without end. The same may be said of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the religious extremists who dominate Iran\u2019s regime \u2013 and the surviving leaders of Iran\u2019s proxies Hamas and Hezbollah. Nor should western reactionaries such as Donald Trump escape blame. All contribute to a destructive continuum of confrontation, violence and misery that is intensifying once again. On every side, the self-fulfilling prophecies and divisive agendas of regressive, intolerant forces are acted out in blood. Hard-right fanatics typically expect the worst, reject conciliation and compromise, stick to their guns. And, sure enough, the worst happens. Moderate voices, such as Iran\u2019s new president, are shouted down. Hapless Joe Biden is humiliated. The UN is slandered and ostracised, its aid workers killed. Peace becomes a dirty word. As ever, ordinary people suffer most. More than 1 million displaced in Lebanon; at least 1,000 killed in the past fortnight. More than 41,000 Palestinians dead in Gaza; almost the entire population homeless. Israeli citizens murdered, as in Jaffa last week, and thousands forced to flee; 101 hostages still unaccounted for. How does this end? In short, badly \u2013 for all concerned. The Tehran regime has cornered itself. Iranians revile its economic failures, corruption and repression. Netanyahu taunts it, predicting a second Islamic revolution. The US and Europe, which had sought to repair ties, give up on it. Its reformers are sidelined by war. Will Iran\u2019s regime fall? Unlikely, given the mullahs\u2019 iron grip. Following last week\u2019s 180-missile attack, Israel wants more than ever to destroy its nuclear programme. One scenario: Iran, shaken by Israeli successes, could go all-out to build nuclear weapons. If that happens, the US may get involved militarily. It may anyway, like it or not, in coming days. What price then Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cnew order\u201d? US regional standing has hit its lowest point since Iraq. For a superpower, it\u2019s embarrassing. The Israeli tail wags the American dog. Biden is repeatedly played for a fool. He keeps sending arms, partly because Democrats want Jewish votes next month. Knowing this, Netanyahu ignores him. Despite numerous post-7 October visits by Antony Blinken, Biden\u2019s secretary of state, there\u2019s still no Gaza ceasefire. The main US aim \u2013 preventing region-wide escalation \u2013 is in ruins. What are the chances of a successful diplomatic push to halt the death spiral? Right now, zilch. Last week\u2019s Lebanon ceasefire plan fell flat. It\u2019s like 1914 out there. So many angry, misguided young men, spoiling for a fight. Blinken still talks, wishfully, about \u201cnormalisation\u201d between Israel and its Arab neighbours. Yet the basic precondition, progress towards a Palestinian state, is flatly rejected by Netanyahu. At the UN, Jordan and the Saudis told Netanyahu: recognise Palestinian independence, and 57 Arab and Muslim countries will make their peace with the Jews. Is this so hard? Talking of peace, Britain\u2019s Keir Starmer wants the war to end \u2013 in the Middle East and in Ukraine, too. Fine. But how come Britain sends the RAF to defend Israelis but not the citizens of Kyiv and Kharkiv \u2013 or Palestinian families cowering in Gaza? These are questions for all western leaders, not just Starmer. Cynical opportunists don\u2019t want this to end, at least not yet. Trump exploits the horror, claiming that Kamala Harris, his White House rival, is presiding, with Biden, over a third world war. Trump hopes the war is Harris\u2019s damaging \u201cOctober surprise\u201d. Yet he himself has no clue. If re-elected, he\u2019d give Netanyahu a free ride to Armageddon. One little-considered escalatory danger is a pro-Iranian militia takeover in divided Iraq, similar to how Hezbollah turned Lebanon into a failed state. After Nasrallah, there\u2019s a vacancy at the top of the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d. Another danger: Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad, Iran\u2019s ally, could be drawn in. Israel is already bombing Damascus. Iran may back off for now; or, if counter-attacked by Israel, may precipitate the unconstrained conflict it says it doesn\u2019t want. In fact, neither country wants all-out war. For, in the end, it all comes back to Palestine. The absence of a long-term Israeli strategy for rehabilitating Gaza and working with the Palestinian Authority towards a lasting settlement is the fundamental problem. Like Iran itself, Hamas and Hezbollah are not ultimately \u201cdestroyable\u201d. The threat from Lebanon cannot be eliminated by arms alone. Without political solutions, West Bank Palestinian-Jewish settler violence will continue, too. Why wouldn\u2019t it? Netanyahu\u2019s self-serving, short-term military gambles \u2013 \u201che has no plan for the morning after, anywhere\u201d \u2013 presage not victory but a strategic \u201cdisaster\u201d, wrote the American commentator Tom Friedman. And here\u2019s the thing: measured in terms of its chronic insecurity, global reputational damage, severe economic self-harm, breaches of international law, and surges in antisemitism, boycotts and disinvestment, Israel has already lost, big-time. All of which underscores the original question: how does this end? Answer: it probably doesn\u2019t. Like a modern rerun of the hundred years war, this Middle East conflict, rooted in injustice, hate and fear since 1948, may eventually be paused but it will not stop. As long as rightwing extremists and religious zealots hold sway, fanning the flames and obstructing a just political solution, everyone\u2019s a loser. \u2022 Simon Tisdall is the Observer\u2019s Foreign Affairs Commentator Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "body": "<p>My partner and I were relatively early adopters of an electric vehicle, buying a Renault Zoe in autumn 2020 during the pandemic. It seemed to make sense to get aboard. After all, the future was electric, wasn\u2019t it?</p> <p>After the first year, I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/08/streets-ahead-what-ive-learned-from-my-year-with-an-electric-car\">wrote an article in this paper</a> about what the experience was like. It was something of a saga. We discovered the charging infrastructure was a chaotic world of different companies and apps. We experienced \u2013 and overcame \u2013 range anxiety (will the car go as far as the battery says?), only for it to be replaced by charge anxiety (can you find a charger that works?). We underwent lifestyle changes, some good (like more train use), some bad (like gender division setting in over apps and charging points). We didn\u2019t dare undertake a 700-mile drive across France. But in spite of the difficulties, the article ended on a relatively positive note.</p> <p>What we assumed then was that the government would steadily make things easier for electric vehicles. But while we are now used to the electric way of life, many of the original difficulties and disadvantages remain. Four years down the line, which is when the finance agreement on our car runs out, we find ourselves looking for another car while asking a heretical question: is electric worth the effort?&nbsp;Life might be so much easier if we gave up.</p> <p>In our \u201capproaching the end of finance agreement\u201d conversation with the dealership, we learn that we are not alone. \u201cWe took it for granted,\u201d says the dealer \u201cthat you were coming to look at a hybrid. Everybody else is.\u201d Statistics released last week show his perception is right: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/19/car-industry-calls-for-shift-in-eu-emissions-targets-amid-slowing-ev-sales\">enthusiasm for EVs has stalled</a> and the motor industry is failing to meet its mandatory sales targets.</p> <p>Our dealer is taken aback when we say we\u2019re still open to the idea of an electric car, especially because our profile is unusual. Unlike most EV drivers, we don\u2019t have a drive on which to park and charge the car outside our house, but we are reliant on public charge points, in our case mainly lamp-post chargers in the south-west London borough of Wandsworth. Nor is the car an urban runaround \u2013 any car journey undertaken, however long, is electric. The dealer is surprised we didn\u2019t chuck it in ages ago.</p> <p>But our experience has been genuinely mixed. Electric cars are technically uncomplicated, so there\u2019s much less to go wrong. Our car has been exceptionally reliable. We\u2019re still well under our guarantee (100,000 miles). Charging the car from lamp-posts is second nature. The chargers are out of order less often and most payment apps work in broadly similar ways. We spend far less time ringing helplines. But many of the expected improvements haven\u2019t happened. There is still no single card with which to pay at all chargers, and journeys out of home territory are likely to require downloading further apps. There are still areas that are charger deserts. We recently abandoned the idea of driving to East Yorkshire because of the lack of chargers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are so many things it would be nice not to have to worry about, like 'hunt the working charger'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As for the fast chargers in service stations, again the picture is mixed. There are more \u201cbig supplier\u201d garages with 20 or so chargers, and fast chargers are pretty fast.

      "bodyText": "My partner and I were relatively early adopters of an electric vehicle, buying a Renault Zoe in autumn 2020 during the pandemic. It seemed to make sense to get aboard. After all, the future was electric, wasn\u2019t it? After the first year, I wrote an article in this paper about what the experience was like. It was something of a saga. We discovered the charging infrastructure was a chaotic world of different companies and apps. We experienced \u2013 and overcame \u2013 range anxiety (will the car go as far as the battery says?), only for it to be replaced by charge anxiety (can you find a charger that works?). We underwent lifestyle changes, some good (like more train use), some bad (like gender division setting in over apps and charging points). We didn\u2019t dare undertake a 700-mile drive across France. But in spite of the difficulties, the article ended on a relatively positive note. What we assumed then was that the government would steadily make things easier for electric vehicles. But while we are now used to the electric way of life, many of the original difficulties and disadvantages remain. Four years down the line, which is when the finance agreement on our car runs out, we find ourselves looking for another car while asking a heretical question: is electric worth the effort? Life might be so much easier if we gave up. In our \u201capproaching the end of finance agreement\u201d conversation with the dealership, we learn that we are not alone. \u201cWe took it for granted,\u201d says the dealer \u201cthat you were coming to look at a hybrid. Everybody else is.\u201d Statistics released last week show his perception is right: enthusiasm for EVs has stalled and the motor industry is failing to meet its mandatory sales targets. Our dealer is taken aback when we say we\u2019re still open to the idea of an electric car, especially because our profile is unusual. Unlike most EV drivers, we don\u2019t have a drive on which to park and charge the car outside our house, but we are reliant on public charge points, in our case mainly lamp-post chargers in the south-west London borough of Wandsworth. Nor is the car an urban runaround \u2013 any car journey undertaken, however long, is electric. The dealer is surprised we didn\u2019t chuck it in ages ago. But our experience has been genuinely mixed. Electric cars are technically uncomplicated, so there\u2019s much less to go wrong. Our car has been exceptionally reliable. We\u2019re still well under our guarantee (100,000 miles). Charging the car from lamp-posts is second nature. The chargers are out of order less often and most payment apps work in broadly similar ways. We spend far less time ringing helplines. But many of the expected improvements haven\u2019t happened. There is still no single card with which to pay at all chargers, and journeys out of home territory are likely to require downloading further apps. There are still areas that are charger deserts. We recently abandoned the idea of driving to East Yorkshire because of the lack of chargers. As for the fast chargers in service stations, again the picture is mixed. There are more \u201cbig supplier\u201d garages with 20 or so chargers, and fast chargers are pretty fast. But many service stations have just a few and, as numbers of EVs increase, so does the pressure on chargers. On a recent journey back from Lincoln, we encountered long queues at three motorway service stations, each with only six chargers. No real EV queue etiquette has evolved, so it was stressful, wondering if after a long wait someone would push in. Fortunately, EV drivers are a reasonable bunch so there were no arguments. I still resent not being able to do longer journeys without elaborate planning and constant just-below-the-surface anxiety about charging. What about the finances?

      "body": "<p>Can you imagine buying a flat without ever actually stepping inside it? And then doing up the entire place \u2013 bashing down walls, jettisoning fittings and reshuffling the floorplan \u2013 remotely? For most of us the answer would be an emphatic, \u201cOf course not!\u201d</p> <p>Kim Verbist would say otherwise. The Belgian interior designer did all of the above when she embarked on the convention-defying transformation of her Brussels apartment, set on the 11th floor of a Brutalist block designed by architect Jacques Wybauw.</p> <p>Covid played its part. Verbist and her partner, Sofie Van Waeyenberge, were enjoying a break at their weekend cottage on a beach in the Netherlands when lockdown struck. They had just bought the apartment, sealing the deal with a text \u201csent at midnight\u201d. Previously occupied by a penniless aristocrat, the property had been untouched for decades. With its dark corridors and a damp-ridden bathroom, it was the definitive fixer-upper.</p>    <p>Verbist was unfazed. The couple\u2019s previous city home, a few blocks down the road, had been designed by the same architect. \u201cI know how his structures work; which walls I could knock down. I knew the materials would be sound,\u201d she says. Her secondary school was also by Wybauw. In a city better known for its sinuous art-nouveau townhouses, the teenage Verbist learned to appreciate then-unfashionable 1970s architecture. \u201cThe light\u2026 the way the spaces flowed. His design is in my DNA.\u201d</p> <p>It also helped that before setting up her own practice specialising in retail and residential properties, Verbist worked for several large hotel chains. That experience, of tempering creativity to fit budgets and space, is evident here. The apartment is compact, but like a luxurious hotel suite, it has everything you need. The central living, cooking and dining area \u2013 \u201cWe spend hours talking over meals\u201d \u2013 is flanked by two bedrooms, one of which doubles as a study and guest room for Verbist\u2019s daughter. There are also two bathrooms and hidden a utility room.</p>    <p>The catalyst for the tutti-frutti colour scheme was a kelim rug. Hauled home from a trip to Istanbul 30 years ago, it has travelled with the couple from home to home ever since. \u201cThe dogs have eaten bits of it. But that doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d says Verbist. Counterintuitively, painting the rooms different colours \u2013 Tuscan pink, emerald green, cocoa brown \u2013 makes the space feel larger. It is even more impressive when you remember that this was all done remotely, Verbist\u2019s customary early-morning site visits carried out on WhatsApp and Zoom.</p> <p>But even professionals have wobbly moments. The first time she saw the apartment was the day the decorators whisked off the dust sheets to unveil the finished project. \u201cI looked at the terracotta walls and thought: this is horrible. We\u2019ll have to put our boxes in the middle of the room and start again.\u201d A mildly cross Van Waeyenberge urged patience. She was right. \u201cOnce we\u2019d unpacked everything it all came together as I\u2019d imagined it would.\u201d</p>    <p>Moving from a larger home they cherrypicked favourite furnishings and possessions. \u201cWe started in a large townhouse and have been downsizing ever since. Which is the opposite of what most people do. But I like the process of refining your belongings.\u201d</p> <p>The majestic, veneer-clad 1950s TV came from Van Waeyenberge\u2019s grandparents\u2019 appliance shop. The glazed white cabinet, eerily scented with pharmaceutical aromas, began life in a doctor\u2019s practice and houses their collection of pottery. In the guest room, a bedside table is made from a fallen ash tree from Verbist\u2019s father\u2019s country garden on the border with France. Aset of graphic midcentury Polish film posters was a present from a friend, whose father was a diplomat in Cold War Warsaw. Everything captures her precise aesthetic: \u201cI like colour, reusing things, minimal plastic \u2013 and not too many designer pieces.\u201d</p> <p>Half-walls zone the living space. The reading nook was designed to fit the twin sofas recovered in a deep blue velvet; mirrored shelving glimmers by night. Opposite, the kitchen cabinets are from Ikea, a curvy island, made to fit, houses more storage. Underfoot, she swapped floor tiles for warmer parquet, inspired by the original flooring. Next to this, a deep window ledge and stools double as a bar for breakfast with a southerly view. In winter, the dogs bask in the warmth of underfloor heating.</p> <p>There is more ingenuity in the main bedroom. A shower room is lined in one-way glass next to a neat dressing area. The bed floats on a podium (built to conceal pipework), the dramatic flourish echoed in the carpet. Woven with lush flowers lifted from a Dutch old master, it creeps up the wall like a fluffy mural. Friends are divided about this defiantly un-Belgian 1970s touch. But, like everything else in this norm-spurning home, it works.</p>",

They had just bought the apartment, sealing the deal with a text \u201csent at midnight\u201d. Previously occupied by a penniless aristocrat, the property had been untouched for decades. With its dark corridors and a damp-ridden bathroom, it was the definitive fixer-upper. Verbist was unfazed. The couple\u2019s previous city home, a few blocks down the road, had been designed by the same architect. \u201cI know how his structures work; which walls I could knock down. I knew the materials would be sound,\u201d she says. Her secondary school was also by Wybauw. In a city better known for its sinuous art-nouveau townhouses, the teenage Verbist learned to appreciate then-unfashionable 1970s architecture. \u201cThe light\u2026 the way the spaces flowed. His design is in my DNA.\u201d It also helped that before setting up her own practice specialising in retail and residential properties, Verbist worked for several large hotel chains. That experience, of tempering creativity to fit budgets and space, is evident here. The apartment is compact, but like a luxurious hotel suite, it has everything you need. The central living, cooking and dining area \u2013 \u201cWe spend hours talking over meals\u201d \u2013 is flanked by two bedrooms, one of which doubles as a study and guest room for Verbist\u2019s daughter. There are also two bathrooms and hidden a utility room. The catalyst for the tutti-frutti colour scheme was a kelim rug. Hauled home from a trip to Istanbul 30 years ago, it has travelled with the couple from home to home ever since. \u201cThe dogs have eaten bits of it. But that doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d says Verbist. Counterintuitively, painting the rooms different colours \u2013 Tuscan pink, emerald green, cocoa brown \u2013 makes the space feel larger. It is even more impressive when you remember that this was all done remotely, Verbist\u2019s customary early-morning site visits carried out on WhatsApp and Zoom. But even professionals have wobbly moments. The first time she saw the apartment was the day the decorators whisked off the dust sheets to unveil the finished project. \u201cI looked at the terracotta walls and thought: this is horrible. We\u2019ll have to put our boxes in the middle of the room and start again.\u201d A mildly cross Van Waeyenberge urged patience. She was right. \u201cOnce we\u2019d unpacked everything it all came together as I\u2019d imagined it would.\u201d Moving from a larger home they cherrypicked favourite furnishings and possessions. \u201cWe started in a large townhouse and have been downsizing ever since. Which is the opposite of what most people do. But I like the process of refining your belongings.\u201d The majestic, veneer-clad 1950s TV came from Van Waeyenberge\u2019s grandparents\u2019 appliance shop. The glazed white cabinet, eerily scented with pharmaceutical aromas, began life in a doctor\u2019s practice and houses their collection of pottery. In the guest room, a bedside table is made from a fallen ash tree from Verbist\u2019s father\u2019s country garden on the border with France. Aset of graphic midcentury Polish film posters was a present from a friend, whose father was a diplomat in Cold War Warsaw. Everything captures her precise aesthetic: \u201cI like colour, reusing things, minimal plastic \u2013 and not too many designer pieces.\u201d Half-walls zone the living space. The reading nook was designed to fit the twin sofas recovered in a deep blue velvet; mirrored shelving glimmers by night. Opposite, the kitchen cabinets are from Ikea, a curvy island, made to fit, houses more storage. Underfoot, she swapped floor tiles for warmer parquet, inspired by the original flooring. Next to this, a deep window ledge and stools double as a bar for breakfast with a southerly view. In winter, the dogs bask in the warmth of underfloor heating. There is more ingenuity in the main bedroom. A shower room is lined in one-way glass next to a neat dressing area. The bed floats on a podium (built to conceal pipework), the dramatic flourish echoed in the carpet. Woven with lush flowers lifted from a Dutch old master, it creeps up the wall like a fluffy mural. Friends are divided about this defiantly un-Belgian 1970s touch. But, like everything else in this norm-spurning home, it works.",

Hundreds of women and men turned out in solidarity with the woman at the centre of a case that has shocked the world. Members of the Pelicot family did not attend but said they appreciated the public support. One woman on the march told French reporters: \u201cI am there as a woman, mother and grandmother \u2026 I am here firstly to support Gis\u00e8le, who is really very brave, and other women and girls.\u201d She said she hoped the case would persuade people to \u201clisten to women \u2026 and not close their eyes\u201d to sexual abuse. On Friday, judges at the mass rape trial in Avignon agreed to allow videos made by Dominique Pelicot of the alleged abuse of his wife to be shown to the press and public in the courtroom. The president of the bench, Roger Arata, had argued the court should be cleared of those not directly involved in the case because the videos represented an affront to public decency and were too \u201cshocking\u201d. The bench agreed to allow them to be screened in open court after Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s lawyers insisted their client wanted them shown. As Pelicot, 72, was drugged to the point of being comatose, she has no memory of the rapes and says the videos are proof of what she suffered. A majority of the 50 men accused of raping her have denied the charges, saying they thought she was pretending to be asleep and they had acted with the consent of her husband. Antoine Camus, one of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s lawyers, told the court: \u201cThe great majority of those accused say they did not have the impression they were committing a rape. A perception is subjective, everyone can have a different one of the same event.

Dominique Pelicot, a retired electrician, recruited men from an online chatroom called \u201cWithout their Knowledge\u201d and invited them to the couple\u2019s house in Mazan near Carpentras in Provence after drugging his wife with sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication mixed with her evening meal or wine. The father of three, 71, who was caught only after a security guard found him filming up the skirt of a female customer in a local supermarket and called the police in 2020, has pleaded guilty to aggravated rape over a period of 10 years. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who has become a symbol for feminists angered at France\u2019s failure to respond to the #MeToo movement and confront widespread sexual abuse, has said police saved her life. Another 30 men shown on almost 20,000 videos and photographs police discovered on a USB drive attached to Dominique Pelicot\u2019s home computer have yet to be identified. The court case will continue until the end of December. The accused face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.",

But for anyone who was lucky enough to be there, Arc day in 2006 was as memorable as any of recent decades, and it was all thanks to the horse that crossed the line in&nbsp;third.</p> \n<p>Deep Impact was not the first runner from Japan in Europe\u2019s most prestigious all-aged race. But he was, by a long way, the most popular, and the combination of a horse with an aura of invincibility and his superstar jockey, Yutaka Take, persuaded tens of thousands of fans to make the 12,500-mile round trip to Paris for a two-and-a-half minute horse race.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/04/sosie-leads-quiet-maestro-andre-fabres-quest-for-ninth-arc-success\">Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe: Sosie leads quiet maestro Andr\u00e9 Fabre\u2019s quest</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was a strange and also an inspiring experience to wander through Longchamp\u2019s enclosures and in front of the grandstands, already packed many hours before the big race itself, and think that in the early years of the 21st century, it was still possible for so many people to be so enraptured by a racehorse.</p> \n<p>A big Japanese presence at Longchamp when the country has a fancied runner in the Arc has been a feature of the weekend ever since. As the fans have kept coming, so have the disappointments, for those at the track and also the millions watching at home in the small hours of Monday morning. Orfevre\u2019s defeat in 2012 when victory seemed inevitable <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RzNXkDBwrLY?si=15niOgRL0fLWxwS6\">is an especially painful&nbsp;</a>memory.</p> \n<p>Frequently beaten but for ever unbowed, Japan\u2019s fervent racing fans will return here on Sunday not just to support Shin Emperor, the country\u2019s only runner in a 16-strong field, but also, as something of a saver, Joseph O\u2019Brien\u2019s Al Riffa, who will be ridden by Take, 18 years on from his loss on Deep Impact.</p> \n<p>Shin Emperor has yet to win at anything better than Grade Three level in Japan, but his close third in last month\u2019s Irish Champion Stakes was as fine an Arc trial as you could hope to see.</p> \n<p>It is also in his favour that this will not be the strongest Arc of recent years. City Of Troy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2024/sep/20/city-of-troy-wows-crowds-gathered-for-key-breeders-cup-test-at-southwell-horse-racing-tips\">the season\u2019s outstanding three-year-old colt</a>, is being aimed at the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic, while two top-class geldings, Goliath and Calandagan, are ineligible under the conditions for this race. But that also means it is a wide-open contest and an Arc unusually rich in storylines.</p> \n<p>Andr\u00e9 Fabre, an undisputed all\u2011time great, saddles three runners \u2013 Sosie, Mqse De Sevigne and Sevenna\u2019s Knight \u2013 in search of a record-extending ninth win, two&nbsp;months before his 79th&nbsp;birthday.</p> \n<p>Look De Vega, the French Derby winner, runs for Carlos Lerner, an Argentinian by birth who fell in love with racing and horses on a visit to Chantilly as a student and settled in France soon afterwards, and his son, Yann, a former jockey.</p> \n<p>Holding the reins, meanwhile, is 46-year-old Ronan Thomas, a journeyman for much of his riding&nbsp;career, whose French Derby win aboard Look De Vega in June was his first Group One success in&nbsp;France.</p> \n<p>Aidan O\u2019Brien, inevitably, has an obvious chance to add a third Arc to his record with Los Angeles, the Irish Derby winner, at the end of what has already been an outstanding season. But Los Angeles is just one of four horses that could easily emerge as the eventual favourite. There is 9lb between the 16-strong field on <em>Timeform </em>ratings, and 4lb between the top 10.</p> \n<p>If the French three-year-old form turns out to be the best on offer, then either Sosie or Look De Vega will probably emerge in front. But neither has a rating to match <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/01/ace-impact-justifies-favourite-tag-to-claim-prix-de-larc-de-triomphe-horse-racing\">last year\u2019s three-year-old winner, Ace Impact</a>, at this stage of their career,&nbsp;while Shin Emperor, like so many Japanese runners before him, is not certain to appreciate a soft&nbsp;surface.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3527f895-78fc-4aac-994b-1b5561aa01dd\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Uttoxeter </b>1.15 Norn Iron 1.50 Nowmelad 2.25 Traveling Soldier 3.00 Rambo T 3.35 Lihyan (nb) 4.10 Home Free 4.45 Get With It 5.20 Ned Cash</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Kelso </b>1.30 Bel Amigo 2.05 Shared 2.40 Yokkell 3.15 Do No Wrong 3.50 Fringill Dike (nap) 4.25 Iwa 5.00 Dalileo</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This could still be the year, though, when the Japanese fans leave at least partially satisfied. British punters of a certain age still regard Take with suspicion after his fast-finishing Arc defeat on White Muzzle in 1994, but he has proven himself time and again to be a world-class rider and in <strong>Al Riffa </strong>(3.20), he may have finally found the horse to get him over the line at&nbsp;Longchamp.</p> \n<p>The four-year-old has clearly been aimed towards this race all year, came from well off the pace to give <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/06/city-of-troy-battling-victory-eclipse-sandown-horse-racing\">City Of Troy a serious race in the Eclipse</a> in July at Sandown. He then stayed every yard of the 12-furlong trip when successful in the Group One Grosser Preis von Berlin last&nbsp;time.</p> \n<p>At about 10-1 with British bookies, he is a slightly under-the-radar contender with as strong a chance as any of the favourites, and an excellent bet to give Take a Longchamp moment to cherish.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The most unforgettable runnings of the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe tend to be defined by the name of the winner: Dancing Brave in 1986, Sea The Stars in 2009 and the unbeaten Zarkava\u2019s retirement run the year before. But for anyone who was lucky enough to be there, Arc day in 2006 was as memorable as any of recent decades, and it was all thanks to the horse that crossed the line in third. Deep Impact was not the first runner from Japan in Europe\u2019s most prestigious all-aged race. But he was, by a long way, the most popular, and the combination of a horse with an aura of invincibility and his superstar jockey, Yutaka Take, persuaded tens of thousands of fans to make the 12,500-mile round trip to Paris for a two-and-a-half minute horse race. It was a strange and also an inspiring experience to wander through Longchamp\u2019s enclosures and in front of the grandstands, already packed many hours before the big race itself, and think that in the early years of the 21st century, it was still possible for so many people to be so enraptured by a racehorse. A big Japanese presence at Longchamp when the country has a fancied runner in the Arc has been a feature of the weekend ever since. As the fans have kept coming, so have the disappointments, for those at the track and also the millions watching at home in the small hours of Monday morning. Orfevre\u2019s defeat in 2012 when victory seemed inevitable is an especially painful memory. Frequently beaten but for ever unbowed, Japan\u2019s fervent racing fans will return here on Sunday not just to support Shin Emperor, the country\u2019s only runner in a 16-strong field, but also, as something of a saver, Joseph O\u2019Brien\u2019s Al Riffa, who will be ridden by Take, 18 years on from his loss on Deep Impact. Shin Emperor has yet to win at anything better than Grade Three level in Japan, but his close third in last month\u2019s Irish Champion Stakes was as fine an Arc trial as you could hope to see. It is also in his favour that this will not be the strongest Arc of recent years. City Of Troy, the season\u2019s outstanding three-year-old colt, is being aimed at the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic, while two top-class geldings, Goliath and Calandagan, are ineligible under the conditions for this race. But that also means it is a wide-open contest and an Arc unusually rich in storylines. Andr\u00e9 Fabre, an undisputed all\u2011time great, saddles three runners \u2013 Sosie, Mqse De Sevigne and Sevenna\u2019s Knight \u2013 in search of a record-extending ninth win, two months before his 79th birthday. Look De Vega, the French Derby winner, runs for Carlos Lerner, an Argentinian by birth who fell in love with racing and horses on a visit to Chantilly as a student and settled in France soon afterwards, and his son, Yann, a former jockey. Holding the reins, meanwhile, is 46-year-old Ronan Thomas, a journeyman for much of his riding career, whose French Derby win aboard Look De Vega in June was his first Group One success in France. Aidan O\u2019Brien, inevitably, has an obvious chance to add a third Arc to his record with Los Angeles, the Irish Derby winner, at the end of what has already been an outstanding season. But Los Angeles is just one of four horses that could easily emerge as the eventual favourite. There is 9lb between the 16-strong field on Timeform ratings, and 4lb between the top 10. If the French three-year-old form turns out to be the best on offer, then either Sosie or Look De Vega will probably emerge in front. But neither has a rating to match last year\u2019s three-year-old winner, Ace Impact, at this stage of their career, while Shin Emperor, like so many Japanese runners before him, is not certain to appreciate a soft surface. This could still be the year, though, when the Japanese fans leave at least partially satisfied. British punters of a certain age still regard Take with suspicion after his fast-finishing Arc defeat on White Muzzle in 1994, but he has proven himself time and again to be a world-class rider and in Al Riffa (3.20), he may have finally found the horse to get him over the line at Longchamp. The four-year-old has clearly been aimed towards this race all year, came from well off the pace to give City Of Troy a serious race in the Eclipse in July at Sandown. He then stayed every yard of the 12-furlong trip when successful in the Group One Grosser Preis von Berlin last time. At about 10-1 with British bookies, he is a slightly under-the-radar contender with as strong a chance as any of the favourites, and an excellent bet to give Take a Longchamp moment to cherish.",

The hosts had chances of their own to equalise, and arguably should have had a penalty for Virgil van Dijk\u2019s tug on Marc Gu\u00e9hi\u2019s arm, but PGMOL say otherwise. Differing opinions will no doubt be found on the internet. But despite eventually flopping over the finishing line, Liverpool deserved the three points on the balance of play. It\u2019s six wins from seven in the Premier League for Arne Slot, and work-in-progress Liverpool go into the international break on top of the Premier League. Palace meanwhile remain in the relegation places \u2026 but there is surely no way this team will end up in a relegation battle if the determination they showed in the second half is anything to go

But look at it another way. Palace are surely too good not to snap their winless streak sooner rather than later; Liverpool surely can\u2019t keep winning their away fixtures this season forever; and despite their great recent record at Selhurst, there\u2019s always something nagging away at the back of Mersey minds \u2026 because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/05/crystal-palace-v-liverpool-live-premier-league-report\">Crystanbul left a </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/05/crystal-palace-v-liverpool-live-premier-league-report\">lot</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/05/crystal-palace-v-liverpool-live-premier-league-report\"> of scar tissue</a>.

      "bodyText": "John Brewin was at Selhurst Park, and his report has landed. Here it is! Thanks for reading this MBM. Oliver Glasner talks to TNT. \u201cThe first half Liverpool showed why they have lost just one game \u2026 we struggled a little bit \u2026 the second half we played really well \u2026 we created chances \u2026 a clear penalty \u2026 he holds him with two hands \u2026 the second half gives me a lot of confidence \u2026 we are disappointed because the players invested a lot \u2026 [Guehi] is held with two hands \u2026 he can\u2019t go to the ball \u2026 it is a penalty \u2026 if the same foul is on the halfway line, it\u2019s a foul \u2026 if it\u2019s a foul, it\u2019s a foul \u2026 we will build up on the second half \u2026 we showed we can play aggressive and cause problems \u2026 we created chances but didn\u2019t take them and that\u2019s why we lost.\u201d That\u2019s nine wins in Arne Slot\u2019s first ten matches, which makes his start the best in the 132-year history of Liverpool Football Club. Here\u2019s where he stands in the admittedly niche most-wins-in-first-ten-matches pantheon. (\u201cIf they only remember me because of this, then it hasn\u2019t been the best period of the Liverpool era,\u201d Slot quips.) 9: Arne Slot 8: William Barclay 7: John McKenna, Bob Paisley Arne Slot speaks to TNT Sports about his team\u2019s performance \u2026 \u201cI think my wife is happy now because she\u2019ll have someone home who is happy and not unhappy \u2026 I am really satisfied about the way we have started the season \u2026 I am hoping to do more special things than only winning nine out of ten, but it\u2019s a good start \u2026 I really like our performance as well \u2026 there was a period when we conceded a lot of free kicks, throw-ins and corners \u2026 that was difficult \u2026 you need to score a second because you break them mentally \u2026 but in my opinion we were the dominant team.\u201d \u2026 the Van Dijk-Guehi incident \u2026 \u201cProbably if the referee had given it, VAR wouldn\u2019t have changed it \u2026 but for me it was not a penalty because he would never get the ball \u2026 but I do not think Palace fans can be unhappy with the referee today because it took us 55 minutes for us to get our first free kick \u2026 but it is an important decision so that\u2019s why we talk about it.\u201d \u2026 Liverpool\u2019s post-break run of fixtures \u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s true that the fixtures are difficult \u2026 but I have also felt how difficult Wolves away is, and how difficult Palace away is \u2026 we will probably not be as dominant as we were today when we face Arsenal away, but both fixtures are really difficult \u2026 now it\u2019s up to us to show ourselves in the big games.\u201d \u2026 and Alisson\u2019s injury. \u201cUnfortunately Ali won\u2019t be with us in those matches I assume, if I saw how he walked off the pitch \u2026 but it was also good to see with [Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher] being sick yesterday, our third goalkeeper got his performance in \u2026 [V\u00edt\u011bzslav Jaro\u0161] was really good, he had a really good season last season, he won the league and cup in Austria \u2026 we trust him a lot.\u201d Post-match postbag o\u2019patter. \u201cFor someone who doesn\u2019t like the 12.30 slot, Slot\u2019s slotted into it, Jota\u2019s slot slots them firmly into top spot, a slot Klopp\u2019s not slotted a lot since they last got that spot. Slotted!\u201d \u2013 Jeremy Boyce Player-of-the-match Virgil van Dijk talks to TNT. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard to come here \u2026 it\u2019s always tight and close \u2026 we scored a fantastic goal \u2026 we could have done better in the second half \u2026 a big three points \u2026 we keep going \u2026 keep working \u2026 we are never satisfied \u2026 we needed Alisson twice, three times maybe \u2026 I am very happy with a clean sheet \u2026 whatever the outside world thinks of us, we don\u2019t really care \u2026 we want to improve and challenge \u2026 we want to compete to the final day \u2026 to win and be successful \u2026 we know how tough the fixture list will be after the international break, but why not enjoy it.\u201d The quietly impressive Cody Gakpo adds: \u201cMy first start [in the Premier League this season] \u2026 you want to show what you got \u2026 we have a great squad with a lot of quality \u2026 today was my turn \u2026 I did my best.\u201d Liverpool made hard work of that. They should have been out of sight \u2013 Diogo Jota should be celebrating a hat-trick, really \u2013 but a second goal proved elusive, and Crystal Palace grew into the game during a tense second half. The hosts had chances of their own to equalise, and arguably should have had a penalty for Virgil van Dijk\u2019s tug on Marc Gu\u00e9hi\u2019s arm, but PGMOL say otherwise. Differing opinions will no doubt be found on the internet. But despite eventually flopping over the finishing line, Liverpool deserved the three points on the balance of play. It\u2019s six wins from seven in the Premier League for Arne Slot, and work-in-progress Liverpool go into the international break on top of the Premier League. Palace meanwhile remain in the relegation places \u2026 but there is surely no way this team will end up in a relegation battle if the determination they showed in the second half is anything to go by. Liverpool go four points clear at the top, for a couple of hours at least. 90 min +6: Gakpo sensationally keeps the ball in play down the left touchline, then wins a corner. That should be enough to get Liverpool over the line. Just. 90 min +5: Jota burns some clock by winning a free kick out on the left flank. Then Endo flicks a ball heading out for a goal kick out for a throw instead. Hughes then foul-throws. A frustrating 60 seconds for the hosts, and there aren\u2019t too many more of those left. 90 min +4: Szoboszlai sends a weak shot wide left of goal. On TNT Sports, Lucy Ward names Van Dijk as her player of the match. 90 min +3: Kamada sends a long pass down the left for Mateta \u2026 but Jaro\u0161 comes to the edge of his box to claim. 90 min +2: A long ball down the middle of the park. Van Dijk heads back towards his keeper \u2026 weakly \u2026 but Robertson completes the job and Jaro\u0161 gathers. 90 min +1: Jota spins into space down the right flank. He\u2019s got Diaz clear in the middle, but Lacroix slide-blocks to keep Palace in it. 90 min: There will be six additional minutes. 89 min: Jones makes way for Endo. Meanwhile here\u2019s the official reasoning for not awarding a penalty for Van Dijk\u2019s hold on Guehi. 88 min: Chalobah is replaced by Kamada. 86 min: Gakpo dribbles down the left and cuts infield. He looks for the top-right corner. High and wide. The tension at Selhurst is palpable. Both teams living on the edge. 84 min: Mateta latches onto a loose ball in the midfield and drives Palace forward. He slips Eze in down the left. Eze opens his body in the hope of steering a shot into the bottom right \u2026 but only succeeds in slamming the ball into the grateful chest of Jaro\u0161, making his first meaningful save as a Liverpool keeper. 83 min: Liverpool draw a little sting from the situation by faffing around at a couple of restarts. Professionalism in action. \u201cIf Alisson\u2019s injury troubles continue, it could be him shown the door next summer instead of Kelleher,\u201d spitballs Patrick Crumlish. 81 min: Palace are pushing Liverpool back now, hoping to pile the pressure on the debutant keeper. Lerma releases that pressure, flaying a preposterous long-distance effort into the stand. 79 min: Jaro\u0161\u2019s first act is to watch a Hughes half-volley sail inches wide of the top-right corner. Meanwhile Robertson comes on for Tsimikas. 78 min: Alisson limps off sadly. For a keeper he doesn\u2019t half pick up some injuries. He\u2019ll be replaced by \u2026 V\u00edt\u011bzslav Jaro\u0161, because the usual understudy Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher is absent himself today. Jaro\u0161, a 23-year-old Czech international, makes his Liverpool debut. 77 min: Alexander-Arnold passes back. Alisson shanks a weird clearance out of play with his left peg, and it soon becomes apparent why, as the keeper immediately goes down clutching his hamstring. He punches the ground in frustration. 75 min: Nketiah is booked for clambering on the back of Gakpo. All of a sudden, this game has kicked off a bit. A fair chance we might not end with 22 players. 74 min: Tsimikas fouls Sarr out on the right flank. Sarr waves an imaginary yellow card and receives one himself. Nothing comes of the resulting free kick, but the Selhurst crowd has its dander up now. Plenty of noise as Palace start putting themselves about at last. 73 min: Hughes is booked for scything Jones from behind. Meanwhile clearer replays of that Guehi penalty claim show Van Dijk tugging away at the defender\u2019s arm. You\u2019ve seen them given. 71 min: Salah is replaced by Diaz. 70 min: From the set piece, Chalobah backflicks goalwards. Cute. Alisson punches clear. Guehi thinks he\u2019s being held by Van Dijk but there\u2019s not enough in it. Another corner, which leads to Lerma flipping Tsimikas over while his opponent was in mid-air. Lerma is booked. 69 min: Some slack after-you-sir defending by Liverpool allows Mateta to barge his way down the middle. He lays off to Eze on his left. Eze blasts a shot towards the top-right corner. Alisson is forced to palm out for a corner. 68 min: Alexander-Arnold cuts in from the right and attempts a curler towards the top left. Miles high and wide. Both teams drifting a little bit here. 66 min: Szoboszlai pings a long-range shot straight at Henderson, who claims. For all Liverpool\u2019s dominance, they\u2019ve not given the Palace keeper too much serious work to do. Anyway, apropos TAXING THE RICH \u2026 \u201cNot sure if I qualify as rich,\u201d begins Gregory S Crawford, a Professor of Applied Microeconomics at the University of Zurich, \u201cthough probably yes as everyone who lives in Switzerland should do \u2026 but it\u2019s remarkable how so many of society\u2019s problems could be solved by simply taxing the rich (rather wealth, but six-of-one...). My professional opinion and all. Funny that more people don\u2019t just SAY SO. There might even be an analogy to the sovereign-wealth and private-equity takeover of the Premier League, but fleshing it out is probably too much thinking for a Saturday afternoon.\u201d 64 min: Gravenberch ships possession carelessly, allowing Nketiah a shy at goal from the edge of the Liverpool D. He creams an effort towards the bottom right, but Alisson is up to the challenge. A fine shot with a save to match. 62 min: It\u2019s Chalobah\u2019s turn to get physical, with Salah, but he overeggs it. A free kick, 30 yards out, right of centre. Alexander-Arnold swings it towards the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. Jota meets it, but sends a weak header wide left. He should have worked Henderson at the very least. He probably should have scored. In a parallel universe somewhere, he\u2019s scored a hat-trick today. 61 min: Hughes\u2019s first act is to wrestle with Alexander-Arnold as the latter dribbles into the Palace box from the right. It\u2019s a risky gambit, but one that pays off, as he earns a free kick, albeit one that\u2019s generously awarded. 60 min: Yep, here we go. Mitchell and Wharton, the latter carrying a groin injury, are replaced by Mateta and Hughes. 58 min: Palace are achieving the square root of nowt. TNT pundit Joe Cole has just described Oliver Glasner as looking \u201cforlorn\u201d. Changes are afoot. 56 min: Gravenberch shoots this time, from 25 yards, but the ball clanks off Guehi. Palace half clear, but Van Dijk quarterbacks from deep, wedging a lovely ball down the inside-right channel for Salah, who traps then shoots. Henderson saves at point-blank range. That would have been a beauty. 55 min: A passing move, from left to right across the face of the Palace box: Gravenberch, Gakpo, Szoboszlai, Salah,Alexander-Arnold. Too many passes, too few shots. Palace clear their lines. 53 min: Mitchell attempts to replicate Paul Konchesky\u2019s fluke in the 2006 FA Cup final. Nearly. His shanked cross from the left floats over Alisson but also the bar. 51 min: Now Guehi wrestles Jota to the floor on the halfway line. No free kick, and the normally placid Arne Slot kicks off on the touchline. He calms down quickly enough, to be fair. That registers about two-and-a-half on our patented Klopp-o-meter\u00ae. 50 min: Jota turns on a sixpence and looks to escape from Lerma. He\u2019s brought down from behind. Lerma is slightly fortunate not to go into the book. He might be in one-more territory. 48 min: Alexander-Arnold sends Salah skittering into space down the right. Salah dillies and dallies and runs the ball out for a goal kick. Uncharacteristically lax. 47 min: Gakpo whistles a cross from the left towards Salah, racing in from the opposite flank. Henderson reads the danger and intercepts. Otherwise, a quiet start to the second half. Literally so: hardly a peep from the normally boisterous Selhurst faithful. Liverpool get the second half under way. They\u2019ve replaced Mac Allister with Szoboszlai. Half-time entertainment. In which our man fires the opening salvo of a debate which will hopefully end with everything nationalised and the rich properly taxed. Game on! Liverpool have been by far the better team, and should have more than one goal to show for their dominance. But Palace had a goal disallowed after just 21 seconds, then showed signs of waking up towards the end of the half, so they\u2019ll have a platform to build on. Intriguing and potentially very entertaining second half coming up! 45 min +2: Sarr has suddenly woken up, and now he shoots from the right-hand edge of the Liverpool D towards the bottom left. Alisson gets down to stop with a strong hand. 45 min +1: The first of two additional first-half minutes passes by without fuss. 45 min: Sarr and Tsimikas battle for a ball bouncing down the inside-right channel. The ball rears up and hits Tsimikas on the hand, and VAR has a look, but it\u2019s not a penalty because the arm was in \u201ca natural running position\u201d, is the latest thing that\u2019s been made up on the spot. 43 min: Mac Allister goes into the book for cynically attempting to stop a Palace counter by bringing down Eze. He failed to make any connection, but the challenge was so brazen, the intent was enough. 42 min: The ball\u2019s shuttled right to left across the face of the Palace box by Alexander-Arnold and Mac Allister. Tsimikas takes a strong whack. Lacroix bravely takes the brunt of it to block. 41 min: Alexander-Arnold delivers. Van Dijk meets at the near post, and heads over. Palace counter but the rare sortie comes to a diminuendo end as Mitchell\u2019s left-wing cross dribbles through unopposed to Alisson. 40 min: \u2026 then suddenly the pace picks up again, and Gakpo crosses from the left. Guehi is forced to concede yet another corner. 39 min: Liverpool are strolling around at the moment. Happy to sit back and see what\u2019s what. 37 min: The corner\u2019s a non-event. The way Arsenal carry on is harder than they make it look. 36 min: Jones slips a ball down the left flank for Jota, who swivels to win a corner. Alexander-Arnold slowly trots across to take it. While he does that, Richard Hirst has an answer for Gary Naylor of 27th-minute fame: \u201cAndersen is definitely worth as much to the buying team. Exhibits A and B: Fulham\u2019s league position and their defensive record. He has brought not just his own ability but his leadership and organisational capabilities. A crucial purchase.\u201d 34 min: Gravenberch strides into the Palace box from the right and rolls across to Jota, who should surely score from eight yards. But he wafts an awful sidefoot miles wide left. He was trying to be too cute there. Time to get the laces through it. It should be 0-2. 33 min: Jones has a nibble at Guehi and receives the one-more-and-it\u2019s-yellow lecture from the referee. The resulting free kick is sent long into the Liverpool box, and wins Palace a corner, from which nothing comes. But the last couple of minutes have given the Palace faithful some succour, and the noise ramps up accordingly. 31 min: Gakpo is booked for catching Sarr late on the ankle. It looked accidental rather than malicious, and the subsequent apology is accepted. 30 min: Alexander-Arnold sends the free gift into the mixer. Gakpo flicks it on, but sends it wide right. 29 min: Wharton gives the ball away 30 yards from his own goal. Alexander-Arnold sends a fierce drive towards the bottom left. Henderson palms away with a strong hand. Clyne should clear the loose ball but carelessly lets it run out of play for a corner. 27 min: Liverpool continue to dominate. Palace can hardly get a touch. Gakpo cuts in from the left and looks for the top-right corner. He finds the top-right corner of the Holmesdale Road. \u201cIs Joachim Andersen one of those players who is worth more to the selling team than the buying one?\u201d wonders Gary Naylor. \u201c\u00a330m seemed a reasonable price for Fulham to pay for a 28 year-old, but could Palace replace his combination of experience, nous and leadership for that? It sounds crazy, but I suspect it happens quite often. There\u2019s no way Liverpool could walk the ball into the net like that if he\u2019s on the pitch.\u201d 25 min: Guehi heads the corner over his own bar. The next attempt nearly tees up Gravenberch on the edge of the D, but he can\u2019t get a shot away due to Lerma\u2019s tenacity. Lerma eventually wins a free kick for his efforts, and earns some appreciative applause from the home fans, who haven\u2019t had too much to shout about since the 21-second mark. 24 min: Konate, Gravenberch and Salah triangulate down the middle of the park. Some lovely football. Jones prepares to shoot but the pass is taken away from him by Mitchell. Another Tsimikas corner from the right coming up. 22 min: Lerma flicks Tsimikas\u2019s corner away from danger. Liverpool have looked more dangerous than usual from corners lately, but they\u2019re not Arsenal yet. 21 min: Jones, Tsimikas and Gakpo combine cutely down the left before the latter crosses deep in the hope of finding Salah at the far stick. Mitchell is on hand to flick out for a corner. 19 min: Gravenberch turns elegantly into space in the midfield, and nearly sends Salah clear down the middle. Chalobah is on point to put a stop to the attack. 17 min: Clyne, formerly of Liverpool, comes on to replace the stricken Munoz. 16 min: Munoz is down feeling his thigh. Not sure he\u2019ll be able to continue. He certainly doesn\u2019t look too happy. The physio comes on, then the pair trudge off. No sub yet. 15 min: Liverpool have enjoyed 83 percent of possession so far. That 21-second Nketiah shock seems an awfully long time ago now. \u201cGood advertisement for squad depth with Robertson\u2019s, Diaz\u2019s and Nunez\u2019s replacements combining for that goal,\u201d observes Patrick Crumlish. 14 min: Space for Salah down the right. He crosses low. Mac Allister opts to dummy instead of poking goalwards at the near post, but there\u2019s nobody in white behind him. Palace clear their lines. 13 min: Lerma blasts a confident clearing header upfield. \u201cUnlike Matt Dony I\u2019m in the unusual position of being very relaxed,\u201d announces Richard Hirst. \u201cIf Palace win it keeps the top of the table closer to Fulham (!), if Liverpool win it, more realistically, keeps a bottom of the table team a long way behind us. Happy days.\u201d 12 min: Mac Allister\u2019s crossfield pass towards Alexander-Arnold on the right is immediately dispatched back into the Palace box. Guehi is forced to head behind with Jota and Gakpo lurking. Tsimikas to take the corner. 11 min: Before the game, Slot talked of keeping Selhurst quiet in the early exchanges. His team haven\u2019t quite achieved that, on account of the away fans bellowing their songbook in celebration. Liverpool ping it around patiently \u2013 this is Slotball \u2013 before \u2013 and this is also Slotball \u2013 suddenly turning it up a notch. Tsimikas slips a pass down the inside-left channel for Gakpo, who fizzes a low cross into the middle. Jota is the sharpest, arriving to slam home from eight yards. Easy as that. 7 min: \u2026 nothing occurs. Eze\u2019s delivery is easily cleared by Gakpo. 6 min: Eze drives down the left before switching play to Munoz on the other flank. He fires a low, hard cross into the six-yard box, forcing Van Dijk to block out for a corner. From which \u2026 4 min: Van Dijk plays a glorious crossfield pass towards Salah on the right touchline, where a one-two with Alexander-Arnold doesn\u2019t come off. Both teams showing plenty of ambition in these early exchanges. 2 min: What a start that would have been for Palace. Brentfordesque. The move started by Lerma winning a 50-50 with Gravenberch in the midfield. Liverpool breathe again. 21 seconds: Crystal Palace have the ball in the net! Wharton slips a pass down the inside-right channel for Sarr, who rolls into the centre for Nketiah. The striker lifts the ball over Alisson and in! But the flag goes up. He\u2019s gone too soon. Crystal Palace get the ball rolling. The hosts are kicking towards the Whitehorse Lane Stand in this first half. The teams are out! Crystal Palace are red and blue and Glad All Over. The usual magnificent atmosphere at Selhurst. Liverpool meanwhile are in crisp third-choice white with black shorts; a proper 1987 Littlewoods Cup final vibe, if memories of Crystanbul haven\u2019t been painful enough. Apologies to Matt Dony. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes! Pre-match postbag. \u201cThere have been 60 games thus far in the Premier League, 21 home wins, 21 home losses, 18 ties. Are we overstating the home advantage?\u201d \u2013 Gary Stover \u201cDo the suits give the 1230 slot more frequently to Liverpool because Slot dislikes it or does Slot dislike it more because the suits scheduling it more frequently? Anyway, Slot has one escape route should they drop points today\u201d \u2013 krishnamoorthy v \u201cAt the risk of annoying a lot of people, there\u2019s an internet phenomenon known as The Game. The aim of The Game is simply to not think about The Game. When you think about The Game, you immediately lose The Game. And you are always playing The Game. As a Liverpool fan, I play a very similar game. The aim of this game is, Don\u2019t Think About The 3-3 Draw Away To Palace. And I just lost it. Again. It happens a surprising amount\u201d \u2013 Matt Dony Oliver Glasner speaks to TNT. \u201cIsma\u00efla [Sarr] had very good performances when he came into the game \u2026 always a positive impact \u2026 he has a lot of pace \u2026 we expect Liverpool to play very dominant \u2026 there will be space in behind \u2026 we hope he can find and use this space and score goals \u2026 Trevoh [Chalobah] seems to be ready \u2026 we don\u2019t know if he will be able to play 95 or 100 minutes but he looked pretty good in training \u2026 we want to play against Liverpool \u2026 we want to compete with the best teams \u2026 today nobody expects the three points but we want it \u2026 we will give everything we have to get the win \u2026 we will see \u2026 it is football, it is sports \u2026 we want to play Liverpool, gorgeous weather, great playing at Selhurst Park at 12.30 \u2026 we feel ready so let\u2019s go!\u201d Arne Slot talks to TNT Sports and is asked about Liverpool\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d start to the season. \u201cBrilliant would have been nine [wins] out of nine! \u2026 this has been a very good start \u2026 the key is we haven\u2019t changed that much \u2026 the players and staff have bought in \u2026 working hard \u2026 the fixture list has also been good to us \u2026 today it\u2019s a difficult one, so let\u2019s see \u2026 we do a lot of things well \u2026 but if we want to stay where we are and compete with even tougher opponents we have to find another gear \u2026 against Wolves we started really slow \u2026 against the low block against Forest we had problems \u2026 you will never reach perfection but we aim for that \u2026 it\u2019s a good moment for Curtis Jones to start, also because he\u2019s not going to go to the international games \u2026 every away game around the world is difficult \u2026 it\u2019s very important not to get the crowd going \u2026 we have to be aggressive without the ball \u2026 help the crowd not to be as loud as they can be.\u201d Crystal Palace make two changes after the 2-1 defeat at Everton last weekend. Trevoh Chalobah, on loan from Chelsea, makes his debut, while Isma\u00efla Sarr starts on the wing; Daichi Kamada and Jean-Philippe Mateta drop to the bench. Liverpool make four changes to the team sent out to beat Bologna 2-0 on Wednesday night. Curtis Jones, Cody Gakpo, Diogo Jota and Kostas Tsimikas are in; Dominik Szoboszlai, Luis D\u00edaz, Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Andrew Robertson are benched. Crystal Palace: Henderson, Chalobah, Guehi, Lacroix, Munoz, Wharton, Lerma, Mitchell, Sarr, Nketiah, Eze. Subs: Turner, Ward, Mateta, Schlupp, Clyne, Kamada, Hughes, Umeh, Kporha. Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Konate, van Dijk, Tsimikas, Jones, Mac Allister, Salah, Gravenberch, Gakpo, Jota. Subs: Jaros, Gomez, Endo, Diaz, Szoboszlai, Nunez, Robertson, Quansah, Bradley. Referee: Simon Hooper (Wiltshire). Crystal Palace have yet to win a Premier League game this season, while Liverpool are top of the table having won five of their first six. Add in the fact that the Reds have won eight of their last nine league visits to Selhurst Park, drawing the other, and there\u2019s a fair chance you\u2019ll be putting this down as an away banker this lunchtime. But look at it another way. Palace are surely too good not to snap their winless streak sooner rather than later; Liverpool surely can\u2019t keep winning their away fixtures this season forever; and despite their great recent record at Selhurst, there\u2019s always something nagging away at the back of Mersey minds \u2026 because Crystanbul left a lot of scar tissue. So good luck confidently predicting the outcome of this game, which could see Liverpool confidently extend their lead at the top, Palace get their season going belatedly, or anything in between. Kick-off is at 12.30pm BST. It\u2019s on!",

Millions of <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/nafta_factsheet_deficit_jobs_wages_feb_2018_final.pdf\">jobs were lost</a> in the following decades as factories moved out of the US and the car industry took advantage of cheaper labour abroad.</p>    <p>In 2016, Trump won support in states with a high proportion of blue-collar worker who were key to his election by railing against Nafta as \u201cthe worst trade deal ever\u201d. General Motors shut a dozen factories around Saginaw and moved most of that work to Mexico.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/03/donald-trump-michigan-rally-car-industry\">was back in Saginaw</a> on Thursday because it\u2019s a bellwether county in a battleground state, and he was pushing the same message as eight years ago.</p> <p>\u201cAmericans have watched as our country has been stripped of our jobs.

Instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America.

I think most of them are still in the same place. The trends that I see with labour people who are Trump supporters is a tendency to be very upset with the status quo, which everyone should be. People are going to stick with Trump until they see and they feel like things are getting better for them.\u201d</p>    <p>Hammond, whose grandfather worked at General Motors in Saginaw while both her parents are anti-union Republicans, said many union members continue to see the Democrats as representing corporate interests over those of American workers. She identifies President Barack Obama\u2019s bailout of the banks following the 2008 financial crash, while millions of Americans lost their homes to foreclosure, as one of the deepest wounds that soured a lot of Democratic working-class voters on the party.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of it is our own party betrayed the working class. When Barack Obama got elected in 2008 on hope and change, the first thing he did was bail out the banks which was exactly the opposite,\u201d she said. \u201cThe legitimate concerns that a lot of Trump voters in the unions have about the Democratic party are mostly regarding who\u2019s bought more by corporations.\u201d</p> <p>For some union members there are also more immediate concerns at work. There is strong support for Trump among members of the United Auto Workers branch who work at a Saginaw factory making vehicle steering systems who fear that the Democrats\u2019 promotion of electric cars will put them out of work.</p> <p>The impact of the blue-collar vote may not be what it was eight years ago. Trump does better with white voters who do not have a college degree, a demographic that accounts for a high proportion of union membership.</p> <p>Historically, about two-thirds of union members in Michigan do not have a degree. But white people without a college degree <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/06/nx-s1-5101765/swing-states-demographics-electorate\">account for</a> a shrinking proportion of voters in the state, falling to about 55% at this year\u2019s election.</p> <p>Still, union members matter in a state like Michigan which Trump won by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2016 and then lost by a narrow margin four years later.</p> <p>Union members in Teamsters for Trump T-shirts were lined up behind the former president at Thursday\u2019s rally in Saginaw. The Teamsters, one of the US\u2019s largest unions, has declined to endorse a candidate, a blow to Harris, after a ballot of its membership showed a clear majority backed Trump.</p> <p>\u201cMy pro-worker policies are one of the major reasons why I\u2019ve been overwhelmingly endorsed by the rank-and-file membership,\u201d Trump told the rally.</p> <p>The IBEW has endorsed Harris in part because of the huge infrastructure spending that helped bring jobs to Saginaw, including a vast semiconductor factory. Allardyce said its construction will provide work to hundred of electricians.</p> <p>\u201cI completely give the credit to the Biden administration. We could be talking about years\u2019 worth of work here, which is an unheard of conversation to have,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It\u2019s a message Allardyce pushes to his members at union meetings.</p> <p>\u201cThe IBEW and trade unions have traditionally got on the backs of Democrats.

Still, Stan (who also impresses as Donald Trump in the forthcoming The Apprentice) is excellent as a man who, whatever his outward appearance, is chronically uncomfortable in his own skin. \u2022 In UK and Irish cinemas now and Australian cinemas on 24 October.",

In the latest instalment, due out on Valentine\u2019s Day next year, Bridget navigates life as a single mother after the death of her husband, Mark Darcy. Grant told the Graham Norton Show: \u201cIt is a good and moving script \u2013 it is extremely funny but very sad.\u201d He also revealed that he was \u201ccrammed in\u201d as there was \u201cno obvious role\u201d for his character, who was a former love interest of Bridget. \u201cSo we didn\u2019t have a 60-year-old Daniel Cleaver wandering around looking at young girls, I made up a good interim story for him.\u201d The Oscar-winner Ren\u00e9e Zellweger has reprised her role in the film, the script for which was written by Fielding.

      "bodyText": "The Israeli military is expanding its operations on multiple fronts around the anniversary of the 7 October attacks on Monday, including planning for a \u201csignificant and serious\u201d retaliation against Iran for last week\u2019s large-scale ballistic missile attack on Israel. Signs of imminent Israeli retaliation against Iran came as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, called for an international embargo on arms delivered to Israel for use against Gaza, where authorities say more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel\u2019s year long assault. \u201cI think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,\u201d Macron told broadcaster France Inter, adding that France was not sending any arms to Israel. Macron made his comments as the Israel Defense Forces said a major strike on Iran was imminent, as Israel hit targets in Lebanon, Syria, and Gaza on Saturday. \u201cThe IDF [Israeli military] is preparing a response to the unprecedented and unlawful Iranian attack on Israeli civilians and Israel,\u201d the military official said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak publicly on the issue. As Israel said it was planning its response to Tuesday\u2019s Iranian missile strikes, which hit on or near a number of key Israeli bases, the US president, Joe Biden, cautioned against striking Iranian oil facilities, a day after he said Washington was \u201cdiscussing\u201d such action. \u201cIf I were in their shoes, I\u2019d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oilfields,\u201d Biden said during a rare appearance at the White House daily press briefing. The Biden administration has already suggested it opposes an Israeli strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. Amid the worsening violence, speculation was hardening that a strike on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs had killed Hashem Safieddine, who had been widely expected to succeed Hezbollah\u2019s slain leader Hassan Nasrallah. According to Lebanese security sources, Safieddine has been unreachable since Friday. Assessments suggest that Safieddine was killed with aides and Iranian advisers in a powerful strike that has made reaching any bodies difficult. In the aftermath of the strike the IDF said it had hit Hezbollah\u2019s intelligence headquarters without disclosing who was present. The fighting comes as Israel prepares to mark the first anniversary on Monday of the devastating 7 October Hamas attack that prompted the current war in Gaza, which has now engulfed neighbouring Lebanon, creating a dangerous regional crisis. Israel\u2019s president, Isaac Herzog, will lead a memorial service in Sderot, one of the cities hardest hit during the onslaught by Hamas militants, amid fears that the anniversary may attract fresh attacks on Israeli citizens. The Israeli military said on Saturday it was also ordering Palestinian civilians in some areas of the Gaza Strip \u2013 including Nuseirat and Bureij, which host large encampments of internally displaced people \u2013 to evacuate, saying that the IDF planned to act \u201cwith great force\u201d against Hamas operating there. Israel also appeared to be ramping up operations over the weekend in southern Lebanon, which its ground forces entered earlier this week. Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah said it was opposing Israeli attempts to enter the southern town of Odaisseh, adding that clashes were ongoing. As Hezbollah continued to fire rockets at northern Israel, there were direct hits in two buildings in Karmiel and near Acre, with reports of casualties from an impact on an apartment block in the Israeli-Arab village of Deir al-Asad. Israel, which began ground operations targeting southern Lebanon on Monday last week, says they are focused on villages near the border and has said Beirut is \u201cnot on the table\u201d, but has not specified how long the ground incursion will last. It says the operation\u2019s aim is to allow tens of thousands of its citizens to return home after Hezbollah bombardments, which began on 8 October 2023, forced them to evacuate from its north. Rapidly escalating violence in recent days has brought intense Israeli strikes on Hezbollah strongholds across Lebanon as ground troops conducted raids near the border, transforming nearly a year of cross-border exchanges into full-blown war. In the first reported Israeli airstrike on the northern Tripoli region in the current flare-up, Hamas said \u201cZionist bombardment\u201d of the Beddawi refugee camp killed a commander, Saeed Atallah Ali, as well as his wife and two daughters on Saturday. Amid mounting fears over the deepening region-wide crisis, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, renewed his call for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon on Saturday. \u201cThe most important issue today is the ceasefire, especially in Lebanon and in Gaza,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThere are initiatives in this regard, there have been consultations that we hope will be successful.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>What else is football for other than its swell of emotions? And if it was love at first sight with J\u00fcrgen Klopp, when will the Liverpool faithful fall for Arne Slot? A continued superb start to the season, top of the table when it was supposed to be Arsenal and Manchester City streaking away, he could hardly have done a better job. There remains a distance. Fans too cool for school? Possibly. A love hangover from those last days of Klopp ending so bittersweetly? Almost certainly.</p> \n<p>From Slot, there will be no touchline pogo, no bearlike screams, even if he can be demonstrative from the technical area. The will to win is still just as apparent as Klopp\u2019s. The results so far are excellent, just two league goals conceded all season, but his horizons are far wider. \u201cI am hoping to do more special things than only winning nine out of ten, but it\u2019s a good start,\u201d Slot said.</p> \n<p>He chooses to do things differently. \u201cWhatever the outside world thinks of us we don\u2019t really care,\u201d said the captain, Virgil van Dijk, following a win collected with few pyrotechnics beyond Diogo Jota\u2019s fine goal. \u201cWe want to try challenge, compete, win and be successful.\u201d</p> \n<p>After last season\u2019s improvements under Oliver Glasner, these are sincere struggles for Crystal Palace. They kicked off as one of five clubs yet to register a win. The wait goes on, even if their manager said \u201chow we played in the second half encourages us.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/23/michael-olise-making-all-the-right-noises-at-bayern-munich-after-one-man-demolition\">Michael Olise is sorely missed</a>. Eberechi Eze finds space much harder to come by. Replaced by Will Hughes in the second half, a change that brought improvement, there were only fleeting signs of the player Adam Wharton looked in spring. He did, though, play a part in the move from which Palace might have been ahead in the first minute. Wharton supplied Isma\u00efla Sarr, only for Eddie Nketiah to trigger the offside trap as he netted.</p> \n<p>Slot\u2019s selection paid off for his team\u2019s ninth-minute winner. Kostas Tsimikas had replaced Andy Robertson; the left-back\u2019s ball found Cody Gakpo, restored to the flank role he made his name in, to slot in Jota. Liverpool\u2019s best finisher stole ahead of Trevoh Chalobah, the Palace debutant. Three simple football decisions, each paying dividends. \u201cYou want to show what you got,\u201d said Gakpo, after his first Premier League start of the season.</p> \n<p>For Glasner, the bad news kept rolling as the defender Daniel Mu\u00f1oz limped off. Liverpool looked for a second, playing a patient fare alien during the ecstatic romance of the Klopp era. As multiple corners piled up, their players looked to Aaron Briggs, Slot\u2019s set-piece coach, for guidance. Van Dijk headed over towards the end of a first half that had Selhurst Park mollified.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The second-half Slot strategy was sitting deep, inviting pressure to trigger counters. Perhaps where he has so far lost out in affections is such dispassionate pragmatism. Glasner rejigged, Hughes and Jean-Philippe Mateta joining the attack. Palace finally began to bubble. \u201cWe could have done better in the second,\u201d said Van Dijk. \u201cBut we knew they\u2019d come out with a bit of pressure on the ball.\u201d</p> \n<p>Still, Jota should have closed the contest. Trent Alexander-Arnold planted a free-kick on his head, only for the striker to head horribly wide. Would Liverpool live to regret that? Palace had a legitimate claim for a penalty when Van Dijk held Marc Gu\u00e9hi with both hands, only for VAR to rule it had been \u201cnot sustained\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cA clear penalty,\u201d declared Glasner, dismissing the PGMOL\u2019s social media explanation. \u201cI did read it but I don\u2019t agree with it.\u201d He took solace that his team had \u201ccreated many chance against the best team at defending in the league\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/alisson-will-not-be-with-us-slot-warns-liverpool-keeper-could-miss-four-games\">\u2018Alisson will not be with us\u2019: Slot warns Liverpool keeper could miss four games</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Next, Eze forced a save from Alisson, who scrambled away the resulting corner, the last of the Brazilian\u2019s actions. The injured goalkeeper was replaced by Vitezslav Jaros, the Czech making his first ever Liverpool appearance, Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher also absent.</p> \n<p>When Eze galloped in on goal, Jaros\u2019s first test arrived. He saved well, clasping the ball to his chest. Liverpool could close out victory, continue that exemplary start.

      "bodyText": "What else is football for other than its swell of emotions? And if it was love at first sight with J\u00fcrgen Klopp, when will the Liverpool faithful fall for Arne Slot? A continued superb start to the season, top of the table when it was supposed to be Arsenal and Manchester City streaking away, he could hardly have done a better job. There remains a distance. Fans too cool for school? Possibly. A love hangover from those last days of Klopp ending so bittersweetly? Almost certainly. From Slot, there will be no touchline pogo, no bearlike screams, even if he can be demonstrative from the technical area. The will to win is still just as apparent as Klopp\u2019s. The results so far are excellent, just two league goals conceded all season, but his horizons are far wider. \u201cI am hoping to do more special things than only winning nine out of ten, but it\u2019s a good start,\u201d Slot said. He chooses to do things differently. \u201cWhatever the outside world thinks of us we don\u2019t really care,\u201d said the captain, Virgil van Dijk, following a win collected with few pyrotechnics beyond Diogo Jota\u2019s fine goal. \u201cWe want to try challenge, compete, win and be successful.\u201d After last season\u2019s improvements under Oliver Glasner, these are sincere struggles for Crystal Palace. They kicked off as one of five clubs yet to register a win. The wait goes on, even if their manager said \u201chow we played in the second half encourages us.\u201d Michael Olise is sorely missed. Eberechi Eze finds space much harder to come by. Replaced by Will Hughes in the second half, a change that brought improvement, there were only fleeting signs of the player Adam Wharton looked in spring. He did, though, play a part in the move from which Palace might have been ahead in the first minute. Wharton supplied Isma\u00efla Sarr, only for Eddie Nketiah to trigger the offside trap as he netted. Slot\u2019s selection paid off for his team\u2019s ninth-minute winner. Kostas Tsimikas had replaced Andy Robertson; the left-back\u2019s ball found Cody Gakpo, restored to the flank role he made his name in, to slot in Jota. Liverpool\u2019s best finisher stole ahead of Trevoh Chalobah, the Palace debutant. Three simple football decisions, each paying dividends. \u201cYou want to show what you got,\u201d said Gakpo, after his first Premier League start of the season. For Glasner, the bad news kept rolling as the defender Daniel Mu\u00f1oz limped off. Liverpool looked for a second, playing a patient fare alien during the ecstatic romance of the Klopp era. As multiple corners piled up, their players looked to Aaron Briggs, Slot\u2019s set-piece coach, for guidance. Van Dijk headed over towards the end of a first half that had Selhurst Park mollified. The second-half Slot strategy was sitting deep, inviting pressure to trigger counters. Perhaps where he has so far lost out in affections is such dispassionate pragmatism. Glasner rejigged, Hughes and Jean-Philippe Mateta joining the attack. Palace finally began to bubble. \u201cWe could have done better in the second,\u201d said Van Dijk. \u201cBut we knew they\u2019d come out with a bit of pressure on the ball.\u201d Still, Jota should have closed the contest. Trent Alexander-Arnold planted a free-kick on his head, only for the striker to head horribly wide. Would Liverpool live to regret that? Palace had a legitimate claim for a penalty when Van Dijk held Marc Gu\u00e9hi with both hands, only for VAR to rule it had been \u201cnot sustained\u201d. \u201cA clear penalty,\u201d declared Glasner, dismissing the PGMOL\u2019s social media explanation. \u201cI did read it but I don\u2019t agree with it.\u201d He took solace that his team had \u201ccreated many chance against the best team at defending in the league\u201d. Next, Eze forced a save from Alisson, who scrambled away the resulting corner, the last of the Brazilian\u2019s actions. The injured goalkeeper was replaced by Vitezslav Jaros, the Czech making his first ever Liverpool appearance, Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher also absent. When Eze galloped in on goal, Jaros\u2019s first test arrived. He saved well, clasping the ball to his chest. Liverpool could close out victory, continue that exemplary start. If the thrill of the chase is not like it was under the last guy, their chances of success are as real as in the wild and crazy years.",

She limits the damage with a well executed slower ball but she\u2019s overstepped twice in a row!

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from us today, the green and gold juggernaut of Australia rolls on. Thanks for your company, the OBO will return. The Captains Speak: Alyssa Healy - Australia captain: It\u2019s a good result at the start of the tournament and we will take some confidence from that. We were decent without being perfect\u201d Chamari Athapaththu \u2013 Sri Lanka captain: We played good cricket in the last two months but unfortunately we\u2019ve lost against Pakistan and Australia. We have struggled little bit with the bat but we cannot complain about these things and we have to adjust and play positive cricket all the time. The batting unit is dependent on the first three-four batters\u2026 the rest of the batters have struggled in this competition. We have to bounce back.\u201d Megan Schutt is the Player of the Match There was a bit more bounce than I thought there would be, I was pushing Midge (Alyssa Healy) for three overs in the powerplay. We probably could have been cleaner (with our fielding) so a bit of adjustment, and a bit to work on. Moons (Beth Mooney) has lost about 16 kilos out there! We have played in hot conditions before. You have to get on with it.\u201d A comfortable if slightly scruffy performance from Australia who will want to tighten up in all departments for their next match. A few dropped catches in the field and far too many front foot no-balls with the ball preceded a slightly stuttering performance with the bat chasing a low total, nevertheless a win is a win. Told you so. Beth Mooney dances down the ground and clobbers a boundary before clipping into the leg side for the winning run! She finishes unbeaten on 43 and has got Australia over the line with 34 balls remaining. 14th over: Australia 89-4 (Mooney 38, Litchfield 9) Shot! Litchfield shows off her lightning hands with a rapier drive through the covers for four. 13th over: Australia 81-4 (Mooney 37, Litchfield 2) Phoebe Litchfield joins Mooney in the middle, she sprinted out in the heat, testing the groin injury that has kept her out of recent matches. Three runs off the over, Australia inching closer to the win. Ash Gardner won\u2019t want to watch the replay of this dismissal \u2013 an ugly hack loops tamely up to the fielder at point. 12th over: Australia 78-3 (Mooney 36, Gardner 12) That\u2019ll help \u2013 no need to run for those! A full toss from Chamari Athapaththu is bunted to the fence for four by Mooney. Australia need 16 more and Beth Mooney is having an large bag of ice plonked on her head between overs. 11th over: Australia 68-3 (Mooney 27, Gardner 11) Mooney is red as a beet under the hot Sharjah sun but we\u2019ve seen before that she\u2019s got hidden reserves. As a fellow puce pallored person post exercise I\u2019ve got every sympathy, dare say Mooney has more in the tank than me post five a side footy last evening. I love the smell of deep heat in the morning. 10th over: Australia 68-3 (Mooney 27, Gardner 11) I\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having drinking! Ash Gardner plays the shot of the day* to the first ball after they hydration break \u2013 holding the pose on a lofted straight drive down the ground that bounces once before going over the boundary at long off. Just 26 more needed for Australia. *In my honest opinion (IMHO) For what it\u2019s worth (FWIW)\u2026erm If destroyed still true? (IDST) 10th over: Australia 62-3 (Mooney 26, Gardner 6) Mooney and Gardner are now seemingly content to pick off the singles. Drinks are called for with Australia needing 32 off 60 balls. That Beth Mooney drop was a real shocker for Sri Lanka. 9th over: Australia 57-3 (Mooney 24, Gardner 3) Ranaweera is given another over after her expensive first foray with the ball. Huge DROP! Mooney flays in the air out to the deep and should have been caught but the fielder went with rock-hard hands\u2026 the ball going straight in and out again before hitting the turf. Sri Lanka can\u2019t afford errors like that with so few runs on the board. Mooney survives. 8th over: Australia 52-3 (Mooney 20, Garnder 2) Beth Mooney decides attack is the best option and chances her arm. Shen trots down the wicket and lifts Kumari for four, narrowly avoiding the extra cover fielder who dives for the catch and misses by a fingernail. A wilder hack is sent aerial down the ground and lands safe of the back pedalling fielder. A decent over for Australia that will settle a few down, ten runs off it. 7th over: Australia 42-3 (Mooney 11, Garnder 1) Beth Mooney was involved in the Wareham run out and has been trapped down the non-striker\u2019s end as Perry and Healy were skittled out. Priyadharshani drifts onto her pads and Mooney doesn\u2019t miss out, paddling away to pick up a welcome boundary. 52 needed off 78 balls (seven wickets in hand) 6th over: Australia 35-3 (Mooney 5, Garnder 0) Ash Gardner joins Beth Mooney in the middle. Australia calling on their strength in depth a little too early for their own liking in Sharjah. Hang on a minute \u2013 Ellyse Perry is bowled out! Sugandika Kumari fizzes one through quicker and Perry goes back to a ball that she should have come forward to\u2026 the extra pace and a hint of turn seeing her defences breached. The bowler gives it the big one in the celebration too \u2013 and why not! 5th over: Australia 34-2 (Mooney 4, Perry 17) 38 year old Inoka Ranaweera came into the side for today\u2019s game and her first over is a forgettable one that releases the pressure on Australia. She floats her first ball up and Ellyse Perry is straight onto the front foot and driving down the ground for four. The next ball is a drag down and Perry rocks back to pull away for four more, twelve in total off the over, Sri Lanka can\u2019t afford too many more like that. I missed this earlier \u2013 tip of the T20 cap to Megan Schutt! 4th over: Australia 22-2 (Mooney 3, Perry 6) Kavisha Dilhari is surely still on a high after that Wareham run out and is duly summoned for a bowl. It\u2019s a tidy over of spinning all-sorts, just two singles off it as Perry and Mooney rebuild for Australia. 3rd over: Australia 20-2 (Mooney 2, Perry 5) Ellyse Perry joins Mooney in the middle, she\u2019ll need to draw on all her experience here with her side in a spot of bother. Did I happen to mention this is her ninth T20 World Cup? She tucks into the leg side for a single and then follows up with a late glide for four to end the over. Class is permanent. GoneGoneGone! Mooney drops into the off side and calls Wareham through for a quick single but Dilhari has other ideas, swooping in from cover to pick up quickly and release the throw on the dive, the direct hit sees Wareham out of her ground by a foot. Excellent start for Sri Lanka, Australia having a wee wobble at the start of this chase. 2nd over: Australia 14-1 (Mooney 2, Wareham 3) Inoshi Priyadharshani comes on to bowl spin from the other end, she starts with a wide down the leg side that evades the keeper too and the batters scamper a run. A slip in place for Wareham who drives for two to get herself moving. 1st over: Australia 8-1 (Mooney 1, Wareham 0) Georgia Wareham joins Beth Mooney in the middle. Sri Lanka looking to keep the pressure on the defending champions. Bowled her! That\u2019s the way to do it with not many runs on the board to defend. Left arm seamer Udeshika Prabodhani drags Healy forward and scuds one through the Aussie captain\u2019s defences with a ball that held its line and knocked back the off stump. Healy playing down Bakerloo and the ball was on the Piccadilly, as someone once said somewhere. The players are out there, let\u2019s play! I\u2019m going to quickly dash for some caffeine. Back very soon for the Australia response. No hat-trick for Schutt as she goes for the yorker but new batter Priyadharshani digs it out to midwicket for a single. Sri Lanka scamper some desperate late runs that smack of much too little much too late and that is that. Australia will need to knock off less than a hundred runs to get their campaign under way with a win. Two in two! Megan Schutt is on a hat-trick! Beth Mooney takin a fine tumbling catch in the deep. Wheels well and truly off for Sri Lanka. Schutt strikes, Sanjeewani chips a simple catch to Georgia Wareham close in on the leg side. 19th over: Sri Lanka 89-5 (Silva 27, Sanjeewani 16) Sublime from Ash Gardner who finishes the penultimate over and ends with parsimonious figures of 1-14 from her four overs. One over to go, Megan Schutt is going to bowl it. 18th over: Sri Lanka 84-5 (Silva 26, Sanjeewani 13) That\u2019s more like it! Sanjeewani has provided a real shot in the arm for the Sri Lanka run rate since arriving in the middle, she gets on the front foot and lifts Wareham over the top for a lovely boundary. Two overs to go, can they post three figures? It still won\u2019t be enough, of that I\u2019ll bet my non existent garden shed. 17th over: Sri Lanka 77-5 (Silva 25, Sanjeewani 7) Sutherland returns and six runs are taken off the over as Sri Lanka dream of making three figures. This innings has been a hard watch\u2026 and I\u2019m being paid. 16th over: Sri Lanka 71-5 (Silva 21, Sanjeewani 6) Anushka Sanjeewani is the new batter and has an immediate impact by hitting the first boundary for Sri Lanka in over eight overs! Wareham drifts onto the leg side and is flicked away fine for a more than welcome Sri Lankan boundary. Gah! A full toss from Wareham is smeared out to the leg side boundary where Ash Gardner pulls off a nifty catch. Sri Lanka lose another and are in the mire. 15th over: Sri Lanka 65-4 (Silva 21, Perera 2) Sophie Molineux has been very impressive so far in her three overs, she has 2-13 so far and has vindicated the selectors decision to go for her over the vastly experienced Jess Jonassen for this tournament. Sri Lanka stutter onward. 14th over: Sri Lanka 61-4 (Silva 19, Perera 0) Wareham gets out of the over for the cost of five more runs to the total, Sri Lanka have only found the boundary on two occasions so far in this innings. That\u2019s a damning stat indeed. 13th over: Sri Lanka 56-4 (Silva 14, Perera 0) Hasini Perera is the new batter, her side are in all sorts of bother here and looking down the barrel of a second straight defeat in this world cup campaign. Gone! With no boundary found in six overs Samarawickrama tries to bunt a full ball from Molineux down the ground but doesn\u2019t get it out of the screws, serving only to plink a return catch back to the bowler. 12th over: Sri Lanka 51-3 (Samarawickrama 20, Silva 12) My days \u2013 Darcie Brown has dropped an absolute goober at short extra cover! she won\u2019t want to see the replay of that one. A slower ball from Sutherland was spooned up by Samarawickrama and Brown made a real mess of it, ending up on her knees with the ball barely even going anywhere near the hands. Beth Mooney gives her a conciliatory pat on the back - \u201crather you than me, pal\u201d. Another maiden over for Australia \u2013 just a solitary leg-bye off the over in the end. 11th over: Sri Lanka 50-3 (Samarawickrama 20, Silva 12) Wareham continues after drinks, she\u2019s worked around for singles and they won\u2019t hurt the reigning champions at this stage. Is that a missed stumping chance? Wareham spears the ball in full and Samarawickrama ends up yorking herself on the charge, Healy can\u2019t gather the ball cleanly though and the batter manages to get her back foot back in time. Australia are well on top but they haven\u2019t been their usual slick outfit in the field so far. Enjoyed this: 10th over: Sri Lanka 43-3 (Samarawickrama 20, Silva 7) We\u2019re halfway through the overs in Sharjah and Sri Lanka have barely played a shot in anger. Time for a drink, let\u2019s hope theres some fiery electrolytes in the brew being brought out to the batters in the middle. 9th over: Sri Lanka 40-3 (Samarawickrama 20, Silva 4) Signs of slow turn for Wareham. Sri Lanka\u2019s batters are watchful and rotate the strike, picking up five runs off the over but it is nowhere near enough. Someone needs to take a risk and open the shoulders. 8th over: Sri Lanka 35-3 (Samarawickrama 17, Silva 2) Crikey, some shot from Samarawickrama as she \u2018sweeps\u2019 Gardner down the ground for four runs. That was more like a Pete Sampras forehand on the end but they all count. Gardner raises her eyebrows and then heads back to her mark to make amends. Eight runs off the over. We\u2019re going to have the first sighting of leg-spin \u2013 Georgia Wareham is tossed the ball. 7th over: Sri Lanka 27-3 (Samarawickrama 10, Silva 1) Nilakshika Silva comes to the middle with her side struggling to get any sort of footing in this match. Ash Gardner is coming back on too. Gulp. And another one gone, another one bites the dust! Sophie Molineux summoned into the attack and is around the wicket with her left arm tweakers. A flighted delivery drops under the attempted sweep shot and three reds on DRS send Dilhari back to the sheds. Sri Lanka in all sorts of trouble in Sharjah. 6th over: Sri Lanka 23-2 (Dilhari 3, Samarawickrama 9) Australia have had a fine start but have also been extremely sloppy, Darcie Brown replaces Ash Gardner and cannot find her radar or run up! Two front foot no balls, in fact make that THREE front foot no balls committed by Brown. What is going on out there?! Samarawickrama slots the first freebie for four but can\u2019t get anywhere near the next one as Brown spears down a wide. This over is lasting an eternity. I\u2019ve got at least three new wrinkles from squinting at the extras column\u202612 runs came off it in the end. \u2018Over\u2019 doing a lot of heavy lifting in this instance as TEN balls were sent down by Brown in total. 5th over: Sri Lanka 11-2 (Dilhari 3, Samarawickrama 2) Megan Schutt into her third over, she goes around the wicket to Samarawickrama who lines up a huge mow into the leg side but catches hold of nothing but fresh air. Just three runs off the over as Sri Lanka can\u2019t seem to break the shackles and find the fence. 4th over: Sri Lanka 8-2 (Dilhari 1, Samarawickrama 1 ) Harshitha Samarawickrama joins Madhavi in the middle, Gardner tosses one up above the eyes but the new batter doesn\u2019t take the bait. A single off the last ball gets Harsitha off the mark, Phoebe Litchfield guilty of diving over the ball in the covers. HUGE WICKET! Gardner scuds one on off the surface, Chamari tries to slog sweep but misses it completely. Vociferous appeal from bowler and fielders but umpire Sue Redfern says not out! Hmmm this looks close to me and Gardner makes the T-sign to her captain right away. Sure enough it is knocking out middle stump! Sri Lanka lose their best batter and Australia all over them like a very inexpensive suit. 3rd over: Sri Lanka 6-1 (Athapaththu 3, Dilhari 0) Australia all over Sri Lanka here, pressure building, captain Chamari has faced ten balls for just three runs and Gunaratne faced the same amount for a duck. Here comes Ash Gardner once again\u2026 Chamari glides past point to pick up the first runs off the bat. Same again the next ball, a compact shot from the Sri Lanka captain. Uh-oh \u2013 Schutt has committed the cardinal sin of overstepping with her front foot and thus gives away a free hit. She limits the damage with a well executed slower ball but she\u2019s overstepped twice in a row! Schutt stomps back to her mark, she might need to call for the trundle wheel and mark out that run up once more\u2026 no damage inflicted as the next ball is a decent yorker. Gone now! Schutt does not overstep and pins Gunaratne in front of middle \u2013 the DRS confirms the on field decision. Three reds and Australia have their first wicket. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 1-0 (Gunaratne 0, Athapaththu 0) Another maiden! Ash Gardner stitching together five dots and a solitary leg bye sees the scoreboard creak to life. 1st over: Sri Lanka 0-0 (Gunaratne 0, Athapaththu 0) A lesser spotted maiden over to begin with as Schutt keeps Gunaratne honest. Tight line and some movement in the air. Healy comes up to the stumps for the second half of the over too. Sri Lanka can\u2019t afford too many overs like that, especially not in the powerplay. Megan Schutt has the ball in hand. Captain Chamari and Gunarathne are opening up for Sri Lanka. Plenty of pressure on them after they lost to Pakistan in their first game, can they get their team off to a flier? Let\u2019s find out \u2013 PLAY! Shades and smears of zinc aplenty as the players head out for the anthems. Sri Lanka\u2019s jaunty tune takes this every time for me. I\u2019m allowed to say that as a completely impartial party. C\u2019mon - that trilling piccolo can\u2019t not put a spring in your step? It\u2019s a fresh pitch in Sharjah and the thoughts from the ground suggest it might skid on more than turn, especially to begin with. If dimension chat gets you going then cop a load of this \u2013 the longest boundary is the 73 metre one straight down the ground whilst the ones square are 57 and 63 metres respectively. I know, have a cold shower won\u2019t you. Teams: Phoebe Litchfield is back for Australia! Oh, and Ellyse Perry is playing in her NINTH T20 World Cup. Incredible. Australia XI: Alyssa Healy (c &amp; wk), Beth Mooney, Ellyse Perry, Ashleigh Gardner, Phoebe Litchfield, Tahlia McGrath, Annabel Sutherland, Georgia Wareham, Sophie Molineux, Megan Schutt, Darcie Brown Sri Lanka XI: Vishmi Gunaratne, Chamari Athapaththu (c), Harshita Samarawickrama, Hasini Perera, Kavisha Dilhari, Nilakshika Silva, Hasini Perera, Anushka Sanjeewani (wk), Sugandika Kumari, Inoshi Priyadarshani, Udeshika Prabodhani, Inoka Ranaweera No surprises in the decision, getting a score on the board has very much been the trend in Sharjah, both matches played at the ground on Thursday were won by the team batting first. Athapaththu says her team want to play fearless and exciting cricket. Healy is unperturbed by losing the toss, she says there is a calmness in their camp but delivers her words with a ruthless glint in the eye that suggests they are very much going to hit the ground running. It looks a scorcher in Sharjah, sun beating down but a bit of a breeze blowing across the ground to provide some succour from the rays. The mercury is set to hit 36 degrees today, Australia have been getting their Scandi on as part of their preparations for this tournament, regular sauna sessions deployed in order to get them used to the potentially sweltering conditions. Hello and welcome to the latest chapter in Australian dominance in women\u2019s world cricket\u2026 the T20 World Cup is underway in the UAE. Alyssa Healy\u2019s side have bossed the format over the past decade with six titles on the green and gold shelf, a stellar batting and bowling line up make for a well oiled winning machine. Today\u2019s opponents are Sri Lanka, no strangers to silverware themselves after scooping the Asian Cup a few months ago, Chamari Athapaththu\u2019s side will pose a decent threat today in Sharjah, albeit they\u2019ve never beaten Australia in a T20, then again - not many sides have. The tournament has already seen a shock result, over in Group A New Zealand skittled India yesterday in Dubai to run out winners by 58 runs. Will we see banana skins, steamrollering or something in between? There\u2019s only one way to find out \u2013 play begins at 2pm local time/8pm AEST and 11am where I am in foggy old London town. Send us your thoughts and theories in the usual way, I\u2019ll be back for the toss and team news very shortly.",

      "body": "<h2>The fight for rat-productive rights</h2> <p>Eric Adams, we recently learned, seems to have spent the bulk of his time as mayor of New York trying to wangle criminally cheap business class tickets from Turkish Airlines. But while Adams may have made history by becoming the first sitting mayor of New York to be indicted on federal corruption charges, the fact that he has a slightly wonky moral compass is old news. Even before being appointed mayor, there were questions about Adam\u2019s truthfulness, including a long-running debate about whether the swagger-obsessed candidate lived in Brooklyn, as he insisted he did, or New Jersey.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/03/melania-trump-memoir-abortion\">\u2018No room for compromise\u2019: Melania Trump reiterates abortion rights support</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, let\u2019s give the mayor his due, shall we? It would be unfair to say he\u2019s spent the entirety of his time in high office trying to live the high life. Adams, who appointed New York City\u2019s first \u201crat tsar\u201d last year, has also spent a lot of time thinking about the city\u2019s rodent problem. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a mayor in history that says how much he hates rats,\u201d he grandly proclaimed during New York City\u2019s inaugural Rat Summit in September. \u201cI dislike rats.\u201d Adams added that he was confident New York could \u201clook forward to a new paradigm in urban rat management\u201d.</p> <p>Wheelie bins are part of that exciting new paradigm in urban rat management. There was much mirth on social media over the summer when it transpired that New York City had paid McKinsey over a million dollars to figure out whether it might be a good idea to put loose rubbish in a bin. (Or, in management consultant speech, \u201ccontainerize\u201d it.) Now the brainiacs in Adams\u2019s orbit have come up with an exciting new paradigm shift: the city council recently greenlit pilot schemes to deploy ContraPest, a type of rodent birth control.</p> <p>The irony that New York is investing in rodent contraceptives at a time when women\u2019s access to reproductive services across the US is under fire hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. Social media has been filled with wry observations along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s easier to get reproductive rights as a rodent in New York than it is for a woman to get reproductive rights in most of the country\u201d.</p> <p>Because pedants never take a day off I will note that quip isn\u2019t strictly true. At least for the moment it isn\u2019t. But if Donald Trump wins the election and the extremists backing him have their way then it might very well be true that rats will soon have better access to birth control in the US than women. Over the past few years, rightwingers have started to speak more openly about the possibility of banning birth control. In 2022, for example, an Idaho Republican leader suggested he\u2019d consider banning certain forms of birth control, including the morning-after pill. Around the same time the governor of Mississippi refused to rule out future contraception bans during an interview on NBC.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just all talk. Over the years the right has managed to undermine access to birth control in a number of alarming ways. In 2022, for example, an appeals court ruled that federally funded family planning centers in Texas must receive parental consent before prescribing birth control to teenagers.

      "bodyText": "The fight for rat-productive rights Eric Adams, we recently learned, seems to have spent the bulk of his time as mayor of New York trying to wangle criminally cheap business class tickets from Turkish Airlines. But while Adams may have made history by becoming the first sitting mayor of New York to be indicted on federal corruption charges, the fact that he has a slightly wonky moral compass is old news. Even before being appointed mayor, there were questions about Adam\u2019s truthfulness, including a long-running debate about whether the swagger-obsessed candidate lived in Brooklyn, as he insisted he did, or New Jersey. Still, let\u2019s give the mayor his due, shall we? It would be unfair to say he\u2019s spent the entirety of his time in high office trying to live the high life. Adams, who appointed New York City\u2019s first \u201crat tsar\u201d last year, has also spent a lot of time thinking about the city\u2019s rodent problem. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a mayor in history that says how much he hates rats,\u201d he grandly proclaimed during New York City\u2019s inaugural Rat Summit in September. \u201cI dislike rats.\u201d Adams added that he was confident New York could \u201clook forward to a new paradigm in urban rat management\u201d. Wheelie bins are part of that exciting new paradigm in urban rat management. There was much mirth on social media over the summer when it transpired that New York City had paid McKinsey over a million dollars to figure out whether it might be a good idea to put loose rubbish in a bin. (Or, in management consultant speech, \u201ccontainerize\u201d it.) Now the brainiacs in Adams\u2019s orbit have come up with an exciting new paradigm shift: the city council recently greenlit pilot schemes to deploy ContraPest, a type of rodent birth control. The irony that New York is investing in rodent contraceptives at a time when women\u2019s access to reproductive services across the US is under fire hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. Social media has been filled with wry observations along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s easier to get reproductive rights as a rodent in New York than it is for a woman to get reproductive rights in most of the country\u201d. Because pedants never take a day off I will note that quip isn\u2019t strictly true. At least for the moment it isn\u2019t. But if Donald Trump wins the election and the extremists backing him have their way then it might very well be true that rats will soon have better access to birth control in the US than women. Over the past few years, rightwingers have started to speak more openly about the possibility of banning birth control. In 2022, for example, an Idaho Republican leader suggested he\u2019d consider banning certain forms of birth control, including the morning-after pill. Around the same time the governor of Mississippi refused to rule out future contraception bans during an interview on NBC. This isn\u2019t just all talk. Over the years the right has managed to undermine access to birth control in a number of alarming ways. In 2022, for example, an appeals court ruled that federally funded family planning centers in Texas must receive parental consent before prescribing birth control to teenagers. (Previously federal courts had found that the national title X program guaranteed minors the right to access birth control without parental involvement.) Then, this summer Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would have recognized a legal right to contraception. Perhaps most importantly, anti-abortion activists have also been doggedly trying to argue that certain birth control methods, such as Plan B and certain intrauterine devices (IUDs), are abortifacients because they may prevent the implantation of fertilized eggs. While it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ll see any sort of direct push to outlaw access to contraceptives, expect to see anti-abortion laws sneakily widen to restrict access to birth control. As advocates have noted, Roe was not toppled in a day\u2013and access to contraceptives won\u2019t be overturned imminently. But anti-abortion extremists have made clear what their endgame is.

      "bodyText": "When poet of the pillowcase Leon Bridges was promoting his Gold-Diggers Sound album in 2021, he told the Guardian he wanted to become one of the few black artists making country music. \u201cAll I need is time,\u201d he said. Well, time is always running away, and black country has since gone mainstream without Bridges\u2019s input. Black country star Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) was the American song of the summer. Still No 1 in the US singles charts after 12 weeks, it\u2019s also topped Billboard\u2019s Hot Country Songs chart for the past four months. Shaboozey is the only black man allowed to head the country chart in its 80-year history \u2013 Lil Nas X\u2019s Old Town Road was excluded for reasons too racist to list here \u2013 and only the second black artist, after Beyonc\u00e9 took Texas Hold \u2018Em top in February. So, to the uninformed, Bridges\u2019s detour down country roads on Leon could look like galloping after a runaway bandwagon. That would be untrue and unfair. Born in Atlanta, raised in Fort Worth, Bridges has this music in his marrow as much as soul or R&amp;B. Over the years he\u2019s earned some spurs, creating songs that could be called country to varying degree, in collaboration with fellow Texan icons like Kacey Musgraves and Miranda Lambert, as well as Khruangbin on the lovely Texas Sun. On Leon, Bridges has hardened his wings. It\u2019s a majestic confection that borrows promiscuously from soul, country and folk but doesn\u2019t owe any of them anything. He blends it all into what he calls his \u201cgumbo\u201d, a simmering mix of southern sounds, using music as a path to connect his past to his present, letting lost loves and home town nostalgia suffuse the stew. So much great pop is about escape, or transformation. It promises that who you were yesterday \u2013 or who you were a few minutes ago, before you heard that song \u2013 can be completely different to the person you are tomorrow. Leon is an excellent collection that pictures a man approaching middle age, driving round his old \u2019hoods, reflecting on those feelings, after the escape. It\u2019s a butterfly remembering how it felt to be a caterpillar. Appropriately for songs composed around summer-maddened memories, there are inconsistencies. We get at least three \u201cfirst love\u201d songs, and they all appear to be different girls, one of whom he may not even have met. It doesn\u2019t matter.

Curfews recur throughout, reminding us that summer is never as endless as its promise.

Plans include a dramatic increase in double yellow lines and a target to replace at least one on-street parking spot on each of Bristol\u2019s 1,500 streets with a bike hangar, planter or benches every year.

If we were fully on the road and [the car on the other side] was fully on the road then no cars could get through,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is nowhere else to park in Easton.

Rob Poole, 36, is fixing his VW camper van, which is up on the pavement. \u201cIf cars are parked on the road it becomes inconveniently narrow,\u201d he says. He understands concerns about accessibility but wouldn\u2019t want to give his vehicle up because it lets him \u201cgo places I would otherwise not go because public transport is so poor to certain places.\u201d James Stockhausen, 34, pauses after helping his family into their car, parked on the kerb outside their house. \u201cThe road is not wide enough. If we were fully on the road and [the car on the other side] was fully on the road then no cars could get through,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is nowhere else to park in Easton. It is not reasonable [to tell us to park elsewhere]. It is not the answer.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cFather of the atomic bomb\u201d is a boast enough to get a person noticed or, as J Robert Oppenheimer himself put it, quoting the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, \u201cdestroyer of worlds\u201d. The American physicist, though scarcely forgotten, had to wait for Hollywood and Christopher Nolan\u2019s 2023 blockbuster to gain modern celebrity. If cinema was slow to catch on, musicians have long been on the case of the lonely scientist and his 1945 test in the New Mexico desert: from songs by Sting and Billy Bragg in the 1980s to John Adams in his opera <em>Doctor Atomic</em> (2005) \u2013 a work that finally abandons music and ends with a bone-shaking, heart-chilling electronic boom.</p> <p>A more recent Oppenheimer piece is <em>Radiance</em>, by the Lithuanian composer Just\u00e9 Janulyt\u00e9 (b 1982). For 12 voices and live electronics, it made a disturbing impact at the <strong>68th International Festival of Contemporary Music </strong>or <strong><a href=\"https://www.labiennale.org/en/music/2024\">Biennale Musica</a></strong>, which comes under the umbrella of the Venice Biennale. Janulyt\u00e9 explores that perennial question: how wild, unfettered sound \u2013 here, the delayed aftermath of an atomic detonation \u2013 can topple into the patterns, the notes and rhythms, of music. Intended as a requiem for victims of the first atomic bombing, <em>Radiance</em> uses two groups of high and low voices, wordless, moving in and out of focus, splitting and uniting in apocalyptic aural fusion.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>This festival buzzes with seriousness and vitality, but is conceived on a human scale</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The performers were the virtuosic French vocal ensemble <strong><a href=\"https://sequenza93.fr/en\">Sequenza 9.3</a></strong>, directed by Catherine Simonpietri, in a programme featuring music by two other Baltic composers, the Estonian Arvo P\u00e4rt (his early, and pivotal, <em>Missa Syllabica</em>) and <em>Saline</em>, a first, and striking, choral work by the Latvian Santa Ratniece. The concert took place in the lofty, arcaded Teatro alle Tese, part of the restored Arsenale and especially appropriate here. The ancient Venetian arms factory, which merits a mention in Dante\u2019s <em>Inferno</em>, is associated with another troubled and isolated physicist, Galileo Galilei. One of his tasks there was to advise on the explosive force of gunpowder.</p>    <p>In the decorative elegance of the Ca\u2019Giustinian \u2013 administrative home of the Biennale \u2013 the New York-based <strong><a href=\"https://www.attaccaquartet.com/\">Attacca Quartet</a></strong> gave the world premiere of another work prompted by the nuclear threat, this time from a more pensive stance. <em>Daisy</em>, by the American composer David Lang (b 1957) takes as a starting point the American political \u201cpeace\u201d advertisement used in Lyndon Baines Johnson\u2019s electoral campaign of 1964: a young girl plucks petals off a daisy before being interrupted by a mushroom cloud. In the event, LBJ\u2019s presidency was overshadowed by war in Vietnam. Lang, a co-founder of the New York group Bang on a Can, writes idiomatically and fluently for strings, sharing lines generously between players, the style lyrical, clearly structured and transparent.</p> <p><em>Daisy</em> was paired with <em>Black Angels (Thirteen Images from the Dark Land)</em> by George Crumb, a work Lang calls one of his favourite pieces, and one of the great quartets written (in 1970) in his lifetime. I\u2019d agree. The musicians vigorously caught the mood of a work indelibly associated with Vietnam. The stylistic adventures and electronics still sound fresh: tapping instruments with thimbles, bowing on the wrong side of the string to create a ghostly effect, and water-filled crystal goblets played as a glass harmonica. A timeless study of terror and lament, <em>Black Angels</em> is music for today. (Only later, adding to an already swirling set of impressions, did I realise that Ca\u2019 Giustinian is where Richard Wagner wrote the epic second act of <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>).</p>    <p>Dipping in for two days to a festival lasting 16, I cannot easily sum up the many strands, which embrace concerts, lectures and \u201cencounters\u201d (which may mean the sound installation in the Sale d\u2019Armi featuring works by the American John Zorn and others, in a darkened sound chamber, floor cushions provided). This festival \u2013 my first visit \u2013 buzzes with seriousness and vitality, but is conceived on a human scale: concerts tend to be short, without intervals, inviting maximum concentration. The city\u2019s gilded musical past is also honoured. In the Chiesa della Piet\u00e0, the<strong> </strong><strong>Venice Baroque Orchestra</strong><strong>, </strong>directed from the harpsichord by Andrea Marcon, played five concertos from Antonio Vivaldi\u2019s <em>L\u2019Estro Armonico</em>. On their feet, powered by infectious adrenaline, bowing arms mercurial, fingering nimble, these players displayed the restless ingenuity and genius of this greatest of Venetians.</p> <p>The step between baroque velocity and the freethinking <strong><a href=\"https://scottishensemble.co.uk/\">Scottish Ensemble</a>,</strong> who played at Queen Elizabeth Hall, to close the Southbank\u2019s Centre\u2019s season-opening weekend, was surprisingly small: another group of elite string players, standing to perform, joyfully drilled by their leader/director Jonathan Morton. Using many of the techniques pioneered by Vivaldi, they played, among others, works by Anna Meredith, Bryce Dessner, Jonny Greenwood and Philip Glass.</p>    <p>Earlier the same evening, in the Clore Ballroom \u2013 curtained off to create a proper listening space \u2013 the <strong><a href=\"https://paraorchestra.com/\">Paraorchestra</a></strong><strong>,</strong> conducted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/feb/07/charles-hazlewood-beethoven-and-me-interview-paraorchestra\">Charles Hazlewood</a>, gave an immersive performance of Henryk G\u00f3recki\u2019s <em>Symphony of Sorrowful Songs</em> (touring to <a href=\"https://www.rncm.ac.uk/performance/paraorchestra-symphony-of-sorrowful-songs/\">Manchester</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nch.ie/all-events-listing/paraorchestra-charles-hazlewood/\">Dublin</a> in November). Founded in 2011, the orchestra consists of disabled and non-disabled professional musicians, and aims to expand the possibilities of concert performance. The soprano was <a href=\"http://www.victoriaoruwari.com/\">Victoria Oruwari</a>, Nigerian-born, London-based and resolutely affecting. Musicians, dressed in white, were positioned on low platforms all around. We were invited to sit or stand anywhere. Perched at the feet of a violinist, in semi-darkness, surrounded by a forest of legs, I had no idea how many musicians were playing, or the nature of their disabilities or non-disabilities. Only the music mattered. It was salutary and uplifting.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)<br>Biennale Musica </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<em><br>Scottish Ensemble </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<em><br>Paraorchestra: Symphony of Sorrowful Songs </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.labiennale.org/en/music/2024\">The Biennale Musica, Venice, continues until 11 October</a></p></li> </ul>",

The stylistic adventures and electronics still sound fresh: tapping instruments with thimbles, bowing on the wrong side of the string to create a ghostly effect, and water-filled crystal goblets played as a glass harmonica. A timeless study of terror and lament, Black Angels is music for today. (Only later, adding to an already swirling set of impressions, did I realise that Ca\u2019 Giustinian is where Richard Wagner wrote the epic second act of Tristan und Isolde). Dipping in for two days to a festival lasting 16, I cannot easily sum up the many strands, which embrace concerts, lectures and \u201cencounters\u201d (which may mean the sound installation in the Sale d\u2019Armi featuring works by the American John Zorn and others, in a darkened sound chamber, floor cushions provided). This festival \u2013 my first visit \u2013 buzzes with seriousness and vitality, but is conceived on a human scale: concerts tend to be short, without intervals, inviting maximum concentration. The city\u2019s gilded musical past is also honoured. In the Chiesa della Piet\u00e0, the Venice Baroque Orchestra, directed from the harpsichord by Andrea Marcon, played five concertos from Antonio Vivaldi\u2019s L\u2019Estro Armonico. On their feet, powered by infectious adrenaline, bowing arms mercurial, fingering nimble, these players displayed the restless ingenuity and genius of this greatest of Venetians. The step between baroque velocity and the freethinking Scottish Ensemble, who played at Queen Elizabeth Hall, to close the Southbank\u2019s Centre\u2019s season-opening weekend, was surprisingly small: another group of elite string players, standing to perform, joyfully drilled by their leader/director Jonathan Morton. Using many of the techniques pioneered by Vivaldi, they played, among others, works by Anna Meredith, Bryce Dessner, Jonny Greenwood and Philip Glass. Earlier the same evening, in the Clore Ballroom \u2013 curtained off to create a proper listening space \u2013 the Paraorchestra, conducted by Charles Hazlewood, gave an immersive performance of Henryk G\u00f3recki\u2019s Symphony of Sorrowful Songs (touring to Manchester and Dublin in November). Founded in 2011, the orchestra consists of disabled and non-disabled professional musicians, and aims to expand the possibilities of concert performance. The soprano was Victoria Oruwari, Nigerian-born, London-based and resolutely affecting. Musicians, dressed in white, were positioned on low platforms all around. We were invited to sit or stand anywhere. Perched at the feet of a violinist, in semi-darkness, surrounded by a forest of legs, I had no idea how many musicians were playing, or the nature of their disabilities or non-disabilities. Only the music mattered. It was salutary and uplifting.

      "body": "<p>On 13 March 2020 a cruise ship called the Braemar was denied entry to the Bahamas after a number of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/cruise-ships-scramble-to-find-safe-harbour-amid-covid-19-crisis-as-countries-turn-them-away\">passengers tested positive</a> for Covid. Forced to travel around the Caribbean, it was finally accepted by Cuba, from where those on board were evacuated to the UK.</p> <p>The Braemar was just one of a number of cruise ships in which passengers found themselves quarantined at sea in those uncertain days. The Diamond Princess was stuck for a month anchored in Japan as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/06/inside-the-cruise-ship-that-became-a-coronavirus-breeding-ground-diamond-princess\">virus ripped through it</a>, leaving more than 700 infected and nine dead. Another ship, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/12/covid-outbreak-on-ruby-princess-not-an-accident-and-cruise-should-never-have-sailed-court-told\">Ruby Princess</a>, had 28 deaths. It was a nautical horror show.</p> <p>Almost overnight these ocean-going symbols of leisure had become crucibles of death and contagion. Over the next 24 months, 35 cruise liners were sent to Aliaga in Turkey, the maritime graveyard where ships are dismantled and sold for scrap. Several major lines went into liquidation, and some observers suggested that the $150bn global cruise industry was effectively sunk.</p>    <p>Yet last week the Braemar, under a new name, left Belfast on the beginning of a three-and-a-half-year world cruise, heralding a new era in long-term cruises or, to put it another way, living at sea.</p> <p>Having been bought in 2023 by a company called Villa Vie Residences, the liner is now named the Odyssey. Aside from the 125 passengers currently on board, the ship is also carrying a couple of heavyweight omens. Belfast was the port in which the Titanic was built and from where its fateful maiden voyage began. And the Odyssey is named after Homer\u2019s epic poem in which its hero, Odysseus, famously spent 10 years wandering around the Mediterranean.</p> <p>The Odyssey\u2019s odyssey isn\u2019t due to be quite so long, but the liner, which was scheduled to begin its cruise on 30 May, has already been beset by obstacles, much like Odysseus himself. Not quite a cyclops or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/27/i-can-see-odysseus-lashed-to-the-mast-of-this-ship-sirens-song\">the Sirens</a>, but slightly more prosaic rudder and gear troubles. They added up to four months of repairs and left passengers to savour the summer delights of Belfast, a city hitherto uncelebrated for sunny blue skies.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had so much use for my umbrella in my life,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/30/cruise-ship-belfast-villa-vie-odyssey-passengers\">Holly Hennessey,</a> a \u201ccruise addict\u201d from Florida who had to move into a hotel in the city over the summer.</p> <p>All told the voyage will last around the same amount of time as that between the last major lockdown and the present day. During that period the cruise industry has managed to stage a conspicuous comeback. Earlier this year, Royal Caribbean launched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/26/icon-of-the-seas-largest-cruise-ship-human-lasagne-climate-fuel-lng-greenwashing\">biggest cruise ship in the world</a>, the gargantuan Icon of the Seas, with a quarter of a million gross tonnage, more than 7,500 passengers and crew, 20 decks, an indoor waterpark and an <em>actual</em> park.</p> <p>If these modern sea monsters, with their garish amusements, are an often unloved sign of the resurgence of cruises, then the Odyssey \u2013 roughly a 10th of the size \u2013 points to a different trend. It\u2019s not about a leisure break so much as a lifestyle rethink. The governing principle seems to be that better than a home near the sea is one <em>on</em> it.</p> <p>As Mikael Petterson, chief executive of Villa Vie Residences, said as the Odyssey finally pulled out from Belfast Lough: \u201cFrom this moment forward, our ship is not just a vessel but a home.\u201d</p> <p>That home comes at a price of between $99,999 and $899,000 (\u00a375,000-\u00a3685,000), depending on the size and comfort of the cabin, although only the mid-range are now available, with two-thirds of the accommodation already sold or rented. Ownership \u2013 which is contractually guaranteed for a minimum of 15 years (at least four circumnavigations) or, if longer, the operational life of the ship (it\u2019s already 31 years old) \u2013 means that you can customise your cabin, come and go as you please, and also lease it out.</p>    <p>If this sounds like a radical development in ocean cruising, something like it has been tried before. Back in 2002 a cruise liner called the World was launched after a promotional campaign lasting several years that sold the idea of living full-time on a luxury liner to an upmarket clientele. They also had the choice of buying or renting, but the business was close to capsizing within a year of the ship \u00adsetting sail. The model of wealthy long-term owners and short-stay guests proved to be unseaworthy.</p> <p>As one owner put it at the time: \u201cIf you\u2019re a hotel guest, you just can\u2019t care for a place the same way you do when it\u2019s your home.\u201d</p> <p>Well, sure, if you\u2019re Ozzy Osbourne and you want to unwind by ripping a TV from the wall and chucking it in the sea. But most luxury hotel guests are not going to do anything more transgressive than leave a towel on the cabin floor.</p> <p>The real issue, of course, was exclusivity. There\u2019s a distinction among the very wealthy that\u2019s known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/22/london-super-rich-serious-money-caroline-knowles\">haves and the have-yachts</a>. And the kinds of people who are rich but not necessarily in the super-yacht-owning class don\u2019t want to share a residence with tourists, however well-behaved.</p> <p>So the World relaunched in the style of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/08/new-york-housing-co-ops-apartments-discrimination\">Manhattan-style co-op</a> in which everyone has a share in the ownership and running of the vessel. Similarly owners were able to screen potential buyers, thus ensuring that there were no unwelcome types who might bring the tone of the neighbourhood down by sporting the wrong swimming trunks.</p> <p>Twenty-two years on, \u201cthe world\u2019s only residential community at sea\u201d, as the World calls itself, is still making its way around the world.</p> <p>Over that length of time it might appear the danger was not \u00adgetting seasick but growing sick of&nbsp;the sea. But no one is permanently there.</p> <p>\u201cMost of our owners typically own, on average, for about seven years,\u201d says a salesperson for the World, \u201calthough we do have some that have owned since the ship first started sailing.\u201d</p> <p>The ship\u2019s itinerary is decided by a committee of residents, with stops every two or three days and no return to the original port of departure for at least three years.</p> <p>In reality the World isn\u2019t a home but a second home. Most residents stay around fourth months spread out across the year, with typically two months in the summer and another two around Christmas.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a very high net worth community,\u201d explains the salesperson. \u201cThe net worth requirement to own on the ship is $10m unencumbered. So for these residents, this is probably their second, third or fourth of multiple homes.\u201d</p> <p>The World was somewhere near Papua New Guinea on Thursday, heading towards Australia, but in a sense it could be anywhere, unencumbered by normal concerns. Because the World is an oyster filled with pearl-clad residents, a mobile yet enclosed society forever moving between one non-place and another.</p>    <p>It was the French anthropologist Marc Aug\u00e9 who made the distinction between places and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/28/non-places-marc-auge-review\">non-places</a>. A place empowers people\u2019s identity; it\u2019s somewhere that social groups form through shared cultural references. By contrast a non-place is a space of transience in which \u00adpeople remain anonymous. Aug\u00e9 cited motorways, hotels rooms, airports and shopping malls as examples.</p> <p>To the narrowly socially defined residents of the World, the ports and people they visit must eventually merge into a series of indistinguishable backdrops: it\u2019s Thursday, this&nbsp;must be Bora Bora.</p> <p>Even so, two other ships recently hoped to follow in the World\u2019s wake, and both were propelled, like the original, by waves of publicity. The first came from a company called Life at Sea. It promised a three-year cruise of 135 countries and 375 destinations, and marketed itself not just at the traditional clientele of senior citizens but also young digital nomads, who, thanks to first-rate internet arrangements, could work from anywhere on the high seas.</p> <p>The package had everything except, it turned out, a ship, a minor detail that eventually scuppered the grandiose plans.</p> <p>The first person to sign up for the aborted cruise was former flight attendant Meredith Shay, who was not alone in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/01/half-million-dollars-three-year-cruise-ship-possessions-liberating\">selling her home and most of her possessions</a> to finance the trip.

      "bodyText": "On 13 March 2020 a cruise ship called the Braemar was denied entry to the Bahamas after a number of its passengers tested positive for Covid. Forced to travel around the Caribbean, it was finally accepted by Cuba, from where those on board were evacuated to the UK. The Braemar was just one of a number of cruise ships in which passengers found themselves quarantined at sea in those uncertain days. The Diamond Princess was stuck for a month anchored in Japan as the virus ripped through it, leaving more than 700 infected and nine dead. Another ship, the Ruby Princess, had 28 deaths. It was a nautical horror show. Almost overnight these ocean-going symbols of leisure had become crucibles of death and contagion. Over the next 24 months, 35 cruise liners were sent to Aliaga in Turkey, the maritime graveyard where ships are dismantled and sold for scrap. Several major lines went into liquidation, and some observers suggested that the $150bn global cruise industry was effectively sunk. Yet last week the Braemar, under a new name, left Belfast on the beginning of a three-and-a-half-year world cruise, heralding a new era in long-term cruises or, to put it another way, living at sea. Having been bought in 2023 by a company called Villa Vie Residences, the liner is now named the Odyssey. Aside from the 125 passengers currently on board, the ship is also carrying a couple of heavyweight omens. Belfast was the port in which the Titanic was built and from where its fateful maiden voyage began. And the Odyssey is named after Homer\u2019s epic poem in which its hero, Odysseus, famously spent 10 years wandering around the Mediterranean. The Odyssey\u2019s odyssey isn\u2019t due to be quite so long, but the liner, which was scheduled to begin its cruise on 30 May, has already been beset by obstacles, much like Odysseus himself. Not quite a cyclops or the Sirens, but slightly more prosaic rudder and gear troubles. They added up to four months of repairs and left passengers to savour the summer delights of Belfast, a city hitherto uncelebrated for sunny blue skies. \u201cI\u2019ve never had so much use for my umbrella in my life,\u201d said Holly Hennessey, a \u201ccruise addict\u201d from Florida who had to move into a hotel in the city over the summer. All told the voyage will last around the same amount of time as that between the last major lockdown and the present day. During that period the cruise industry has managed to stage a conspicuous comeback. Earlier this year, Royal Caribbean launched the biggest cruise ship in the world, the gargantuan Icon of the Seas, with a quarter of a million gross tonnage, more than 7,500 passengers and crew, 20 decks, an indoor waterpark and an actual park. If these modern sea monsters, with their garish amusements, are an often unloved sign of the resurgence of cruises, then the Odyssey \u2013 roughly a 10th of the size \u2013 points to a different trend. It\u2019s not about a leisure break so much as a lifestyle rethink. The governing principle seems to be that better than a home near the sea is one on it. As Mikael Petterson, chief executive of Villa Vie Residences, said as the Odyssey finally pulled out from Belfast Lough: \u201cFrom this moment forward, our ship is not just a vessel but a home.\u201d That home comes at a price of between $99,999 and $899,000 (\u00a375,000-\u00a3685,000), depending on the size and comfort of the cabin, although only the mid-range are now available, with two-thirds of the accommodation already sold or rented.

Early voting is already under way and more than 1.4 million Americans had voted as of midday Friday, <a href=\"https://election.lab.ufl.edu/early-vote/2024-early-voting/\">according to data</a> collected by the Election Lab at the University of Florida.</p> \n<p>Harris retains a slight lead, similar to the Guardian\u2019s analysis last week. But the numbers have yet to reflect the vice-presidential debate.</p> \n<p>The simplest path to winning the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency continues to be winning the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. While Harris leads Trump in the 10-day average of polls in all three, according to the Guardian\u2019s analysis (Pennsylvania by 1.2 points, Michigan by 0.1 point, and Wisconsin by 2.2 points), those advantages aren\u2019t significant enough to say who will win, analysts say.</p> \n<p>The race is similarly close in the four other battleground states, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2024/oct/05/us-politics-underwhelming-walz-and-more-presentable-vance-in-vp-debate-full-story-podcast\">US politics: underwhelming Walz and more presentable Vance in VP debate \u2013 Full Story podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cNo candidate enjoys a significant lead in states worth the 270 electoral votes needed to win,\u201d Nate Cohn, the polling analyst for the New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/upshot/polling-trump-harris-election.html\">wrote in his weekly newsletter</a>. \u201cThis might be the clearest read we\u2019ve had of the race so far. It was arguably the first \u2018quiet\u2019 week since Vice-President Harris\u2019s entry into the race.\u201d</p> \n<p>One slight exception may be in Pennsylvania, Cohn wrote. Polls showed Harris leading in the state by about 2 points after the 10 September debate, but now the race there was essentially tied, he wrote.</p> \n<p>The Guardian\u2019s tracker is based on an average of high quality polls over the last 10 days compiled by 538. As of Friday, the forecasting site said the race was <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/?cid=rrpromo\">essentially a toss-up</a>, with Harris having a 55% chance of winning and Trump having a 45% chance.</p> \n<p>Some of Trump\u2019s best polling has been in Arizona \u2013 he leads Harris there 48.8% to 48%, according to the Guardian\u2019s state poll tracker. Some of that advantage may have to do with his support among Hispanic voters, Cohn wrote.</p> \n<p>When Joe Biden won Arizona in 2020, he carried Latino voters <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/arizona\">by nearly 25 points</a>. Four high-quality polls released this week showed Harris leading among Hispanic voters by no more than 12 points, Cohn noted. A national poll from <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/poll-harris-trump-democrats-advantage-latino-voters-continues-shrink-rcna172686\">NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC</a> found Harris leading among Hispanic voters 54%-40%. Biden won 59% of the Hispanic vote in 2020.</p> \n<p>\u201cMr Trump\u2019s strength among Hispanic voters this cycle might seem surprising, but four years ago he made big gains among them across the country,\u201d Cohn wrote. \u201cAnd in 2016, he fared no worse than Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 showing among them, even though his anti-immigration rhetoric created the expectation of a significant backlash. In retrospect, his resilience among Hispanic voters in 2016 looks like a harbinger of what was to come.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2024/08/us-poll-tracker/historical-10-05\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hispanic voters are not a monolith and Trump and Biden may be targeting different parts of the demographic. A<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/\"> Pew analysis</a> found Biden won college-educated Hispanic voters 69% to 30% in 2020. But among non-college educated Hispanics, he won a much narrower 55% to 41%.</p> \n<p>Recent polling from the non-partisan <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/survey-research/2024-swing-state-project/swing-state-polling-finds-deadlocked-presidential\">Cook Political Report</a> also found that the race was essentially tied. But its analysis did show some good signs for Harris.</p> \n<p>A plurality of voters now think Harris will win the election, with 46% saying so compared to 39% for Trump.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat represents an 11-point swing in Harris\u2019s favor since August, and suggests that Harris has been successful in presenting herself as a serious candidate, while Trump\u2019s attempts to portray her as unable to do the job have not been effective,\u201d Amy Walter and Jessica Taylor, two of the site\u2019s editors, <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/survey-research/2024-swing-state-project/swing-state-polling-finds-deadlocked-presidential\">wrote in an analysis</a>.</p> \n<p>There were also some encouraging signs for Harris on the economy, the Cook Political Report found.

      "bodyText": "More than 1.4 million people have now voted in the presidential election, as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump continue to crisscross the country in the final stretch of a neck-and-neck campaign. Their vice-presidential picks, JD Vance and Tim Walz, also faced off this week in the only vice-presidential debate of this cycle. But initial polls suggested voters saw the debate as a draw, without clear impact on the race. Harris earned her highest national polling average since July, though the presidential race remains extremely close in battleground states, according to the Guardian\u2019s poll tracker. Harris is leading in five of seven swing states, according to the Guardian\u2019s average of high-quality state polls aggregated by the polling analysis platform 538 over the last 10 days. But overall, both candidates continue to have about even odds of winning. The Guardian\u2019s tracker shows Harris with 49.3% of the vote nationally, compared with 46% for Trump. Early voting is already under way and more than 1.4 million Americans had voted as of midday Friday, according to data collected by the Election Lab at the University of Florida. Harris retains a slight lead, similar to the Guardian\u2019s analysis last week. But the numbers have yet to reflect the vice-presidential debate. The simplest path to winning the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency continues to be winning the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. While Harris leads Trump in the 10-day average of polls in all three, according to the Guardian\u2019s analysis (Pennsylvania by 1.2 points, Michigan by 0.1 point, and Wisconsin by 2.2 points), those advantages aren\u2019t significant enough to say who will win, analysts say. The race is similarly close in the four other battleground states, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona. \u201cNo candidate enjoys a significant lead in states worth the 270 electoral votes needed to win,\u201d Nate Cohn, the polling analyst for the New York Times, wrote in his weekly newsletter. \u201cThis might be the clearest read we\u2019ve had of the race so far. It was arguably the first \u2018quiet\u2019 week since Vice-President Harris\u2019s entry into the race.\u201d One slight exception may be in Pennsylvania, Cohn wrote. Polls showed Harris leading in the state by about 2 points after the 10 September debate, but now the race there was essentially tied, he wrote. The Guardian\u2019s tracker is based on an average of high quality polls over the last 10 days compiled by 538. As of Friday, the forecasting site said the race was essentially a toss-up, with Harris having a 55% chance of winning and Trump having a 45% chance. Some of Trump\u2019s best polling has been in Arizona \u2013 he leads Harris there 48.8% to 48%, according to the Guardian\u2019s state poll tracker. Some of that advantage may have to do with his support among Hispanic voters, Cohn wrote. When Joe Biden won Arizona in 2020, he carried Latino voters by nearly 25 points. Four high-quality polls released this week showed Harris leading among Hispanic voters by no more than 12 points, Cohn noted. A national poll from NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC found Harris leading among Hispanic voters 54%-40%. Biden won 59% of the Hispanic vote in 2020. \u201cMr Trump\u2019s strength among Hispanic voters this cycle might seem surprising, but four years ago he made big gains among them across the country,\u201d Cohn wrote. \u201cAnd in 2016, he fared no worse than Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 showing among them, even though his anti-immigration rhetoric created the expectation of a significant backlash. In retrospect, his resilience among Hispanic voters in 2016 looks like a harbinger of what was to come.\u201d Hispanic voters are not a monolith and Trump and Biden may be targeting different parts of the demographic. A Pew analysis found Biden won college-educated Hispanic voters 69% to 30% in 2020. But among non-college educated Hispanics, he won a much narrower 55% to 41%. Recent polling from the non-partisan Cook Political Report also found that the race was essentially tied. But its analysis did show some good signs for Harris. A plurality of voters now think Harris will win the election, with 46% saying so compared to 39% for Trump. \u201cThat represents an 11-point swing in Harris\u2019s favor since August, and suggests that Harris has been successful in presenting herself as a serious candidate, while Trump\u2019s attempts to portray her as unable to do the job have not been effective,\u201d Amy Walter and Jessica Taylor, two of the site\u2019s editors, wrote in an analysis. There were also some encouraging signs for Harris on the economy, the Cook Political Report found. While Trump continues to lead among voters who believe he is better equipped to handle the economy, voters are evenly split on who would be better to get inflation under control. In August, Trump had a 48%-42% advantage on the issue. The shift might reflect that Harris\u2019s messaging on the economy is breaking through to voters, Walter and Taylor wrote. It could also suggest that Trump hasn\u2019t been successful in linking Harris to the rising cost of living, they said.",

      "body": "<p>After 20 years fighting flames for the US Forest Service, the fire captain Abel Martinez has pretty much seen it all.</p> <p>His lungs are scarred from the smouldering car tires and scorched homes that fed billowing flames alongside highways, through parched canyons, or over treetops in the Angeles national forest, the mountainous wilderness where he works in southern California. Whether it\u2019s a dry year or a wet one, the decades on the job have taught him that every fire season is likely to be a busy one.</p> <p>But this year, sweltering weather added brutal new dimensions to the already dangerous work.</p> <p>The summer has been California\u2019s hottest in more than a century, a grim record that\u2019s been felt first-hand by those on the fire line. Heatwave after heatwave blasted the state with triple-digit temperatures for months on end. Meanwhile, the state has seen close to a million acres burn, with months still to go before the highest risks subside.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/12/us-firefighters-forest-service-labor-disputes\">Burned-out firefighters are fleeing the US Forest Service amid labor disputes: \u2018We are decimated\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn So Cal it seems like it is always hot, but then you get a heatwave,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHeat waves suck.\u201d</p> <p>For firefighters like Martinez, the extreme temperatures make an already grueling job even harder. Depending on their role, wildland firefighters carry between 50lbs and 75lbs in packs that they slug up steep, rugged slopes that lack trails or easy routes. During initial attacks, when the aim is to try to corral the flames before they spread, the work is chaotic and fast-moving.</p> <p>When temperatures climb past 100F (37.7C), it takes an exacting toll on a firefighters\u2019 bodies. \u201cIt is not normal for a human to be out there with that much weight basically covered from head to toe in 115F heat,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you factor in the heat from the ground that you\u2019re standing on and the heat from the flames that are burning and the impacts of the smoke.\u201d Without the ability to breathe deeply, hard-working muscles are depleted of oxygen. And in the remote environments where these men and women work, getting enough hydration is a major challenge.</p> <p>This year as the heat spiked, tactics had to be adjusted and plans put in place. Injuries still occurred. \u201cYou can\u2019t push the way you push on a 95-100F fire day,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s 115F, people are going to end up in the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Firefighting has never been a job for the faint of heart. But dangerous and difficult conditions compound when the heat index rises, especially when crews aren\u2019t able to get the rest they need.</p> <p>\u201cWe know if we get a fire, we are probably not going to get a lot of backup soon \u2013 if at all,\u201d Martinez said between rattling coughs. A bout of pneumonia took him off the fireline for a week, marking one of the only long breaks he would get in the height of a busy summer.</p> <p>Wildland firefighting has always been a dangerous, tiring job. But the risks, and the toll they take, have only escalated as California\u2019s climate intensifies. Experienced federal firefighters like Martinez are growing rarer as years of low pay and overwork have pushed many to leave the profession, or at least the federal agencies where conditions are difficult to sustain. Those still in the trenches, like Martinez, have been left to pick up the slack.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We are working folks to the ground. There is no stop to it</p> <footer> <cite>Abel Martinez</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are working folks to the ground,\u201d he said, mentioning that some crews are putting in roughly 1,400 hours of overtime and are still being asked to keep showing up. \u201cThere is no stop to it.\u201d</p> <p>The strain has led to more injuries along with extreme levels of physical and mental fatigue. \u201cA fire environment is really dynamic,\u201d he said, adding that burnout can impact decision-making and increase the dangers to firefighters and the communities and landscapes they are working to protect. \u201cYou are not processing information like you would if you had adequate rest.\u201d</p> <p>But thousands of firefighters like Martinez still continue to brave the conditions, hazards and the mounting pressures year after year, bound by a deep sense of duty despite a dire lack of support. Even as temperatures continue to spike, they strap in for days at a time with little reprieve, taking the harms on the chin.</p> <p>The impacts to their health and well-being add up. \u201cAfter 20 years of fighting fire I have lung damage,\u201d Martinez said, noting that there are inadequate respiratory protections for wildland firefighters.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s repeated exposure,\u201d he said of the harmful substances he and others breathe in daily. \u201cFires burn into some kind of structure or vehicle and that smoke from those combustables \u2013 houses, shipping containers, pallets \u2013 when you breathe that in, it\u2019s even worse. Especially here, fires on the side of the freeway. Tires, poop bags, you name it \u2013 we have found kilos of cocaine on the side of the road.\u201d</p> <p>Martinez emphasized that there needs to be better preparation for burnout, especially in a future where conditions are only expected to grow more dangerous. Until then, firefighters have tried to protect themselves the best they can.</p> <p>\u201cI have been pushing our guys to decontaminate,\u201d he said. A 10-minute shower in very hot water to \u201copen up the pores and get all the gunk out\u201d has become a priority. They use strong detergents to wash their gear and suds up with soaps to wash away contaminants that cling to their skin and hair.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand the danger of carcinogens,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "After 20 years fighting flames for the US Forest Service, the fire captain Abel Martinez has pretty much seen it all. His lungs are scarred from the smouldering car tires and scorched homes that fed billowing flames alongside highways, through parched canyons, or over treetops in the Angeles national forest, the mountainous wilderness where he works in southern California. Whether it\u2019s a dry year or a wet one, the decades on the job have taught him that every fire season is likely to be a busy one. But this year, sweltering weather added brutal new dimensions to the already dangerous work. The summer has been California\u2019s hottest in more than a century, a grim record that\u2019s been felt first-hand by those on the fire line. Heatwave after heatwave blasted the state with triple-digit temperatures for months on end. Meanwhile, the state has seen close to a million acres burn, with months still to go before the highest risks subside. \u201cIn So Cal it seems like it is always hot, but then you get a heatwave,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHeat waves suck.\u201d For firefighters like Martinez, the extreme temperatures make an already grueling job even harder. Depending on their role, wildland firefighters carry between 50lbs and 75lbs in packs that they slug up steep, rugged slopes that lack trails or easy routes. During initial attacks, when the aim is to try to corral the flames before they spread, the work is chaotic and fast-moving. When temperatures climb past 100F (37.7C), it takes an exacting toll on a firefighters\u2019 bodies. \u201cIt is not normal for a human to be out there with that much weight basically covered from head to toe in 115F heat,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you factor in the heat from the ground that you\u2019re standing on and the heat from the flames that are burning and the impacts of the smoke.\u201d Without the ability to breathe deeply, hard-working muscles are depleted of oxygen. And in the remote environments where these men and women work, getting enough hydration is a major challenge. This year as the heat spiked, tactics had to be adjusted and plans put in place. Injuries still occurred. \u201cYou can\u2019t push the way you push on a 95-100F fire day,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s 115F, people are going to end up in the hospital.\u201d Firefighting has never been a job for the faint of heart. But dangerous and difficult conditions compound when the heat index rises, especially when crews aren\u2019t able to get the rest they need. \u201cWe know if we get a fire, we are probably not going to get a lot of backup soon \u2013 if at all,\u201d Martinez said between rattling coughs. A bout of pneumonia took him off the fireline for a week, marking one of the only long breaks he would get in the height of a busy summer. Wildland firefighting has always been a dangerous, tiring job. But the risks, and the toll they take, have only escalated as California\u2019s climate intensifies. Experienced federal firefighters like Martinez are growing rarer as years of low pay and overwork have pushed many to leave the profession, or at least the federal agencies where conditions are difficult to sustain. Those still in the trenches, like Martinez, have been left to pick up the slack. \u201cWe are working folks to the ground,\u201d he said, mentioning that some crews are putting in roughly 1,400 hours of overtime and are still being asked to keep showing up. \u201cThere is no stop to it.\u201d The strain has led to more injuries along with extreme levels of physical and mental fatigue. \u201cA fire environment is really dynamic,\u201d he said, adding that burnout can impact decision-making and increase the dangers to firefighters and the communities and landscapes they are working to protect. \u201cYou are not processing information like you would if you had adequate rest.\u201d But thousands of firefighters like Martinez still continue to brave the conditions, hazards and the mounting pressures year after year, bound by a deep sense of duty despite a dire lack of support. Even as temperatures continue to spike, they strap in for days at a time with little reprieve, taking the harms on the chin. The impacts to their health and well-being add up. \u201cAfter 20 years of fighting fire I have lung damage,\u201d Martinez said, noting that there are inadequate respiratory protections for wildland firefighters. \u201cIt\u2019s repeated exposure,\u201d he said of the harmful substances he and others breathe in daily. \u201cFires burn into some kind of structure or vehicle and that smoke from those combustables \u2013 houses, shipping containers, pallets \u2013 when you breathe that in, it\u2019s even worse. Especially here, fires on the side of the freeway. Tires, poop bags, you name it \u2013 we have found kilos of cocaine on the side of the road.\u201d Martinez emphasized that there needs to be better preparation for burnout, especially in a future where conditions are only expected to grow more dangerous. Until then, firefighters have tried to protect themselves the best they can. \u201cI have been pushing our guys to decontaminate,\u201d he said. A 10-minute shower in very hot water to \u201copen up the pores and get all the gunk out\u201d has become a priority. They use strong detergents to wash their gear and suds up with soaps to wash away contaminants that cling to their skin and hair. \u201cWe understand the danger of carcinogens,\u201d he said. After that, he said, \u201cthe priority becomes food and sleep \u2013 at least until you get another call\u201d. This is the last of three stories about the US workers who are struggling to survive a summer of extreme heat that shattered records from coast to coast. Read part one here and two here.",

Of the remaining trio, the former lawmaker Ayachi Zammel was jailed this week for reportedly falsifying documents. It is unclear if his candidature remains valid despite his detention.</p>    <p>Bassam Khawaja, a deputy director for Middle East and north Africa at Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cSince the start of the electoral period on 14 July, authorities have prosecuted, convicted, or detained at least nine prospective candidates.\u201d</p> <p>Late in September, Tunisia\u2019s parliament voted with an overwhelming majority to strip the courts of the power to reverse decisions made by its electoral body.

He apportioned to himself the power to appoint magistrates and the seven ISIE members by presidential decree \u2013 and fire them at will.</p>    <p>More than a dozen leaders of the leading opposition party, Ennahda, including the former MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/05/uk-urged-to-seek-release-of-tunisian-opposition-figure-jailed-in-crackdown\">Said Ferjani</a>, who was also imprisoned under Ali, were detained. Many remain in captivity.</p> <p>Khawaja said: \u201cHolding elections amid such repression makes a mockery of Tunisians\u2019 right to participate in free and fair elections.\u201d</p> <p>Saied\u2019s pursuit of an authoritarian agenda has coincided with downturn in Tunisia\u2019s economic fortunes. Unemployment has risen and inflation is in double digits. According to the World Bank, the country\u2019s economic recovery from years of a cost-of-living crisis and a recession in 2023 has slowed.</p> <p>Throughout his tenure, Saied has accused civil society and opposition groups critical of his governance of having nefarious motives and being puppets of foreign countries. That line of thinking was echoed by the lawmakers in September, as some even outside the ruling party accused judges of acting on behalf of unnamed foreign interests.</p> <p>With the coast clear for his re-election, there are fears of more democratic backsliding and populist propaganda efforts in the years to come.</p> <p>Yerkes said: \u201cBy manipulating the 2024 presidential election, Saied has put one more nail in the coffin of Tunisia\u2019s democratic transition and ensured the outcome well before the process began.\u201d</p>",

Last year, he ordered a crackdown on undocumented black migrants that drew criticism from around the world, but the EU nevertheless proceeded with a \u20ac105m deal with Tunisia to stem irregular migration. The deal has helped fund security units that, according to a recent Guardian investigation, have been perpetrating widespread sexual violence against women on migration routes in its territory. In the run-up to the election, the Independent High Authority for Elections (ISIE) whittled down an initial longlist of 17 presidential candidates to three after a raft of controversial disqualifications. Of the remaining trio, the former lawmaker Ayachi Zammel was jailed this week for reportedly falsifying documents. It is unclear if his candidature remains valid despite his detention. Bassam Khawaja, a deputy director for Middle East and north Africa at Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cSince the start of the electoral period on 14 July, authorities have prosecuted, convicted, or detained at least nine prospective candidates.\u201d Late in September, Tunisia\u2019s parliament voted with an overwhelming majority to strip the courts of the power to reverse decisions made by its electoral body. The vote followed a row between the ISIE and a court that overturned the former\u2019s disqualification of three presidential contenders. The latest development has made Saied, who will lead for another five years if victorious on Sunday, near unstoppable. Sarah Yerkes, a senior fellow in the Middle East programme at the Washington-based thinktank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the election would \u201calmost certainly be a low point in the trajectory of what was once the sole democracy in the Arab world\u201d. After the Arab spring protests ousted the longstanding ruler Ben Ali in 2011, Tunisia was hailed as one of the region\u2019s brightest democratic lights, a reputation boosted by back-to-back elections. Saied stood as an independent candidate and establishment outsider in the previous election in 2019, campaigning on a platform of strong government after nearly a decade of deadlock between Islamist and secular blocs since the 2011 revolution. The political outsider won by a landslide, with 73% of the vote in a second round runoff with turnout of 58%. In 2021, he suspended the opposition-controlled parliament and fired the prime minister. The following year, a referendum changed the constitution and gave Saied sweeping powers in a newly introduced unitary system of government. He apportioned to himself the power to appoint magistrates and the seven ISIE members by presidential decree \u2013 and fire them at will. More than a dozen leaders of the leading opposition party, Ennahda, including the former MP Said Ferjani, who was also imprisoned under Ali, were detained. Many remain in captivity. Khawaja said: \u201cHolding elections amid such repression makes a mockery of Tunisians\u2019 right to participate in free and fair elections.\u201d Saied\u2019s pursuit of an authoritarian agenda has coincided with downturn in Tunisia\u2019s economic fortunes. Unemployment has risen and inflation is in double digits. According to the World Bank, the country\u2019s economic recovery from years of a cost-of-living crisis and a recession in 2023 has slowed. Throughout his tenure, Saied has accused civil society and opposition groups critical of his governance of having nefarious motives and being puppets of foreign countries. That line of thinking was echoed by the lawmakers in September, as some even outside the ruling party accused judges of acting on behalf of unnamed foreign interests. With the coast clear for his re-election, there are fears of more democratic backsliding and populist propaganda efforts in the years to come. Yerkes said: \u201cBy manipulating the 2024 presidential election, Saied has put one more nail in the coffin of Tunisia\u2019s democratic transition and ensured the outcome well before the process began.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Biden administration breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday when the union representing port workers called off a strike that threatened mass disruption of goods just weeks before November\u2019s election. But the dispute between the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association (ILA) and the nation\u2019s port operators is not yet over, and could hand whoever wins the White House their first political crisis come January. The agreement to call off industrial action expires on 15 January, and if a new contract is not agreed by then, the ILA could take further action. The impact of which is likely to be felt worldwide. As many Americans learned during the pandemic, the supply chain is somewhat fragile. Imported goods made abroad are packed on to massive shipping containers that travel the seas to reach American shores. Once they arrive at a port, the containers are removed from the ships to be put in warehouses. The goods are then taken by truck or train to get to their destinations. If one part of the chain is interrupted, there can be ripple effects. That\u2019s why the dockworkers\u2019 strike that started on Tuesday was such a big deal. Goods shipped to a port on the east coast or Gulf coast of the US could not move along until the strike was called off. The first of its kind since 1977, the dock strike probably cost the economy at least $5bn a day. The ILA, representing 45,000 workers across 36 ports, is calling for higher wages and forbidding automation and semi-automation at the ports, as a job protection measure. The union and the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX), a consortium of carriers and terminal operations, have reached a tentative deal with a reported 62% increase in wages over six years. Other issues, including automation, remain unresolved. As talks continue, here\u2019s more on what\u2019s at stake for the US economy. This strike ended after three days. What happened? For most Americans, the impacts of the strike were minimal. Companies knew the strike was a possibility for at least a few weeks, said Keely Croxton, professor of logistics at Ohio State University, and have been ramping up shipments and expediting getting containers off ships before the strike. What if a new strike goes on for more than a couple of weeks? The goods coming into the east and Gulf coast ports are largely shipments from Europe and South and Central America. The strike does not affect cruise ships or military cargo. This means that some fresh fruit and vegetables transported in refrigerated containers could be affected first if the strike lasts more than two weeks. Many of the bananas consumed in the US, for example, come from South and Central America.

His career has spanned four decades: first touring with his sister, the Irish country music star Margo, and then as a solo artist. His debut, The&nbsp;Boy from Donegal, was released in&nbsp;1984, and he has since achieved 16&nbsp;Top 10 albums with singles such as What Ever Happened to Old Fashioned Love, Footsteps and Crush on You. Through the Years \u2013 The Very Best of&nbsp;Daniel O\u2019Donnell is out now.</p> <p><strong>Our next</strong><strong>door neighbour</strong>, Annie<strong> </strong>McGarvey, recorded the whole of our family\u2019s childhood on a box camera she bought using cocoa coupons in 1937. She took this photograph outside her thatched house on the day of my first holy communion. I was seven.</p> <p>The suit was something I enjoyed wearing \u2013 it had been passed down to me after both of my brothers had worn it at their communions. My only other memories from that day were that I&nbsp;walked home with Diana Quickhead, a girl whose family came up every summer from Belfast, and was able to buy a block of ice-cream from the post office, as a treat.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Growing up, there was always music around, on the radio or on TV. I don\u2019t remember a time in my life when I wasn\u2019t singing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My first communion wasn\u2019t a big celebration as my father had&nbsp;died the August before, and my mother was still grieving. She went to the church, but there was no big party for&nbsp;me afterwards. I&nbsp;was too young to&nbsp;be affected by my father\u2019s death, whereas&nbsp;my brothers, who were 19 and&nbsp;10, felt greatly impacted. It didn\u2019t last for ever, however: my mother was a&nbsp;very strong woman and after a while she gathered herself. I learned that it\u2019s&nbsp;just the way life is \u2013 everybody manages. You deal the cards out and&nbsp;play them as they are.</p> <p>My childhood was spent in Kincasslagh in Donegal, a lovely part&nbsp;of Ireland. It was right beside the&nbsp;beach, so our summers were spent&nbsp;playing there. Maybe it\u2019s my romantic, rose-tinted glasses, but the&nbsp;days felt endless and the weather was always good. The village had a&nbsp;pub, a post office and two shops, one&nbsp;of which I&nbsp;worked in from the age&nbsp;of nine. There&nbsp;were not a lot of houses in Kincasslagh \u2013 only 40 or 50&nbsp;people lived there \u2013 so our family knew everybody. Was I&nbsp;a&nbsp;well-behaved boy? I&nbsp;was good enough, not much of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bother.</p> <p><strong>Growing up, there was always music</strong> <strong>around</strong>, on the radio or on TV. I&nbsp;don\u2019t remember a time in my life when I&nbsp;wasn\u2019t singing. I started when I&nbsp;was aged two, and by the time I&nbsp;eventually went to college, that ambition was so strong in my mind that I wasn\u2019t able to settle. I knew that I wanted to try to pursue music instead.</p> <p>My sister Margaret was \u2013 and still is \u2013 a professional singer who had a&nbsp;great career. It was Christmas of 1980&nbsp;when I&nbsp;said to her that I\u2019d like to&nbsp;perform with her. That was a brave thing to do, because there was a chance that it might not have worked out. When you\u2019re young you can afford&nbsp;to take chances, and I am glad I&nbsp;did. I&nbsp;travelled with her for two years, from 1981, before starting my own group in 1983. That was the beginning of where we are now.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In\u00a01992, I was on Top of the Pops with the Shamen. We are at two ends of the spectrum, musically speaking, but\u00a0it\u00a0was amazing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the beginning of my solo career, I&nbsp;was playing to small crowds \u2013 10 or 20&nbsp;people at most. At the end of 1985 I&nbsp;thought about giving up because I&nbsp;didn\u2019t think it was going to take off. I&nbsp;said this to Mick Clerkin, who owned&nbsp;the label I had made my debut&nbsp;album with, Ritz Records. He&nbsp;felt that we should hang on, and he&nbsp;was right. By&nbsp;1986, it was like somebody switched on a light. My&nbsp;career turned around and off we&nbsp;went. My shows were sold out on the door \u2013 the venues were full before I&nbsp;walked on stage.</p> <p>Gaining recognition during the 80s&nbsp;and 90, a time when pop was very experimental, there were probably some people who considered my music&nbsp;as something from a bygone era. But I&nbsp;can\u2019t do anything about that \u2013 people like what they like. There\u2019s lots&nbsp;of music that I don\u2019t particularly like, but&nbsp;there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. In&nbsp;1992, I was performing I Just Want to Dance With You on the same episode of Top of the Pops as the Shamen [performing Ebeneezer Goode]. We are at two ends of the spectrum, musically speaking, but&nbsp;it&nbsp;was amazing.</p> <p><strong>In 1992, I became very tired.</strong> I was doing too much and needed a break from performing. There was nothing obviously wrong with my vocal cords \u2013 I had no nodules, I didn\u2019t need surgery \u2013 I just had to rest. For a&nbsp;time I&nbsp;worried that I wouldn\u2019t recover, but I&nbsp;did. Doctors discovered I&nbsp;was very allergic to dust. I did a lot of&nbsp;dances at the time; and when people&nbsp;dance there\u2019s dust rising, whether you see it or not. People smoked as well \u2013 so I&nbsp;realised that the whole environment, those kinds of shows, would not be good for me any more. After that I&nbsp;changed the types of&nbsp;rooms I booked; that experience elevated me to a&nbsp;different type of performer. I played sit-down venues and started to interact with the audience a little more, rather than just&nbsp;singing. I\u2019ve never had any problems since.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/sep/21/broadcaster-nicki-chapman-looks-back\">Broadcaster Nicki Chapman: \u2018David Bowie handed me his cigarette when he came off stage.

      "bodyText": "Born in Donegal in 1961, Daniel O\u2019Donnell is a singer and TV personality known as \u201cWee Daniel\u201d to his legion of dedicated fans. His career has spanned four decades: first touring with his sister, the Irish country music star Margo, and then as a solo artist. His debut, The Boy from Donegal, was released in 1984, and he has since achieved 16 Top 10 albums with singles such as What Ever Happened to Old Fashioned Love, Footsteps and Crush on You. Through the Years \u2013 The Very Best of Daniel O\u2019Donnell is out now. Our nextdoor neighbour, Annie McGarvey, recorded the whole of our family\u2019s childhood on a box camera she bought using cocoa coupons in 1937. She took this photograph outside her thatched house on the day of my first holy communion. I was seven. The suit was something I enjoyed wearing \u2013 it had been passed down to me after both of my brothers had worn it at their communions. My only other memories from that day were that I walked home with Diana Quickhead, a girl whose family came up every summer from Belfast, and was able to buy a block of ice-cream from the post office, as a treat. My first communion wasn\u2019t a big celebration as my father had died the August before, and my mother was still grieving. She went to the church, but there was no big party for me afterwards. I was too young to be affected by my father\u2019s death, whereas my brothers, who were 19 and 10, felt greatly impacted. It didn\u2019t last for ever, however: my mother was a very strong woman and after a while she gathered herself. I learned that it\u2019s just the way life is \u2013 everybody manages. You deal the cards out and play them as they are. My childhood was spent in Kincasslagh in Donegal, a lovely part of Ireland. It was right beside the beach, so our summers were spent playing there. Maybe it\u2019s my romantic, rose-tinted glasses, but the days felt endless and the weather was always good. The village had a pub, a post office and two shops, one of which I worked in from the age of nine. There were not a lot of houses in Kincasslagh \u2013 only 40 or 50 people lived there \u2013 so our family knew everybody. Was I a well-behaved boy? I was good enough, not much of a bother. Growing up, there was always music around, on the radio or on TV. I don\u2019t remember a time in my life when I wasn\u2019t singing. I started when I was aged two, and by the time I eventually went to college, that ambition was so strong in my mind that I wasn\u2019t able to settle. I knew that I wanted to try to pursue music instead. My sister Margaret was \u2013 and still is \u2013 a professional singer who had a great career. It was Christmas of 1980 when I said to her that I\u2019d like to perform with her. That was a brave thing to do, because there was a chance that it might not have worked out. When you\u2019re young you can afford to take chances, and I am glad I did. I travelled with her for two years, from 1981, before starting my own group in 1983. That was the beginning of where we are now. At the beginning of my solo career, I was playing to small crowds \u2013 10 or 20 people at most. At the end of 1985 I thought about giving up because I didn\u2019t think it was going to take off. I said this to Mick Clerkin, who owned the label I had made my debut album with, Ritz Records. He felt that we should hang on, and he was right. By 1986, it was like somebody switched on a light. My career turned around and off we went. My shows were sold out on the door \u2013 the venues were full before I walked on stage. Gaining recognition during the 80s and 90, a time when pop was very experimental, there were probably some people who considered my music as something from a bygone era. But I can\u2019t do anything about that \u2013 people like what they like. There\u2019s lots of music that I don\u2019t particularly like, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. In 1992, I was performing I Just Want to Dance With You on the same episode of Top of the Pops as the Shamen [performing Ebeneezer Goode]. We are at two ends of the spectrum, musically speaking, but it was amazing. In 1992, I became very tired. I was doing too much and needed a break from performing. There was nothing obviously wrong with my vocal cords \u2013 I had no nodules, I didn\u2019t need surgery \u2013 I just had to rest. For a time I worried that I wouldn\u2019t recover, but I did. Doctors discovered I was very allergic to dust. I did a lot of dances at the time; and when people dance there\u2019s dust rising, whether you see it or not. People smoked as well \u2013 so I realised that the whole environment, those kinds of shows, would not be good for me any more. After that I changed the types of rooms I booked; that experience elevated me to a different type of performer. I played sit-down venues and started to interact with the audience a little more, rather than just singing. I\u2019ve never had any problems since. The feeling of standing on stage and receiving applause is something I cannot describe. It\u2019s amazing that people enjoy my music so much and my audience is a huge part of what I do. I used to host tea parties in Donegal, but they are irrelevant now \u2013 there\u2019s no point talking about something nobody can go to. They outgrew their purpose \u2013 which was to meet people at my home \u2013 as too many people were coming. I still get to meet my fans, however. It\u2019s something I have always enjoyed. When I was starting out I would step off the stage after singing and chat to whomever was there. As the audience grew, I just carried on. I still live in Donegal, two and a half miles from where I was brought up. It\u2019s the same place \u2013 filled with the same people I grew up with, and the same atmosphere, too.

      "body": "<p>All Ella Purnell ever wanted to do was write children\u2019s books about magical trees and talking ducks and happy bunny rabbits, and instead here she is chainsawing a man\u2019s head off in a radioactive wasteland. Or freezing to death in the wilderness and being eaten by her closest friends. Or being so traumatised by school bullies that she takes up serial killing, slaughtering victims with her dead dad\u2019s treasured pocketknife.</p> <p>It might not be exactly what Purnell had in mind for her 20s, but spending the past few years committing, and being subject to, acts of stomach-churning violence has certainly had its upsides: the Londoner is now on the brink of TV superstardom. Purnell has been on a steep trajectory since 2021, when she appeared in hit US drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/12/yellowjackets-review-gory-lord-of-flies-series-gets-lost-in-the-wilderness\">Yellowjackets</a> as the prom queen captain of a New Jersey high school football team left stranded in a Canadian forest after a plane crash (think Mean Girls meets Lord of the Flies). In April, she starred in Amazon\u2019s sensationally successful video game adaptation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/apr/11/prime-fallout-review-an-absolute-blast-of-a-tv-show\">Fallout</a> as Lucy MacLean, a vault dweller in a post-nuclear apocalypse United States who surfaces to search for her kidnapped father (the series attracted 65 million viewers in its first 16 days of release, and helped Purnell accumulate 1.4 million Instagram followers). Now, the 28-year-old is returning to the UK for more viscerally disturbing action. In new Sky Atlantic thriller Sweetpea, she plays Rhiannon Lewis, a receptionist whose mounting fury at being walked all over eventually erupts into a murderous spree.</p> <p>Purnell isn\u2019t sure why she\u2019s ended up specialising in such troubling material. \u201cPeople think I must be really messed up, but I swear I\u2019m a happy, well-adjusted human!\u201d Seated on a sofa in the corner of a blindingly white photography studio \u2013 the dramatic purple eye makeup from her shoot still intact \u2013 Purnell certainly seems psychologically sound; relaxed and genial, with a kind of preternatural confidence (even by American standards: a recent New York Magazine profile described her as \u201cstrikingly self-assured\u201d). Yet the actor also joins me in identifying as a total wuss: \u201cI can\u2019t do horror films. I don\u2019t really love watching too much gore, or any supernatural things. I\u2019m not even really a big sci-fi person. And I\u2019m not a gamer. So I don\u2019t know how any of this has happened!\u201d</p>    <p>In truth, there is a logic behind Purnell\u2019s CV \u2013 and it can be traced back to the ambivalence with which she has approached her profession. Purnell \u201cnever really planned on becoming an actor. I feel a lot of guilt and impostor syndrome attached to that statement, because I know a lot of people have wanted to be an actor ever since they were kids. And that just wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p> <p>Confusingly though, Purnell actually was an actor when she was a kid. Growing up in east London, she took singing and dancing lessons at the storied Sylvia Young Theatre School, which led to her performing in Oliver! in the West End when she was 10. She appeared in her first film when she was 14 \u2013 playing Keira Knightley\u2019s character Ruth as a child in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/10/never-let-me-go-review\">Never Let Me Go</a>. But as her career picked up further in her teens, she \u201cfreaked out\u201d about the path that had been laid out for her (not by parents or agents, she clarifies, but a road she had unknowingly carved out herself). At 18, she decided to put the brakes on her acting career. \u201cI wanted to go to university and be a writer \u2013 I&nbsp;wanted to write children\u2019s books.\u201d</p> <p>Purnell won a place at university (she can\u2019t remember exactly where or what she was going to study, but it was related to creative writing), but ended up deferring after landing a part in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/26/miss-peregrines-home-for-peculiar-children-review-mordant-british-ya-x-men-is-tim-burtons-best-in-20-years\">Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children</a> \u2013 working with Tim Burton was her childhood dream and she couldn\u2019t bring herself to turn it down. She thought it would be a one-off, but more irresistible jobs cropped up, such as the lead role in a US TV show. In 2017, Purnell moved to New York to star in Sweetbitter \u2013 a series about a young woman who comes of age working in the city\u2019s buzzy restaurant scene \u2013 and relinquished her university place. \u201cI realised I didn\u2019t need to go to university to be a writer \u2013 I could just write!\u201d</p> <p>Despite her fixation on writing \u2013 she hasn\u2019t written a children\u2019s book yet, but thinks she \u201cprobably will one day\u201d \u2013 Purnell set off back down the acting avenue with renewed purpose. The fact she wasn\u2019t desperate for success gave her the freedom to pursue only the most challenging, difficult and stimulating parts \u2013 an impulse that drew her to stories that deal in emotional and physical extremes.

In her masterful hands, Lucy\u2019s journey from priggish innocent to imperious action hero wasn\u2019t just entirely plausible, it was uplifting, too: seeing such a beautifully rendered bildungsroman unfold across a ravaged planet proved strangely life-affirming.

That\u2019s a slightly disorienting experience.\u201d Still, the actor views it as an overnight success 20 years in the making. \u201cI feel like it became a marathon and not a sprint.

But they\u2019re all like 6ft.\u201d</p> <p>In the wake of this heady career high, Sweetpea might sound like an odd choice. The show, which airs on Sky this month, is unlikely to have quite the same reach as Fallout, which was the most watched show across all streaming platforms in April. It also marks Purnell\u2019s return to the UK, having already established herself in the US big leagues. Technically she still lives in London, but she has worked so much in the States \u2013 and played so many Americans \u2013 that some colleagues have been shocked to learn she\u2019s English.

Purnell gets to be an executive producer for the first time, meaning she was involved in developing the series outline and the scripts, and also \u201cgot a large say in the visual elements. The hair and makeup is my favourite thing.\u201d The actor \u2013 who remained glossily beautiful even in the gruesome Fallout finale \u2013 is practically unrecognisable as the downtrodden Rhiannon. It\u2019s amazing what havoc a wispy fringe can wreak on a person\u2019s appearance, but there were other details, too: \u201cI\u2019ve dyed my hair enough times to know what doesn\u2019t look good, so having a mousy element to the hair that makes me look paler, highlighting the dark circles under my eyes, no makeup, being quite plain-looking.\u201d</p> <p>Reeking of awkwardness, loneliness and low self-worth, Rhiannon spends her life being either ignored or avoided. She\u2019s a wannabe newspaper reporter who is frighteningly delusional about her crimes \u2013 yet her mission to fight back against a world that has mistreated her is surprisingly easy to get on board with. Although the series was designed as a prequel to CJ Skuse\u2019s Sweetpea books, the Rhiannon in those is an out-and-out sociopath who derives huge satisfaction from killing, and is more \u201csnarky and definitely a lot more evil\u201d, says Purnell.</p> <p>This TV version is clearly concerned with making her as sympathetic as possible. Purnell was compelled by the puzzle of creating a female killer viewers could connect with. \u201cWomen are so often pressured to be likable and pretty and perfectly packaged,\u201d says Purnell, meaning it\u2019s \u201ca lot harder to create moral complexity\u201d. She \u201cempathised\u201d with Rhiannon \u201cbut didn\u2019t relate.

We see repeated flashbacks to a school disco, where a bully called Julia snatches the wig Rhiannon wears to disguise the fact she\u2019s pulled out most of her hair due to the stress of being tormented by Julia. When the latter, now an estate agent (played by Nic\u00f4le Lecky, best known for BBC Three drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/01/mood-review-songs-sorrow-and-sex-work-in-nicole-leckys-bold-fresh-drama\">Mood</a>), is tasked with selling Rhiannon\u2019s home, passed down to her and her sister by her late father, you can\u2019t help but feel sorry for Rhiannon \u2013 despite her barbaric reaction. \u201cWhen you go through an intense trauma, you get&nbsp;stuck in this arrested development,\u201d says Purnell.

If you take away the murder, it\u2019s quite a sweet coming-of-age story.\u201d You can\u2019t really take away the murder, though. The&nbsp;brutality and trauma that radiates through Sweetpea did \u201ctake a toll\u201d on Purnell.

      "bodyText": "All Ella Purnell ever wanted to do was write children\u2019s books about magical trees and talking ducks and happy bunny rabbits, and instead here she is chainsawing a man\u2019s head off in a radioactive wasteland. Or freezing to death in the wilderness and being eaten by her closest friends. Or being so traumatised by school bullies that she takes up serial killing, slaughtering victims with her dead dad\u2019s treasured pocketknife. It might not be exactly what Purnell had in mind for her 20s, but spending the past few years committing, and being subject to, acts of stomach-churning violence has certainly had its upsides: the Londoner is now on the brink of TV superstardom. Purnell has been on a steep trajectory since 2021, when she appeared in hit US drama Yellowjackets as the prom queen captain of a New Jersey high school football team left stranded in a Canadian forest after a plane crash (think Mean Girls meets Lord of the Flies). In April, she starred in Amazon\u2019s sensationally successful video game adaptation Fallout as Lucy MacLean, a vault dweller in a post-nuclear apocalypse United States who surfaces to search for her kidnapped father (the series attracted 65 million viewers in its first 16 days of release, and helped Purnell accumulate 1.4 million Instagram followers). Now, the 28-year-old is returning to the UK for more viscerally disturbing action. In new Sky Atlantic thriller Sweetpea, she plays Rhiannon Lewis, a receptionist whose mounting fury at being walked all over eventually erupts into a murderous spree. Purnell isn\u2019t sure why she\u2019s ended up specialising in such troubling material. \u201cPeople think I must be really messed up, but I swear I\u2019m a happy, well-adjusted human!\u201d Seated on a sofa in the corner of a blindingly white photography studio \u2013 the dramatic purple eye makeup from her shoot still intact \u2013 Purnell certainly seems psychologically sound; relaxed and genial, with a kind of preternatural confidence (even by American standards: a recent New York Magazine profile described her as \u201cstrikingly self-assured\u201d). Yet the actor also joins me in identifying as a total wuss: \u201cI can\u2019t do horror films. I don\u2019t really love watching too much gore, or any supernatural things. I\u2019m not even really a big sci-fi person. And I\u2019m not a gamer. So I don\u2019t know how any of this has happened!\u201d In truth, there is a logic behind Purnell\u2019s CV \u2013 and it can be traced back to the ambivalence with which she has approached her profession. Purnell \u201cnever really planned on becoming an actor. I feel a lot of guilt and impostor syndrome attached to that statement, because I know a lot of people have wanted to be an actor ever since they were kids. And that just wasn\u2019t me.\u201d Confusingly though, Purnell actually was an actor when she was a kid. Growing up in east London, she took singing and dancing lessons at the storied Sylvia Young Theatre School, which led to her performing in Oliver! in the West End when she was 10. She appeared in her first film when she was 14 \u2013 playing Keira Knightley\u2019s character Ruth as a child in Never Let Me Go. But as her career picked up further in her teens, she \u201cfreaked out\u201d about the path that had been laid out for her (not by parents or agents, she clarifies, but a road she had unknowingly carved out herself). At 18, she decided to put the brakes on her acting career. \u201cI wanted to go to university and be a writer \u2013 I wanted to write children\u2019s books.\u201d Purnell won a place at university (she can\u2019t remember exactly where or what she was going to study, but it was related to creative writing), but ended up deferring after landing a part in Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children \u2013 working with Tim Burton was her childhood dream and she couldn\u2019t bring herself to turn it down. She thought it would be a one-off, but more irresistible jobs cropped up, such as the lead role in a US TV show. In 2017, Purnell moved to New York to star in Sweetbitter \u2013 a series about a young woman who comes of age working in the city\u2019s buzzy restaurant scene \u2013 and relinquished her university place. \u201cI realised I didn\u2019t need to go to university to be a writer \u2013 I could just write!\u201d Despite her fixation on writing \u2013 she hasn\u2019t written a children\u2019s book yet, but thinks she \u201cprobably will one day\u201d \u2013 Purnell set off back down the acting avenue with renewed purpose. The fact she wasn\u2019t desperate for success gave her the freedom to pursue only the most challenging, difficult and stimulating parts \u2013 an impulse that drew her to stories that deal in emotional and physical extremes. With Yellowjackets, she was enticed by the challenge of taking \u201cthis stereotypical mean girl and breaking her down. I wasn\u2019t sure if I could do it in a way that felt tasteful and not tropey. And it scared me.\u201d Fallout also pushed Purnell well outside her comfort zone. Not only was she taking on some precious source material with a fervent built-in fanbase (the show is based on the beloved video game series), but Lucy herself would have been a challenge for any actor: you just try pretending to be a bouncy, privileged na\u00eff raised in an underground vault modelled on 1950s America whose quest to find your father on the nuclear war-torn surface allies you with a 200-year-old ghoul hell-bent on selling your organs while decimating your entire moral code. Yet Purnell aced the brief. In her masterful hands, Lucy\u2019s journey from priggish innocent to imperious action hero wasn\u2019t just entirely plausible, it was uplifting, too: seeing such a beautifully rendered bildungsroman unfold across a ravaged planet proved strangely life-affirming. The show \u2013 wryly funny, deeply horrifying, breathlessly entertaining and a smash hit by every metric \u2013 transformed her life. \u201cThere\u2019s the day before Fallout comes out and no one knows who you are, to a week after Fallout comes out and suddenly people know your name. That\u2019s a slightly disorienting experience.\u201d Still, the actor views it as an overnight success 20 years in the making. \u201cI feel like it became a marathon and not a sprint. It didn\u2019t feel as shocking to me as when somebody goes viral overnight.\u201d She never worries about the hype going to her head. \u201cI have an incredible support system who would never let me get too arrogant.\u201d It includes \u201cthree younger brothers whose main mission is to humble me any opportunity they get\u201d. Their primary focus is on \u201chow short I am. And for context, I\u2019m not that short. I\u2019m 5ft 4in. But they\u2019re all like 6ft.\u201d In the wake of this heady career high, Sweetpea might sound like an odd choice. The show, which airs on Sky this month, is unlikely to have quite the same reach as Fallout, which was the most watched show across all streaming platforms in April. It also marks Purnell\u2019s return to the UK, having already established herself in the US big leagues.

Purnell gets to be an executive producer for the first time, meaning she was involved in developing the series outline and the scripts, and also \u201cgot a large say in the visual elements. The hair and makeup is my favourite thing.\u201d The actor \u2013 who remained glossily beautiful even in the gruesome Fallout finale \u2013 is practically unrecognisable as the downtrodden Rhiannon. It\u2019s amazing what havoc a wispy fringe can wreak on a person\u2019s appearance, but there were other details, too: \u201cI\u2019ve dyed my hair enough times to know what doesn\u2019t look good, so having a mousy element to the hair that makes me look paler, highlighting the dark circles under my eyes, no makeup, being quite plain-looking.\u201d Reeking of awkwardness, loneliness and low self-worth, Rhiannon spends her life being either ignored or avoided.

      "bodyText": "The Knox county commission was questioning a property developer one evening in April three years ago when protesters quietly filed in to their auditorium and raised their fists in the air. A week earlier, police had shot and killed 17-year-old Anthony Thompson Jr in a bathroom at his high school after they found him with a gun. Protests erupted in Knoxville, the county seat and largest city in eastern Tennessee, and one the loudest voices speaking out was Constance Every, who had organized demonstrations in the city during the national outrage that followed George Floyd\u2019s death less than a year earlier. Now, she was in the county commission chamber with about two dozen others, intending to press them for the release of police body-camera footage that captured Thompson\u2019s death. As the protesters lined up near the meeting room\u2019s back wall, Every, who was wearing a Black Lives Matter shirt, retrieved from her backpack a white T-shirt Thompson\u2019s aunt gave her, which read: \u201cWho do you call when the murderer wears a badge?\u201d Then, she pulled out an electronic bullhorn, and sounded the siren. \u201cKnox county, county commission, your meeting is over,\u201d Every said through the bullhorn, as the protesters clustered around her. \u201c\u2019Cause what we\u2019re not going to tolerate is that we got a kid who was murdered at Knox county schools, and y\u2019all going to carry on like these children don\u2019t deserve to have their rights and other factors. It is not OK, what you all are doing, whatsoever.\u201d Within seconds of the siren going off, sheriff\u2019s deputies, both in uniform and in plainclothes, converged on Every, grabbing her and some of her group, and marching them outside. While many kept silent as they left, Every did not. \u201cI have not broke any laws! I am exercising my right to peacefully assemble and use my freedom of speech, you fucking murderers!\u201d she shouted. The disruption lasted just over 70 seconds. But for Every and the six others arrested in the commission chambers, it marked the beginning of a three-year legal saga, after the county prosecutor charged them with disrupting a lawful meeting \u2013 a misdemeanor for which Tennessee\u2019s Republican leaders had just months earlier doubled the punishment. Since Floyd\u2019s death in May 2020, Republican-led states have enacted laws expanding the definition of rioting to encompass protesters who stayed peaceful when others did not, protecting drivers who run over demonstrators that block roads and enhancing penalties against protesters who target oil and gas infrastructure and deface monuments. The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL), which tracks the legislation, has found that hundreds of proposals have been made by state and federal lawmakers nationwide, and more than two dozen signed into law. The push comes as the GOP\u2019s standard bearer, Donald Trump, campaigns for the presidency on a platform that includes suppressing protests. He has vowed to deploy the national guard \u201cwhere there has been a complete breakdown of law and order\u201d, while simultaneously promising pardons for people convicted over the January 6 insurrection. As president, Trump reportedly encouraged the military to shoot protesters, and, this year, allies such as the speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, have said the national guard should be used against college students demonstrating over Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza. If he returned to the White House, Trump could direct a militarized response to protests and pressure congressional Republicans to pass legislation that would impose nationwide penalties like those already in effect in Tennessee. Tennessee is a thoroughly red state where the GOP holds a supermajority in its general assembly. Last year lawmakers temporarily expelled two Black Democratic representatives who staged a noisy protest calling for gun control legislation in the state house chamber. In August 2020, Republicans passed a bill that increased penalties for blocking a street or sidewalk and created a new felony offense for protest encampments on state property, in addition to making disrupting a meeting a more severe category of misdemeanor.

To Amelia Parker, a Black Lives Matter activist who now serves on the Knoxville city council, it is not surprising that Every wound up being perhaps the first person to run afoul of such laws. \u201cShe\u2019s one that authorities would want to make an example out of. They definitely would not want another Constance,\u201d Parker said. An African American army veteran who is disabled with post-traumatic stress disorder from two tours in Afghanistan, Every became politically active after struggling to find services during a period of homelessness in Knoxville, the home town she returned to after leaving the military. \u201cI\u2019m not a sugar-coater, I\u2019m not a person that\u2019s going to come in and say, \u2018with all due respect\u2019. I\u2019m not that,\u201d Every said in an interview from her apartment, where a framed photograph of her speaking to protesters in a police station parking lot in the days after Floyd\u2019s death hangs over the couch. \u201cI\u2019m going to come in and tell you straight to your face the failures, the problems, and more importantly, you holding this role as a political, elected body or member, that you should hold a lot of accountability for what\u2019s happening.\u201d Her leadership of the 2020 protests, which in Knoxville were generally peaceful, put her on the radar of local authorities, she believes.

But he believes the new law serves as a \u201cshot across the bow of everybody, that they weren\u2019t going to let you protest in this way. \u201cI think that the state saying, \u2018hey, we care about these protest laws, let\u2019s charge people.\u2019 I don\u2019t think that was lost on the county here.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Scandi-style cabin in the North York Moors</strong></h2> <p>There are days when a walk in the woods is the best option. This includes days when the cloud ceiling is barely above chest height and there is a rowdy wind driving the rain in your face. I am striding fast up Sandpit Lane near the hamlet of Thimbleby on the west side of the North York Moors. Charms of goldfinches, oblivious to the weather, are bouncing along the hedgerow. The land rises up and I reach the trees.</p> <p>The effect is immediate: the wind disappears, silence falls and there are dry patches of pine needles under the Scots pines. When I turn and look back, there is a female deer tip-toeing along 50 metres behind me. I\u2019m not the only one who wants shelter. I reach for my camera but she is gone, silently bounding uphill and vanishing into the russet gloom under the pines.</p> <p>I start at <strong>Lark</strong>, a secluded Scandinavian-style cabin with twin brass bathtubs on the terrace and a log burner inside. The cosy interior is pine-panelled with minimal fuss and plenty of ingenious design features. Local milk, butter, eggs, biscuits and bread are provided. Outside, there\u2019s a&nbsp;broad terrace with barbecue, plus a&nbsp;woodland pond and campfire spot. Thimbleby itself is no more than a clutch of honey-coloured stone houses with red roofs.</p>    <p>The first half mile of this walk is on road going south, but traffic is scarcely a problem. I see a quad bike carrying a hooded figure and a muddy dog. Back in the woods, there are moments of route-finding indecision. This is an old plantation, and patches of clear felling have blocked the paths in some spots, forcing detours. But I&nbsp;stick with it and there is much to enjoy: a patch of mushrooms \u2026 chanterelles? Closer inspection is inconclusive, and that\u2019s a word that you don\u2019t want to hear before you cook up your fungi. I leave them alone.</p> <p>The path emerges at a thicket where pheasants are being reared, then dives&nbsp;back through the woods, crosses a footbridge and merges with the Cleveland Way, finally reaching the attractive village of Osmotherley on the edge of the national park \u2013 all stone cottages, narrow ginnels and grassy banks. It grew with the linen industry and retains a prosperous look.</p> <p>Soaking-wet walkers, a common sight, are well catered for with several pubs, a fish and chip shop and an excellent cafe, the Coffee Shop, which has great homemade cakes and comfortable chairs. It\u2019s a mile back home through parkland dotted with trees and rare-breed sheep.<br><em>Lark sleeps two adults and two children from \u00a32</em><em>05 a night, <a href=\"http://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/lark\">www.canopyandstars.co.uk/lark</a></em><br><strong>Kevin Rushby</strong></p> <h2><strong>Glamping and cycling in the National Forest</strong></h2>    <p>I always feel that <a href=\"about:blank\">the National Forest</a> is Britain\u2019s biggest secret. When I&nbsp;mention it to friends, few have any idea where or what it is. I discovered it while researching a book about slow family travel, and was soon entranced by what is one of Britain\u2019s biggest rewilding success stories.</p> <p>This partially human-made, purposefully planted forest, which straddles parts of Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Staffordshire, has transformed 200 square miles of coalmines, clay pits and heavy industry into swathes of green \u2013 a mosaic of trees, wetlands and grasslands. Since its inception in 1991, 9.5m trees have been planted and forest cover has increased from 6% to 25% (the aim is to reach 33%, linking the ancient forests of Needwood in Staffordshire and Charnwood in Leicestershire).</p> <p>I have spent many days exploring the forest with my kids on well-marked trails. Autumn \u2013 and October half-term in particular \u2013 is a good time to visit, as the trees turn to fiery hues and you can walk for hours and hardly see anyone else. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Autumn is a good time to visit as the trees  turn to fiery hues and you can walk for hours and hardly see anyone else</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of my favourite places to stay is <strong><a href=\"https://www.dandyglamping.co.uk/\">Dandelion Hideaway</a></strong>, a few miles from Market Bosworth on the edge of the forest and 13 miles east of Leicester, which offers vintage-inspired glamping. My kids love disappearing into the spinney behind the tents to find the nature hide, and building dens (during school holidays there are&nbsp;forest school days, too). <strong><a href=\"https://hastingsretreat.co.uk/\">Hastings Retreat</a></strong> in the heart of the forest is another good option for colder weather, with self-catering barns.</p> <p>The 75-mile <a href=\"about:blank\">National Forest Way</a> links all the major attractions, and I&nbsp;often bike the trails around <a href=\"about:blank\">Hicks Lodge: the National Forest Cycling Centre</a>. <a href=\"https://www.visitconkers.com/\">Conkers</a> is a much-loved family attraction with rope courses, archery and canoeing. <a href=\"https://greenwooddays.co.uk/\">Greenwood Days</a> runs woodland workshops (my slightly wonky rolling pin felt like a great achievement).</p> <p>I love hunting out the six <a href=\"https://www.nationalforest.org/explore/noon-columns\">Noon Columns</a>, oak sculptures designed by David Nash dotted around the forest, with slots carved to let the midday sun shine through. Visitors can also help to plant trees and become part of this epic rewilding project (next session <a href=\"https://www.nationalforest.org/explore/events/plant-a-tree\">26 Oct)</a>. <br><em>Canvas cottages sleep six at <a href=\"https://www.dandyglamping.co.uk/\">Dandelion Hideaway</a> from </em><em>\u00a3525 for a weekend in October. </em><em>The Bull Pen at <a href=\"https://hastingsretreat.co.uk/\">Hastings Retreat</a> sleeps four </em><em>from \u00a380 a&nbsp;night.</em><br><strong>Jane Anderson</strong></p> <h2><strong>Farmhouse and forest trails</strong><strong> in the</strong><strong> Scot</strong><strong>tish Highlands</strong></h2>    <p>From the village of Nethy Bridge in the&nbsp;Cairngorms national park, a rough track traces the edge of the Abernethy Forest to the <strong>Dell of Abernethy</strong>. A string of lanterns and a glimpse of a&nbsp;tipi through the trees shows we\u2019re in&nbsp;the right place. This old rambling farmhouse was originally built for a local forester, and the beech, lime and oak trees he planted still stand. Owners Polly and Ross Cameron are the third generation of their family to live here, and gradually they have transformed the farmhouse into six beautifully tranquil places to stay \u2013 ideal for exploring the woods. We\u2019re in Dell Cottage, and it\u2019s perfect for two, with vintage furniture, contemporary art, a living room with a fireplace and a claw-foot bath in the bathroom.</p> <p>We\u2019ve timed our visit to catch one of the sporadic pop-up supper clubs, and spend the evening in a woodland tipi festooned with lights: it\u2019s a magical experience. The Dell hosts intimate acoustic gigs and suppers throughout the year, and on Fridays the tipi becomes the Gather Inn, a forest pub with live music and a pizza van (until 1 Nov). Self-catering is made easy with the little Dell Grocer on site, and former chef Polly keeps the freezer stocked with homemade meals. Well-marked forest trails start right from the garden gate. In autumn, before the snow, the trees are at their most beautiful, as the fiery hues of the birch, oak and hazel contrast with the deep green of the old pines. From here you can walk the Ryvoan Pass to the green waters of An Lochan Uaine and its remote bothy, or follow shorter loops through the forest. </p>    <p>I follow a long, winding path carpeted in pine needles into Abernethy Forest, one of the largest remnants of the ancient Caledonian pinewood, looking for red squirrels and the last of the bilberries.

      "bodyText": "Scandi-style cabin in the North York Moors There are days when a walk in the woods is the best option. This includes days when the cloud ceiling is barely above chest height and there is a rowdy wind driving the rain in your face. I am striding fast up Sandpit Lane near the hamlet of Thimbleby on the west side of the North York Moors. Charms of goldfinches, oblivious to the weather, are bouncing along the hedgerow. The land rises up and I reach the trees. The effect is immediate: the wind disappears, silence falls and there are dry patches of pine needles under the Scots pines. When I turn and look back, there is a female deer tip-toeing along 50 metres behind me. I\u2019m not the only one who wants shelter. I reach for my camera but she is gone, silently bounding uphill and vanishing into the russet gloom under the pines. I start at Lark, a secluded Scandinavian-style cabin with twin brass bathtubs on the terrace and a log burner inside. The cosy interior is pine-panelled with minimal fuss and plenty of ingenious design features. Local milk, butter, eggs, biscuits and bread are provided. Outside, there\u2019s a broad terrace with barbecue, plus a woodland pond and campfire spot. Thimbleby itself is no more than a clutch of honey-coloured stone houses with red roofs. The first half mile of this walk is on road going south, but traffic is scarcely a problem. I see a quad bike carrying a hooded figure and a muddy dog. Back in the woods, there are moments of route-finding indecision. This is an old plantation, and patches of clear felling have blocked the paths in some spots, forcing detours. But I stick with it and there is much to enjoy: a patch of mushrooms \u2026 chanterelles? Closer inspection is inconclusive, and that\u2019s a word that you don\u2019t want to hear before you cook up your fungi. I leave them alone. The path emerges at a thicket where pheasants are being reared, then dives back through the woods, crosses a footbridge and merges with the Cleveland Way, finally reaching the attractive village of Osmotherley on the edge of the national park \u2013 all stone cottages, narrow ginnels and grassy banks. It grew with the linen industry and retains a prosperous look. Soaking-wet walkers, a common sight, are well catered for with several pubs, a fish and chip shop and an excellent cafe, the Coffee Shop, which has great homemade cakes and comfortable chairs. It\u2019s a mile back home through parkland dotted with trees and rare-breed sheep. Lark sleeps two adults and two children from \u00a3205 a night, www.canopyandstars.co.uk/lark Kevin Rushby Glamping and cycling in the National Forest I always feel that the National Forest is Britain\u2019s biggest secret. When I mention it to friends, few have any idea where or what it is. I discovered it while researching a book about slow family travel, and was soon entranced by what is one of Britain\u2019s biggest rewilding success stories. This partially human-made, purposefully planted forest, which straddles parts of Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Staffordshire, has transformed 200 square miles of coalmines, clay pits and heavy industry into swathes of green \u2013 a mosaic of trees, wetlands and grasslands. Since its inception in 1991, 9.5m trees have been planted and forest cover has increased from 6% to 25% (the aim is to reach 33%, linking the ancient forests of Needwood in Staffordshire and Charnwood in Leicestershire). I have spent many days exploring the forest with my kids on well-marked trails. Autumn \u2013 and October half-term in particular \u2013 is a good time to visit, as the trees turn to fiery hues and you can walk for hours and hardly see anyone else. One of my favourite places to stay is Dandelion Hideaway, a few miles from Market Bosworth on the edge of the forest and 13 miles east of Leicester, which offers vintage-inspired glamping. My kids love disappearing into the spinney behind the tents to find the nature hide, and building dens (during school holidays there are forest school days, too). Hastings Retreat in the heart of the forest is another good option for colder weather, with self-catering barns. The 75-mile National Forest Way links all the major attractions, and I often bike the trails around Hicks Lodge: the National Forest Cycling Centre. Conkers is a much-loved family attraction with rope courses, archery and canoeing. Greenwood Days runs woodland workshops (my slightly wonky rolling pin felt like a great achievement). I love hunting out the six Noon Columns, oak sculptures designed by David Nash dotted around the forest, with slots carved to let the midday sun shine through. Visitors can also help to plant trees and become part of this epic rewilding project (next session 26 Oct). Canvas cottages sleep six at Dandelion Hideaway from \u00a3525 for a weekend in October. The Bull Pen at Hastings Retreat sleeps four from \u00a380 a night. Jane Anderson Farmhouse and forest trails in the Scottish Highlands From the village of Nethy Bridge in the Cairngorms national park, a rough track traces the edge of the Abernethy Forest to the Dell of Abernethy. A string of lanterns and a glimpse of a tipi through the trees shows we\u2019re in the right place. This old rambling farmhouse was originally built for a local forester, and the beech, lime and oak trees he planted still stand. Owners Polly and Ross Cameron are the third generation of their family to live here, and gradually they have transformed the farmhouse into six beautifully tranquil places to stay \u2013 ideal for exploring the woods. We\u2019re in Dell Cottage, and it\u2019s perfect for two, with vintage furniture, contemporary art, a living room with a fireplace and a claw-foot bath in the bathroom. We\u2019ve timed our visit to catch one of the sporadic pop-up supper clubs, and spend the evening in a woodland tipi festooned with lights: it\u2019s a magical experience. The Dell hosts intimate acoustic gigs and suppers throughout the year, and on Fridays the tipi becomes the Gather Inn, a forest pub with live music and a pizza van (until 1 Nov). Self-catering is made easy with the little Dell Grocer on site, and former chef Polly keeps the freezer stocked with homemade meals. Well-marked forest trails start right from the garden gate. In autumn, before the snow, the trees are at their most beautiful, as the fiery hues of the birch, oak and hazel contrast with the deep green of the old pines. From here you can walk the Ryvoan Pass to the green waters of An Lochan Uaine and its remote bothy, or follow shorter loops through the forest. I follow a long, winding path carpeted in pine needles into Abernethy Forest, one of the largest remnants of the ancient Caledonian pinewood, looking for red squirrels and the last of the bilberries. I take it slow, listening on my headphones to the Dell\u2019s meditative soundscape, and stop now and then to listen to the birds, too. In November, the Dell hosts a \u201cwintering\u201d retreat, with four days of yoga, meditation, open fires and mountain views.

      "bodyText": "Julian Dunkerton is striding around Superdry\u2019s barn-like showroom, yanking garments off rails, stroking fabrics and talking up the brand he believes he can bring back from the brink. Aged 59, Dunkerton could be forgiven for retreating to focus on the rest of his empire, which extends from the family cider business to property and hospitality assets including the No 131 boutique hotel and bar in Cheltenham. Instead, he sees at least another decade ahead at the brand he founded in the 1980s, having ploughed \u00a310m of his own money into taking it off the stock market in July. While he was comfortably able to fund the deal without wiping out cash reserves or remortgaging the Cotswold mansion he shares with fashion designer wife Jade Holland Cooper (thanks to their \u00a3100m-plus fortune), he faces a high-stakes journey to revive Superdry, which has been dismissed by many as an uncool \u201cdad\u2019 brand. Dunkerton admits Superdry, which was born out of his first business selling T-shirts from his car and a market stall called Cult Clothing in Cheltenham, is his passion. He now owns 75% of its equity, with former stock market investors controlling the rest, and specialist lenders Hilco and Bantry Bay looming in the background with large (and expensive) loans helping to fund a three-year revival plan. The challenge of turning around the business, which employs 3,000 staff globally, is immense. At the height of its powers, in early 2018, the company was worth \u00a31.7bn, but after years of slumping sales, its stock market value had dived to less than \u00a33m on delisting. Sales were almost \u00a3500m in the year to the end of April via 89 UK stores and 93 more directly operated stores overseas, as well as more than 300 franchise and licensed outlets, but that was down more than 15% on a year before. Pre-tax losses may have almost halved \u2013 but remained hefty at \u00a365m. The delisting comes after more than five years of disruption. Dunkerton left Superdry in 2018 and then returned in a boardroom coup when turnaround efforts by one-time chief executive Euan Sutherland led to a slump in sales and profits. \u201cThe good news is that I\u2019m coming back,\u201d says Dunkerton, dressed head to toe in Superdry garb: a woollen jacket, skinny jeans and trainers. That comes after a \u201ctough summer\u201d for the whole fashion industry and two years of restructuring at Superdry, involving more than 100 job cuts at head office and dozens of store closures across Europe and the UK, helping reduce costs by \u00a350m. The latest figures show a double-digit rise in sales in recent weeks as cooler weather has prompted purchases of jackets and coats. Dunkerton says the brand is on track to break even next year and return to profit in 2026. That comes after clearing a \u00a319m backlog of stock he says was built up under the previous management so he can now react more quickly to trends with two \u201cmuses\u201d in mind \u2013 dads and their teenage kids. He says the brand had been \u201cchasing too many rainbows\u201d and now has a \u201cvery clear focus of who we are and what we are\u201d. \u201cPreppy classics are absolutely back with my age group and the teenage age group.\u201d. Quitting the stock market has freed him up to spend time overseeing every aspect of the business, planning ranges, checking out factories and eyeing new licensing deals. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge benefit. I\u2019ve just spent eight days going through every single one of these products,\u201d Dunkerton says, rifling through clothes in the Cheltenham showroom. While they are still very much present, there are fewer items with the big logos and the Japanese-influenced graphics that made Superdry big in the 1990s and 2000s. Instead, there is new, subtler SD branding for those more interested in quality clothing \u2013 at a premium high street price. There are plans for more franchise stores overseas, and possibly more UK outlets as well as further brand licences after signing a kidswear deal with Next. Dunkerton not only believes he has the right formula to turn the tide at Superdry, but has plenty of advice for the Labour government on how to revive the UK high street, too. The Chinese fashion website Shein and other online behemoths such as Amazon should be paying far more tax in the UK, he says, while tourist shoppers should be tempted back from Paris with the revival of VAT tax breaks. He contends that Brexit was an \u201ceconomic disaster\u201d which led to millions of pounds worth of additional costs for Superdry \u2013 and other similar businesses. \u201cThere is a huge amount of money just sat there waiting to be taken,\u201d he says. The government needs to consider how the fast-growing online players such as Shein can pay \u201cthe right amount in a fair way or there will be British bankruptcies and the tax take will be lower\u201d. \u201cShould it be the winter fuel allowance or a tax take [from companies such as Shein]?\u201d he asks. Shein, and some other online specialists, now exploit a loophole that excludes low-value items from import duty and VAT because they send individual items direct to shoppers from overseas. As a result, Dunkerton says Shein, which is hoping to list on the London Stock Exchange, is \u201cnot working on a level playing field\u201d. According to Dunkerton, Shein should be paying import duty and VAT on the low-value goods it imports, as well as an environmental tax linked to the scale of home deliveries and its fast-fashion products. \u201cIf you look at landfill it is not full of my products but products made in a particularly cheap way that last one or two wears. People have my products for 25 years and they are still going strong and you\u2019ll be passing it on to your children.\u201d Shein did not comment but has previously said: \u201cWe keep prices affordable through our on-demand business model and flexible supply chain. This reduces inefficiency, takes out wastage of material, and lowers our unsold inventory. \u201cWe pass this advantage to our customers, and this has driven our success around the world, not the exemptions that retailers receive under current tax regimes.\u201d Dunkerton claims Superdry is \u201csecond only to [ethical outdoor wear brand] Patagonia\u201d in terms of sustainability efforts.

      "body": "<p>Adi (Ziad Abaza, also the film\u2019s co-scriptwriter) is the kind of loud-mouthed wide boy you\u2019d change seats to get away from in a restaurant. Although married to longsuffering Amira (Priya Blackburn) and the father to adorable little girl Mia (Layla Hady), Adi has been seduced away from his family by the siren-song of the vlogging life and spends all his time making videos for his precious channel. His speciality is supposedly feats of strength and endurance in the vein of recently disgraced Mr Beast, although maybe he cheats when the camera is off.</p> <p>One day, in a shisha bar with his best mate/main enabler Maz (Mim Shaikh), Adi meets a fan, Lee (Harry Reid, not to be confused with the former Democratic American senator) who suggests a new challenge. Meet Lee and the circle of Sufi Muslim mystics he hangs with and they\u2019ll arrange for Adi and Maz to be buried six-feet under in a field, with only an airpipe and a little water each day to survive. Per the title, this experience will simulate the experience of death and help to precipitate a profound spiritual awakening. After some hesitation, Adi decides to do it for the lols and the chance of winning new subscribers, little grasping what he\u2019s let himself in for. Accompanied only by a little monkey figurine named Oge that Mia insists he take with him, Adi duly starts to unravel underground, experiencing delusions as he fantasies that Oge is talking to him.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gwh9AUVGw0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8gwh9AUVGw0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>This sort of claustrophobic, almost one-man show depends a lot, obviously, on how engaging and range-capable the lead performer is. Abaza, thankfully, is very good, appropriately annoying and bombastic in the early scenes, and then affecting when his fragile ego starts to dissolve in the dirt. Be advised that big stretches of it are very dark so it may as well have been a radio play.</p> <p>\u2022 Die Before You Die is in UK cinemas from 4 October.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Adi (Ziad Abaza, also the film\u2019s co-scriptwriter) is the kind of loud-mouthed wide boy you\u2019d change seats to get away from in a restaurant. Although married to longsuffering Amira (Priya Blackburn) and the father to adorable little girl Mia (Layla Hady), Adi has been seduced away from his family by the siren-song of the vlogging life and spends all his time making videos for his precious channel. His speciality is supposedly feats of strength and endurance in the vein of recently disgraced Mr Beast, although maybe he cheats when the camera is off. One day, in a shisha bar with his best mate/main enabler Maz (Mim Shaikh), Adi meets a fan, Lee (Harry Reid, not to be confused with the former Democratic American senator) who suggests a new challenge. Meet Lee and the circle of Sufi Muslim mystics he hangs with and they\u2019ll arrange for Adi and Maz to be buried six-feet under in a field, with only an airpipe and a little water each day to survive. Per the title, this experience will simulate the experience of death and help to precipitate a profound spiritual awakening. After some hesitation, Adi decides to do it for the lols and the chance of winning new subscribers, little grasping what he\u2019s let himself in for. Accompanied only by a little monkey figurine named Oge that Mia insists he take with him, Adi duly starts to unravel underground, experiencing delusions as he fantasies that Oge is talking to him. This sort of claustrophobic, almost one-man show depends a lot, obviously, on how engaging and range-capable the lead performer is. Abaza, thankfully, is very good, appropriately annoying and bombastic in the early scenes, and then affecting when his fragile ego starts to dissolve in the dirt. Be advised that big stretches of it are very dark so it may as well have been a radio play. \u2022 Die Before You Die is in UK cinemas from 4 October.",

      "body": "<p>A few days ago, the Guardian published a reader callout asking how much it costs to be single in the UK. We wanted to know how much single people pay for various things \u2013 from housing costs and bills to holidays and entertainment \u2013 and if they feel they are being penalised or are losing out financially when compared with couples or families.</p> <p>It clearly touched a nerve: scores of readers got in touch, with many saying this was an issue they felt really strongly about.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what three readers of different ages told us.</p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s just not affordable to live alone\u2019</h2> <p>When Calvin Kern moved to England from Germany at 14, he always imagined he would be able to afford to live on his own in his 20s. But since moving out of home, he has instead found himself in \u201ccrazy expensive house shares\u201d. Rent is one of the many parts of Kern\u2019s life that he feels he pays extra for because he is single.</p> <p>\u201cThe rent in a house share these days is nuts compared with how it was a couple of years ago.</p> <p>\u201cI live in a house share with four others, and at the moment I\u2019m paying \u00a3869 [a month], and then they are going to put this up to \u00a3950 in the next month for, literally, a room that\u2019s not even in the city centre,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just not affordable to live alone.\u201d</p> <p>Over the last few years he has found himself living further and further away from central London but paying the same rent \u2013 or more \u2013 for a room. \u201cWhen I lived in Vauxhall, my landlords increased my rent by \u00a3300 in one year, which is crazy, right?\u201d</p>    <p>Kern is keenly aware that for couples, their outgoings are not the same, and the costs that people in relationships can share stack up. \u201cAs a couple, you can share even small things like the Netflix subscription or Amazon Prime, which I pay for on my own.</p> <p>\u201cYou can save a lot of money on food shopping, too. Obviously, if you\u2019re able to share food \u2013 buy food together in bulk and cook together \u2013 then that will save a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>At 23, his dad bought his first property by himself. For Kern, that is far from his reality. \u201cI\u2019m 22 now, and I\u2019ve got a better job than my dad had when he was my age, yet he was still able to buy a house.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really tough and you start to think: \u2018Oh, is it my fault? Should I be earning more?\u2019 \u2013 that sort of thing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not resentful of couples. If you\u2019re in a relationship, live together, I think that\u2019s a great thing. It just is a lot cheaper for them.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Mabel Banfield-Nwachi</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/sep/18/how-to-cut-the-cost-of-travelling-on-your-own\">How to cut the cost of travelling on your own</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018I pay the same for a hotel room as a couple\u2019</h2> <p>Cath, 40, who lives in south Wales, estimates that her \u201ccomfortable but very far from lavish life\u201d costs her, as a single person, \u201cupwards of \u00a310,000 a year more than if I had a partner\u201d.</p> <p>She adds: \u201cThe single supplement applies to everything, not just hotel rooms \u2026 The costs of the very basics of living are sky-high for a single person.\u201d</p> <p>Cath sold her house to escape noisy neighbours but her next purchase fell through at the last minute because of a terrible survey, so she now rents, paying \u00a31,100 a month in rent and \u00a3170 a month in council tax, \u201cand that is before utility bills, TV licence, etc\u201d.</p>    <p>She adds: \u201cIf I rented my home and split all bills 50/50 with a partner (removing the 25% council tax discount), I\u2019d probably save about \u00a3750 a month. That is a huge amount of money that I could save, invest, put in a pension or simply use to enjoy life that bit more. And I run a car, so every year I pay for road tax, breakdown cover, MOT, service, repairs, insurance by myself. That\u2019s another several hundred pounds a year more.</p> <p>\u201cLook at railcards: there\u2019s a discount for pretty much everyone except working adults who live alone. If I go on a trip, I pay the same for a hotel room as a couple would. Couples get a discount if they join the same gym. It\u2019s ridiculous \u2013 society gives discounts for nice things to those who already have someone to share the cost of the essentials with.\u201d<br><br>Cath says: \u201cPoliticians always talk about \u2018hard-working families\u2019\u2026 But we\u2019ve got an ever-increasing number of people living alone. It just seems like it\u2019s something that society should be talking about more; most people these days must know someone who lives alone.\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cWho\u2019s going to provide a miracle solution to this? The answer is no one \u2026 Ultimately, I don\u2019t torment myself by spending much time thinking about how much easier life would be financially if I had a good relationship and someone to share the ever-spiralling costs of living with. I have a few friends who are in far worse financial situations than me, so I have to think myself lucky.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Rupert Jones</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/21/being-single-has-a-lot-going-for-it-but-10k-a-year-seems-too-high-a-price-for-the-privilege\">Being single has a lot going for it, but \u00a310k a year seems too high a price for the privilege | Emma John</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018With water, I\u2019m paying way above what I use\u2019</h2> <p>Erica Wolfe-Murray has been single for 17 years after being married for 22 years, \u201cso I\u2019m well aware of all the hidden things you pay more for\u201d.</p> <p>The businesswoman, who lives near Oxford, says that what some have called the \u201csingles tax\u201d is something she feels very strongly about.</p> <p>She says that one figure she saw put the cost of being single at about 30% more than being in a couple.</p> <p>Wolfe-Murray says that when she reads magazine and weekend newspaper articles, \u201cthere\u2019s rarely anything about single people \u2013 it\u2019s all about couples.

Rent is one of the many parts of Kern\u2019s life that he feels he pays extra for because he is single. \u201cThe rent in a house share these days is nuts compared with how it was a couple of years ago. \u201cI live in a house share with four others, and at the moment I\u2019m paying \u00a3869 [a month], and then they are going to put this up to \u00a3950 in the next month for, literally, a room that\u2019s not even in the city centre,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just not affordable to live alone.\u201d Over the last few years he has found himself living further and further away from central London but paying the same rent \u2013 or more \u2013 for a room. \u201cWhen I lived in Vauxhall, my landlords increased my rent by \u00a3300 in one year, which is crazy, right?\u201d Kern is keenly aware that for couples, their outgoings are not the same, and the costs that people in relationships can share stack up. \u201cAs a couple, you can share even small things like the Netflix subscription or Amazon Prime, which I pay for on my own. \u201cYou can save a lot of money on food shopping, too. Obviously, if you\u2019re able to share food \u2013 buy food together in bulk and cook together \u2013 then that will save a lot of money.\u201d At 23, his dad bought his first property by himself. For Kern, that is far from his reality. \u201cI\u2019m 22 now, and I\u2019ve got a better job than my dad had when he was my age, yet he was still able to buy a house. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough and you start to think: \u2018Oh, is it my fault? Should I be earning more?\u2019 \u2013 that sort of thing. \u201cI\u2019m not resentful of couples. If you\u2019re in a relationship, live together, I think that\u2019s a great thing. It just is a lot cheaper for them.\u201d Mabel Banfield-Nwachi \u2018I pay the same for a hotel room as a couple\u2019 Cath, 40, who lives in south Wales, estimates that her \u201ccomfortable but very far from lavish life\u201d costs her, as a single person, \u201cupwards of \u00a310,000 a year more than if I had a partner\u201d. She adds: \u201cThe single supplement applies to everything, not just hotel rooms \u2026 The costs of the very basics of living are sky-high for a single person.\u201d Cath sold her house to escape noisy neighbours but her next purchase fell through at the last minute because of a terrible survey, so she now rents, paying \u00a31,100 a month in rent and \u00a3170 a month in council tax, \u201cand that is before utility bills, TV licence, etc\u201d. She adds: \u201cIf I rented my home and split all bills 50/50 with a partner (removing the 25% council tax discount), I\u2019d probably save about \u00a3750 a month. That is a huge amount of money that I could save, invest, put in a pension or simply use to enjoy life that bit more. And I run a car, so every year I pay for road tax, breakdown cover, MOT, service, repairs, insurance by myself. That\u2019s another several hundred pounds a year more. \u201cLook at railcards: there\u2019s a discount for pretty much everyone except working adults who live alone. If I go on a trip, I pay the same for a hotel room as a couple would. Couples get a discount if they join the same gym. It\u2019s ridiculous \u2013 society gives discounts for nice things to those who already have someone to share the cost of the essentials with.\u201d Cath says: \u201cPoliticians always talk about \u2018hard-working families\u2019\u2026 But we\u2019ve got an ever-increasing number of people living alone. It just seems like it\u2019s something that society should be talking about more; most people these days must know someone who lives alone.\u201d She adds: \u201cWho\u2019s going to provide a miracle solution to this? The answer is no one \u2026 Ultimately, I don\u2019t torment myself by spending much time thinking about how much easier life would be financially if I had a good relationship and someone to share the ever-spiralling costs of living with. I have a few friends who are in far worse financial situations than me, so I have to think myself lucky.\u201d Rupert Jones \u2018With water, I\u2019m paying way above what I use\u2019 Erica Wolfe-Murray has been single for 17 years after being married for 22 years, \u201cso I\u2019m well aware of all the hidden things you pay more for\u201d. The businesswoman, who lives near Oxford, says that what some have called the \u201csingles tax\u201d is something she feels very strongly about. She says that one figure she saw put the cost of being single at about 30% more than being in a couple. Wolfe-Murray says that when she reads magazine and weekend newspaper articles, \u201cthere\u2019s rarely anything about single people \u2013 it\u2019s all about couples. So you\u2019re not only getting reinforcement of your lack of value in society, you are also having to pay more to live in that society.\u201d The list of areas where this is an issue is long. \u201cThe daily standing charges for electricity and gas have to be paid \u2013 and you pick 100% of them up if you are single,\u201d she adds. Meanwhile, single-person households typically use less water. \u201cThames Water seem to be loth to come and fit a water meter. I know I\u2019m paying way above what I use,\u201d says the 65-year-old, who works in the creative sector helping companies to grow. Plus, there never seems to be a discount for one person, whether it\u2019s memberships, entry fees or whatever, whereas there is often a discount available for two people, she adds. Wolfe-Murray has regularly been asked to pay a single supplement when booking a hotel room. She says a hotel bedroom can often cost the same for a single person as for a couple, \u201cwhereas you are using half of the towels, water, overheads, etc (other than the sheets)\u201d. However, she has noticed that some hotels do seem to be stopping charging single supplements. Talking of holidays, she recalls the time she visited Cuba a few years ago. \u201cYou could book rooms in people\u2019s houses, which allowed homeowners to earn income from tourists to boost their minimal finances.\u201d Travelling alone, she had booked a room in advance in the town of Vi\u00f1ales. \u201dWhen I got off the bus, I was greeted by a different person to the one I had booked with. She explained that I would be staying with her, as my original host had been offered four guests to stay in the room I would have occupied (therefore more money). The following night, I returned to the house to find my bags packed and loaded into a car in which I was driven to another house because my second host had been offered two guests for the nights I would have stayed.\u201d This room was effectively a converted lean-to next to a chicken run with dodgy wiring and water. \u201cI was told that as a single traveller I was not worth much to anyone, so was lucky to have a bed at all.\u201d Rupert Jones",

      "body": "<p>In popular culture, narratives about being single generally flip between the joys of unparalleled freedom or lean into cliches that depict those flying solo as lonely or desperate for love.</p> <p>Stereotypes of the \u201ccrazy cat lady\u201d or the socially awkward man who lives with his parents abound. But something often forgotten, many singles would argue, is the significant added costs they face on account of their relationship status.</p> <p>Living alone or being single can come with a very big price tag. Cath estimates that for her, in total, the \u201csingle penalty\u201d, or \u201csingles tax\u201d, costs her upwards of \u00a310,000 a year. Similarly, another reader, Joe, a man in his 30s living in London, says that once his mortgage and various other bills and costs are factored in, it amounts to an \u201capproximately \u00a312,000 cost of being, or choosing to be, single a year\u201d.</p> <p>Those figures echo <a href=\"https://ukdebtexpert.co.uk/blog/single-and-paying-for-it-the-cost-of-living-alone-in-the-uk-in-2024/\">data issued earlier this year</a> by the website UK Debt Expert, which said: \u201cBeing single could mean you fork out, on average, more than \u00a310,000 a year extra compared to homes with two or more adults.\u201d (Its data was based on people who rent.)</p> <p>This steeper financial burden applies across a vast range of costs \u2013 from housing and insurance to utilities, rail travel and holidays. The sting of this \u201ctax\u201d, or \u201cpremium\u201d, comes as people are increasingly going it alone.</p> <p>The number of one-person households, as statisticians call them, is growing: there were 8.4 million people living alone in the UK in 2023, up from 7.8 million a decade earlier, according to <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/bulletins/familiesandhouseholds/2023\">official data issued in May</a> this year.</p> <p>These single-occupancy households accounted for almost a third (29.6%) of the total, the Office for National Statistics said. Exactly half of all those living alone last year were aged 65 or older.</p> <p>Trying to come up with a one-size-fits-all figure for the financial hit suffered by people living alone is almost impossible because of their varying circumstances and lifestyles, but most say it totals thousands of pounds a year.</p> <p>Only this week, the home loans firm Mojo Mortgages issued research showing that solo renters typically spend an extra \u00a3498 a month on essentials such as rent, bills and groceries compared with couples.</p> <p>People living alone often say they feel invisible, but in some countries, policymakers are starting to take notice. In February, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/14/lens-singleton-belgian-council-focus-live-alone#:~:text=7%20months%20old-,'Lens%20of%20a%20singleton'%3A%20Belgian%20council%20to%20focus,on%20those%20who%20live%20alone&amp;text=For%20much%20of%20the,to%20work%20evenings%20and%20weekends.\">the Guardian reported</a> on a Belgian councillor who has persuaded her municipality to consider the impact of its policies on single-adult households.</p> <p>For many, housing is their biggest monthly expense, and the most blatant example of how single-adult households are penalised.</p> <h2><strong>Housing</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mortgages</strong></p> <p>Not having someone to share housing costs with is a huge issue for many. Londoner Joe says his mortgage is approximately \u00a31,500 a month. \u201cThat\u2019s \u00a3750 a month more than a young couple paying a mortgage of the same value together in London \u2013 amounting to \u00a39,000 a year.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel, 36, who lives in London and works in e-commerce, says the string of interest rate increases mean that the mortgage payments for her one-bedroom flat went up by \u00a3400 a month, \u201cand without someone to share the burden with, it\u2019s a serious dent\u201d.</p> <p>About one-third of those getting on the property ladder do it alone, but they come up against more barriers compared with couples buying together. First-time buyers put down an average deposit of \u00a353,414 in 2023, according to <a href=\"https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/media/press-releases/2024/halifax-2024/almost-two-thirds-of-first-time-buyers-teaming-up.html\">data from the Halifax</a>. That is almost \u00a320,000 more than a year\u2019s average pay in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2023\">at \u00a334,963</a>. An obvious advantage of buying with a partner is that this deposit cost can be shared.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the most significant benefits of joint ownership is the potential to pool two incomes as one to secure a joint mortgage. This can often lead to a larger loan being offered compared with applying as a solo prospective homeowner, as lenders consider the combined income of both parties,\u201d Danny Belton, the head of lending at broker the Mortgage Advice Bureau, says.</p> <p>According to Mojo Mortgages, it typically takes a solo buyer 13 years to save for a deposit, while couples need only three years and two months.</p>    <p>There are schemes that can help people hoping to buy, such as the lifetime Isa, where you can benefit from a government bonus of up to \u00a31,000 a year. This doubles to \u00a32,000 when it is a couple where both are saving into an Isa.</p> <p>Even if someone has been able to buy a property on their own, they would then bear the costs of running the household with only one income. \u201cSolo buyers will also be responsible for all household expenses on their own, placing greater stress on their finances. In contrast, joint owners can share the burden of these costs,\u201d Belton says.</p> <p>Single people can, of course, take out a joint mortgage with a friend or relative. This can be a great way to step on to the housing ladder but can throw up its own challenges.</p> <p>The kinds of properties available to people buying alone will also depend on the deposit they can save and the amount borrowers will lend.</p> <p>\u201cOnce they\u2019ve found a place in their price range, the mortgage rates available to single buyers are the same for those buying with someone else,\u201d a spokesperson at the Halifax says.</p> <p><strong>Renting</strong></p> <p>With private rents soaring, more and more people have delayed moving out of home or have turned towards house shares. For many single renters relying on their income alone, the cost of a studio or one-bed flat has become unfeasible.</p> <p>\u201cThe cost of renting has surged in recent years, so it is unsurprising that renters living alone are especially struggling to cover the rent and other costs,\u201d says Ben Twomey, the chief executive of the campaign group Generation Rent.</p> <p>But it is not only single people who are increasingly finding themselves in houseshares in an attempt to save costs. The number of people looking for rooms as a couple increased by 67% in 2023 compared with 2019, according to the flatshare website SpareRoom.</p>    <p>The average price to rent a room in Edinburgh is \u00a3844 a month. That works out at \u00a3422 a person for a couple. </p> <p>Matt Hutchinson, a director at SpareRoom, notes that the way the rent is divided in house shares can vary quite a bit and is not always divided by the room. \u201cSometimes the cost is fixed for the room and, whether it\u2019s a couple or not, it\u2019s the same. However, some people charge a bit extra for a couple, especially if bills are included. If the group sharing all know each other well, they might just split the rent equally between them.\u201d</p> <p>Chances are, it is still cheaper to rent with a partner, and this means more money can be put into savings or spent at the end of each month.</p> <p><strong>Council tax</strong></p> <p>If you live on your own, you are entitled to a 25% reduction on your council tax, although you will need to submit an application to receive it. This is a huge bugbear for many people living alone, as it means couples sharing the bill are paying 50% each compared with the 75% of the full amount that a single person pays. There had been suggestions that the government was considering scrapping the single-person discount but last month Downing Street indicated it would not be getting rid of it.</p> <p>The average monthly cost of council tax for each person in a couple is \u00a390.46, whereas it is \u00a3135.69 for a solo renter, even with the discount, according to Mojo Mortgages.

A typical bill for a single occupier is likely to be about \u00a3325 a year, while a family of three might expect to pay more than double that, according to the Consumer Council for Water (CCW).</p>    <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a water meter, the bill will be the same regardless of how many people live in the property and how much water is being used.\u201d says Andy White, the senior leader for social policy at the CCW.</p> <p>If a customer requests a water meter but it is not possible to fit one for any reason, they should still be eligible for the single occupier assessed charge. \u201cThese charges are designed to better reflect the fact that someone is living alone and can significantly reduce a customer\u2019s bill,\u201d the CCW says.</p> <p>You can try the <a href=\"https://www.ccw.org.uk/save-money-and-water/water-meter-calculator/\">meter calculator</a> on the CCW\u2019s website.</p> <p><strong>Car insurance</strong></p> <p>If you are the only named driver on your car insurance policy, you are likely to be paying more than if there were another person on the plan. Adding another named driver to the policy is one way you can often cut the cost of your car cover because you are \u201cultimately sharing the risk\u201d, says Rhydian Jones, a motoring expert at Confused.com.</p> <p>The extra driver may also have more experience, which \u2013 in the eyes of the insurance company \u2013 means they may carry a lower risk of making a claim. However, the price you pay for a single or multi-person policy will completely depend on the profile of each driver and their driving history. In some cases, this could increase the price you pay.</p>    <p>A named driver on a policy does not have to be someone you are living with or in a relationship with either \u2013 it could be a friend or relative you will be sharing the car with, Jones says.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, our data found that the average cost of car insurance for a woman who is the only driver on a policy is \u00a3971, and \u00a31,176 for a man. But in comparison, a female driver with one additional driver, who is not their spouse, pays \u00a3854 on average, and for men it is \u00a31,112 on average.\u201d</p> <p>Jones adds: \u201cFor a spouse, this generally brings the price down even further. Women with their spouse named on their policy pay \u00a3657 on average, and men pay \u00a3717 on average.\u201d</p> <p>Admiral says married couples are generally seen as a lower risk. \u201cOverall, we statistically find that someone who is married is generally a lower risk than a single person, but this isn\u2019t always the case based on other factors, and it is possible for a single person to be cheaper than a married person in some circumstances [such as historic claims data].\u201d</p> <p><strong>Home insurance</strong></p> <p>Covering your contents if you are single can also cost more than it would for a married couple living together, even if you live with a housemate. Moneysupermarket crunched the data and found that single people typically spend almost twice as much to insure their possessions compared with those who are married and split the cost between them.</p>    <p>\u201cInsurers look at various factors, including claim frequencies and costs, when deciding on premium prices,\u201d says Alicia Hempsted, an insurance expert at the website. </p> <p>It says buildings and contents cover for a house comes up on average at \u00a3275.40 for a single person a year, whereas it costs \u00a3292.91 for a married couple. If the couple split the cost, this is about \u00a3146.45 each \u2013 meaning someone living alone would be paying \u00a3128.95 more each year than one half of a couple.</p> <h2><strong>Pensions</strong><strong> and retirement</strong></h2> <p>This is another area where it can be tough to be single. The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association has developed the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.retirementlivingstandards.org.uk/\">retirement living standards</a>\u201d to show what life in retirement looks like at three levels: minimum, moderate and comfortable. It says a single person needs about \u00a314,400 a year to meet the minimum threshold, whereas for a couple it is \u00a322,400 a year. To meet the moderate threshold, for a single person it is \u00a331,300 and \u00a343,100, respectively.</p> <h2><strong>Entertainment</strong><strong> and leisure</strong></h2> <p><strong>Holidays</strong></p> <p>The dreaded single supplement is the bane of many travellers\u2019 lives. It is a premium often charged when someone books a hotel room, package tour or cabin that they are not sharing with anyone else.</p> <p>Sharing a room involves two people essentially splitting the room cost 50/50. The <a href=\"https://holiday.saga.co.uk/blog/what-are-single-supplements\">holiday company Saga says</a> the single supplement \u201cmeans a single person can expect to pay between 70% and 90% of the room [cost] rather than 100% of the cost \u2013 but it can still be significantly more than the 50% someone travelling as part of a pair would spend\u201d.</p> <p>UK Debt Expert said its research indicated the single supplement \u201ccan cost singles about \u00a3462 more on average for a package holiday\u201d.</p>    <p>The consumer group Which? has also found that<a href=\"https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/solo-travel-single-supplements-aMTc91M8tYV5\"> many solo travellers are paying a hefty surcharge</a> on package holidays, cruises and coach holidays. In one example highlighted last year, it found solo travellers were being quoted 87% more to occupy a single-occupancy cabin, when compared with two people sharing a larger double cabin, on a popular Mediterranean cruise route.</p> <p>Rory Boland, the Which? travel editor, says it is worth travellers digging around to find the companies that offer discounts or reductions for those who are solo.</p> <p>\u201cThe reductions are not always immediately obvious, and may rely on you entering a code, so do search around tour operator websites.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cMany hotels still offer a reduced rate on double rooms for single guests, so be sure to change the field indicating how many people are staying to see if you can get a cheaper price.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/sep/18/how-to-cut-the-cost-of-travelling-on-your-own\">How to cut the cost of travelling on your own</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Travel insurance</strong></p> <p>On top of the unwanted surcharges, single people tend to pay a bit more for their holiday insurance than couples. The Guardian ran a few scenarios, looking at how much it would cost a healthy 40-year-old single person to cover a trip to Malaysia for the whole of November. With one insurer we tried, it cost a single person \u00a357.25. For a couple living at the same address, it was \u00a395.64, which is \u00a347.82 each. Group insurance for two people with the same details as the couple came out at \u00a3114.50 \u2013 that is, the single-person price times two.</p>    <p><strong>Meal kits</strong></p> <p>Rachel says one of her pet peeves is recipe or meal boxes. \u201cThey are everywhere these days, but all of them are based on each meal being for two or four people. I know I can order the two-person one and have leftovers, but it\u2019s pretty depressing.\u201d</p> <p><strong>TV subscriptions</strong></p> <p>A TV licence costs \u00a3169.50 a year for each household, and there is no discount for a single person. However, if you live in a shared property with a joint tenancy agreement, you only need one licence to cover all devices in the property.</p> <p>For TV subscriptions such as Netflix or Disney+, couples are able to split the amount between them, as they can with many costs. A standard Netflix subscription costs \u00a310.99 a month and can be watched by two devices simultaneously. There is no plan for just one device. Disney+ standard has an annual fee of \u00a379.90, or costs \u00a37.99 a month. Unless you split the cost with a housemate, a single person living alone will be paying \u00a339.95 a year more for their standard subscription than one half of a couple who go 50/50.</p> <p><strong>Travel</strong></p> <p>After you turn 30, discounts available for rail travel start to dwindle. There is the Network Railcard for \u00a330 a year, which gives a third off and covers London and the south-east. However, if you are in a couple, you can get a Two Together Railcard. For \u00a330 a year, this gives you a third off for both people when travelling together throughout Great Britain.</p> <p><strong>Health and fitness</strong></p> <p>Even exercise isn\u2019t exempt from the \u201csingle penalty\u201d, with some gyms offering discounts for couples who sign up together. Nuffield Health has a joint membership discount if you sign up in-club, while Total Fitness offers a \u201ccouple membership\u201d, giving a saving of 10% on two individual memberships. </p>",

      "bodyText": "In popular culture, narratives about being single generally flip between the joys of unparalleled freedom or lean into cliches that depict those flying solo as lonely or desperate for love. Stereotypes of the \u201ccrazy cat lady\u201d or the socially awkward man who lives with his parents abound. But something often forgotten, many singles would argue, is the significant added costs they face on account of their relationship status. Living alone or being single can come with a very big price tag. Cath estimates that for her, in total, the \u201csingle penalty\u201d, or \u201csingles tax\u201d, costs her upwards of \u00a310,000 a year. Similarly, another reader, Joe, a man in his 30s living in London, says that once his mortgage and various other bills and costs are factored in, it amounts to an \u201capproximately \u00a312,000 cost of being, or choosing to be, single a year\u201d. Those figures echo data issued earlier this year by the website UK Debt Expert, which said: \u201cBeing single could mean you fork out, on average, more than \u00a310,000 a year extra compared to homes with two or more adults.\u201d (Its data was based on people who rent.) This steeper financial burden applies across a vast range of costs \u2013 from housing and insurance to utilities, rail travel and holidays. The sting of this \u201ctax\u201d, or \u201cpremium\u201d, comes as people are increasingly going it alone. The number of one-person households, as statisticians call them, is growing: there were 8.4 million people living alone in the UK in 2023, up from 7.8 million a decade earlier, according to official data issued in May this year. These single-occupancy households accounted for almost a third (29.6%) of the total, the Office for National Statistics said. Exactly half of all those living alone last year were aged 65 or older. Trying to come up with a one-size-fits-all figure for the financial hit suffered by people living alone is almost impossible because of their varying circumstances and lifestyles, but most say it totals thousands of pounds a year. Only this week, the home loans firm Mojo Mortgages issued research showing that solo renters typically spend an extra \u00a3498 a month on essentials such as rent, bills and groceries compared with couples. People living alone often say they feel invisible, but in some countries, policymakers are starting to take notice. In February, the Guardian reported on a Belgian councillor who has persuaded her municipality to consider the impact of its policies on single-adult households. For many, housing is their biggest monthly expense, and the most blatant example of how single-adult households are penalised. Housing Mortgages Not having someone to share housing costs with is a huge issue for many. Londoner Joe says his mortgage is approximately \u00a31,500 a month. \u201cThat\u2019s \u00a3750 a month more than a young couple paying a mortgage of the same value together in London \u2013 amounting to \u00a39,000 a year.\u201d Rachel, 36, who lives in London and works in e-commerce, says the string of interest rate increases mean that the mortgage payments for her one-bedroom flat went up by \u00a3400 a month, \u201cand without someone to share the burden with, it\u2019s a serious dent\u201d. About one-third of those getting on the property ladder do it alone, but they come up against more barriers compared with couples buying together. First-time buyers put down an average deposit of \u00a353,414 in 2023, according to data from the Halifax. That is almost \u00a320,000 more than a year\u2019s average pay in the UK, at \u00a334,963. An obvious advantage of buying with a partner is that this deposit cost can be shared. \u201cOne of the most significant benefits of joint ownership is the potential to pool two incomes as one to secure a joint mortgage. This can often lead to a larger loan being offered compared with applying as a solo prospective homeowner, as lenders consider the combined income of both parties,\u201d Danny Belton, the head of lending at broker the Mortgage Advice Bureau, says. According to Mojo Mortgages, it typically takes a solo buyer 13 years to save for a deposit, while couples need only three years and two months. There are schemes that can help people hoping to buy, such as the lifetime Isa, where you can benefit from a government bonus of up to \u00a31,000 a year. This doubles to \u00a32,000 when it is a couple where both are saving into an Isa. Even if someone has been able to buy a property on their own, they would then bear the costs of running the household with only one income. \u201cSolo buyers will also be responsible for all household expenses on their own, placing greater stress on their finances. In contrast, joint owners can share the burden of these costs,\u201d Belton says. Single people can, of course, take out a joint mortgage with a friend or relative. This can be a great way to step on to the housing ladder but can throw up its own challenges. The kinds of properties available to people buying alone will also depend on the deposit they can save and the amount borrowers will lend. \u201cOnce they\u2019ve found a place in their price range, the mortgage rates available to single buyers are the same for those buying with someone else,\u201d a spokesperson at the Halifax says. Renting With private rents soaring, more and more people have delayed moving out of home or have turned towards house shares. For many single renters relying on their income alone, the cost of a studio or one-bed flat has become unfeasible. \u201cThe cost of renting has surged in recent years, so it is unsurprising that renters living alone are especially struggling to cover the rent and other costs,\u201d says Ben Twomey, the chief executive of the campaign group Generation Rent. But it is not only single people who are increasingly finding themselves in houseshares in an attempt to save costs. The number of people looking for rooms as a couple increased by 67% in 2023 compared with 2019, according to the flatshare website SpareRoom. The average price to rent a room in Edinburgh is \u00a3844 a month. That works out at \u00a3422 a person for a couple. Matt Hutchinson, a director at SpareRoom, notes that the way the rent is divided in house shares can vary quite a bit and is not always divided by the room. \u201cSometimes the cost is fixed for the room and, whether it\u2019s a couple or not, it\u2019s the same. However, some people charge a bit extra for a couple, especially if bills are included. If the group sharing all know each other well, they might just split the rent equally between them.\u201d Chances are, it is still cheaper to rent with a partner, and this means more money can be put into savings or spent at the end of each month. Council tax If you live on your own, you are entitled to a 25% reduction on your council tax, although you will need to submit an application to receive it. This is a huge bugbear for many people living alone, as it means couples sharing the bill are paying 50% each compared with the 75% of the full amount that a single person pays. There had been suggestions that the government was considering scrapping the single-person discount but last month Downing Street indicated it would not be getting rid of it. The average monthly cost of council tax for each person in a couple is \u00a390.46, whereas it is \u00a3135.69 for a solo renter, even with the discount, according to Mojo Mortgages. That is an extra \u00a345.23 for those living alone each month. Bills Utilities As one reader put it to us this week: \u201cWith bills, obviously I have to heat my house the same amount regardless of how many people are in it.\u201d Energy suppliers do not tend to offer discounts for people living alone, unless they are on benefits. However, some offer tariffs with no standard charges, meaning you only pay for the energy you use, and customers can shop around suppliers to try to find the best deal. With water, a lot of people could save money by switching to a meter, where your bill is based on what you use. A typical bill for a single occupier is likely to be about \u00a3325 a year, while a family of three might expect to pay more than double that, according to the Consumer Council for Water (CCW). \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a water meter, the bill will be the same regardless of how many people live in the property and how much water is being used.\u201d says Andy White, the senior leader for social policy at the CCW. If a customer requests a water meter but it is not possible to fit one for any reason, they should still be eligible for the single occupier assessed charge. \u201cThese charges are designed to better reflect the fact that someone is living alone and can significantly reduce a customer\u2019s bill,\u201d the CCW says. You can try the meter calculator on the CCW\u2019s website. Car insurance If you are the only named driver on your car insurance policy, you are likely to be paying more than if there were another person on the plan. Adding another named driver to the policy is one way you can often cut the cost of your car cover because you are \u201cultimately sharing the risk\u201d, says Rhydian Jones, a motoring expert at Confused.com. The extra driver may also have more experience, which \u2013 in the eyes of the insurance company \u2013 means they may carry a lower risk of making a claim. However, the price you pay for a single or multi-person policy will completely depend on the profile of each driver and their driving history. In some cases, this could increase the price you pay. A named driver on a policy does not have to be someone you are living with or in a relationship with either \u2013 it could be a friend or relative you will be sharing the car with, Jones says. \u201cFor example, our data found that the average cost of car insurance for a woman who is the only driver on a policy is \u00a3971, and \u00a31,176 for a man. But in comparison, a female driver with one additional driver, who is not their spouse, pays \u00a3854 on average, and for men it is \u00a31,112 on average.\u201d Jones adds: \u201cFor a spouse, this generally brings the price down even further. Women with their spouse named on their policy pay \u00a3657 on average, and men pay \u00a3717 on average.\u201d Admiral says married couples are generally seen as a lower risk. \u201cOverall, we statistically find that someone who is married is generally a lower risk than a single person, but this isn\u2019t always the case based on other factors, and it is possible for a single person to be cheaper than a married person in some circumstances [such as historic claims data].\u201d Home insurance Covering your contents if you are single can also cost more than it would for a married couple living together, even if you live with a housemate. Moneysupermarket crunched the data and found that single people typically spend almost twice as much to insure their possessions compared with those who are married and split the cost between them. \u201cInsurers look at various factors, including claim frequencies and costs, when deciding on premium prices,\u201d says Alicia Hempsted, an insurance expert at the website. It says buildings and contents cover for a house comes up on average at \u00a3275.40 for a single person a year, whereas it costs \u00a3292.91 for a married couple. If the couple split the cost, this is about \u00a3146.45 each \u2013 meaning someone living alone would be paying \u00a3128.95 more each year than one half of a couple. Pensions and retirement This is another area where it can be tough to be single. The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association has developed the \u201cretirement living standards\u201d to show what life in retirement looks like at three levels: minimum, moderate and comfortable. It says a single person needs about \u00a314,400 a year to meet the minimum threshold, whereas for a couple it is \u00a322,400 a year. To meet the moderate threshold, for a single person it is \u00a331,300 and \u00a343,100, respectively. Entertainment and leisure Holidays The dreaded single supplement is the bane of many travellers\u2019 lives. It is a premium often charged when someone books a hotel room, package tour or cabin that they are not sharing with anyone else. Sharing a room involves two people essentially splitting the room cost 50/50. The holiday company Saga says the single supplement \u201cmeans a single person can expect to pay between 70% and 90% of the room [cost] rather than 100% of the cost \u2013 but it can still be significantly more than the 50% someone travelling as part of a pair would spend\u201d. UK Debt Expert said its research indicated the single supplement \u201ccan cost singles about \u00a3462 more on average for a package holiday\u201d. The consumer group Which? has also found that many solo travellers are paying a hefty surcharge on package holidays, cruises and coach holidays. In one example highlighted last year, it found solo travellers were being quoted 87% more to occupy a single-occupancy cabin, when compared with two people sharing a larger double cabin, on a popular Mediterranean cruise route. Rory Boland, the Which? travel editor, says it is worth travellers digging around to find the companies that offer discounts or reductions for those who are solo. \u201cThe reductions are not always immediately obvious, and may rely on you entering a code, so do search around tour operator websites.\u201d He adds: \u201cMany hotels still offer a reduced rate on double rooms for single guests, so be sure to change the field indicating how many people are staying to see if you can get a cheaper price.\u201d Travel insurance On top of the unwanted surcharges, single people tend to pay a bit more for their holiday insurance than couples. The Guardian ran a few scenarios, looking at how much it would cost a healthy 40-year-old single person to cover a trip to Malaysia for the whole of November. With one insurer we tried, it cost a single person \u00a357.25. For a couple living at the same address, it was \u00a395.64, which is \u00a347.82 each. Group insurance for two people with the same details as the couple came out at \u00a3114.50 \u2013 that is, the single-person price times two. Meal kits Rachel says one of her pet peeves is recipe or meal boxes. \u201cThey are everywhere these days, but all of them are based on each meal being for two or four people. I know I can order the two-person one and have leftovers, but it\u2019s pretty depressing.\u201d TV subscriptions A TV licence costs \u00a3169.50 a year for each household, and there is no discount for a single person. However, if you live in a shared property with a joint tenancy agreement, you only need one licence to cover all devices in the property. For TV subscriptions such as Netflix or Disney+, couples are able to split the amount between them, as they can with many costs. A standard Netflix subscription costs \u00a310.99 a month and can be watched by two devices simultaneously. There is no plan for just one device. Disney+ standard has an annual fee of \u00a379.90, or costs \u00a37.99 a month. Unless you split the cost with a housemate, a single person living alone will be paying \u00a339.95 a year more for their standard subscription than one half of a couple who go 50/50. Travel After you turn 30, discounts available for rail travel start to dwindle. There is the Network Railcard for \u00a330 a year, which gives a third off and covers London and the south-east. However, if you are in a couple, you can get a Two Together Railcard. For \u00a330 a year, this gives you a third off for both people when travelling together throughout Great Britain.

      "body": "<p>A year ago, Franky Dean, a 24-year-old documentary film-making master\u2019s student, decided to make a phone call she\u2019d been avoiding nearly half her life. She was sitting in a dark computer room in New York University\u2019s journalism institute in Manhattan when she FaceTimed her parents. They were in the living room at her home in the UK, where she grew up. Franky told them she\u2019d just filed a police report about something that had happened more than a decade earlier. When Franky was 12, she had been sexually abused by a close friend\u2019s dad.</p> <p>Franky stared at her phone. For a moment, her parents didn\u2019t say anything.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Franky remembers her dad saying.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean? How do I know that?\u201d she said, taken aback. \u201cI know it because I remember it.\u201d</p> <p>And then her mum said two words that would change her life, again, for ever: \u201cWe know.\u201d</p> <p>It was meant to be a climactic moment \u2013 a revelation that Franky had been building up to for years. Instead, it was the beginning of another story \u2013 the unravelling of a shadow narrative that spanned half of Franky\u2019s life. It\u2019s a story about what happens when police assume survivors of sexual abuse to be \u201cunknowing victims\u201d \u2013 a series of misinterpretations and missteps that amounted to Franky spending 12 years hiding her abuse from her parents while they spent 12 years hiding it from her.</p> <p>Franky\u2019s story sheds light on a complicated and little-understood area in criminal law. What should police do if a victim does not know \u2013 or is presumed not to know \u2013 that they are a victim of a crime?</p> <p>There are a number of instances in which someone may be an unknowing victim of a sex-related crime. For instance, if someone is date raped and does not remember that they have been assaulted. Or if they have consented to having sex with someone but do not know that they are being filmed or that the film is going to be distributed.</p> <p>One of the most extreme examples is Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, 72, whose former husband Dominique is currently in court in France accused of drugging her to the point of a \u201ccoma-like\u201d state so that he and more than 70 strangers could sexually assault her at home. Gis\u00e8le says she had no idea that any of the alleged assaults had happened until she was told by police. She has chosen to waive her right to anonymity to raise awareness of the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.</p> <p>Franky has chosen to be public about what happened to her because she feels that misunderstandings about her experience as a victim have led to a miscarriage of&nbsp;justice.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Franky was a happy and bubbly child. She boarded at a private girls\u2019 school in England. One of her best friends was called Jo. Outside term time, the two girls played at each other\u2019s houses. Sometimes Jo\u2019s dad, Greg (not their real names), took them on outings, such as fishing trips. Anne Dean, Franky\u2019s mum, remembers respecting him. He had a military background and seemed nice. Perhaps a bit quiet, but she thought of him as \u201ca normal dad\u201d.</p> <p>One night, Franky was having a sleepover at Jo\u2019s house. Jo had offered Franky her bedroom and said that she would share her younger sister\u2019s bunk bed. At some point during the night, Franky noticed the glare of a computer in the corner of her eye. Greg was in the room, sitting on a chair by the desk. She wasn\u2019t alarmed and fell back to sleep.</p>    <p>But then, some time later, she felt something. Greg was touching her. He was still looking at his computer, but his left hand was under her loose shorts. Franky lay there, frozen. She didn\u2019t know what sex was, but she knew that what was happening was wrong.</p> <p>The next morning, everything appeared to be normal. Greg lived in a detached house on a private estate, so he had to drive Franky to the gate for her mum to pick her up. During the journey, neither of them acknowledged what had happened. In the car ride home with her mum, Franky didn\u2019t bring it up. She felt ashamed. She wouldn\u2019t talk about it to anyone for several years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In her teens, Franky started getting flashbacks to that night. \u2018It was like the memory came back\u2019\u00a0</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first person Franky told about the assault was her first boyfriend, when she was in her teens. She\u2019d begun getting flashbacks to that night at Greg\u2019s house. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the memory came to me later in life,\u201d she says now. Sometimes when her boyfriend would touch her, she\u2019d feel uneasy. Or, when they were intimate with one another, she\u2019d have a panic attack afterwards.</p> <p>But even small things, like the sound of her own breathing, could trigger her. \u201cIt\u2019s the silliest thing, because I\u2019m breathing all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m almost stuck in that position of constantly going over it, over and over again.\u201d</p> <p>The flashbacks had become vivid and all-consuming, but at the same time, they made Franky confused. She&nbsp;sometimes doubted whether the assault had happened at all. It felt like waking up after a nightmare. \u201cYou wake up and you\u2019re thinking: was that real? Was that not real?\u201d</p> <p>One day, when Franky was still a teenager, she called an NHS helpline to try to get therapy. She says she was (incorrectly) told that since a child sexual assault had taken place, she\u2019d have to report the crime first. Franky felt trapped. She knew she needed help but she didn\u2019t want to be responsible for her friend\u2019s dad going to jail. \u201cI loved her so much,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want her to lose her dad.\u201d</p> <p>So she made a promise to herself. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell my parents,\u201d she decided. \u201cWhatever happens, I\u2019m not going to tell them.\u201d</p> <p>What Franky didn\u2019t know was that her parents already knew.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>In 2014, Franky\u2019s parents received a call from a detective constable. She asked if she could meet them at their house, and arrived soon afterwards. She told them that Greg had been arrested. A year earlier, three girls in a changing room had spotted him holding a small camera under the cubicle walls. Thames Valley police raided his home and seized his computers and laptops, which contained 13,000 indecent images of children. Some of the footage was of Franky. He had filmed her at his home: in the shower, using the toilet, and while he touched her vagina and lifted up her top, revealing her breasts.</p> <p>Franky\u2019s parents\u2019 memory of that first meeting and what came after is blurry. Recently, they\u2019ve begun trying to pin down exactly what happened and when. But one thing stands out in their minds. They remember the detective telling them that it looked as if Franky was asleep in some of the videos, and advised them that they shouldn\u2019t discuss what had happened with her.</p> <p>Franky\u2019s dad, Andrew, describes himself as someone who is \u201cfairly fussy about people\u201d, but nothing about the police officer\u2019s manner alarmed him. Andrew and Anne were horrified about what had happened to their daughter, but the detective was \u201cpersonable\u201d and had explained everything in a \u201creasonable way\u201d. Her advice made sense to them. Franky\u2019s behaviour hadn\u2019t changed. She was still going to Jo\u2019s house. \u201cWe just thought: well, what\u2019s the point?\u201d Anne says. \u201cIf she knows nothing about it, what good is it going to do to tell her that this has happened?\u201d</p>    <p>Still, keeping it a secret was a challenge. They no longer wanted to let Franky go to Jo\u2019s house; but they couldn\u2019t explain why. Once, when Jo was at their house, Greg arrived to collect his daughter. Anne was horrified; she couldn\u2019t believe it. She ran inside to get Andrew. \u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The man who had molested their daughter was metres away from them, outside their house, but the Deans felt they had to act breezy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make a fuss in front of the girls\u201d or \u201cstir anything up that might make Franky think anything about it,\u201d Anne says. \u201cWe also didn\u2019t know who knew what, because the police hadn\u2019t told us.\u201d Andrew pulled Greg aside and told him to leave. \u201cI didn\u2019t care what happened to him. It was so far down the priority list,\u201d he says. \u201cMy&nbsp;overriding question was always about what\u2019s best for Franky.\u201d</p> <p>On 2 September 2015, the detective emailed the Deans to inform them that the Crown Prosecution Service had authorised 22 charges against Greg. She said that since they strongly anticipated him pleading guilty (he had already fully admitted to the offences in interviews) there was no need to inform Franky about any of it.</p> <p>The sentencing hearing took place in December. According to the local news account, Greg described his obsession as a \u201ccancer\u201d \u2013 a disease he wanted to defeat. On 22 December, he was sentenced to a three-year community order but no jail time \u2013 despite admitting to all 22 charges. The Deans couldn\u2019t believe he wasn\u2019t going to jail. But they kept quiet. It was the same problem all over again. \u201cWhat do we do about it?\u201d Anne says. \u201cBecause if we try to do something about it, we\u2019ve got to involve Franky.\u201d</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>According to Suzanne Ost and Alisdair Gillespie, professors of law at Lancaster University, there is no&nbsp;explicit guidance in England and Wales on how police officers should deal with unknowing victims. \u201cIf you look at the Victims\u2019 Code, for instance, there is nowhere in it that says: \u2018victims have a right to know\u2019,\u201d Ost tells me.</p> <p>In 2019, Ost and Gillespie published a paper in the International Review of Victimology<em>, </em>addressing what they believed to be a gap in victimology and criminology literature. They put forward a hypothetical situation: a law enforcement agent comes across abusive images of a toddler, who is now an adult. As far as the agent knows, the victim is not aware that the images exist, or that the abuse has taken place. \u201cNow imagine that victim is you,\u201d they ask the reader. \u201cWould you want to be informed of the crimes and the existence of the&nbsp;images?\u201d</p> <p>When Ost and Gillespie consulted police officers about this conundrum, they tended to agree that unknowing victims deserved to be told. But without any official guidance to disclose such abuse, potentially life-changing decisions are left to interpretation. As technology develops, the prospect of being filmed, photographed or AI rendered without one\u2019s consent becomes increasingly likely. But unknowing victims remain in a legal and ethical grey area, their fates determined by the discretion of individual police officers. \u201cThey need more guidance full stop,\u201d Ost says. \u201cThis issue is not going to go away.\u201d</p> <p>Should unknowing victims always have a right to know, even if it will cause them trauma that could otherwise have been avoided? And what if a mistake has been made? What if \u2013 as with Franky \u2013 the unknowing victim, in fact, does know? Across the board, experts in child sexual abuse believe that there is not a one-size-fits-all solution to these questions.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just such an ethical debate,\u201d says Lawrence Jordan, director of services at Marie Collins Foundation, a charity that supports victims and survivors of technology-assisted child sexual abuse. \u201cNo one has been able to say with confidence \u2013 probably because it\u2019s a case-by-case basis \u2013 that yes, a survivor should know or no, they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Donald Findlater, the former director of Lucy Faithfull Foundation, the preventive child sex abuse charity where Greg received therapy (according to local newspaper reports at the time), recalls a story he heard at a conference. A woman said that when she was a child someone had taken photographs of her through the windows of her family home without her knowledge. She only found out years later when police knocked on her parents\u2019 door to tell them that someone had gone to prison for the crime.</p> <p>The woman wished she hadn\u2019t been told. The revelation made her anxious. How could she protect herself from future danger if she was unable to protect herself from this? \u201cAs a consequence of that knock on the door, she\u2019s now living with this very spooked world of thinking: who\u2019s watching me?\u201d Findlater says.</p> <p>What makes these decisions so challenging is that every survivor is unique; it\u2019s impossible to predict the impact of disclosure until it happens. One of the most prolific incidents of unknowing victims in recent years was the case of Reynhard Sinaga, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/06/reynhard-sinaga-jailed-life-drugging-raping-men-manchester\">who drugged and&nbsp;raped</a> at least 48 men in Manchester between 2015 and 2017. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50688975\">Almost all the victims</a> had no idea they had been raped until police officers knocked on the door years later.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a moral dilemma,\u201d says Lisa Waters, the former child service manager at St Mary\u2019s sexual assault referral centre, who worked with police on these visits. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go in there, tell them what\u2019s happened and drop the bombshell and walk away. You have an obligation to keep people safe.\u201d</p> <p>Some victims were numb; others were furious. \u201cWhy have you told me this?\u201d Waters recalls them asking. \u201cI&nbsp;had no idea that this happened to me. You\u2019ve ruined my life. So why have you told me?\u201d But for other victims, the revelation was a relief. They didn\u2019t have a clear memory of the night, but they had a feeling that something bad had happened. \u201cThe unknown was harder than knowing, even though what I know is horrible,\u201d one victim told the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-58746267\">BBC</a>.</p>    <p>What may seem like an obvious distinction \u2013 between knowing and unknowing \u2013 is, in fact, hazy. Waters says that survivors sometimes report sexual assault years afterwards, perhaps because they have only recently remembered it happening.</p> <p>\u201cSexual violence can affect people\u2019s mental health so deeply and so tragically that sometimes people will dissociate from their experience,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople will come to us, years later, and say, \u2018I don\u2019t know what it was that made me think this is what has happened to me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Sam Tarling, a child investigative interviewing specialist, says she understands why police might not talk to unknowing victims of sexual assault when they are children, but adds, \u201cThere\u2019s a massive difference between: \u2018Let\u2019s not tell them now\u2019 and \u2018Let\u2019s never tell them.\u2019\u201d She also cautions against the rationale for non-disclosure being that someone <em>looked </em>as if they were sleeping. It\u2019s not uncommon for children to pretend to be asleep during traumatic situations.</p> <p>At its core, the concept of unknowing victimhood poses a deeper question: how certain can we ever be about what we know and what we don\u2019t know? A wealth of research into pre-verbal trauma tells us that we are shaped by experiences before we can even articulate them. In 1995, a clinical professor of psychiatry at University of Colorado hospital, Theodore J Gaensbauer, published a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15719501_Trauma_in_the_Preverbal_Period_Symptoms_Memories_and_Developmental_Impact\">case study</a> about a young boy called Robert (not his real name), who, at the age of seven months, was physically and sexually abused by his birth father.</p> <p>When he was adopted, Robert was \u201ccatatonic\u201d. He was afraid of men, he didn\u2019t want to be touched and he preferred to be left in a dark room, alone. As a child, he had behavioural problems and intense mood swings. Robert\u2019s adoptive mother decided to take him to therapy. In one session, when Robert was eight, he said that he\u2019d had a scary memory of his father hurting him. He flung himself to the floor, wailing hysterically, raising his bottom in the air. He shouted: \u201cStop! I hurt all over! My bottom is red!\u201d and, \u201cDon\u2019t let him hurt me! Please don\u2019t do that to me! I\u2019m just a baby!\u201d</p> <p>Robert\u2019s adoptive mother was disturbed and perplexed. She\u2019d made a point not to talk about Robert\u2019s birth father in front of him and he was too young to comprehend his assault when it took place. Yet it seemed the experience had stayed with him.</p> <p>Tarling gives an example of a baby witnessing a violent fight between their parents, in which a knife is pulled and bottles of alcohol are everywhere. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to process all of that because you don\u2019t have language for it. But what you might do, when you\u2019re five, is have a complete meltdown when you see somebody get a bottle of beer out of the fridge,\u201d she says. The child may not be able to explain why they are reacting so viscerally, but that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t remember, it means that you can\u2019t articulate what you\u2019ve experienced, because when you experienced it, you didn\u2019t have words\u201d.</p> <p>Without disclosure, unknowing victims of sexual abuse risk being isolated in a lonely, liminal state of partial knowledge, deprived of victim compensation or adequate psychological support built from a full picture of their histories and mental health.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>About a year after Franky was assaulted, she and a group of girls were called into the deputy head\u2019s office. It was a bright room, overlooking the front of the school. Franky remembers two police officers standing there, asking the girls if anything weird had happened at a friend\u2019s party or sleepover. Franky recalls the girls looking round at each other, confused about what they were talking about. Months had passed since the assault and it wasn\u2019t at the forefront of her mind. \u201cIt didn\u2019t trigger anything,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though I knew what had happened to me, it never clicked.\u201d</p> <p>Years later, when Franky finally reported the assault to the police, they brought up this school meeting, as if to say: why didn\u2019t you tell us then? \u201cIt felt very much like victim blaming,\u201d Franky says. There\u2019s a particular art to interviewing children who might have been subjected to sexual abuse. It\u2019s called the ABE technique, which stands for achieving best evidence. It\u2019s a balancing act between wanting to get all the necessary information, without asking leading questions. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t always go to plan. \u201cThe biggest problem is the lack of planning,\u201d says Tarling, who has observed police rush into schools, and, because they don\u2019t want to ask leading questions, don\u2019t give children a full understanding of why they are there.</p> <p>Tarling believes that hiring specialist child investigative interviewers (as opposed to police alone)&nbsp;could improve the process \u2013 people who understand both the demands of navigating an adversarial court system and<em> </em>child psychology. \u201cI have very strong views about the feminist discourse around this,\u201d she says. \u201cA&nbsp;lot of it is rooted in this belief that speaking to children must be easy, because women [typically] do it \u2026 they look after children and they stay at home.\u201d</p> <p>Philip Baines, a safeguarding and training consultant at the Marie Collins Foundation and former police detective on the Child Abuse Investigation Unit, covering Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire, says he has also observed officers miss opportunities for disclosure. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that the child doesn\u2019t&nbsp;know the answer, it\u2019s just you haven\u2019t asked the right question.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In 2019, a friend said: \u2018Jo\u2019s dad had filmed us all in the toilets.\u2019 It was the first time Franky had had confirmation that the shadowy memory of that night was probably real </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2019, Franky was getting ready with her friend Kate (not her real name) for Henley Royal Regatta, an annual rowing race on the River Thames. \u201cDid you ever know why the police had come to our school and talked to all of the girls?\u201d Franky remembers Kate asking her. Franky said she didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Kate said that her mum had told her. \u201cIt was because Jo\u2019s dad had filmed us all in the toilets.\u201d Franky didn\u2019t say anything, but her mind was whirling. It was the first time she\u2019d had confirmation that the shadowy memory of that night was probably real.</p> <p>Soon after, standing with her mum in the kitchen, Franky decided to float what Kate had told her. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d Franky remembers Anne saying. Franky told her that it was Kate. \u201cI never let you stay over at his after that,\u201d her mum responded. Franky felt devastated; \u201cI remember thinking to myself: it was way too late.\u201d Franky and her mum were facing each other, talking about Greg\u2019s predatory behaviour, but at the same time, they were worlds apart, each barricaded by their lack of understanding of what the other knew.</p> <p>\u201cBoth of us were obviously keeping face, almost hiding our own secrets,\u201d Franky says. \u201cShe was feeling me out to see if I knew anything about my assault, and I was feeling her out.\u201d</p> <p>It would be years until they would address it again.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The night before Franky filed a police report, she\u2019d been to the cinema to watch a new documentary, To Kill a Tiger. The film follows the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/14/jharkhand-india-rape-culture-nisha-pahuja-film-to-kill-a-tiger\">an Indian farmer seeking justice</a> after his 13-year-old daughter was gang raped. Franky was moved. \u201cIf she has the confidence to do that where she is and at her age,\u201d she remembers thinking, \u201cI should be able to do the same.\u201d She called the police the next day.</p> <p>But months after filing the police report, Franky is still waiting for some form of closure. After the phone call with her parents, Franky\u2019s dad sent her his email correspondence with the detective who first approached them, which went back to 2014. Franky scrolled through it, feeling nauseous. She started having a panic attack. \u201cThere was stuff that I didn\u2019t know had happened.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t know, for instance, that Greg had lifted up her top and filmed her breasts.<strong> </strong>Franky had recently started therapy at NYU, where she\u2019d been diagnosed with PTSD. She found this new revelation particularly upsetting. \u201cI\u2019d look at myself in the mirror and be like, I\u2019m disgusting,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the body part that I really loved and now it just feels so violated and&nbsp;horrible.\u201d</p> <p>Franky\u2019s perceived unknowingness was brought up during Greg\u2019s trial. \u201cI\u2019m told that these girls do not know what happened,\u201d the judge is reported as saying, \u201cbut if they did, a great deal of harm would be caused.\u201d To Eleanor Laws, a barrister specialising in criminal, sexual offences, and civil harassment cases, this indicates \u201cthat the judge has reduced his sentence because she thought that and was told that the victim was asleep\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/offences/crown-court/item/sexual-assault-of-a-child-under-13/\">starting point</a> for a prison sentence for someone who has committed a child sexual assault of this kind is usually four years, and if Franky was found to have suffered severe psychological harm, the starting point would have been higher: at least six years. But without Franky having the opportunity to give a victim statement, the judge would not be able to gauge the full impact that the assault had on her life.</p> <p>Last Christmas, Franky returned to the UK and recorded an interview with a police officer at her house. She sketched out the room where she was assaulted; recalled details such as Greg touching her with his left hand. \u201cShe was asking me questions that I\u2019ve never even thought about before, but I had the answers to them, they were still in my head,\u201d Franky says.</p> <p>But after cross-referencing Franky\u2019s statement with video evidence gathered at the time, police came back with a response that Franky found disheartening. Sitting alone in NYU\u2019s journalism department, Franky spoke to a detective constable over Zoom. He told her that it was unlikely that the incident she remembered was different from the one Greg had already been charged for, meaning that the case could not be&nbsp;reopened.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>This man has wrecked my mental health. I can\u2019t even sit in front of a court and have what feels to me like my own fair trial </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Franky felt depleted. In the UK, the prosecution can appeal against a sentence if they consider it to be too lenient, but there is a short time frame in which this can be done: 28 days. After this, the defendant cannot be retried for the same charge, unless new evidence arises that may amount to a separate criminal offence.</p> <p>\u201cEverything that I had been working up to for the past 12 years was unsuccessful,\u201d Franky says. Listening to the police officer\u2019s words, she couldn\u2019t stop crying. \u201cThis whole thing went on about me,\u201d she says, \u201cabout my vagina, about my boobs. And I had no clue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve completely lost what I needed, which was to be in court, say my piece, say what he\u2019s done to affect me,\u201d she says. \u201cThis man has completely wrecked my mental health and I can\u2019t even sit in front of a court and have what feels to me like my own fair trial.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Franky wonders what might have happened if the story had gone differently, if police hadn\u2019t assumed she was asleep in the videos. She thinks that if she\u2019d been given a chance to speak, the outcome of the trial and the trajectory of her life might have been different. \u201cI just have to deal with the fact that I can never be part of my court case.\u201d</p> <p>Franky doesn\u2019t blame her parents for what had happened; she thinks that \u201cif I was in that position, I would have done the same\u201d. But Anne and Andrew can\u2019t help but reflect on the years that passed them by, the years they kept Franky\u2019s assault a secret, consumed by guilt. Sometimes they wonder, knowing what they did at the time, if they should have done it any differently. \u201cThe answer\u2019s no,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cBecause we did it out of love.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 In the UK, the <a href=\"https://www.nspcc.org.uk/\">NSPCC</a> offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

      "bodyText": "A year ago, Franky Dean, a 24-year-old documentary film-making master\u2019s student, decided to make a phone call she\u2019d been avoiding nearly half her life. She was sitting in a dark computer room in New York University\u2019s journalism institute in Manhattan when she FaceTimed her parents. They were in the living room at her home in the UK, where she grew up. Franky told them she\u2019d just filed a police report about something that had happened more than a decade earlier. When Franky was 12, she had been sexually abused by a close friend\u2019s dad. Franky stared at her phone. For a moment, her parents didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Franky remembers her dad saying. \u201cWhat do you mean? How do I know that?\u201d she said, taken aback. \u201cI know it because I remember it.\u201d And then her mum said two words that would change her life, again, for ever: \u201cWe know.\u201d It was meant to be a climactic moment \u2013 a revelation that Franky had been building up to for years. Instead, it was the beginning of another story \u2013 the unravelling of a shadow narrative that spanned half of Franky\u2019s life. It\u2019s a story about what happens when police assume survivors of sexual abuse to be \u201cunknowing victims\u201d \u2013 a series of misinterpretations and missteps that amounted to Franky spending 12 years hiding her abuse from her parents while they spent 12 years hiding it from her. Franky\u2019s story sheds light on a complicated and little-understood area in criminal law. What should police do if a victim does not know \u2013 or is presumed not to know \u2013 that they are a victim of a crime? There are a number of instances in which someone may be an unknowing victim of a sex-related crime. For instance, if someone is date raped and does not remember that they have been assaulted. Or if they have consented to having sex with someone but do not know that they are being filmed or that the film is going to be distributed. One of the most extreme examples is Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, 72, whose former husband Dominique is currently in court in France accused of drugging her to the point of a \u201ccoma-like\u201d state so that he and more than 70 strangers could sexually assault her at home. Gis\u00e8le says she had no idea that any of the alleged assaults had happened until she was told by police. She has chosen to waive her right to anonymity to raise awareness of the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse. Franky has chosen to be public about what happened to her because she feels that misunderstandings about her experience as a victim have led to a miscarriage of justice. * * * Franky was a happy and bubbly child. She boarded at a private girls\u2019 school in England. One of her best friends was called Jo. Outside term time, the two girls played at each other\u2019s houses. Sometimes Jo\u2019s dad, Greg (not their real names), took them on outings, such as fishing trips. Anne Dean, Franky\u2019s mum, remembers respecting him. He had a military background and seemed nice. Perhaps a bit quiet, but she thought of him as \u201ca normal dad\u201d. One night, Franky was having a sleepover at Jo\u2019s house. Jo had offered Franky her bedroom and said that she would share her younger sister\u2019s bunk bed. At some point during the night, Franky noticed the glare of a computer in the corner of her eye. Greg was in the room, sitting on a chair by the desk. She wasn\u2019t alarmed and fell back to sleep. But then, some time later, she felt something. Greg was touching her. He was still looking at his computer, but his left hand was under her loose shorts. Franky lay there, frozen. She didn\u2019t know what sex was, but she knew that what was happening was wrong. The next morning, everything appeared to be normal. Greg lived in a detached house on a private estate, so he had to drive Franky to the gate for her mum to pick her up. During the journey, neither of them acknowledged what had happened. In the car ride home with her mum, Franky didn\u2019t bring it up. She felt ashamed. She wouldn\u2019t talk about it to anyone for several years. The first person Franky told about the assault was her first boyfriend, when she was in her teens. She\u2019d begun getting flashbacks to that night at Greg\u2019s house. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the memory came to me later in life,\u201d she says now. Sometimes when her boyfriend would touch her, she\u2019d feel uneasy. Or, when they were intimate with one another, she\u2019d have a panic attack afterwards. But even small things, like the sound of her own breathing, could trigger her. \u201cIt\u2019s the silliest thing, because I\u2019m breathing all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m almost stuck in that position of constantly going over it, over and over again.\u201d The flashbacks had become vivid and all-consuming, but at the same time, they made Franky confused. She sometimes doubted whether the assault had happened at all. It felt like waking up after a nightmare. \u201cYou wake up and you\u2019re thinking: was that real? Was that not real?\u201d One day, when Franky was still a teenager, she called an NHS helpline to try to get therapy. She says she was (incorrectly) told that since a child sexual assault had taken place, she\u2019d have to report the crime first. Franky felt trapped. She knew she needed help but she didn\u2019t want to be responsible for her friend\u2019s dad going to jail. \u201cI loved her so much,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want her to lose her dad.\u201d So she made a promise to herself. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell my parents,\u201d she decided. \u201cWhatever happens, I\u2019m not going to tell them.\u201d What Franky didn\u2019t know was that her parents already knew. * * * In 2014, Franky\u2019s parents received a call from a detective constable. She asked if she could meet them at their house, and arrived soon afterwards. She told them that Greg had been arrested. A year earlier, three girls in a changing room had spotted him holding a small camera under the cubicle walls. Thames Valley police raided his home and seized his computers and laptops, which contained 13,000 indecent images of children. Some of the footage was of Franky. He had filmed her at his home: in the shower, using the toilet, and while he touched her vagina and lifted up her top, revealing her breasts. Franky\u2019s parents\u2019 memory of that first meeting and what came after is blurry. Recently, they\u2019ve begun trying to pin down exactly what happened and when. But one thing stands out in their minds. They remember the detective telling them that it looked as if Franky was asleep in some of the videos, and advised them that they shouldn\u2019t discuss what had happened with her. Franky\u2019s dad, Andrew, describes himself as someone who is \u201cfairly fussy about people\u201d, but nothing about the police officer\u2019s manner alarmed him. Andrew and Anne were horrified about what had happened to their daughter, but the detective was \u201cpersonable\u201d and had explained everything in a \u201creasonable way\u201d. Her advice made sense to them. Franky\u2019s behaviour hadn\u2019t changed. She was still going to Jo\u2019s house. \u201cWe just thought: well, what\u2019s the point?\u201d Anne says. \u201cIf she knows nothing about it, what good is it going to do to tell her that this has happened?\u201d Still, keeping it a secret was a challenge. They no longer wanted to let Franky go to Jo\u2019s house; but they couldn\u2019t explain why. Once, when Jo was at their house, Greg arrived to collect his daughter. Anne was horrified; she couldn\u2019t believe it. She ran inside to get Andrew. \u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d she said. The man who had molested their daughter was metres away from them, outside their house, but the Deans felt they had to act breezy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make a fuss in front of the girls\u201d or \u201cstir anything up that might make Franky think anything about it,\u201d Anne says. \u201cWe also didn\u2019t know who knew what, because the police hadn\u2019t told us.\u201d Andrew pulled Greg aside and told him to leave. \u201cI didn\u2019t care what happened to him. It was so far down the priority list,\u201d he says. \u201cMy overriding question was always about what\u2019s best for Franky.\u201d On 2 September 2015, the detective emailed the Deans to inform them that the Crown Prosecution Service had authorised 22 charges against Greg. She said that since they strongly anticipated him pleading guilty (he had already fully admitted to the offences in interviews) there was no need to inform Franky about any of it. The sentencing hearing took place in December. According to the local news account, Greg described his obsession as a \u201ccancer\u201d \u2013 a disease he wanted to defeat. On 22 December, he was sentenced to a three-year community order but no jail time \u2013 despite admitting to all 22 charges. The Deans couldn\u2019t believe he wasn\u2019t going to jail. But they kept quiet. It was the same problem all over again. \u201cWhat do we do about it?\u201d Anne says. \u201cBecause if we try to do something about it, we\u2019ve got to involve Franky.\u201d * * * According to Suzanne Ost and Alisdair Gillespie, professors of law at Lancaster University, there is no explicit guidance in England and Wales on how police officers should deal with unknowing victims. \u201cIf you look at the Victims\u2019 Code, for instance, there is nowhere in it that says: \u2018victims have a right to know\u2019,\u201d Ost tells me. In 2019, Ost and Gillespie published a paper in the International Review of Victimology, addressing what they believed to be a gap in victimology and criminology literature. They put forward a hypothetical situation: a law enforcement agent comes across abusive images of a toddler, who is now an adult. As far as the agent knows, the victim is not aware that the images exist, or that the abuse has taken place. \u201cNow imagine that victim is you,\u201d they ask the reader. \u201cWould you want to be informed of the crimes and the existence of the images?\u201d When Ost and Gillespie consulted police officers about this conundrum, they tended to agree that unknowing victims deserved to be told. But without any official guidance to disclose such abuse, potentially life-changing decisions are left to interpretation. As technology develops, the prospect of being filmed, photographed or AI rendered without one\u2019s consent becomes increasingly likely. But unknowing victims remain in a legal and ethical grey area, their fates determined by the discretion of individual police officers. \u201cThey need more guidance full stop,\u201d Ost says. \u201cThis issue is not going to go away.\u201d Should unknowing victims always have a right to know, even if it will cause them trauma that could otherwise have been avoided? And what if a mistake has been made? What if \u2013 as with Franky \u2013 the unknowing victim, in fact, does know? Across the board, experts in child sexual abuse believe that there is not a one-size-fits-all solution to these questions. \u201cIt\u2019s just such an ethical debate,\u201d says Lawrence Jordan, director of services at Marie Collins Foundation, a charity that supports victims and survivors of technology-assisted child sexual abuse. \u201cNo one has been able to say with confidence \u2013 probably because it\u2019s a case-by-case basis \u2013 that yes, a survivor should know or no, they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Donald Findlater, the former director of Lucy Faithfull Foundation, the preventive child sex abuse charity where Greg received therapy (according to local newspaper reports at the time), recalls a story he heard at a conference. A woman said that when she was a child someone had taken photographs of her through the windows of her family home without her knowledge. She only found out years later when police knocked on her parents\u2019 door to tell them that someone had gone to prison for the crime. The woman wished she hadn\u2019t been told. The revelation made her anxious. How could she protect herself from future danger if she was unable to protect herself from this? \u201cAs a consequence of that knock on the door, she\u2019s now living with this very spooked world of thinking: who\u2019s watching me?\u201d Findlater says. What makes these decisions so challenging is that every survivor is unique; it\u2019s impossible to predict the impact of disclosure until it happens. One of the most prolific incidents of unknowing victims in recent years was the case of Reynhard Sinaga, who drugged and raped at least 48 men in Manchester between 2015 and 2017. Almost all the victims had no idea they had been raped until police officers knocked on the door years later. \u201cIt was a moral dilemma,\u201d says Lisa Waters, the former child service manager at St Mary\u2019s sexual assault referral centre, who worked with police on these visits. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go in there, tell them what\u2019s happened and drop the bombshell and walk away. You have an obligation to keep people safe.\u201d Some victims were numb; others were furious. \u201cWhy have you told me this?\u201d Waters recalls them asking. \u201cI had no idea that this happened to me. You\u2019ve ruined my life. So why have you told me?\u201d But for other victims, the revelation was a relief. They didn\u2019t have a clear memory of the night, but they had a feeling that something bad had happened. \u201cThe unknown was harder than knowing, even though what I know is horrible,\u201d one victim told the BBC. What may seem like an obvious distinction \u2013 between knowing and unknowing \u2013 is, in fact, hazy. Waters says that survivors sometimes report sexual assault years afterwards, perhaps because they have only recently remembered it happening. \u201cSexual violence can affect people\u2019s mental health so deeply and so tragically that sometimes people will dissociate from their experience,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople will come to us, years later, and say, \u2018I don\u2019t know what it was that made me think this is what has happened to me.\u2019\u201d Sam Tarling, a child investigative interviewing specialist, says she understands why police might not talk to unknowing victims of sexual assault when they are children, but adds, \u201cThere\u2019s a massive difference between: \u2018Let\u2019s not tell them now\u2019 and \u2018Let\u2019s never tell them.\u2019\u201d She also cautions against the rationale for non-disclosure being that someone looked as if they were sleeping. It\u2019s not uncommon for children to pretend to be asleep during traumatic situations. At its core, the concept of unknowing victimhood poses a deeper question: how certain can we ever be about what we know and what we don\u2019t know? A wealth of research into pre-verbal trauma tells us that we are shaped by experiences before we can even articulate them. In 1995, a clinical professor of psychiatry at University of Colorado hospital, Theodore J Gaensbauer, published a case study about a young boy called Robert (not his real name), who, at the age of seven months, was physically and sexually abused by his birth father. When he was adopted, Robert was \u201ccatatonic\u201d. He was afraid of men, he didn\u2019t want to be touched and he preferred to be left in a dark room, alone. As a child, he had behavioural problems and intense mood swings. Robert\u2019s adoptive mother decided to take him to therapy. In one session, when Robert was eight, he said that he\u2019d had a scary memory of his father hurting him. He flung himself to the floor, wailing hysterically, raising his bottom in the air. He shouted: \u201cStop! I hurt all over! My bottom is red!\u201d and, \u201cDon\u2019t let him hurt me! Please don\u2019t do that to me! I\u2019m just a baby!\u201d Robert\u2019s adoptive mother was disturbed and perplexed. She\u2019d made a point not to talk about Robert\u2019s birth father in front of him and he was too young to comprehend his assault when it took place. Yet it seemed the experience had stayed with him. Tarling gives an example of a baby witnessing a violent fight between their parents, in which a knife is pulled and bottles of alcohol are everywhere. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to process all of that because you don\u2019t have language for it. But what you might do, when you\u2019re five, is have a complete meltdown when you see somebody get a bottle of beer out of the fridge,\u201d she says. The child may not be able to explain why they are reacting so viscerally, but that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t remember, it means that you can\u2019t articulate what you\u2019ve experienced, because when you experienced it, you didn\u2019t have words\u201d. Without disclosure, unknowing victims of sexual abuse risk being isolated in a lonely, liminal state of partial knowledge, deprived of victim compensation or adequate psychological support built from a full picture of their histories and mental health. * * * About a year after Franky was assaulted, she and a group of girls were called into the deputy head\u2019s office. It was a bright room, overlooking the front of the school. Franky remembers two police officers standing there, asking the girls if anything weird had happened at a friend\u2019s party or sleepover. Franky recalls the girls looking round at each other, confused about what they were talking about. Months had passed since the assault and it wasn\u2019t at the forefront of her mind. \u201cIt didn\u2019t trigger anything,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though I knew what had happened to me, it never clicked.\u201d Years later, when Franky finally reported the assault to the police, they brought up this school meeting, as if to say: why didn\u2019t you tell us then? \u201cIt felt very much like victim blaming,\u201d Franky says. There\u2019s a particular art to interviewing children who might have been subjected to sexual abuse. It\u2019s called the ABE technique, which stands for achieving best evidence. It\u2019s a balancing act between wanting to get all the necessary information, without asking leading questions. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t always go to plan. \u201cThe biggest problem is the lack of planning,\u201d says Tarling, who has observed police rush into schools, and, because they don\u2019t want to ask leading questions, don\u2019t give children a full understanding of why they are there. Tarling believes that hiring specialist child investigative interviewers (as opposed to police alone) could improve the process \u2013 people who understand both the demands of navigating an adversarial court system and child psychology. \u201cI have very strong views about the feminist discourse around this,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of it is rooted in this belief that speaking to children must be easy, because women [typically] do it \u2026 they look after children and they stay at home.\u201d Philip Baines, a safeguarding and training consultant at the Marie Collins Foundation and former police detective on the Child Abuse Investigation Unit, covering Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire, says he has also observed officers miss opportunities for disclosure. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that the child doesn\u2019t know the answer, it\u2019s just you haven\u2019t asked the right question.\u201d In 2019, Franky was getting ready with her friend Kate (not her real name) for Henley Royal Regatta, an annual rowing race on the River Thames. \u201cDid you ever know why the police had come to our school and talked to all of the girls?\u201d Franky remembers Kate asking her. Franky said she didn\u2019t. Kate said that her mum had told her. \u201cIt was because Jo\u2019s dad had filmed us all in the toilets.\u201d Franky didn\u2019t say anything, but her mind was whirling. It was the first time she\u2019d had confirmation that the shadowy memory of that night was probably real. Soon after, standing with her mum in the kitchen, Franky decided to float what Kate had told her. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d Franky remembers Anne saying. Franky told her that it was Kate. \u201cI never let you stay over at his after that,\u201d her mum responded. Franky felt devastated; \u201cI remember thinking to myself: it was way too late.\u201d Franky and her mum were facing each other, talking about Greg\u2019s predatory behaviour, but at the same time, they were worlds apart, each barricaded by their lack of understanding of what the other knew. \u201cBoth of us were obviously keeping face, almost hiding our own secrets,\u201d Franky says. \u201cShe was feeling me out to see if I knew anything about my assault, and I was feeling her out.\u201d It would be years until they would address it again. * * * The night before Franky filed a police report, she\u2019d been to the cinema to watch a new documentary, To Kill a Tiger. The film follows the story of an Indian farmer seeking justice after his 13-year-old daughter was gang raped. Franky was moved. \u201cIf she has the confidence to do that where she is and at her age,\u201d she remembers thinking, \u201cI should be able to do the same.\u201d She called the police the next day. But months after filing the police report, Franky is still waiting for some form of closure. After the phone call with her parents, Franky\u2019s dad sent her his email correspondence with the detective who first approached them, which went back to 2014. Franky scrolled through it, feeling nauseous. She started having a panic attack. \u201cThere was stuff that I didn\u2019t know had happened.\u201d She didn\u2019t know, for instance, that Greg had lifted up her top and filmed her breasts. Franky had recently started therapy at NYU, where she\u2019d been diagnosed with PTSD. She found this new revelation particularly upsetting. \u201cI\u2019d look at myself in the mirror and be like, I\u2019m disgusting,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the body part that I really loved and now it just feels so violated and horrible.\u201d Franky\u2019s perceived unknowingness was brought up during Greg\u2019s trial. \u201cI\u2019m told that these girls do not know what happened,\u201d the judge is reported as saying, \u201cbut if they did, a great deal of harm would be caused.\u201d To Eleanor Laws, a barrister specialising in criminal, sexual offences, and civil harassment cases, this indicates \u201cthat the judge has reduced his sentence because she thought that and was told that the victim was asleep\u201d. The starting point for a prison sentence for someone who has committed a child sexual assault of this kind is usually four years, and if Franky was found to have suffered severe psychological harm, the starting point would have been higher: at least six years. But without Franky having the opportunity to give a victim statement, the judge would not be able to gauge the full impact that the assault had on her life. Last Christmas, Franky returned to the UK and recorded an interview with a police officer at her house. She sketched out the room where she was assaulted; recalled details such as Greg touching her with his left hand. \u201cShe was asking me questions that I\u2019ve never even thought about before, but I had the answers to them, they were still in my head,\u201d Franky says. But after cross-referencing Franky\u2019s statement with video evidence gathered at the time, police came back with a response that Franky found disheartening. Sitting alone in NYU\u2019s journalism department, Franky spoke to a detective constable over Zoom. He told her that it was unlikely that the incident she remembered was different from the one Greg had already been charged for, meaning that the case could not be reopened. Franky felt depleted. In the UK, the prosecution can appeal against a sentence if they consider it to be too lenient, but there is a short time frame in which this can be done: 28 days. After this, the defendant cannot be retried for the same charge, unless new evidence arises that may amount to a separate criminal offence. \u201cEverything that I had been working up to for the past 12 years was unsuccessful,\u201d Franky says. Listening to the police officer\u2019s words, she couldn\u2019t stop crying. \u201cThis whole thing went on about me,\u201d she says, \u201cabout my vagina, about my boobs. And I had no clue.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve completely lost what I needed, which was to be in court, say my piece, say what he\u2019s done to affect me,\u201d she says. \u201cThis man has completely wrecked my mental health and I can\u2019t even sit in front of a court and have what feels to me like my own fair trial.\u201d Today, Franky wonders what might have happened if the story had gone differently, if police hadn\u2019t assumed she was asleep in the videos. She thinks that if she\u2019d been given a chance to speak, the outcome of the trial and the trajectory of her life might have been different. \u201cI just have to deal with the fact that I can never be part of my court case.\u201d Franky doesn\u2019t blame her parents for what had happened; she thinks that \u201cif I was in that position, I would have done the same\u201d. But Anne and Andrew can\u2019t help but reflect on the years that passed them by, the years they kept Franky\u2019s assault a secret, consumed by guilt. Sometimes they wonder, knowing what they did at the time, if they should have done it any differently. \u201cThe answer\u2019s no,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cBecause we did it out of love.\u201d \u2022 In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

      "body": "<p>With four full weeks of the NFL regular-season schedule complete, merely one kickoff has been returned for a touchdown under the league\u2019s funky new kickoff rules. DeeJay Dallas, who actually plays for Arizona, <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/videos/can-t-miss-play-first-kick-return-td-of-2024-deejay-dallas-burns-bills-for-96-yard-score\">took one 96 yards to the house</a> in the Cardinals\u2019 season opener.</p> <p>NFL kick returners are on pace to score precisely 4.25 touchdowns this season, only slightly better than the four touchdowns scored on kickoff returns last year. But it is very early in the season, and to judge the effect of the new rules just by touchdowns is to miss the point(s).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/04/the-black-quarterback-is-now-the-nfls-leading-man-but-at-what-cost\">The Black quarterback is now the NFL\u2019s leading man. But at what cost?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NFL rewrote the kickoff rules to encourage teams to return more kickoffs, while moving the coverage teams (but not the kicker) 25 yards upfield for the kickoff, in large part to minimize those breakneck, full-speed collisions that have caused far too many injuries.</p> <p>As intended, teams are returning more kickoffs \u2013 in spades. Through the first four weeks of the season \u2013 not including Thursday night\u2019s game between the Buccaneers and Falcons \u2013 the NFL\u2019s 32 teams have combined to return 187 of 642 kickoffs, or 29.1%, according to statistics from the NFL. Through all of last year, 587 of 2,698 kickoffs were returned, or 21.7%.</p> <p>Kickoffs are still made from the 35-yard line, so there have been 437 thrill-killing touchbacks, or 68.1%. But that is still an improvement over last season\u2019s overall touchback rate of 73%. With cold and damp weather on the way, the touchback percentage is certain to fall.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a cat-and-mouse game until the weather changes and the ball doesn\u2019t go out [for a touchback] all the time,\u201d Michael Clay, the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 special teams coach, said at a news conference last week. \u201cI still think guys are kicking out the back of the end zone at a pretty good clip.\u201d</p> <p>Clay continued: \u201cI\u2019m sure guys haven\u2019t shown everything they have been working on. So again, it goes week-by-week, personnel-based, who is the returner. There\u2019s going to be cat-and-mouse regardless. But it is interesting to see what\u2019s going around the league, and you just start to see what is happening, what kind of schemes are being run out there.\u201d</p> <p>Essentially, all kickoffs in the so-called \u201clanding zone\u201d, from the return team\u2019s own goal line to its 20-yard line, must be returned.

      "bodyText": "With four full weeks of the NFL regular-season schedule complete, merely one kickoff has been returned for a touchdown under the league\u2019s funky new kickoff rules. DeeJay Dallas, who actually plays for Arizona, took one 96 yards to the house in the Cardinals\u2019 season opener. NFL kick returners are on pace to score precisely 4.25 touchdowns this season, only slightly better than the four touchdowns scored on kickoff returns last year. But it is very early in the season, and to judge the effect of the new rules just by touchdowns is to miss the point(s). The NFL rewrote the kickoff rules to encourage teams to return more kickoffs, while moving the coverage teams (but not the kicker) 25 yards upfield for the kickoff, in large part to minimize those breakneck, full-speed collisions that have caused far too many injuries. As intended, teams are returning more kickoffs \u2013 in spades. Through the first four weeks of the season \u2013 not including Thursday night\u2019s game between the Buccaneers and Falcons \u2013 the NFL\u2019s 32 teams have combined to return 187 of 642 kickoffs, or 29.1%, according to statistics from the NFL. Through all of last year, 587 of 2,698 kickoffs were returned, or 21.7%. Kickoffs are still made from the 35-yard line, so there have been 437 thrill-killing touchbacks, or 68.1%. But that is still an improvement over last season\u2019s overall touchback rate of 73%. With cold and damp weather on the way, the touchback percentage is certain to fall. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a cat-and-mouse game until the weather changes and the ball doesn\u2019t go out [for a touchback] all the time,\u201d Michael Clay, the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 special teams coach, said at a news conference last week. \u201cI still think guys are kicking out the back of the end zone at a pretty good clip.\u201d Clay continued: \u201cI\u2019m sure guys haven\u2019t shown everything they have been working on. So again, it goes week-by-week, personnel-based, who is the returner. There\u2019s going to be cat-and-mouse regardless. But it is interesting to see what\u2019s going around the league, and you just start to see what is happening, what kind of schemes are being run out there.\u201d Essentially, all kickoffs in the so-called \u201clanding zone\u201d, from the return team\u2019s own goal line to its 20-yard line, must be returned. The other 10 players on the kickoff-coverage team can\u2019t move until the ball hits the ground or player in the landing zone or the end zone. In the old days, as you recall, coverage teams got off to flying starts that led to head-rattling collisions. The ball is placed at the 30-yard line, five yards upfield from last year, after a kickoff sails into the end zone and is not returned. But a kickoff that hits in the landing zone and rolls into the end zone for a touchback results in the ball being placed at the 20-yard line. There are other unusual and exciting ways to score touchdowns \u2013 bombs, long runs, plus punt, interception and fumble returns among them. In the Eagles\u2019 33-16 loss Sunday to Tampa Bay, Philadelphia defensive back Kelee Ringo returned a blocked Bucs\u2019 extra point for two points, for the Eagles. But the NFL wants to see kickoffs returned, especially on the opening kickoff of a game.

There is also the matter of a team\u2019s kicker, usually not a big fella, acting as the lonely last line of defense. (But that was more or less the case in previous years.) Teams that are trailing in the fourth quarter of a game also must declare onside kicks, in which the old kickoff rules are used. But that is not as significant as it sounds, either, because virtually everyone in the stadium knows when an onside kick might be coming, anyway. The general idea is to put the ball into play, but with the lowest risk of injury. Between 2022 and 2023, the number of kickoff returns had dropped from 1,087 to just 511, per the NFL, and return yards had dwindled from 23,105 to 13,530, and touchdowns from six to four.

      "body": "<p>In 1973, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> was a hungry, awkward real estate heir from Queens looking for respect in New York. Not particularly smart, not particularly charming and with no solid plan to combat a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html\">federal lawsuit</a> over the family company\u2019s discrimination against Black tenants, the young Trump was fumbling toward his dream of opening a lavish hotel near Grand Central. That is, until he met Roy Cohn, Senator Joseph McCarthy\u2019s pugilistic prosecutor turned Richard Nixon confidant and political fixer, at a swanky New York club.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/20/donald-trump-biopic-the-apprentice-ali-abbasi-cannes\">Donald Trump biopic The Apprentice depicts him as a rapist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s the opening scene of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/20/the-apprentice-review-cartoon-version-of-chump-in-chief-donald-trumps-early-years\">The Apprentice</a>, a new film out this month following a beleaguered journey to theaters. Written by Vanity Fair\u2019s longtime Trump chronicler Gabriel Sherman and directed by the Iranian Danish film-maker Ali Abbasi, the film depicts the young Trump\u2019s ascent in New York society in the 1970s and 80s via Cohn\u2019s shameless tactics, as the lawyer\u2019s health weakened due to HIV/Aids. The question dogging the film, starring a de-handsomed Sebastian Stan as Trump and Succession\u2019s Jeremy Strong as Cohn, has been: does anyone want to watch a Trump movie? And after the film fizzled into a long period of distribution uncertainty following some positive reviews at the Cannes film festival in May \u2013 <em>would</em> anyone be able to watch it?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with people bashing us, praising us, whatever,\u201d Abbasi, who previously made serial killer thriller Holy Spider, said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m not fine with, what really hurts, is the boycott or censorship that, effectively, we went through.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tXEN0WNJUg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0tXEN0WNJUg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Even with two major stars attached, the independent film has had a torturous road to theaters. Following the film\u2019s festival premiere, the Trump camp issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/24/trump-apprentice-film-cease-and-desist\">a cease-and-desist letter</a> \u2013 unsurprising, given the former president\u2019s litigiousness and the film\u2019s material. The Apprentice depicts, among other things, Trump raping his first wife, Ivana (Maria Bakalova) \u2013 a fictionalized account of an alleged 1989 attack \u2013 and getting liposuction. Dan Snyder, a pro-Trump billionaire involved with Kinematics, the company that put up equity for the film against domestic rights, reportedly sought to block its release. Possibly spooked by the legal threats, various studios and streamers passed. At the 11th hour, Briarcliff Entertainment swooped in with a <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/trump-film-the-apprentice-release-date-awards-campaign-1235984424/\">domestic distribution plan</a> and awards push, though the film-makers still asked for $100,000 in a <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/the-apprentice-movie-kickstarter-1235991544/\">Kickstarter campaign</a> (dubbed \u201cRelease the Apprentice\u201d).</p> <p>According to Abbasi, who is based in Copenhagen, the distribution issue was less a juicy story of a rightwing billionaire and more an unrepentant liar getting their way than simple corporate logic: \u201cWhatever makes money makes money, whatever doesn\u2019t make money is not interesting.\u201d The calculation being that, though people will watch the movie, it could turn off more Maga subscribers or customers. \u201cFor all the liberal surface of Hollywood \u2013 and I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re lying or anything \u2013 but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re willing to get into politics in any major, meaningful way,\u201d said Abbasi.</p> <p>The movie has, from the get-go, been a tough sell. \u201cTrumpland thinks that we\u2019re doing a hit job on Trump, but when we were doing the movie, all our liberal friends in Hollywood, they thought that we\u2019re giving him too much oxygen,\u201d said Abbasi. \u201cWe had people hanging up on us when we were crewing up, because we didn\u2019t \u2018hate\u2019 Trump enough.\u201d</p> <p>To be clear, the film, which Sherman first conceived and wrote in 2017 \u2013 far before Cohn\u2019s rules of \u201cattack, attack, attack\u201d, \u201cadmit nothing, deny everything\u201d and \u201cnever admit defeat\u201d manifested in efforts to steal a US presidential election \u2013 does not go easy on Trump. It\u2019s a work of dramatization grounded in the historical record, which is as damning as you view it to be. (For people outside the Maga-verse, it\u2019s pretty damning.) But it is attempting to do what may be impossible in America now: to talk about Trump without any political baggage, to set aside feelings on the man in the name of fact-based art. \u201cIt\u2019s not written to influence people\u2019s minds,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cIt\u2019s written as art and what people take from it is their own choice.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a universal story about the apprentice outstripping the master,\u201d he added. \u201cI hope people can experience it on its own terms and not bring all their political baggage to it.\u201d</p>    <p>Nothing in the Apprentice is unknown to anyone who has paid attention to Trump beyond his recent political career. The film depicts his icy, disappointing relationship with his father (Martin Donovan); his more affectionate relationship with his alcoholic older brother Fred (Charlie Carrick), who died in 1981; his bumbling courtship with Ivana; and his blind eye toward Cohn\u2019s homosexuality and bumbling attempts at respectability. And perhaps most damning of all, his cheats, workarounds and outright lies \u2013 to the housing board, to the press \u2013 that worked because they aligned with others\u2019 self-interest, and the ways that New York elites conferred legitimacy on a blowhard. (A New York Times profile comparing Trump to Robert Redford, read aloud by his mother Mary, is lifted directly from a real article helping to build Trump\u2019s reputation as a legitimate New York businessman.)</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a system, there\u2019s a social Darwinism that is built-in in American society, that didn\u2019t come with Trump and will not end with Trump,\u201d said Abbasi, who maintains that The Apprentice is \u201cnot a Trump movie. It is about the becoming of the character Donald Trump as we know him today, through this very specific time and specific relationship.\u201d</p> <p>Over the course of the film, Trump, as played by Stan in as unexaggerated a way as someone could possibly do, becomes more and more like the recognizable figure today \u2013 bigger and with more bluster, operating with increasingly little sense of consequence. The most disturbing scene to watch \u2013 and the one that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/20/donald-trump-biopic-the-apprentice-ali-abbasi-cannes\">made headlines out of Cannes</a> \u2013 is one in which he rapes Ivana in the late 1980s.</p> <p>\u201cI felt the film had to address that aspect of his character \u2013 it would be a whitewash of a movie if we didn\u2019t acknowledge it in some way,\u201d said Sherman, noting that Trump has been credibly accused of sexual assault by at least a dozen women, and was found liable by a New York jury for the assault of the former Elle columnist E Jean Carroll. The episode in question draws from Ivana\u2019s own divorce deposition, behind closed doors and under oath, in 1990. (Ivana, who died in 2022, later made contradictory statements, though Sherman noted these were under pressure from Trump\u2019s lawyers and, eventually, campaign team.) \u201cI wanted to feel like, OK, this man is our president he has this history of sexual assault \u2013 let\u2019s look at it, let\u2019s like make people actually see what that is like,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It\u2019s one of several tough scenes to stomach, however much one has intellectualized Trump\u2019s well-documented misconduct, and has, naturally, drawn the ire of Republicans.

      "bodyText": "In 1973, Donald Trump was a hungry, awkward real estate heir from Queens looking for respect in New York. Not particularly smart, not particularly charming and with no solid plan to combat a federal lawsuit over the family company\u2019s discrimination against Black tenants, the young Trump was fumbling toward his dream of opening a lavish hotel near Grand Central. That is, until he met Roy Cohn, Senator Joseph McCarthy\u2019s pugilistic prosecutor turned Richard Nixon confidant and political fixer, at a swanky New York club. That\u2019s the opening scene of The Apprentice, a new film out this month following a beleaguered journey to theaters. Written by Vanity Fair\u2019s longtime Trump chronicler Gabriel Sherman and directed by the Iranian Danish film-maker Ali Abbasi, the film depicts the young Trump\u2019s ascent in New York society in the 1970s and 80s via Cohn\u2019s shameless tactics, as the lawyer\u2019s health weakened due to HIV/Aids. The question dogging the film, starring a de-handsomed Sebastian Stan as Trump and Succession\u2019s Jeremy Strong as Cohn, has been: does anyone want to watch a Trump movie? And after the film fizzled into a long period of distribution uncertainty following some positive reviews at the Cannes film festival in May \u2013 would anyone be able to watch it? \u201cI\u2019m fine with people bashing us, praising us, whatever,\u201d Abbasi, who previously made serial killer thriller Holy Spider, said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m not fine with, what really hurts, is the boycott or censorship that, effectively, we went through.\u201d Even with two major stars attached, the independent film has had a torturous road to theaters. Following the film\u2019s festival premiere, the Trump camp issued a cease-and-desist letter \u2013 unsurprising, given the former president\u2019s litigiousness and the film\u2019s material. The Apprentice depicts, among other things, Trump raping his first wife, Ivana (Maria Bakalova) \u2013 a fictionalized account of an alleged 1989 attack \u2013 and getting liposuction. Dan Snyder, a pro-Trump billionaire involved with Kinematics, the company that put up equity for the film against domestic rights, reportedly sought to block its release. Possibly spooked by the legal threats, various studios and streamers passed. At the 11th hour, Briarcliff Entertainment swooped in with a domestic distribution plan and awards push, though the film-makers still asked for $100,000 in a Kickstarter campaign (dubbed \u201cRelease the Apprentice\u201d). According to Abbasi, who is based in Copenhagen, the distribution issue was less a juicy story of a rightwing billionaire and more an unrepentant liar getting their way than simple corporate logic: \u201cWhatever makes money makes money, whatever doesn\u2019t make money is not interesting.\u201d The calculation being that, though people will watch the movie, it could turn off more Maga subscribers or customers. \u201cFor all the liberal surface of Hollywood \u2013 and I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re lying or anything \u2013 but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re willing to get into politics in any major, meaningful way,\u201d said Abbasi. The movie has, from the get-go, been a tough sell. \u201cTrumpland thinks that we\u2019re doing a hit job on Trump, but when we were doing the movie, all our liberal friends in Hollywood, they thought that we\u2019re giving him too much oxygen,\u201d said Abbasi. \u201cWe had people hanging up on us when we were crewing up, because we didn\u2019t \u2018hate\u2019 Trump enough.\u201d To be clear, the film, which Sherman first conceived and wrote in 2017 \u2013 far before Cohn\u2019s rules of \u201cattack, attack, attack\u201d, \u201cadmit nothing, deny everything\u201d and \u201cnever admit defeat\u201d manifested in efforts to steal a US presidential election \u2013 does not go easy on Trump.

The film depicts his icy, disappointing relationship with his father (Martin Donovan); his more affectionate relationship with his alcoholic older brother Fred (Charlie Carrick), who died in 1981; his bumbling courtship with Ivana; and his blind eye toward Cohn\u2019s homosexuality and bumbling attempts at respectability.

For an instant style upgrade, buy Arket\u2019s good-quality, cotton, ribbed ankle socks to wear with loafers, hiking sandals or trainers. Come evening, I love the punk, jet-flecked Calzedonia sheer socks with a simple black court. After decades of on-the-ground reporting, my findings are that wearing socks with high-heeled shoes approximately doubles how long you can comfortably stand in them.</p>    <p><strong>Sheer socks, \u00a37<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.calzedonia.com/uk/product/sheer_short_socks_with_diamante-DCZ032.html\"><sub>calzedonia.com</sub></a></p>    <p><strong>Ribbed ankle socks, \u00a317 for five pairs<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.arket.com/en_gbp/women/socks-tights/product.cotton-rib-socks-set-of-5-white.1207875003.html\"><sub>arket.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Pick up a chic mini scarf</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve written about my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/feb/10/how-to-jazz-up-your-boring-old-coat-with-a-colourful-twist\">Lucky Stitch scarf</a> before, but am telling you again in case you missed it. Most wool scarves are Doctor Who, but these dual-coloured neck ties are pure Grace Kelly. I\u2019ve never mastered tying a silk scarf elegantly, but the knitted neckerchief always looks great and is small enough to fold into a blazer pocket so you don\u2019t lose it. There are endless, gorgeous colours; mine is tan and tobacco.</p>    <p><strong>Mini scarf, from \u00a328<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/luckystitchstore/\"><sub>etsy.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Find a \u2018Chanel\u2019 jacket</strong></h2> <p>Obviously I\u2019m not suggesting you buy a fake Chanel jacket \u2013 hiya, Chanel lawyers! But what I call a Chanel tribute jacket (nubbly tweed, boxy, patch pockets, snazzy buttons) is a staple of the British high street these days. The genius is in the way it gives you support and structure, but doesn\u2019t restrict you. You can pretty much always find one of these in Zara for about \u00a360.</p>    <p><strong>Textured blazer, \u00a359.99<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/textured-cropped-blazer-p08073245.html\"><sub>zara.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Discover the high street\u2019s best jeans</strong></h2> <p>The most brilliant jeans in the world are Levi\u2019s 501 90s. The next best thing could be Gap\u2019s Cheeky high-waisted straight-leg jeans, which have an authentic straight leg and come in a low-stretch denim which holds you really well, so you don\u2019t get that afternoon slump.</p>    <p><strong>Levi 501 90s jeans, \u00a3100</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.levi.com/GB/en_GB/clothing/women/jeans/501-90s-jeans/p/A19590005\"><sub>levi.com</sub></a></p>    <p><strong>High-waisted straight-leg jeans, \u00a360<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.gap.co.uk/style/ls331117/k10660\"><sub>gap.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Stop wearing your jumper. Yes, really</strong></h2> <p>Drape it instead. Looping your sweater over your shoulders is the new shoulder-robing. An instant wardrobe update \u2013 and a practical safety net if the weather turns nippy.</p>    <h2><strong>Check out Uniqlo\u2019s coat selection</strong></h2> <p>Fashion insiders have long known that Uniqlo is a goldmine of well-designed pieces. The appointment of former Givenchy designer Clare Waight Keller as creative director suggests things will get even better. Your first port of call for a classic wool coat that looks expensive but isn\u2019t: the boxy wool blend Chester long coat. It comes in grey, black and beige, and has a concealed button that converts the lapel into a funnel neck. </p>    <p><strong>Wool blend long coat, \u00a399.90<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E469906-000/00\"><sub>uniqlo.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Buy T-shirts that last</strong></h2> <p>Isle of Wight brand Rapanui is serious about circular fashion. Send your old 100% cotton T-shirt back (any brand) and it will give you a \u00a35 store credit. The women\u2019s mid-weight oversized T-shirt has just the right sleeve length and fabric weight to feel elevated and chic, rather than basic. Great colours, too \u2013 evergreen is a favourite.</p>    <p><strong>Oversized T-shirt, \u00a325<br></strong><a href=\"https://rapanuiclothing.com/products/womens-midweight-oversized-t-shirt\"><sub>rapanuiclothing.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Get your cardies from the men\u2019s section</strong></h2> <p>Preppy is back. A great cardigan never went away. Knitwear from the menswear floor is ideal for clean lines and an oversized fit; the colours are often more chic and muted, too. Uniqlo\u2019s lambswool V-neck is a classic.</p>    <p><strong>V-neck cardigan, \u00a339.90<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E469402-000/00\"><sub>uniqlo.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Get your brows done in a salon</strong></h2> <p>Brows with a strong arch and a neat outline add instant polish to your look. Having your eyebrows waxed or threaded costs less than \u00a310 in most salons, and is so quick you can usually walk in and get a spot.</p>    <h2><strong>Try press-on lash clusters</strong></h2> <p>If you would like to have better eyelashes, but definitely don\u2019t have time, money or bandwidth for getting specialist extensions, try Kiss Impress press-on lash clusters. Just press one or two clusters below the upper lashes on each eye and give them a squeeze with the clamp. They look great, last for a few days, then just fall off. The \u00a320 starter kit gets you the clamp; refill boxes with just the lashes are \u00a39. Go for the natural set so it\u2019s not too much.</p>    <p><strong>Press-on lash kit, \u00a320<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.superdrug.com/make-up/eye-makeup/false-eyelashes/pre-glued-eyelashes/kiss-impress-falsies-press-on-lash-kit-01/p/834608\"><sub>superdrug.com</sub></a></p> <p><strong>Press-on lashes, \u00a39<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.superdrug.com/make-up/eye-makeup/false-eyelashes/pre-glued-eyelashes/kiss-impress-press-on-single-02/p/840425\"><sub>superdrug.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Buy your boots from M&amp;S \u2026</strong></h2> <p>About half the shoes I wear are from M&amp;S. The high street stalwart has great styles \u2013 keep a close eye and swoop fast \u2013 and they are ridiculously comfortable. For autumn, I\u2019ve got my eye on these classic block heeled boots, which come in burgundy (very this season\u2019s Gucci) and black.</p>    <p><strong>Ankle boots, \u00a375</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/leather-block-heel-ankle-boots/p/clp60683381\"><sub>marksandspencer.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and your heels from Dune</strong></h2> <p>Have you looked at Dune shoes recently? They look fabulous, the prices are fair and, best of all, the luxurious squishy padded soles cut down heel ache. I love the Careless two-tone ankle straps in burgundy and black. A block heel is more economical than a dainty heel tip, which requires endless trips to the cobblers.</p>    <p><strong>Ankle strap courts, \u00a390<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.dunelondon.com/careless--burgundy-0095504510002502.html\"><sub>dunelondon.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Invest in quiet-luxury loafers</strong></h2> <p>Loafers are definitely going to be around for a while, so if you haven\u2019t already invested, do. Boden\u2019s Iris snaffle loafers in ginger snap suede have a terrific Talented Mr Ripley vibe. (FYI, the company does extraordinary sales.)</p>    <p><strong>Suede loafers, \u00a3110<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.boden.co.uk/en-gb/iris-snaffle-loafers-ginger-snap-suede/sty-a1412-brn\"><sub>boden.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Shop shoes like a fashion insider</strong></h2> <p>Fancy flats by Singapore brand Charles &amp; Keith are a fashion editor favourite. They look designer, are comfortable, and don\u2019t cost the earth. The tweed beaded chain-link slingback flats have smart glossy toe caps and a beaded chain-link strap, all for \u00a359.</p>    <p><strong>Slingback flats, \u00a359<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.charleskeith.co.uk/gb/CK1-70900382-2_BLKTXT.html\"><sub>charleskeith.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Take a travel iron on holiday</strong></h2> <p>Ever since a fashion desk colleague tipped me off about packing a travel iron, I\u2019ve never looked back. I can wear a cotton shirt twice \u2013 even at fashion week \u2013 if I can iron out the creases and sharpen up the collar. It means you can pack lighter and travel hand-luggage only, which results in less stress at the airport as well as cheaper fares. Mine is from Quest.</p>    <p><strong>Travel iron, \u00a318</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.wilko.com/en-uk/quest-travel-steam-iron-1000w/p/0607878\"><sub>wilko.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and a stain remover pen everywhere</strong></h2> <p>Tide-to-Go stain remover pens are magic. I wouldn\u2019t travel to fashion shows \u2013 or anywhere else, really \u2013 without packing one. Whip it out, rub it on your garment and watch that coffee splash vanish.</p>    <p><strong>Stain remover pens, \u00a312.99 for three<br></strong><a href=\"https://americantreatsintheuk.com/products/tide-to-go-pen-3-pack\"><sub>americantreatsintheuk.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Pick up some fabric protector</strong></h2> <p>This isn\u2019t just for sofas and shoes; it is great for clothes, too. Scotchgard water shield fabric protector is a pre-emptive lifesaver: spray it all over white jackets, suede trousers or delicate party dresses to repel stains and watermarks. You\u2019re welcome.</p>    <p><strong>Fabric protector, \u00a36.59<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.viking-direct.co.uk/en/p/1073193\"><sub>viking-direct.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Clean your jewellery</strong></h2> <p>Fill a bowl \u2013 not a sink, we don\u2019t want any accidents with the plughole \u2013 with warm (not boiling) water, add a squirt of washing-up liquid, leave rings and earrings to soak for 10 minutes and then clean with an old toothbrush to dislodge grime.</p>    <h2><strong>Snap up a classic Argyle cardi </strong></h2> <p>Nothing says autumn like a cosy Argyle cardigan. You could wear M&amp;S\u2019s version, featuring a ribbed trim and shiny gold buttons, with barrel leg jeans and chunky silver earrings this winter and look bang on trend, but the style will never date. </p>    <p><strong>Argyle cardigan, \u00a335<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/argyle-crew-neck-cardigan-with-wool/p/clp60688482\"><sub>marksandspencer.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Organise your beauty kit</strong></h2> <p>Makeup artists love Next\u2019s lay flat drawstring makeup bag. It sits on your shelf as a pretty velvet pouch, but undo the drawstring and it lies flat, so everything is visible. With other bags I waste at least one of the five minutes I have to do my makeup rummaging around; this way, I have time for a second coat of mascara. I want it in green velvet.</p>    <p><strong>Drawstring makeup bag, \u00a314<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.next.co.uk/style/ST335328/C52312\"><sub>next.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Give yourself a lazy girl\u2019s French manicure</strong></h2> <p>My bar for nails is set at a low but achievable level of presentability, which means one coat of Glowing Out by Nails Inc, which adds a rosy tint to your nails while making the white tips look whiter. A quick swipe with a nail tip whitener crayon (Mavala makes the best) in the two minutes it takes the polish to dry and you are good to go.</p>    <p><strong>Nail perfector polish, \u00a39<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.superdrug.com/make-up/nails/nail-polish/gloss-nail-polish/nailsinc-glowing-out-glowing-my-way/p/820056\"><sub>superdrug.com</sub></a></p> <p><strong>Nail white crayon, \u00a36.40<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.nailpolishdirect.co.uk/nail-white-crayon-nail-tip-whitener-90615-p11051/s15298\"><sub>nailpolishdirect.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Upgrade a look with a belt</strong></h2> <p>A beautiful belt will make the simplest shirt and trousers look more sophisticated. I love S\u00e9zane\u2019s, which come in soft leather with pleasingly vintage-looking burnished hardware. The brand\u2019s Taylor belt is \u00a365, which might seem expensive, but works out as a good price-per-wear, seeing as I wear it most days.</p>    <p><strong>Leather belt, \u00a365<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.sezane.com/en-en/product/taylor-belt/smooth-black-heritage\"><sub>sezane.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Buy a cheap magnifying mirror</strong></h2> <p>The key to smarter makeup. You want a little one on a stand, so you can prop it wherever the light hits best. Ikea\u2019s, gives 2.5 times magnification.</p>    <p><strong>Magnifying mirror, \u00a35<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/trensum-mirror-stainless-steel-24524485/\"><sub>ikea.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Do thermals \u2026 but make them fashion</strong></h2> <p>You know about Uniqlo Heattech, right? New-gen thermals that look and feel like fashion. Uniqlo has sold more than a billion of these, because they work. My favourite item is its extra warm cashmere blend high-neck T-shirt in six colours. I\u2019ll be wearing it underneath lightweight shirt dresses or sleeveless shifts to keep my summer wardrobe firing well into autumn.</p>    <p><strong>Thermal T-shirt, \u00a319.90</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E471601-000/00\"><sub>uniqlo.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Swap your dull laces for bright hiking ones</strong></h2> <p>Give your scuffed old walking boots a glow-up with a fancy pair of hiking laces. Cherry purple, why not?</p>    <p><strong>Round laces, \u00a33.49<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/round-laces-for-hiking-shoes/_/R-p-309845?mc=8738488&amp;c=cherry+purple\"><sub>decathlon.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Check the weather </strong></h2> <p>Nothing ruins your look \u2013 and mood \u2013 faster than not being dressed right in wind or rain. Being up to date with the weather will do more for your look than being up to date with trends. Download an extra weather app and crosscheck at least two forecasts each morning. Your suede shoes will thank you.</p>    <p><strong>Weather app<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/weather-app\"><sub>metoffice.gov.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Consider a tuxedo jacket</strong></h2> <p>If you have a black tux with contrast lapels, you have a perfect look for every kind of party: wear it with black trousers and heels for black tie, or with jeans and a T-shirt for a cocktail-dress code. And because it will always be an unusual choice, you will stand out every time without having to buy anything new. From November, M&amp;S is doing one with classic satin lapels, which is good value at \u00a379, but you can pick up a double breasted version from there now for \u00a389. Alternatively, Vinted is a great source for tailoring. </p>    <p><strong>Tuxedo jacket, \u00a389<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/double-breasted-tuxedo-jacket/p/clp22533874\"><sub>marksandspencer.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Dig out a vintage knitted waistcoat</strong></h2> <p>Look, you can easily buy one of these from Zara but the brilliant thing about the return of the knitted waistcoat \u2013 a kind of button-up sweater vest \u2013 is that this staple of the gentleman\u2019s wardrobe is widely available in secondhand stores for a song.</p>    <p><strong>Knit waistcoat, \u00a319.99</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/stretch-knit-buttoned-waistcoat-p05584664.html\"><sub>zara.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Find two perfect bras</strong></h2> <p>Bras are personal, and bigger cup sizes have specific needs, but for all my not-super-busty-but-need-a-bra girlies out there, these are a couple I swear by for comfort and a smooth line. Gossard Glossies sheer bra for under T-shirts, and Rosie for M&amp;S Beau silk and lace wired plunge bra for everything else.</p>    <p><strong>Plunge bra, \u00a329.50<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/beau-silk-and-lace-wired-plunge-bra-a-e-/p/clp60638330\"><sub>marksandspencer.com</sub></a></p> <p><strong>Sheer moulded bra, \u00a336</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.gossard.com/glossies-sheer-moulded-bra-white-white-6271-wht.html\"><sub>gossard.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Choose classic, long-lasting trainers</strong></h2> <p>What do Alexa Chung, Kate Middleton, Emily Ratajkowski and I have in common? Superga 2750 trainers. The Italian-made, old-school canvas plimsolls are sleekly minimal and super comfortable.</p>    <p><strong>Trainers, \u00a365<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/superga-2750-cotu-classic-canvas-vegan-trainers/white/p3601396\"><sub>johnlewis.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Try a barn coat</strong></h2> <p>You know that French-blue \u201cchore\u201d jacket that\u2019s been everywhere the past few years? Well, the tan \u201cbarn coat\u201d \u2013 seen on the catwalk for Loewe \u2013 is the new that. It has serious fashion cred right now, and the best versions are pre-loved from US workwear brands. Key details to look for are a corduroy collar, a straight silhouette (not waisted) and oversized pockets. Beaten-up looks better than pristine. Search LL Bean or J Crew on eBay, and you should find something for about \u00a330.</p>    <p><strong>Barn jacket, \u00a375</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.asos.com/monki/monki-barn-jacket-in-light-brown-with-contrast-cord-collar/prd/207130147\"><sub>asos.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t write off souvenir shop earrings</strong></h2> <p>A dash of kitsch can look surprisingly chic with an otherwise sophisticated outfit. I get more compliments for my dangly mini Eiffel Towers than for almost any other pair of earrings. They cost \u20ac5 in a souvenir shop on the Rue de Rivoli in Paris, but you can also find cute ones on Etsy and Lottie and Lu. Or pick your own landmark: Statue of Liberty, Tower of Pisa, Big Ben?</p>    <p><strong>Enamel</strong> <strong>Eiffel Tower earrings, \u00a34.99<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/964783121/french-eiffel-tower-drop-earrings-for\"><sub>etsy.com</sub></a></p> <p><strong>Black Eiffel Tower earrings, \u00a35.50<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.lottieandlu.co.uk/products/eiffel-tower-solid-resin-drop-earrings-black\"><sub>lottieandlu.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Get the baseball cap du jour</strong></h2> <p>The baseball cap is back. Why not get the TikTok-approved Harris-Walz camo one, due to be in stock on the campaign website from 14 October, ready for US election crunch time.</p>    <p><strong>Harris-Walz camo cap (available in the US only from 14 October), $40<br></strong><a href=\"https://store.kamalaharris.com/harris-walz-embroidered-camo-hat/\"><sub>store.kamalaharris.com</sub></a></p> <p><strong>Customisable camo cap, from \u00a321.98<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.coreworkwear.co.uk/product/truetimber-kanati-camo-cap-6988/\"><sub>coreworkwear.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Choose a logo-free handbag</strong></h2> <p>If you can\u2019t afford a designer bag, the worst alternative is one that is trying to look designer by having a big old logo and lots of cheap shiny rattling hardware. Look for understated classic shapes, neat seaming and minimal, user-friendly detailing like adjustable straps. The Anyday range by John Lewis offers amazing value. Also recommended: M&amp;S knotted detail cross-body bag .</p>    <p><strong>Cross body bag, \u00a329.50<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/knotted-detail-cross-body-bag/p/clp60691572\"><sub>marksandspencer.com</sub></a></p>    <p><strong>Black tote bag, \u00a365<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-anyday-sia-triple-flap-tote-bag-black/p110947370\"><sub>johnlewis.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Avoid overpriced sunglasses \u2026</strong></h2> <p>Air Heart by Le Specs are my go-to sunglasses. I have never met anyone they don\u2019t suit. They are cat\u2019s eye but not retro, oversized but not overwhelming. And \u00a365 is reasonable compared with the extortionate prices of most designer sunnies.</p>    <p><strong>Cat\u2019s eye sunglasses, \u00a365<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/le-specs-womens-air-heart-cats-eye-sunglasses/tortoise/p110372721\"><sub>johnlewis.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and wear your sunnies with pearls</strong></h2> <p>Mrs Prada says so, this season. Unexpected. And very good. The shades don\u2019t need to be Prada, any black pair will do \u2026 and, no, the pearls don\u2019t have to be real.</p>    <h2><strong>Get a really nice umbrella</strong></h2> <p>The classic Original Duckhead umbrella, with its wooden duck-shaped handle, will put a smile on your face. It costs \u00a336, but is infinitely more chic than those cheap emergency buys with wonky spokes.</p>    <p><strong>Duck umbrella, \u00a336<br></strong><a href=\"https://originalduckhead.com/products/forest-green-eco-friendly-umbrella\"><sub>originalduckhead.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Let your necklace do the talking</strong></h2> <p>I almost don\u2019t want to tell you how good Boden jewellery is, because I feel like it\u2019s a well-kept fashion secret. Every season it has at least one gorgeous piece that can spice up the simplest dress. Something chunky with pearls and crystals can turbo-charge a simple sweater and jeans into a going-out look just as effectively as putting on high heels \u2013 and it\u2019s a lot more comfy. </p>    <p><strong>Pearl and crystal necklace, \u00a365<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.boden.co.uk/en-gb/mega-cluster-necklace-ivory/sty-a1843-wht\"><sub>boden.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Swap gold hoops for silver teardrops</strong></h2> <p>If your earrings look like a mini Anish Kapoor for your lobe, they\u2019re perfect. The pendulous silver teardrop is all over the high street this autumn \u2013 the ones in H&amp;M are great.</p>    <p><strong>Teardrop earrings, \u00a323.00<br></strong><a href=\"https://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.1243257002.html\"><sub>hm.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Wear your initials as earrings</strong></h2> <p>I stole this idea from a woman I saw on the tube who had three tiny letter studs in one ear spelling sex. I dialled it down to my initials, with the more vanilla JCM. If you have just one hole in each ear (really? still?) you could spell your initials that way. Just remember that the image in the mirror is reversed, so don\u2019t spell your name backwards. I love the sparkly letters by Missoma, which is one of my absolute favourite jewellery brands \u2013 the aesthetic is bang-on, and the finish and fastenings are made to last.</p>    <p><strong>Initial studs, \u00a339 each<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.missoma.com/products/pave-initial-single-stud-earring-18ct-gold-plated-vermeil-cubic-zirconia-initial-g\"><sub>missoma.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Retire your huge, old wallet</strong></h2> <p>Are you still lugging about a walloping wallet from the days when cash was king? If so, time to downsize. The Betsy &amp; Floss small leather purse is a neat 10.5cm x 8cm, with a zipped pocket for coins and slip compartments for cards and notes. Also, it looks like Mulberry, and it\u2019s \u00a325, which includes free personalisation with up to four embossed initials.</p>    <p><strong>Small leather purse, \u00a325<br></strong><a href=\"https://betsyandfloss.com/collections/purses-wallets/products/small-leather-purse\"><sub>betsyandfloss.com</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>Host a clothes swap night</strong></h2> <p>Ask your friends to bring five pieces they don\u2019t wear any more and would like to see go to a happy new home. Lay everything out, then take it in turns to pick a piece each. Free wardrobe update and fun, too. People come in different sizes, so encourage people to bring jewellery, bags and shoes as well. Happy swapping! </p>    <ul> <li><p><em>Jess Cartner-Morley is the Guardian\u2019s associate fashion editor</em></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contents\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2024/05/17/small-blue-link-embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

And I delight in sharing those finds with other style lovers. Almost everything is under \u00a3100. Now, \u00a3100 is a lot of money. But the point of this list is not to give you the cheapest possible option in any category because a list of shoddily constructed, unethically produced buys is no good to anyone. Clothes that sag and break aren\u2019t just a false economy \u2013 they add landfill to the planet and hassle to your life. Instead, I\u2019ve tried to bring you an honest list of ways to look better at a reasonable price point \u2013 just in time for autumn.

      "body": "<p>Proposals to give terminally ill people in England and Wales the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/03/mps-vote-first-time-assisted-dying-bill-uk-parliament\">right to choose to end their life</a> will be considered by MPs this month. While the public debate about moral arguments, doctors are considering the practical reality of assisted dying, as a historic change to the law appears an increasingly likely prospect.</p> <p>As public opinion on the issue has shifted in the past decade, so too has the medical perspective. In 2021 the British Medical Association voted in favour of changing its position on assisted dying from opposition to a change in the law to neutrality. Many doctors are swayed by the argument that patients should have freedom over their own bodies, including how they die when they are terminally ill. Others have ethical and pragmatic concerns or worry about how assisted dying could affect access to palliative care at a time when health inequalities are already rife.</p> <p>One question is over the criteria that could be set to decide patient eligibility. The details of the bill have not been finalised but are expected to be similar to a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3g9yvdrxzzo\">proposal in the House of Lords</a> that would allow terminally ill adults with six months or less to live to get medical help to end their own lives.</p> <p>\u201cSix months is a really tricky one to predict,\u201d said Prof Mark Taubert, a consultant in palliative medicine at Velindre University NHS trust and Cardiff University School of Medicine. \u201cI\u2019ve had it go both ways. I\u2019ve had cancer patients who I\u2019ve thought would die over a weekend, who I have seen in my clinic again five years later, but also had a patient who I\u2019ve thought would live another two years, who has deteriorated very quickly. Most doctors have come a cropper with this.\u201d</p> <p>Graham Winyard, a former NHS England medical director, also views the six-months-to-live criterion as problematic. \u201cPartly because of the difficulty in estimating a person\u2019s prognosis, but it also misses out a whole number of people who are deeply suffering,\u201d he said.</p> <p>According to Winyard, who is in favour of a change to the law, fewer than half those who have travelled to the Swiss clinic Dignitas would qualify under this criterion, which he says may exclude many patients with severe degenerative illnesses such as motor neurone disease.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re facing a downward path. You don\u2019t want to decline into gradual helplessness. There comes a point where you say you\u2019ve really had enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThat ought to be everyone\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>Others feel the six months strikes a sensible balance and say it has been workable in other jurisdictions including Oregon in the US, which has had a similar criterion since assisted dying was legalised there in 1997.</p> <p>David Bogod, a recently retired consultant anaesthetist based in Nottingham, said: \u201cPrognosis is not an exact science, of course, but doctors routinely make such assessments.\u201d</p> <p>He said concerns about prognosis often assumed that people who request assisted dying are eager to die. \u201cBut the data from Oregon and elsewhere shows us that one-third of those who receive a prescription do not ultimately use it. It seems that what they are seeking is a fallback plan to allow them to die quickly and painlessly if their suffering becomes unbearable.\u201d</p> <p>Some have highlighted the less rigorous evidence base for using medicines to bring about death. Taubert said: \u201cThese are unlicensed drugs for the purpose of killing someone.\u201d Discussing the potential for side-effects and complications may sound silly in a context where death is the desired outcome, he said, but he is concerned that without proper registries it is unclear which regimens are the most reliable and effective.</p> <p>While the BMA\u2019s position has shifted to one of neutrality, it has clear recommendations about how any law could be implemented.

      "bodyText": "Proposals to give terminally ill people in England and Wales the right to choose to end their life will be considered by MPs this month. While the public debate about moral arguments, doctors are considering the practical reality of assisted dying, as a historic change to the law appears an increasingly likely prospect. As public opinion on the issue has shifted in the past decade, so too has the medical perspective. In 2021 the British Medical Association voted in favour of changing its position on assisted dying from opposition to a change in the law to neutrality. Many doctors are swayed by the argument that patients should have freedom over their own bodies, including how they die when they are terminally ill. Others have ethical and pragmatic concerns or worry about how assisted dying could affect access to palliative care at a time when health inequalities are already rife. One question is over the criteria that could be set to decide patient eligibility. The details of the bill have not been finalised but are expected to be similar to a proposal in the House of Lords that would allow terminally ill adults with six months or less to live to get medical help to end their own lives. \u201cSix months is a really tricky one to predict,\u201d said Prof Mark Taubert, a consultant in palliative medicine at Velindre University NHS trust and Cardiff University School of Medicine. \u201cI\u2019ve had it go both ways. I\u2019ve had cancer patients who I\u2019ve thought would die over a weekend, who I have seen in my clinic again five years later, but also had a patient who I\u2019ve thought would live another two years, who has deteriorated very quickly. Most doctors have come a cropper with this.\u201d Graham Winyard, a former NHS England medical director, also views the six-months-to-live criterion as problematic. \u201cPartly because of the difficulty in estimating a person\u2019s prognosis, but it also misses out a whole number of people who are deeply suffering,\u201d he said. According to Winyard, who is in favour of a change to the law, fewer than half those who have travelled to the Swiss clinic Dignitas would qualify under this criterion, which he says may exclude many patients with severe degenerative illnesses such as motor neurone disease. \u201cYou\u2019re facing a downward path. You don\u2019t want to decline into gradual helplessness. There comes a point where you say you\u2019ve really had enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThat ought to be everyone\u2019s right.\u201d Others feel the six months strikes a sensible balance and say it has been workable in other jurisdictions including Oregon in the US, which has had a similar criterion since assisted dying was legalised there in 1997. David Bogod, a recently retired consultant anaesthetist based in Nottingham, said: \u201cPrognosis is not an exact science, of course, but doctors routinely make such assessments.\u201d He said concerns about prognosis often assumed that people who request assisted dying are eager to die. \u201cBut the data from Oregon and elsewhere shows us that one-third of those who receive a prescription do not ultimately use it. It seems that what they are seeking is a fallback plan to allow them to die quickly and painlessly if their suffering becomes unbearable.\u201d Some have highlighted the less rigorous evidence base for using medicines to bring about death. Taubert said: \u201cThese are unlicensed drugs for the purpose of killing someone.\u201d Discussing the potential for side-effects and complications may sound silly in a context where death is the desired outcome, he said, but he is concerned that without proper registries it is unclear which regimens are the most reliable and effective. While the BMA\u2019s position has shifted to one of neutrality, it has clear recommendations about how any law could be implemented. It has called for an opt-in model for doctors, so that only those who choose to participate would be expected or able to do so. The BMA also argues that assisted dying should not be integrated into existing care pathways, such that an oncologist or palliative care doctor would at a patient\u2019s request provide this as an additional part of treatment. On the question of who could provide patients with this new type of care, it is notable that the Association for Palliative Medicine \u2013 which represents those in closest contact with terminally ill patients \u2013 continues to oppose any change in the law that would license doctors to administer lethal drugs to a patient to enable them to take their own life. When surveyed in 2020, 85% of the association\u2019s membership said they would not support a change to the law and would not be willing to administer euthanasia. Taubert is among those against a change to the law, but is already preparing for the possibility. \u201cI\u2019m broadly against assisted dying, but if the public decides that\u2019s the direction we want to go in, we\u2019ll have to look at it,\u201d he said. His perspective is partly due to his own experiences in palliative care and concerns about inequality of access to good palliative care. \u201cUsually I see good deaths,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I still see bad deaths, but I\u2019m not convinced that the deaths in Switzerland are much better. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know what a good death looks like.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Your bedroom is too messy</strong></h2> <p>\u201cStudies show that <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167209352864\">clutter kills libido</a>. A messy and disorganised space can cause stress, which is not good for our sex life,\u201d says sex educator <a href=\"https://www.portiabrowncoaching.com/\">Portia Brown</a>. \u201cYou may find yourself thinking, \u2018Why haven\u2019t I put away that laundry?\u2019 instead of focusing on pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>Men\u2019s sex coach <a href=\"https://cam-fraser.com/\">Cam Fraser</a> believes the bedroom should be \u201clike a little sanctuary\u201d, free from stresses and distractions, so that you can feel instantly relaxed and ready to be intimate in it. How do you create a sexual sanctuary? Take five minutes to declutter before initiating sex \u2013 \u201cif you\u2019ve got dirty clothes on the bed or the washing has to be put away, at least put everything in a cupboard, close its door and make the bed\u201d \u2013 and don\u2019t talk shopping lists or the school pickup in bed.</p> <h2><strong>You\u2019re cuddling too much</strong></h2> <p>If one person constantly wants more cuddles, their partner can start to feel smothered. The more they pursue, the more the other can pull back from all physical affection, including sex, leading to both partners feeling more disconnected. \u201cThey end up on this merry-go-round of one person pulling back to try to widen the distance and the other trying to shrink the distance,\u201d says Natasha Silverman, a sex and relationships therapist for <a href=\"https://www.relate.org.uk/\">Relate</a>. \u201c It\u2019s a really unhealthy cycle for both people and it can feel very emotionally damaging for the person who needs more connection.\u201d If you can relate to this, Silverman promises \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong, you\u2019re not broken and the relationship is probably OK \u2013 you\u2019re going through a very normal process\u201d.</p> <p>There is, after all, no right way or amount to cuddle. \u201cIt\u2019s completely subjective,\u201d she says. Plus, some partners may find that the more comfortable they become in a relationship, the less they want to&nbsp;cuddle and even have sex. It\u2019s what is known as the intimacy-desire paradox. \u201cAfter the honeymoon stage, sex often starts to take a dive. When we talk to&nbsp;couples, it often emerges that they\u2019ve started to replicate a family dynamic. Living together, washing each other\u2019s clothes and cooking dinner conjures up&nbsp;a lot of family memories.\u201d Once this happens, physical and sexual touch can feel a bit unappealing. \u201cI have a client who got really upset when her partner stroked her hair while they were watching telly on the sofa. She freaked out and said, \u2018That\u2019s when my dad used to stroke my hair!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>To avoid this, when you initiate cuddles with your partner, ask: \u201cIs this OK? Do you like this?\u201d If you notice that your desire for cuddles is causing tension, step back and give your partner more room to pursue you. Silverman adds: \u201cThe way we initiate affection is often replicated in the way we initiate sex. So if you can nail this when it comes to cuddles, you can break the cycle when it comes to sex as well.\u201d</p>    <h2><strong>Your \u2018sexual currency\u2019 is low</strong></h2> <p>Any erotic-feeling kisses, suggestive glances and touches which happen outside sex are \u201csexual currency\u201d \u2013 a term coined by Karen Gurney, a clinical psychologist and author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/mind-the-gap-9781472267139\">Mind the Gap</a> and <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-not-to-let-having-kids-ruin-your-sex-life-9781035405114\">How Not to Let Having Kids Ruin Your Sex Life</a>. \u201cSexual currency creates a current or charge between partners,\u201d says Miranda Christophers, a sex and relationships psychotherapist and clinical director at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thetherapyyard.co.uk/therapists/miranda-christophers/\">The Therapy Yard</a>. Most importantly, it builds \u201can&nbsp;intimate bond and connection between sexual partners in a way that differs from relationships with others.\u201d Not having enough of it can dampen your sexual confidence and desire.</p> <p>If the idea of introducing more sexual touch outside the bedroom feels awkward, think about what kinds of flirting have felt natural or familiar to you in the past and what your partner has been receptive to, and slowly reintroduce these. \u201cIt may just be one or two things, but as you notice their receptiveness you may feel more comfortable and confident by trying different things,\u201d Christophers says. For some, it may feel easier to intentionally increase the flirty vibes together: \u201cIt could be a light conversation about what each of you may enjoy and be receptive to, which may help to break down any barriers in initiating things such as touch, kissing and flirtation.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>You\u2019re not initiating in the right way</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for me to see people who \u2018invite each other in\u2019 to sex in a way that doesn\u2019t work so well for their partner,\u201d says Gurney. \u201cPerhaps the way they do it leaves their partner cold, or doesn\u2019t act as a trigger to kickstart their desire.\u201d There are endless ways to initiate, from a subtle hand on the thigh to a suggestive joke. But Gurney says people rarely tell each other what their preferred initiation style is. Often, they\u2019ll use the same method every time whether it gets the desired result or not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/sep/17/i-havent-had-sex-with-my-partner-since-his-affair-we-still-share-a-bed-but-i-want-more\">I haven\u2019t had sex with my partner since his affair. We still share a bed \u2013 but I want more</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Problems can also arise when one person always&nbsp;takes the initiator role. \u201cA lot of people want&nbsp;to feel desired, but desire isn\u2019t just when you\u2019re between the sheets; it\u2019s in the initiation,\u201d says Oloni, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-big-o-9780008524142\">The Big O</a>. \u201cIf only one person initiates, the other might start to think, \u2018Do you even find me attractive? Do you yearn for me the way I yearn for you?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re not sure whether your initiation style is working for your partner,<strong> </strong>talk to them about how you currently initiate, and how often. Ask if there are other methods which would work better for them, hear them out and be open to any changes they suggest.</p> <h2><strong>Your pet is getting in the way</strong></h2> <p>\u201cGiven that attention is so crucial for sex, anything that disrupts it \u2013 like noticing the dog has jumped on to the bed \u2013 can really get in the way of our sexual response,\u201d Gurney says. This affects many of her clients, especially those having casual sexual partners who \u201cmay not expect a pet to be a spectator when they go to somebody\u2019s home to have sex for the first time.\u201d</p> <p>For first-time encounters, minimise surprises by asking pet-owning partners about their bedroom policy before you head there. Those in relationships should set bedroom boundaries together. Christophers says these will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/01/you-be-the-judge-should-my-girlfriends-dog-stop-sleeping-in-our-bed\">differ from person to person</a>. \u201cFor some, boundaries may involve not having pets in the room when having sex, which may involve closing doors,\u201d she says. For others, they may agree to a policy of bedrooms (or beds) being pet-free spaces.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes small distractions \u2013 like a dog yapping at the door when you\u2019re having sex \u2013 are unavoidable. Agree with your partner on how you will tend to the cause of the distraction (if you need&nbsp;to) and then reconnect with the sexual intimacy. Rather than trying to restart where you were before you left the&nbsp;room, allow time to relax and reconnect with feelings of pleasure to get back&nbsp;into the flow.\u201d If boundaries seem difficult to&nbsp;maintain because you\u2019re struggling with introducing and training the&nbsp;pet, speak to a pet&nbsp;behaviour expert for advice.</p>    <h2><strong>You\u2019re exercising too much</strong></h2> <p>\u201cPeople who do lengthy and gruelling workouts <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28195945/\">report lower libidos</a> on average than those who do light-to-moderate workouts,\u201d says Justin Lehmiller, research fellow at the <a href=\"https://kinseyinstitute.org/\">Kinsey Institute</a> and host of the <a href=\"https://www.sexandpsychology.com/podcasts/\">Sex and Psychology Podcast</a>. \u201cFrequent strenuous workouts can cause fatigue and hormonal disruptions, both of which can be a real mood killer.\u201d</p> <p>If you really enjoy hardcore workouts, try spacing&nbsp;them out a bit. \u201cAlternate them with some moderate-intensity days, and be sure to take rest days here and&nbsp;there,\u201d says Lehmiller. If you work out&nbsp;very frequently, it\u2019s important to watch for signs that you&nbsp;might be overdoing it to avoid injury and maintain a healthy sex life.</p> <p>\u201cWhat counts as \u2018too much\u2019 strenuous exercise is&nbsp;different for everyone because our bodies all differ,\u201d he adds. \u201cPay attention to things like chronic&nbsp;fatigue and low energy, negative changes in&nbsp;mood (depression or irritability), a drop in your sex drive, prolonged pain and sleep disruptions. These are all potential indicators that you might be&nbsp;pushing yourself too hard and that it\u2019s time to scale back.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>You\u2019re waiting until after dinner to have sex</strong></h2> <p>Dinner then sex, that\u2019s the rule, right? Wrong, says <a href=\"https://www.joanprice.com\">Joan Price</a>, a sex educator and author of <a href=\"https://joanprice.com/books/naked-at-our-age\">Naked at Our Age: Talking Out Loud About Senior Sex</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to get aroused and reach orgasm when blood flow is going to our digestive system instead of our genitals.\u201d This is true for everyone, but it\u2019s especially pertinent as you age.</p> <p>\u201cHave sex when your energy level is high, such as&nbsp;the morning or afternoon,\u201d says Price, \u201cand definitely before your main meal, not after. If your schedule doesn\u2019t allow for daytime sex, that\u2019s what weekends are for!\u201d If evenings are the only time&nbsp;you have together, either try to squeeze in sex before dinner or give yourselves time to digest before you initiate.</p> <h2><strong>Your blood pressure is high</strong></h2> <p>High blood pressure can also limit the blood flow to the genitals. \u201cIn the clitoris and vagina, this can lead to a lack of lubrication, sensitivity and make it <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9143081/\">more difficult to orgasm</a>. For men, it makes it difficult to get and keep erections,\u201d says Dr Shirin Lakhani, a former GP and now <a href=\"https://drshirinlakhani.co.uk/\">aesthetic physician</a>. It can also lower your testosterone \u2013 a hormone that\u2019s \u201ccritical for libido\u201d according to Dr Emilia Pasiah, a family physician in Los Angeles.</p> <p>Lower your blood pressure by adopting a healthy, balanced diet and eating less salt \u2013 or talking to your&nbsp;doctor about medication. Increasing physical activity, limiting alcohol and quitting smoking can also help.</p> <h2><strong>You\u2019re trying to be too adventurous</strong></h2> <p>Take baby steps when you try new sex acts or positions, says Emily Jamea, a sex and relationship therapist and author of <a href=\"https://emilyjamea.com/anatomy-of-desire/\">Anatomy of Desire: Five Secrets to Create Connection and Cultivate Passion</a>. \u201cIf something\u2019s too far outside our comfort zone, we\u2019re going to get a rush of stress hormones. This&nbsp;makes us feel anxious, inhibited and shuts us&nbsp;down.\u201d </p> <p>Jamea suggests making \u201cYes, no, maybe\u201d sex lists separately, then comparing notes and identifying any areas where your interests overlap. Start by ticking off the least-intimidating activities on the list and work your way up to the bigger ones, together.</p> <h2><strong>You don\u2019t have a </strong><strong>\u2018sexual growth</strong><strong>\u2019 mindset</strong></h2> <p>\u201cA sexual growth mindset assumes that we and our partners can learn new things and want to change, to grow, to become better lovers,\u201d says Joan Price. \u201cThe opposite is thinking that a partner\u2019s sexual behaviour is static because people are who they are.\u201d One problem with not having this mindset is that \u201cyou\u2019re less motivated to figure out how to have those deep conversations about the kind of sex you\u2019d&nbsp;both rather be having\u201d.</p> <p>By regularly having ongoing conversations about your sex life, you\u2019ll keep sexual growth at the forefront of your mind and relationship. To check in with your partner, say: \u201cI really enjoy our sex, but is there anything else that would make it even better for you?\u201d</p> <p>This may feel uncomfortable, but Price says that \u201cas you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/20/start-low-and-go-slow-how-to-talk-to-your-partner-about-sex\">practise talking about sex together</a>, the awkwardness will dissipate and it will just become a&nbsp;natural part of your relationship.\u201d</p> <p>You could also prep in advance. \u201cSpend some time thinking about what you want to share or ask your partner, or get your thoughts down on paper. You may even want to speak to a friend about it.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>You\u2019re not having enough new experiences outside sex</strong></h2> <p>Partners who share new, non-sexual experiences are <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-47337-001\">36 times more likely</a> to have sex than those who don\u2019t. \u201cWhen you connect with different parts of yourself and experience excitement and joy outside the pattern of daily life, you\u2019re able to inject more erotic energy into your life,\u201d says Silverman. Snuggling on the sofa in your pyjamas is great some of the time, but if it\u2019s all you ever do \u201cyou\u2019re probably going to struggle to find that same degree of excitement and passion to inject into your sex life.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/sep/21/this-is-how-we-do-it-i-felt-betrayed-when-i-found-his-viagra-were-his-issues-my-fault\">This is how we do it: \u2018I felt betrayed when I found his Viagra. Were his issues my fault?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Silverman appreciates this isn\u2019t always easy to do. \u201cIt can feel vulnerable and exposing, particularly if our partner\u2019s reaction is hard to predict. And when we tell our loved ones that we\u2019d like something new or different, it can easily land with them as \u2018criticism\u2019, which can make them take a defensive stance, or even shut down entirely. To avoid this, lead with what\u2019s working well and invite your partner in. For example, \u2018I love trying new things with you. Do you want to do something like that again?\u2019. You can also think of every criticism as an unmet wish. \u2018We never try new things together\u2019 would understandably land as a criticism. Instead, state the unmet wish: \u2018It would mean a lot to me if we could share new experiences. What do you think?\u2019\u201d</p> <h2><strong>You\u2019re not open to receiving feedback</strong></h2> <p>As well as expressing what you want, good sexual communication is about welcoming your partner\u2019s feedback, Price says. \u201cYou could have great bedroom skills, but everyone is different, and your current partner is unlikely to react the way your last one did to the same technique or timing.\u201d Being open to hearing feedback (and, crucially, acting on it) will ultimately make sex better. If you master this, \u201cyou\u2019ll become a better lover for this person, and they\u2019ll want more sex with you\u201d.</p> <p>Don\u2019t get defensive, shut down or lash out when your partner shares their guidance. Instead, remain curious and ask for more detail so you know exactly how to put it into action.</p> <p>If you find it awkward to ask for feedback, Price suggests saying this before you have sex: \u201cHow would you like me to pleasure you today?\u201d or, \u201cTell me what you\u2019re in the mood for today.\u201d She adds: \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to learn to talk with a partner about the kind of sex you both want, and it will enrich the sexual experience \u2013 and your emotional intimacy \u2013 dramatically.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "Your bedroom is too messy \u201cStudies show that clutter kills libido. A messy and disorganised space can cause stress, which is not good for our sex life,\u201d says sex educator Portia Brown. \u201cYou may find yourself thinking, \u2018Why haven\u2019t I put away that laundry?\u2019 instead of focusing on pleasure.\u201d Men\u2019s sex coach Cam Fraser believes the bedroom should be \u201clike a little sanctuary\u201d, free from stresses and distractions, so that you can feel instantly relaxed and ready to be intimate in it. How do you create a sexual sanctuary? Take five minutes to declutter before initiating sex \u2013 \u201cif you\u2019ve got dirty clothes on the bed or the washing has to be put away, at least put everything in a cupboard, close its door and make the bed\u201d \u2013 and don\u2019t talk shopping lists or the school pickup in bed. You\u2019re cuddling too much If one person constantly wants more cuddles, their partner can start to feel smothered. The more they pursue, the more the other can pull back from all physical affection, including sex, leading to both partners feeling more disconnected. \u201cThey end up on this merry-go-round of one person pulling back to try to widen the distance and the other trying to shrink the distance,\u201d says Natasha Silverman, a sex and relationships therapist for Relate. \u201c It\u2019s a really unhealthy cycle for both people and it can feel very emotionally damaging for the person who needs more connection.\u201d If you can relate to this, Silverman promises \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong, you\u2019re not broken and the relationship is probably OK \u2013 you\u2019re going through a very normal process\u201d. There is, after all, no right way or amount to cuddle. \u201cIt\u2019s completely subjective,\u201d she says. Plus, some partners may find that the more comfortable they become in a relationship, the less they want to cuddle and even have sex. It\u2019s what is known as the intimacy-desire paradox. \u201cAfter the honeymoon stage, sex often starts to take a dive. When we talk to couples, it often emerges that they\u2019ve started to replicate a family dynamic. Living together, washing each other\u2019s clothes and cooking dinner conjures up a lot of family memories.\u201d Once this happens, physical and sexual touch can feel a bit unappealing. \u201cI have a client who got really upset when her partner stroked her hair while they were watching telly on the sofa. She freaked out and said, \u2018That\u2019s when my dad used to stroke my hair!\u2019\u201d To avoid this, when you initiate cuddles with your partner, ask: \u201cIs this OK? Do you like this?\u201d If you notice that your desire for cuddles is causing tension, step back and give your partner more room to pursue you. Silverman adds: \u201cThe way we initiate affection is often replicated in the way we initiate sex. So if you can nail this when it comes to cuddles, you can break the cycle when it comes to sex as well.\u201d Your \u2018sexual currency\u2019 is low Any erotic-feeling kisses, suggestive glances and touches which happen outside sex are \u201csexual currency\u201d \u2013 a term coined by Karen Gurney, a clinical psychologist and author of Mind the Gap and How Not to Let Having Kids Ruin Your Sex Life. \u201cSexual currency creates a current or charge between partners,\u201d says Miranda Christophers, a sex and relationships psychotherapist and clinical director at The Therapy Yard. Most importantly, it builds \u201can intimate bond and connection between sexual partners in a way that differs from relationships with others.\u201d Not having enough of it can dampen your sexual confidence and desire. If the idea of introducing more sexual touch outside the bedroom feels awkward, think about what kinds of flirting have felt natural or familiar to you in the past and what your partner has been receptive to, and slowly reintroduce these. \u201cIt may just be one or two things, but as you notice their receptiveness you may feel more comfortable and confident by trying different things,\u201d Christophers says. For some, it may feel easier to intentionally increase the flirty vibes together: \u201cIt could be a light conversation about what each of you may enjoy and be receptive to, which may help to break down any barriers in initiating things such as touch, kissing and flirtation.\u201d You\u2019re not initiating in the right way \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for me to see people who \u2018invite each other in\u2019 to sex in a way that doesn\u2019t work so well for their partner,\u201d says Gurney. \u201cPerhaps the way they do it leaves their partner cold, or doesn\u2019t act as a trigger to kickstart their desire.\u201d There are endless ways to initiate, from a subtle hand on the thigh to a suggestive joke. But Gurney says people rarely tell each other what their preferred initiation style is. Often, they\u2019ll use the same method every time whether it gets the desired result or not. Problems can also arise when one person always takes the initiator role. \u201cA lot of people want to feel desired, but desire isn\u2019t just when you\u2019re between the sheets; it\u2019s in the initiation,\u201d says Oloni, author of The Big O. \u201cIf only one person initiates, the other might start to think, \u2018Do you even find me attractive? Do you yearn for me the way I yearn for you?\u2019\u201d If you\u2019re not sure whether your initiation style is working for your partner, talk to them about how you currently initiate, and how often. Ask if there are other methods which would work better for them, hear them out and be open to any changes they suggest. Your pet is getting in the way \u201cGiven that attention is so crucial for sex, anything that disrupts it \u2013 like noticing the dog has jumped on to the bed \u2013 can really get in the way of our sexual response,\u201d Gurney says. This affects many of her clients, especially those having casual sexual partners who \u201cmay not expect a pet to be a spectator when they go to somebody\u2019s home to have sex for the first time.\u201d For first-time encounters, minimise surprises by asking pet-owning partners about their bedroom policy before you head there. Those in relationships should set bedroom boundaries together. Christophers says these will differ from person to person. \u201cFor some, boundaries may involve not having pets in the room when having sex, which may involve closing doors,\u201d she says. For others, they may agree to a policy of bedrooms (or beds) being pet-free spaces. \u201cSometimes small distractions \u2013 like a dog yapping at the door when you\u2019re having sex \u2013 are unavoidable. Agree with your partner on how you will tend to the cause of the distraction (if you need to) and then reconnect with the sexual intimacy. Rather than trying to restart where you were before you left the room, allow time to relax and reconnect with feelings of pleasure to get back into the flow.\u201d If boundaries seem difficult to maintain because you\u2019re struggling with introducing and training the pet, speak to a pet behaviour expert for advice. You\u2019re exercising too much \u201cPeople who do lengthy and gruelling workouts report lower libidos on average than those who do light-to-moderate workouts,\u201d says Justin Lehmiller, research fellow at the Kinsey Institute and host of the Sex and Psychology Podcast. \u201cFrequent strenuous workouts can cause fatigue and hormonal disruptions, both of which can be a real mood killer.\u201d If you really enjoy hardcore workouts, try spacing them out a bit. \u201cAlternate them with some moderate-intensity days, and be sure to take rest days here and there,\u201d says Lehmiller. If you work out very frequently, it\u2019s important to watch for signs that you might be overdoing it to avoid injury and maintain a healthy sex life. \u201cWhat counts as \u2018too much\u2019 strenuous exercise is different for everyone because our bodies all differ,\u201d he adds. \u201cPay attention to things like chronic fatigue and low energy, negative changes in mood (depression or irritability), a drop in your sex drive, prolonged pain and sleep disruptions. These are all potential indicators that you might be pushing yourself too hard and that it\u2019s time to scale back.\u201d You\u2019re waiting until after dinner to have sex Dinner then sex, that\u2019s the rule, right? Wrong, says Joan Price, a sex educator and author of Naked at Our Age: Talking Out Loud About Senior Sex. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to get aroused and reach orgasm when blood flow is going to our digestive system instead of our genitals.\u201d This is true for everyone, but it\u2019s especially pertinent as you age. \u201cHave sex when your energy level is high, such as the morning or afternoon,\u201d says Price, \u201cand definitely before your main meal, not after. If your schedule doesn\u2019t allow for daytime sex, that\u2019s what weekends are for!\u201d If evenings are the only time you have together, either try to squeeze in sex before dinner or give yourselves time to digest before you initiate. Your blood pressure is high High blood pressure can also limit the blood flow to the genitals. \u201cIn the clitoris and vagina, this can lead to a lack of lubrication, sensitivity and make it more difficult to orgasm. For men, it makes it difficult to get and keep erections,\u201d says Dr Shirin Lakhani, a former GP and now aesthetic physician. It can also lower your testosterone \u2013 a hormone that\u2019s \u201ccritical for libido\u201d according to Dr Emilia Pasiah, a family physician in Los Angeles. Lower your blood pressure by adopting a healthy, balanced diet and eating less salt \u2013 or talking to your doctor about medication. Increasing physical activity, limiting alcohol and quitting smoking can also help. You\u2019re trying to be too adventurous Take baby steps when you try new sex acts or positions, says Emily Jamea, a sex and relationship therapist and author of Anatomy of Desire: Five Secrets to Create Connection and Cultivate Passion. \u201cIf something\u2019s too far outside our comfort zone, we\u2019re going to get a rush of stress hormones. This makes us feel anxious, inhibited and shuts us down.\u201d Jamea suggests making \u201cYes, no, maybe\u201d sex lists separately, then comparing notes and identifying any areas where your interests overlap. Start by ticking off the least-intimidating activities on the list and work your way up to the bigger ones, together. You don\u2019t have a \u2018sexual growth\u2019 mindset \u201cA sexual growth mindset assumes that we and our partners can learn new things and want to change, to grow, to become better lovers,\u201d says Joan Price. \u201cThe opposite is thinking that a partner\u2019s sexual behaviour is static because people are who they are.\u201d One problem with not having this mindset is that \u201cyou\u2019re less motivated to figure out how to have those deep conversations about the kind of sex you\u2019d both rather be having\u201d. By regularly having ongoing conversations about your sex life, you\u2019ll keep sexual growth at the forefront of your mind and relationship. To check in with your partner, say: \u201cI really enjoy our sex, but is there anything else that would make it even better for you?\u201d This may feel uncomfortable, but Price says that \u201cas you practise talking about sex together, the awkwardness will dissipate and it will just become a natural part of your relationship.\u201d You could also prep in advance. \u201cSpend some time thinking about what you want to share or ask your partner, or get your thoughts down on paper. You may even want to speak to a friend about it.\u201d You\u2019re not having enough new experiences outside sex Partners who share new, non-sexual experiences are 36 times more likely to have sex than those who don\u2019t. \u201cWhen you connect with different parts of yourself and experience excitement and joy outside the pattern of daily life, you\u2019re able to inject more erotic energy into your life,\u201d says Silverman. Snuggling on the sofa in your pyjamas is great some of the time, but if it\u2019s all you ever do \u201cyou\u2019re probably going to struggle to find that same degree of excitement and passion to inject into your sex life.\u201d Silverman appreciates this isn\u2019t always easy to do. \u201cIt can feel vulnerable and exposing, particularly if our partner\u2019s reaction is hard to predict. And when we tell our loved ones that we\u2019d like something new or different, it can easily land with them as \u2018criticism\u2019, which can make them take a defensive stance, or even shut down entirely. To avoid this, lead with what\u2019s working well and invite your partner in. For example, \u2018I love trying new things with you. Do you want to do something like that again?\u2019. You can also think of every criticism as an unmet wish. \u2018We never try new things together\u2019 would understandably land as a criticism. Instead, state the unmet wish: \u2018It would mean a lot to me if we could share new experiences. What do you think?\u2019\u201d You\u2019re not open to receiving feedback As well as expressing what you want, good sexual communication is about welcoming your partner\u2019s feedback, Price says. \u201cYou could have great bedroom skills, but everyone is different, and your current partner is unlikely to react the way your last one did to the same technique or timing.\u201d Being open to hearing feedback (and, crucially, acting on it) will ultimately make sex better. If you master this, \u201cyou\u2019ll become a better lover for this person, and they\u2019ll want more sex with you\u201d. Don\u2019t get defensive, shut down or lash out when your partner shares their guidance. Instead, remain curious and ask for more detail so you know exactly how to put it into action. If you find it awkward to ask for feedback, Price suggests saying this before you have sex: \u201cHow would you like me to pleasure you today?\u201d or, \u201cTell me what you\u2019re in the mood for today.\u201d She adds: \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to learn to talk with a partner about the kind of sex you both want, and it will enrich the sexual experience \u2013 and your emotional intimacy \u2013 dramatically.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Thursday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/03/porto-manchester-united-europa-league-match-report\">3-3 draw at Porto</a> means Manchester United have conceded 12 goals in the opening nine games of the season, and there are recurring themes: the scorer allowed a lot of space in the box, defenders not being aggressive enough, crosses being a particular problem. We analyse every goal and give each one a rating out of five for awfulness. We\u2019ve not included the Community Shield as that was only partly competitive. You might want to look away, Erik \u2026</p> \n<h2>Danny Welbeck, Brighton (3/5)</h2> \n<p>Jo\u00e3o Pedro produced a dangerous cross from deep on the right under no pressure, which Harry Maguire decided against dealing with, allowing the ball to reach Kaoru Mitoma completely unmarked. The Japan winger had time inside the penalty area to take a touch and see Danny Welbeck standing alone on the edge of the six-yard box. Mitoma found Welbeck, who slid the ball into an almost empty net to score against his former club.</p> \n<h2>Jo\u00e3o Pedro, Brighton (4/5)</h2> \n<p>After United had failed to clear an injury-time corner, Brighton came back at their opponents, not that Ten Hag\u2019s side had much to worry about given they had 10 players inside their own box. The ball was worked back to Simon<strong> </strong>Adingra, who had space to chip a cross to the back post where there were two unmarked blue and white shirts waiting, including Jo\u00e3o Pedro, who kept calm and headed into the corner from five yards to earn Fabian H\u00fcrzeler\u2019s men a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/24/brighton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">2-1 victory</a>. Matthijs de Ligt, Scott McTominay and Lisandro Mart\u00ednez were marking space and, despite all their experience, had no knowledge of their surroundings.</p> \n<h2>Luis D\u00edaz, Liverpool (5/5)</h2> \n<p>Casemiro is one of the most experienced central midfielders in world football but he learned something new on the first day of September: playing a first-time pass to Ryan Gravenberch is incredibly stupid. The Brazilian\u2019s misdirection quickly gave Liverpool a five on three advantage with United unable to cope with the speed of the transition, hindered by their full-backs being high up the pitch expecting an attack. Gravenberch found Mohamed Salah, who chipped the ball to the back post where Dominik Szoboszlai and Luis D\u00edaz had been afforded most of the penalty area to set up camp and from where the Colombian eventually directed a header beyond Andr\u00e9 Onana.</p> \n<h2>Luis D\u00edaz, Liverpool (4/5)</h2> \n<p>Lightning does not strike twice \u2026 unless you are Casemiro, who was also at fault for Liverpool\u2019s second goal in their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/sep/01/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">3-0 win</a> at Old Trafford. The Brazilian was dispossessed by D\u00edaz and Liverpool transitioned in a flash. United actually had the numerical advantage this time but, despite this, D\u00edaz was left alone on the penalty spot, slap bang between De Ligt and Mart\u00ednez, who clearly did not want to disturb the Colombian\u2019s plans. Salah was allowed to slip the ball to his South American teammate, who spun on the spot before firing into the bottom corner of Onana\u2019s net. Casemiro, in an act of necessary mercy, was removed at half-time.</p> \n<h2>Mohamed Salah, Liverpool (3/5)</h2> \n<p>With Casemiro off the pitch, Kobbie Mainoo showed he has learned a thing or two from his teammate by being easily brushed aside by Alexis Mac Allister. With Noussair Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot high again, the Argentina midfielder found Szoboszlai, who was part of a four-man attack against United\u2019s two centre-backs. Dalot did his best to race back but Salah produced a wonderful first-time finish into the near corner. Once again it was a case of United losing the ball in their own half. To do it once in a match is unfortunate, twice is sloppy and a third time is plain incompetent.</p> \n<h2>Sam Lammers, FC Twente (4/5)</h2> \n<p>Giving the ball away when facing your own goal is only going to cause your team problems. Christian Eriksen found that out the hard way when he turned inside, not expecting Sam Lammers to come racing up to dispossess him. Mart\u00ednez was a long way up the pitch, forcing Maguire to cover him, but he completely missed a tackle on Bart van Rooij, leaving both centre-backs out of position and a gaping hole for Lammers to run into. The former Rangers man gave Onana the eye and smashed his shot in at the near post to secure a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/25/manchester-united-twente-europa-league-match-report\">1-1 draw</a> for the Dutch side at Old Trafford.</p> \n<h2>Brennan Johnson, Tottenham (5/5)</h2> \n<p>Micky van de Ven was recently credited as the fastest player in the Premier League. It helped his case that United allowed the defender to get up to his full speed by galloping 60 yards unopposed. The Dutchman won the ball in his own half and sprinted forward while everyone in red backed off, allowing him to reach the byline and deliver a cross to the back post where Brennan Johnson \u2013 and you really will not be surprised to hear this \u2013 was completely unmarked. Dalot was alongside the Wales international on the halfway line when he started his run but decided against keeping up with him.</p> \n<h2>Dejan Kulusevski, Tottenham (4/5)</h2> \n<p>Mart\u00ednez was left on the floor after failing to intercept Dominic Solanke\u2019s header on the halfway line, leaving United a man light. Johnson collected the loose ball and sprinted into open space on the right wing as Dalot, again, was awol, making his way into the box where De Ligt\u2019s attempt to block the cross came far too late. Johnson picked out the unmarked Dejan Kulusevski, who jabbed home from six yards. United were down to 10 men at this point but it was once again far too easy for Spurs to move through the gears and score unopposed.</p> \n<h2>Dominic Solanke, Tottenham (4/5)</h2> \n<p>Lucas Bergvall swung a corner to the near post, which Pape Sarr flicked for Dominic Solanke to turn in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/29/manchester-united-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">for 3-0</a>, the striker having wandered through untracked from a few yards out. A classic corner routine and a clear illustration of the disorganisation that has come to characterise United\u2019s defending.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Pep\u00ea, Porto (4/5)</h2> \n<p>Two goals ahead and nothing to worry about \u2013 unless you are Erik ten Hag\u2019s Manchester United. Zero pressure on the ball allowed Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio to whip in a dangerous cross. Mazraoui, to be fair, won the first header but in doing so forced Onana into a save. Mart\u00ednez was on his heels and did not react, allowing Pep\u00ea to nod in the rebound from close range. No pressure, no marking, limited hope.</p> \n<h2>Samu, Porto (3/5)</h2> \n<p>Again, a problem with crosses. United did not deal with the original delivery, resulting in another unchallenged delivery from Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio. On the upside, Samu was not left in acres of space; instead he had to overpower De Ligt in order to head home from a few yards out. The Dutchman threw out his arms in despair but he knew he had not been up to the task.</p> \n<h2>Samu, Porto (4/5)</h2> \n<p>Pep\u00ea did as he wished between left-back and centre-back. Mart\u00ednez tried to go over to cover but was outpaced, allowing the Porto wide forward to get into the box and pull the ball back for Samu who, once again, was too quick and too smart for De Ligt at the near post, steering home with limited fuss to make it 3-2 to the hosts. Only Maguire\u2019s late header prevented yet another embarrassing loss for Ten Hag, but that wait may not be long with a trip to Aston Villa next up on Sunday.</p>",

The ball was worked back to Simon Adingra, who had space to chip a cross to the back post where there were two unmarked blue and white shirts waiting, including Jo\u00e3o Pedro, who kept calm and headed into the corner from five yards to earn Fabian H\u00fcrzeler\u2019s men a 2-1 victory. Matthijs de Ligt, Scott McTominay and Lisandro Mart\u00ednez were marking space and, despite all their experience, had no knowledge of their surroundings. Luis D\u00edaz, Liverpool (5/5) Casemiro is one of the most experienced central midfielders in world football but he learned something new on the first day of September: playing a first-time pass to Ryan Gravenberch is incredibly stupid. The Brazilian\u2019s misdirection quickly gave Liverpool a five on three advantage with United unable to cope with the speed of the transition, hindered by their full-backs being high up the pitch expecting an attack. Gravenberch found Mohamed Salah, who chipped the ball to the back post where Dominik Szoboszlai and Luis D\u00edaz had been afforded most of the penalty area to set up camp and from where the Colombian eventually directed a header beyond Andr\u00e9 Onana. Luis D\u00edaz, Liverpool (4/5) Lightning does not strike twice \u2026 unless you are Casemiro, who was also at fault for Liverpool\u2019s second goal in their 3-0 win at Old Trafford. The Brazilian was dispossessed by D\u00edaz and Liverpool transitioned in a flash. United actually had the numerical advantage this time but, despite this, D\u00edaz was left alone on the penalty spot, slap bang between De Ligt and Mart\u00ednez, who clearly did not want to disturb the Colombian\u2019s plans. Salah was allowed to slip the ball to his South American teammate, who spun on the spot before firing into the bottom corner of Onana\u2019s net. Casemiro, in an act of necessary mercy, was removed at half-time. Mohamed Salah, Liverpool (3/5) With Casemiro off the pitch, Kobbie Mainoo showed he has learned a thing or two from his teammate by being easily brushed aside by Alexis Mac Allister. With Noussair Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot high again, the Argentina midfielder found Szoboszlai, who was part of a four-man attack against United\u2019s two centre-backs. Dalot did his best to race back but Salah produced a wonderful first-time finish into the near corner. Once again it was a case of United losing the ball in their own half. To do it once in a match is unfortunate, twice is sloppy and a third time is plain incompetent. Sam Lammers, FC Twente (4/5) Giving the ball away when facing your own goal is only going to cause your team problems. Christian Eriksen found that out the hard way when he turned inside, not expecting Sam Lammers to come racing up to dispossess him. Mart\u00ednez was a long way up the pitch, forcing Maguire to cover him, but he completely missed a tackle on Bart van Rooij, leaving both centre-backs out of position and a gaping hole for Lammers to run into. The former Rangers man gave Onana the eye and smashed his shot in at the near post to secure a 1-1 draw for the Dutch side at Old Trafford. Brennan Johnson, Tottenham (5/5) Micky van de Ven was recently credited as the fastest player in the Premier League. It helped his case that United allowed the defender to get up to his full speed by galloping 60 yards unopposed. The Dutchman won the ball in his own half and sprinted forward while everyone in red backed off, allowing him to reach the byline and deliver a cross to the back post where Brennan Johnson \u2013 and you really will not be surprised to hear this \u2013 was completely unmarked. Dalot was alongside the Wales international on the halfway line when he started his run but decided against keeping up with him. Dejan Kulusevski, Tottenham (4/5) Mart\u00ednez was left on the floor after failing to intercept Dominic Solanke\u2019s header on the halfway line, leaving United a man light. Johnson collected the loose ball and sprinted into open space on the right wing as Dalot, again, was awol, making his way into the box where De Ligt\u2019s attempt to block the cross came far too late. Johnson picked out the unmarked Dejan Kulusevski, who jabbed home from six yards. United were down to 10 men at this point but it was once again far too easy for Spurs to move through the gears and score unopposed. Dominic Solanke, Tottenham (4/5) Lucas Bergvall swung a corner to the near post, which Pape Sarr flicked for Dominic Solanke to turn in for 3-0, the striker having wandered through untracked from a few yards out. A classic corner routine and a clear illustration of the disorganisation that has come to characterise United\u2019s defending. Pep\u00ea, Porto (4/5) Two goals ahead and nothing to worry about \u2013 unless you are Erik ten Hag\u2019s Manchester United. Zero pressure on the ball allowed Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio to whip in a dangerous cross. Mazraoui, to be fair, won the first header but in doing so forced Onana into a save. Mart\u00ednez was on his heels and did not react, allowing Pep\u00ea to nod in the rebound from close range. No pressure, no marking, limited hope. Samu, Porto (3/5) Again, a problem with crosses. United did not deal with the original delivery, resulting in another unchallenged delivery from Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio. On the upside, Samu was not left in acres of space; instead he had to overpower De Ligt in order to head home from a few yards out. The Dutchman threw out his arms in despair but he knew he had not been up to the task. Samu, Porto (4/5) Pep\u00ea did as he wished between left-back and centre-back. Mart\u00ednez tried to go over to cover but was outpaced, allowing the Porto wide forward to get into the box and pull the ball back for Samu who, once again, was too quick and too smart for De Ligt at the near post, steering home with limited fuss to make it 3-2 to the hosts. Only Maguire\u2019s late header prevented yet another embarrassing loss for Ten Hag, but that wait may not be long with a trip to Aston Villa next up on Sunday.",

      "bodyText": "As the A-list stars assembled at the Venice film festival this autumn, there were few there more famous than Angelina Jolie, who generated Oscar buzz for her performance in Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s biopic of Maria Callas. But one of the most intriguing subplots didn\u2019t take place on the big screen \u2013 in the audience at the film\u2019s premiere, as a guest of Jolie, was Akala \u2013 the rapper, author and activist. Since Venice there\u2019s been a stream of tabloid speculation about the pair and whether or not they\u2019re are in a relationship. \u201cSources close to the pair\u201d have reportedly confirmed and denied the claims, and the question of who Akala is lingers for many film fans. Akala, born Kingslee James McLean Daley, grew up in Kentish Town, north London, son of a Scottish mother and a Jamaican father. His stepfather was the stage manager of the Hackney Empire, where Akala met Angela Davis and Hugh Masekela as a child. He attended a pan-African Saturday school for black children, which he said exposed him to \u201cblack cultural inputs\u201d from music and theatre to the writing of Walter Rodney from an early age. Akala first rose to prominence in the early 00s British rap scene as part of a socially conscious branch of hip-hop that included the likes of Ty and Lowkey. The rapper and poet was not the only person with musical talent in his family. His older sister is Ms Dynamite, the singer who melded UK garage and rap with pop and won the Mercury prize in 2002. Akala won a Mobo award himself in 2006, and in 2009 he set up a musical theatre production company called Hip-hop Shakespeare that fused two of his passions which, he has convincingly argued, have far more in common than many people recognise. In 2018 he released his debut nonfiction book, Natives \u2013 a memoir that combined social history with meditations on class, empire and its legacy in politics, culture and beyond. The book shifted perceptions on what it meant to be black and British as well as about Akala himself; turning him into a sought-after public speaker, with some calling him one of Britain\u2019s few modern public intellectuals. \u201cWhen I was a child, I couldn\u2019t imagine being a young black boy now and seeing someone like me with a woolly hat, who doesn\u2019t pronounce his t\u2019s correctly, go on Good Morning Britain and be taken seriously as an intellectual,\u201d he said shortly after Natives was released. But that is exactly what happened. The book became a bestseller and was part of a wave of literature tackling identity and the UK\u2019s relationship to its past, along with Reni-Eddo Lodge\u2019s Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race and Afua Hirsch\u2019s Brit(ish). He riffed on the power of Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s lyricism and mastery of the sciences, educated James O\u2019Brien on how racism has been woven through immigration legislation, and clashed with the far-right leader Tommy Robinson on Islamophobia. Tabloids have called him a \u201cCorbynista rapper\u201d. Having never voted in a general election, he wrote an opinion piece in the Guardian in 2017 about why he was supporting the Islington North MP. He said: \u201cFor the first time in my adult life, and perhaps for the first time in British history, someone I would consider to be a fundamentally decent human being has a chance of being elected.\u201d But his political activism stretches well beyond, and typically eschews, party politics. He has campaigned on rethinking how knife crime and its causes are reported on, called for radical black Caribbean history to be retold, and written openly about his struggles with mixed identity. Jolie\u2019s humanitarian work has chimed with the causes Akala has taken up, and whether there is a romantic relationship or not, the speculation has brought the north Londoner and his particular brand of hip-hop-inspired intellectualism to a new audience.",

Twelve months later, with no relenting in the killings and the destruction of Gaza, with Israel spreading the conflict to the West Bank, where <a href=\"https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-225-west-bank\">more than 700</a> Palestinians have been killed, and its escalatory attacks in Lebanon and Iran, the question has only become more pertinent.</p> <p>In the course of these past 12 months many atrocities have been committed, starting with the killing by Palestinians of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/18/israeli-west-bank-strikes-gaza-death-toll-palestine-war-hamas\">1,200 Israeli soldiers and civilians</a>, followed by the Israeli army killing <a href=\"https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-2-october-2024\">more than 41,000 Palestinians</a>, including more than 17,000 women and children, <a href=\"https://pro.drc.ngo/resources/news/world-humanitarian-day-the-deadliest-year-for-aid-workers-in-gaza\">287 aid workers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ifj.org/war-in-gaza\">138 journalists</a> and media workers. This does not include those unaccounted for who remain under the rubble of the <a href=\"https://www.qna.org.qa/en/News-Area/News/2024-09/30/0083-un-66-of-buildings-in-gaza-strip-damaged\">two-thirds of Gaza\u2019s buildings</a> that have been damaged or destroyed. Here is just one detail from this 12-month war: On 25 September, Israel returned a truck containing <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-sends-scores-bodies-gaza-palestinians-demand-details-before-burying-them-2024-09-25/\">88 bodies</a> with no identifying details to Gaza.</p> <p>Israel has been under the misguided belief that it could hide these atrocities from the world by limiting access to journalists. It has not allowed outsiders to do <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/editorial/2024-09-11/ty-article-opinion/israel-must-allow-foreign-journalists-to-report-from-gaza/00000191-dd73-dd31-a9bd-ff779bf20000\">independent reporting</a> in Gaza, which has made it easier to dispute Palestinian versions of events and the figures of those killed, and the extent of the damage caused. To shed further doubt, the tremendous number of lives lost is usually accompanied by the caveat \u201cclaims the Hamas-run health ministry\u201d.</p> <p>All of this made the Israeli army callous, and it has killed large numbers of Palestinians in single airstrikes. Benjamin Netanyahu made the killing or capture of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/14/hunt-for-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-israel-prime-target\">Yahya Sinwar</a>, the Hamas leader, a prime objective of the war for which no price was deemed excessive. Rather than use precision bombs when there was intelligence on Sinwar\u2019s whereabouts, the Israeli military used 2,000lb (900kg) bombs, killing and injuring hundreds of innocent Palestinians. This has been repeated many times over this past year and has continued even after the US <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/11/us-resumes-sending-shipments-of-500-pound-bombs-to-israel\">stopped supplying Israel</a> with this type of bomb because of its use in civilian areas.</p> <p>Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, the majority of whom are refugees from towns and villages in what became Israel in 1948, have been forced to relocate multiple times; Israel has treated the population as dispensable chattels that it can move around at will. In the months since Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack, almost all of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million have been displaced from their homes.</p> <p>At the beginning of the war, I confess that I did not take seriously the initial pronouncements of Israel\u2019s hawkish leaders, such as their promise to turn Gaza into an uninhabitable desert and descriptions of Palestinians in subhuman terms. I couldn\u2019t believe that the Israelis had relegated the Palestinians to such an inferior state that they were capable of conducting this policy without a reaction from within and outside Israel. As events showed, they meant these words, and they have now left the Gaza Strip effectively uninhabitable. The dire warnings have materialised.</p> <p>What I also failed to realise was that once they were able to get away with such atrocities in Gaza, the rightwing leaders would seize their chance to follow them with similar crimes in the West Bank and now in Lebanon. And so they began destroying the infrastructure of camps and towns in the West Bank, and used drones to kill Palestinians from the air just as they are doing in Gaza.</p> <p>One development that I had high hopes for was theend of Israeli impunity with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/how-south-africas-genocide-case-against-israel-played-out-in-the-hague\">South African case against Israel</a> at The Hague. I took much cheer from the <a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20240520_the_era_of_impunity_for_israeli_decision_makers_is_over\">B\u2019Tselem press release</a> on 20 May, which stated that the \u201cera of impunity for Israel decision-makers is over\u201d. This proved to be false optimism. So far, Israeli leaders have not been deterred. I should have known better after my disappointments following decades of waging futile human rights battles against Israeli violations in the West Bank regarding the building of illegal settlements.</p> <p>For Israelis, the events of 7 October last year have become akin to what the Turkish-Cypriot psychiatrist Vamik Volkan has called a \u201cchosen trauma\u201d, which he described as an event that binds a community\u2019s sense of itself together even as it can close off the possibility of healing and making peace.</p> <p>Yet the events of 7 October are not the only \u201cchosen trauma\u201d in Israel\u2019s chequered past. Israel often narrates relations between Israelis and Palestinians as replete with traumas that are never forgotten and are used \u201cto legitimate the killing of Palestinians as an effective tool to preserve a secure Jewish state and prepare Israeli youth to be good soldiers and to carry on the practices of occupation\u201d, as Israeli professor Nurit Peled-Elhanan argued in her 2010 study <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/42889680\">Legitimation of massacres in Israeli school history books</a>.</p> <p>There is scant possibility that the Israeli population will eventually wake up and recognise the harm it has done to Palestinians past and present. In May, a Pew Research Center survey found that <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/05/30/israeli-views-of-the-israel-hamas-war/\">39% of Israelis</a> said Israel\u2019s military response against Hamas in Gaza had been about right, while 34% said it had not gone far enough and only 19% thought it had gone too far. The prospect of this public coming to its senses seems remote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/04/uk-palestinians-nightmare-watching-war-unfold-from-afar\">UK Palestinians on the nightmare of watching war unfold from afar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nor is there hope that the tide of unquestioned support for Israel by the US will be receding any time soon. Or that the US government will begin to see that unconditional support for Israel is self-defeating and injurious for Israel as well as too costly</p> <p>Yet despite all the above, the poignant fact remains that the Palestinians are the crux of the matter. After its military success in 1967, the Israeli defence minister Moshe Dayan declared: \u201cWe are now an empire.\u201d Fifty-seven years later, Israel remains unable to achieve peace because it has repeatedly refused to recognise Palestinian self-determination. Israel\u2019s perceived success at clipping the wings of Hezbollah has already made it euphoric, confirming its belief that it can proceed with destroying the Palestinians in Gaza and will have a free hand in taking over the whole of Palestine to establish Greater Israel.</p> <p>Yet after fighting on several fronts its economy is suffering and its dependence on support from the US, which it has repeatedly humiliated, remains undiminished. Soon it will become clear that Israel will have to keep on fighting one war after another and will remain a nation forever under siege if it continues on this path. Only when Israel realises that the cost of destroying the Palestinians is too high will the two nations find a way to live together in peace in our shared homeland.</p> <ul> <li><p>Raja Shehadeh is a Palestinian lawyer and writer, and founder of the human rights organisation Al-Haq.

After its military success in 1967, the Israeli defence minister Moshe Dayan declared: \u201cWe are now an empire.\u201d Fifty-seven years later, Israel remains unable to achieve peace because it has repeatedly refused to recognise Palestinian self-determination. Israel\u2019s perceived success at clipping the wings of Hezbollah has already made it euphoric, confirming its belief that it can proceed with destroying the Palestinians in Gaza and will have a free hand in taking over the whole of Palestine to establish Greater Israel. Yet after fighting on several fronts its economy is suffering and its dependence on support from the US, which it has repeatedly humiliated, remains undiminished. Soon it will become clear that Israel will have to keep on fighting one war after another and will remain a nation forever under siege if it continues on this path. Only when Israel realises that the cost of destroying the Palestinians is too high will the two nations find a way to live together in peace in our shared homeland.

The Israeli-Egyptian blockade, imposed in 2007 after Hamas\u2019s violent takeover of the territory, was suffocating, and Rimal, his middle-class neighbourhood in<strong> </strong>Gaza City<strong>,</strong> had not been spared from airstrikes in the previous wars with Israel.</p> \n<p>Despite everything, he said, his family worked hard to establish a simple, quiet existence after being expelled from their village in what is now Israel in 1948. Baroud, 48, was a lecturer in the fine arts department at Al-Aqsa University, and he, his wife, Khansa, 47, and children Rita, 21, Ilya, 18, and Maria, 14, lived in a flat in the large family building shared with his mother, his siblings and their children. A docile cat and several songbirds completed their home life.</p> \n<p>A restless sleeper, he liked to draw late at night, after everyone else had gone to bed.</p> \n<p>On 7 October 2023, that world collapsed. Following the Hamas attacks in Israel, the war arrived like \u201can earthquake that ravaged everything \u2026 Since that date, our sole mission has become trying to survive,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Over the past year, Baroud and his family have been displaced 12 times. Nowhere in Gaza is safe from airstrikes, but encroaching Israeli ground forces have forced them to flee again and again. Each move is more difficult than the last, as options and space in already overcrowded areas dwindle.</p> \n<p>His story, and his journey, is a window into the new reality of life in the strip, where 90% of the population have fled their homes \u2013 many, like the Baroud family, several times \u2013 in a war that shows no sign of stopping.</p> \n<p>Throughout it all, the artist has managed to keep drawing. Sometimes pens and paper are in short supply, and sometimes he is too exhausted from hours searching for water and food each day, but when he can he documents what his family has witnessed. He calls the series Still Alive, a way to keep communicating with the outside world.</p> \n<p>Baroud\u2019s work has always drawn on the hardships of life in Gaza, a black and white palette reflecting a grey city, where characters weave in and out of claustrophobic spaces. Now it is a record of a year of displacement, chaos and pain: aid packages that fall into the sea, tents that fail to protect from either cold or heat, hospitals that become killing zones.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe killing machine took everything, but could not take away my passion and love for drawing,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI draw to document the events and scenes we are living through \u2026 destruction, death, sorrow, siege, patience, resilience, defeat. All of these stories are important, like pieces of a mosaic, creating the overall picture.\u201d</p> \n<p>The family have narrowly escaped death several times. On the third day of the war, a neighbour ran down the road telling everyone to get out because the Israeli military had called to say an airstrike was coming \u2013 a \u201cknock on the roof\u201d practice the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have long since abandoned. The first missile damaged all six buildings on the street, leaving the artist\u2019s house still standing, but uninhabitable. The second, however, reduced his home, office and studio to rubble.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/2023map-zip/giv-4559Eg69g4nfhWIJ/\" data-alt=\"Map of Gaza Strip\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/2023map-zip/giv-4559Eg69g4nfhWIJ/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>After spending the night at a neighbour\u2019s, the Barouds left for his sister\u2019s house in Tel al-Hawa, in the south of Gaza City, where 25 family members squeezed into one flat. The next day, the group decided to follow the Israeli order to evacuate the city.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey said the south was safe \u2026 but the tanks and planes have destroyed everything. My dreams, my wife\u2019s dreams, my children\u2019s dreams, and my small world \u2026 Everything has ended. There is no future here. There is only death,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>It is almost impossible to imagine now, but a year ago, the Gaza Strip was relatively quiet. Most of the rebuilding from the last war between Hamas and Israel, in May 2021, had been completed. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/01/its-like-another-planet-crossing-the-border-from-gaza-to-work-in-israel#:~:text=A%20day%20in%20the%20life,a%20peculiar%20socio%2Deconomic%20hierarchy.\">new work visa system</a> for men from Gaza to enter Israel was making a significant difference, bringing in upwards of $1m a day to the impoverished Mediterranean territory, home to 2.2 million people.</p> \n<p>The West Bank, the other occupied Palestinian territory, had seemed more likely than Gaza to descend into war: in response to a rise in attacks on Israeli civilians, the IDF was conducting near-nightly raids on Palestinian militant groups, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/05/palestinians-reel-israel-raid-on-jenin\">worst violence in the area for 20 years</a>.</p> \n<p>Unbeknownst to everyone \u2013 including Israel\u2019s vaunted intelligence services \u2013 Hamas\u2019s military chief, Yahya Sinwar, was planning an offensive designed to upend the status quo of seemingly endless occupation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/21/saudi-arabia-getting-closer-to-normalising-relations-with-israel-crown-prince-says\">increasingly normalised</a> by the outside world.</p> \n<p>Hamas broke out of Gaza at dawn on 7 October, massacring 1,200 people, the majority of whom were civilians, and seizing another 250 as bargaining chips, according to Israeli tallies.</p> \n<p>With echoes of the US in the aftermath of 9/11, Israel\u2019s grief and fury following 7 October has fuelled what the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, calls \u201ctotal war\u201d on Gaza. The result has been total destruction.</p> \n<p>\u201cEverything I knew is gone,\u201d Baroud said. \u201cYou walk through some streets and neighbourhoods thinking really hard about the location and trying to identify the buildings, but nothing in Gaza resembles your memory now. It is all blurred and distorted.\u201d</p> \n<p>After a year of war, the Gaza in which Baroud was born and grew up no longer exists. By many measures, Gaza is already the bloodiest and most destructive conflict of the 21st century.</p> \n<p>The figures are staggering. According to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, more than 41,000 people have been killed, about 2% of the population. Though the ministry does not distinguish between militant and civilian deaths, the majority of a recently published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/17/gaza-publishes-identities-of-34344-palestinians-killed-in-war-with-israel\">list covering 80% of Palestinians killed can be identified as civilians</a> based on age and gender alone.</p> \n<p>It is unclear how many more bodies lie under the rubble of collapsed buildings or have died from disease or illness since. The war has also created a generation of orphans. The UN put the number of children without mothers at 19,000 in April, and other estimates run as high as 25,000.</p> \n<p>About 92,000 people have been injured, a number including approximately 14,000 new amputees. Anaesthetics, painkillers and prostheses are lacking owing to Israeli blocks on aid that even agencies in the US, Israel\u2019s closest ally, describe as \u201carbitrary denial, restriction and impediments\u201d.</p> \n<p>As of September, about 84% of Gaza is covered by Israeli evacuation orders, forcing 2 million people into overcrowded, unsanitary conditions in areas Israel has designated as \u201chumanitarian zones\u201d \u2013 which have been repeatedly bombed anyway.</p> \n<p>More than 70% of housing stock has been damaged, along with countless other public buildings, businesses, schools and hospitals. A total of 42m tonnes of debris lies across the territory, the UN says. Clearing the rubble, which contains human remains and unexploded ordnance, then rebuilding, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-gaza-who-will-pay-to-rebuild/\">could take 80 years, and cost more than $80bn</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-zip/giv-4559mAHdGHjjlH1h/\" data-alt=\"Map of Gaza Strip 2023\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-zip/giv-4559mAHdGHjjlH1h/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet Baroud and his family, along with millions of others, must try to find shelter and safety amid the ruins.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs a family, we managed to stay together. In some places, the situation on the ground allowed us only hours to stay, while others were relatively safe, far from tank shells but never far from airstrikes and drones,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>After leaving Gaza City on 13 October, the family walked to al-Qarara, north of Khan Younis, seeking refuge in a relative\u2019s house, until it became too crowded with displaced people and they managed to find another flat nearby.</p> \n<p>After the week-long ceasefire collapsed on 1 December, ground fighting resumed with a vengeance, and Israeli forces began moving towards central Gaza.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn that difficult night, we headed to Khan Younis, thinking we had found our final stop, but we were wrong. Within 24 hours, things took a turn for the worse and the area became dangerous, surrounded by fire, forcing us to go to Rafah,\u201d Baroud said.</p> \n<p>Rafah, the southernmost point of the strip, would be safest, the family reasoned: the Israelis could not attack an area where more than a million civilians had fled. They were wrong.</p> \n<p>Baroud\u2019s sister managed to find an empty shop in the city, where the 25 members of the family packed inside like sardines. But the bombing was still so close that clouds of dust and dirt clouded their vision and tore at their throats.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/2024map-zip/giv-45594aZcCrHaIbBT/\" data-alt=\"Map of Gaza Strip 2024\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/2024map-zip/giv-45594aZcCrHaIbBT/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>A few days later, a distant relative found the group a flat close to some aid warehouses, and a month later, they managed to rent in a building in central Rafah. Before the war, the rent would have been about $200; now it was $2,000. Pens and paper are 10 times more expensive than before.</p> \n<p>When Israel\u2019s ground assault on Rafah began in May, they were forced back to al-Qarara. \u201cWe returned to find it ravaged by tanks, missiles, most of it destroyed, the landscape disfigured,\u201d Baroud said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe searched for a long time but could not find a place, so we were forced to live in a destroyed house. We managed to repair parts of it, and after a lot of effort, it was usable.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt overlooked the smoke from the war in all directions. We slept to the sound of gunfire and woke up to the sound of artillery and tank shells.

      "bodyText": "The artist Maisara Baroud never found living in Gaza easy. The Israeli-Egyptian blockade, imposed in 2007 after Hamas\u2019s violent takeover of the territory, was suffocating, and Rimal, his middle-class neighbourhood in Gaza City, had not been spared from airstrikes in the previous wars with Israel. Despite everything, he said, his family worked hard to establish a simple, quiet existence after being expelled from their village in what is now Israel in 1948. Baroud, 48, was a lecturer in the fine arts department at Al-Aqsa University, and he, his wife, Khansa, 47, and children Rita, 21, Ilya, 18, and Maria, 14, lived in a flat in the large family building shared with his mother, his siblings and their children. A docile cat and several songbirds completed their home life. A restless sleeper, he liked to draw late at night, after everyone else had gone to bed. On 7 October 2023, that world collapsed. Following the Hamas attacks in Israel, the war arrived like \u201can earthquake that ravaged everything \u2026 Since that date, our sole mission has become trying to survive,\u201d he said. Over the past year, Baroud and his family have been displaced 12 times. Nowhere in Gaza is safe from airstrikes, but encroaching Israeli ground forces have forced them to flee again and again. Each move is more difficult than the last, as options and space in already overcrowded areas dwindle. His story, and his journey, is a window into the new reality of life in the strip, where 90% of the population have fled their homes \u2013 many, like the Baroud family, several times \u2013 in a war that shows no sign of stopping. Throughout it all, the artist has managed to keep drawing. Sometimes pens and paper are in short supply, and sometimes he is too exhausted from hours searching for water and food each day, but when he can he documents what his family has witnessed. He calls the series Still Alive, a way to keep communicating with the outside world. Baroud\u2019s work has always drawn on the hardships of life in Gaza, a black and white palette reflecting a grey city, where characters weave in and out of claustrophobic spaces. Now it is a record of a year of displacement, chaos and pain: aid packages that fall into the sea, tents that fail to protect from either cold or heat, hospitals that become killing zones. \u201cThe killing machine took everything, but could not take away my passion and love for drawing,\u201d he said. \u201cI draw to document the events and scenes we are living through \u2026 destruction, death, sorrow, siege, patience, resilience, defeat. All of these stories are important, like pieces of a mosaic, creating the overall picture.\u201d The family have narrowly escaped death several times. On the third day of the war, a neighbour ran down the road telling everyone to get out because the Israeli military had called to say an airstrike was coming \u2013 a \u201cknock on the roof\u201d practice the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have long since abandoned. The first missile damaged all six buildings on the street, leaving the artist\u2019s house still standing, but uninhabitable. The second, however, reduced his home, office and studio to rubble. After spending the night at a neighbour\u2019s, the Barouds left for his sister\u2019s house in Tel al-Hawa, in the south of Gaza City, where 25 family members squeezed into one flat. The next day, the group decided to follow the Israeli order to evacuate the city. \u201cThey said the south was safe \u2026 but the tanks and planes have destroyed everything. My dreams, my wife\u2019s dreams, my children\u2019s dreams, and my small world \u2026 Everything has ended. There is no future here. There is only death,\u201d he said. It is almost impossible to imagine now, but a year ago, the Gaza Strip was relatively quiet. Most of the rebuilding from the last war between Hamas and Israel, in May 2021, had been completed. A new work visa system for men from Gaza to enter Israel was making a significant difference, bringing in upwards of $1m a day to the impoverished Mediterranean territory, home to 2.2 million people. The West Bank, the other occupied Palestinian territory, had seemed more likely than Gaza to descend into war: in response to a rise in attacks on Israeli civilians, the IDF was conducting near-nightly raids on Palestinian militant groups, the worst violence in the area for 20 years. Unbeknownst to everyone \u2013 including Israel\u2019s vaunted intelligence services \u2013 Hamas\u2019s military chief, Yahya Sinwar, was planning an offensive designed to upend the status quo of seemingly endless occupation, increasingly normalised by the outside world. Hamas broke out of Gaza at dawn on 7 October, massacring 1,200 people, the majority of whom were civilians, and seizing another 250 as bargaining chips, according to Israeli tallies. With echoes of the US in the aftermath of 9/11, Israel\u2019s grief and fury following 7 October has fuelled what the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, calls \u201ctotal war\u201d on Gaza. The result has been total destruction. \u201cEverything I knew is gone,\u201d Baroud said. \u201cYou walk through some streets and neighbourhoods thinking really hard about the location and trying to identify the buildings, but nothing in Gaza resembles your memory now. It is all blurred and distorted.\u201d After a year of war, the Gaza in which Baroud was born and grew up no longer exists. By many measures, Gaza is already the bloodiest and most destructive conflict of the 21st century. The figures are staggering. According to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, more than 41,000 people have been killed, about 2% of the population. Though the ministry does not distinguish between militant and civilian deaths, the majority of a recently published list covering 80% of Palestinians killed can be identified as civilians based on age and gender alone. It is unclear how many more bodies lie under the rubble of collapsed buildings or have died from disease or illness since. The war has also created a generation of orphans. The UN put the number of children without mothers at 19,000 in April, and other estimates run as high as 25,000. About 92,000 people have been injured, a number including approximately 14,000 new amputees. Anaesthetics, painkillers and prostheses are lacking owing to Israeli blocks on aid that even agencies in the US, Israel\u2019s closest ally, describe as \u201carbitrary denial, restriction and impediments\u201d. As of September, about 84% of Gaza is covered by Israeli evacuation orders, forcing 2 million people into overcrowded, unsanitary conditions in areas Israel has designated as \u201chumanitarian zones\u201d \u2013 which have been repeatedly bombed anyway. More than 70% of housing stock has been damaged, along with countless other public buildings, businesses, schools and hospitals. A total of 42m tonnes of debris lies across the territory, the UN says. Clearing the rubble, which contains human remains and unexploded ordnance, then rebuilding, could take 80 years, and cost more than $80bn. Yet Baroud and his family, along with millions of others, must try to find shelter and safety amid the ruins. \u201cAs a family, we managed to stay together. In some places, the situation on the ground allowed us only hours to stay, while others were relatively safe, far from tank shells but never far from airstrikes and drones,\u201d he said. After leaving Gaza City on 13 October, the family walked to al-Qarara, north of Khan Younis, seeking refuge in a relative\u2019s house, until it became too crowded with displaced people and they managed to find another flat nearby. After the week-long ceasefire collapsed on 1 December, ground fighting resumed with a vengeance, and Israeli forces began moving towards central Gaza. \u201cOn that difficult night, we headed to Khan Younis, thinking we had found our final stop, but we were wrong. Within 24 hours, things took a turn for the worse and the area became dangerous, surrounded by fire, forcing us to go to Rafah,\u201d Baroud said. Rafah, the southernmost point of the strip, would be safest, the family reasoned: the Israelis could not attack an area where more than a million civilians had fled. They were wrong. Baroud\u2019s sister managed to find an empty shop in the city, where the 25 members of the family packed inside like sardines. But the bombing was still so close that clouds of dust and dirt clouded their vision and tore at their throats. A few days later, a distant relative found the group a flat close to some aid warehouses, and a month later, they managed to rent in a building in central Rafah. Before the war, the rent would have been about $200; now it was $2,000. Pens and paper are 10 times more expensive than before. When Israel\u2019s ground assault on Rafah began in May, they were forced back to al-Qarara. \u201cWe returned to find it ravaged by tanks, missiles, most of it destroyed, the landscape disfigured,\u201d Baroud said. \u201cWe searched for a long time but could not find a place, so we were forced to live in a destroyed house. We managed to repair parts of it, and after a lot of effort, it was usable. \u201cIt overlooked the smoke from the war in all directions. We slept to the sound of gunfire and woke up to the sound of artillery and tank shells. Death came close many times, but when the tanks came back we were forced to evacuate again.\u201d In mid-August, unable to find anywhere to stay, the family lived on the street in Deir al-Balah for a week before the ground fighting followed them. The family went back to their semi-destoyed shelter in al-Qarara a month ago, where Baroud is still drawing during his long, sleepless nights. His shapes have become sharper, more rigid; bodies that curve, bend, break and tremble. He said he would not leave a third time. The former agricultural area was relatively quiet, and the family could not afford to pay any more rent or risk becoming homeless again. \u201cIt felt like death was chasing us everywhere we went,\u201d he said. \u201cWe decided to return to al-Qarara and stay there. Death there has a more acceptable form.\u201d The artist said he would draw until the war ended, or death claimed him, whichever came first.",

A heartbreaking blend of drama and documentary, it traced the life and death of Joyce Vincent, a vibrant young woman who died and lay undiscovered in her flat for years after slipping through the cracks in an increasingly alienated, isolated society. Mixing interviews with audiotape recordings of Vincent (a powerful singer) and eyes-half-closed dramatic reconstructions, <em>Dreams of a Life </em>is a profoundly humanist work that uses cinematic invention to bring us closer to awful reality.

Loosely adapted from Martin Amis\u2019s 1997 source Night Train (which was originally earmarked for adaptation by Nic Roeg, whose son, Luc, co-produces), Out of Blue has been described by Morley as an attempt to \u201crescue the characters from the pages\u201d of the book \u2013 another tantalisingly autobiographical detail. Double-lives and dual realities interweave in a film rich with Twin Peaks-y surrealism \u2013 an adventurous spirit that alienated many critics, just as David Lynch\u2019s Fire Walk With Me baffled reviewers back in 1992. Today Fire Walk With Me is considered a misunderstood masterpiece, one of its director\u2019s finest works. One day soon, I believe the same will be true of Morley\u2019s Out of Blue. All titles in bold are widely available to stream unless otherwise specified What else I\u2019m enjoying The Coming Storm Gabriel Gatehouse\u2019s dive into America\u2019s conspiracy culture returns in a new Radio 4 series, offering a pre-election reminder of just how crazy the US has become and how deep the poisonous post-truth malaise runs. The presentation style is breezily inquisitive, but the subject matter remains alarming. The Substance Coralie Fargeat\u2019s eye-popping social satire is a rip-roaring treat, an exuberant feast of scrungy body-horror that splatters its audience with metaphors made flesh. Reports of audience walkouts merely add to the appeal \u2013 this is extreme cinema at its finest, designed to astonish and outrage in equal measure. My favourite film of the year so far.",

Israel\u2019s adversaries in the region should \u201cdouble your efforts and capabilities \u2026 and resist the aggressive enemy\u201d, Khamenei said in a rare appearance leading Friday prayers, at which he mentioned Nasrallah and called Iran\u2019s attack on Israel legal and legitimate. The semi-official Iranian news agency SNN quoted Revolutionary Guards deputy commander Ali Fadavi as saying on Friday that if Israel attacked, Iran would target Israeli energy and gas installations. The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known as Unifil, said on Saturday that it would not leave positions in the country\u2019s south despite what it said was an Israeli request to relocate from some of them. \u201cPeacekeepers remain in all positions and the UN flag continues to fly,\u201d it said. Lebanon\u2019s government says more than 2,000 people have been killed there in the past year, with most in the past two weeks. A UN spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, called the toll on civilians \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d. The Israeli military said about 70 projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israeli territory on Friday evening and were either intercepted or fell in open land. The US state department said an American was killed in Lebanon this week and Washington was working to understand the circumstances. Kamel Ahmad Jawad, from Michigan, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Tuesday, according to his daughter, a friend and the US congresswoman representing his district. Hezbollah said early on Saturday it was engaged in clashes with Israeli troops in the Lebanon border area, after earlier saying it forced Israeli soldiers to retreat there. \u201cIsraeli enemy soldiers renewed an attempt to advance towards the vicinity of the municipality in the village of Adaysseh\u201d and Hezbollah fighters confronted the attempt \u201cand clashes are continuing\u201d, the group said. Its fighters had forced Israeli troops to \u201cretreat\u201d in the same area, it said earlier. Hezbollah also said it targeted troops in south Lebanon\u2019s Yarun area with a \u201crocket salvo\u201d, as well as soldiers in two points across the border with rockets. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging near-daily cross-border fire for almost a year, with the group saying it is acting in support of Palestinian ally Hamas over the Gaza war. Israel, saying it is targeting Hezbollah in order to make Israel\u2019s northern area safe for the return of displaced people, has intensified its bombardment and this week announced its troops had started ground raids into parts of southern Lebanon.

As we move deeper into autumn, we\u2019re&nbsp;heading for one of these moments, and I\u2019ll be out in the woods trying to catch it.</p> <p>I have spent much of the past two years travelling the length of the UK and Ireland exploring our relationship with trees and woodlands for a new book. I wandered in stunning beech groves in Oxford, pinewoods in the Highlands, ancient oaks in Wicklow and Atlantic rainforest in County Clare.</p> <p>The journey started among the trees my father planted 11 years ago on his smallholding near Oswestry on the border between England and Wales. Listening to him discuss the trees he knows so well with my son, I realised how little I really understand them. I&nbsp;could name only a&nbsp;handful of tree species from their leaves \u2013 and far fewer in winter. The&nbsp;realisation sent me spinning off to explore why woodlands hold such allure for us, what they do for our health and wellbeing, and what our relationship with precious fragments of ancient woodland looks like now.</p>    <p>One of the first woodlands I visited is also one of the most heavily studied in the world. <a href=\"https://www.wythamwoods.ox.ac.uk/access\">Wytham Woods</a> in Oxford is owned and managed by Oxford University, where walkers are as likely to encounter research teams as to spot deer in the undergrowth or birds in the canopy. Trees across the 405-hectare (1,000-acre) site are festooned with all manner of gadgets that are wonders in themselves \u2013 signs of the populations of scientists who study bats, birds and beetles, or the spread of diseases such as ash dieback.</p> <p>To walk at Wytham (entry is free but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wythamwoods.ox.ac.uk/permit\">requires a&nbsp;permit</a>) is to walk through not one woodland but many, from medieval coppice woods and glorious beech groves planted to best frame a view of&nbsp;a country house, to trees around which first world war training trenches snake, and which become bright with bluebells in spring.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>On Wenlock Edge, I\u00a0wandered beneath towering ash trees as mellow autumn sunlight filtered through the leaves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/shropshire-staffordshire/wenlock-edge/things-to-do-at-wenlock-edge\">Wenlock Edge</a> in Shropshire, I&nbsp;wandered beneath towering ash trees as mellow autumn sunlight filtered through the leaves on to the limestone escarpment, glimpsing long views across the county between the trunks. Walking in Wenlock is a peaceful affair: hiking trails follow the line of the Edge, an 18-mile limestone ridge, so it would be difficult to get lost. To get a different view, though, I spent a&nbsp;night here, in reputedly the most haunted woodland in the country, trying to scare myself with ghost stories, and succeeding. Among the many stories is that of<strong> </strong>robber knight Ippikin, whose ghost is said to roam the Edge at night, pushing unwary walkers off the escarpment. As darkness fell, walking deep in a wood that had been familiar and friendly in daylight, I experienced some of what writer <a href=\"https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/sara-maitland\">Sara Maitland</a> calls \u201cforest fear\u201d, and retreated to my campervan.</p>    <p>Over and again as I travelled, I came across \u201ckeep out\u201d signs, so it was uplifting to take part in an organised trespass into a privately owned wood on Dartmoor with writer and land access campaigner Guy Shrubsole and the South Devon <a href=\"https://www.righttoroam.org.uk/\">Right to Roam</a> group. This transgressive walk ended among the ancient oaks and beeches of the lush \u2013 and entirely legally accessed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/visiting-woods/woods/dendles-wood-nnr/\">Dendles Wood</a>. This is a wonderful example of temperate rainforest, home to rare beetles. Mosses and lichens draped from the branches form&nbsp;a kind&nbsp;of green veil, inspiring a&nbsp;hushed awe. I marvelled at&nbsp;the depth of colours and the complexity of the lichens, which seemed whole worlds in themselves. </p> <p>Often small, tucked away and under threat, patches of temperate rainforest can be found across the UK\u2019s western fringes, from the ancient oaks at <a href=\"https://www.northwaleswildlifetrust.org.uk/nature-reserves/coed-crafnant-nature-reserve\">Coed</a> <a href=\"https://www.northwaleswildlifetrust.org.uk/nature-reserves/coed-crafnant-nature-reserve\">Crafnant</a> in Gwynedd to the stunning hazels at <a href=\"https://scottishwildlifetrust.org.uk/reserve/ballachuan-hazel-wood/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwreW2BhBhEiwAavLwfHGUOwqrm_R4jbG2HwmbPCjC4V2YdGef1xXo_jHSZSEuxrziuvxiRRoC-fcQAvD_BwE\">Ballachuan</a>, on the island of Seil south of Oban. To walk here is to be reminded of the natural wonders these islands offer, and I defy you not to feel protective of them after visiting one. As I wander through such ancient groves, I imagine the time when forests like these covered much of our islands. I hope we will see our way to giving more land over to these precious habitats.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>As I wander through such ancient groves, I imagine the time when forests like these covered much of our islands</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Scotland, where access rights mean one can roam on nearly all land and inland water, my hike took me from the towering conifers and rushing burns of <a href=\"https://forestryandland.gov.scot/visit/reelig-glen\">Reelig Glen</a>, through farmland and private woods to one of Scotland\u2019s first community-owned woodlands, <a href=\"https://www.abriachan.org.uk/\">Abriachan Forest Trust</a>.

      "body": "  <h2>Fawaz Gerges: We may have reached a point beyond which the international order changes for ever</h2> <p>Israel\u2019s year-long war in Gaza (and the accompanying violence perpetrated against Palestinians in the West Bank), and its ever-expanding military campaign against Lebanon, have led to humanitarian catastrophe and the heightened risk of an all-out regional war. But the wider consequences may ultimately be a great rupture in international relations, and the accelerated decline of the US-led international liberal capitalist order that has prevailed since the end of the second world war.</p> <p>At that time, western states seemingly committed themselves to an international human rights architecture, embodied in the Nuremberg principles, which holds that leaders and the states they govern must be held accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity. But the way that Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and its military have waged their campaign over the past year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/09/us-israel-weapons\">armed and supported</a> by the US, has permanently undermined the notion that all states will be held equally accountable under international law.</p> <p>Indeed, the slaughter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/15/gaza-death-toll-hits-40000-with-thousands-more-yet-to-be-counted\">more than 40,000</a> Palestinians in Gaza (conservative estimates place the number of children who have been killed <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/more-women-and-children-killed-gaza-israeli-military-any-other-recent-conflict\">at more than 11,000</a>), the destruction of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/25/starvation-israel-gaza-war\">starvation that has ensued</a> cannot be justified by Hamas\u2019s terrorist attack on 7 October, however horrific it was.</p> <p>The US\u2019s full-throated defence of Israel\u2019s brutal campaign, consisting of many genocidal acts, has exposed what many in the global south already believed: that international law applies to the global south but not to the US and its allies. That Arab lives and the lives of non-westerners are viewed as lesser in the eyes of those who set up the liberal international order.</p> <p>If there is not an immediate change in course, the consequences of the growing north-south polarisation will probably have transformative effects on international politics for generations. It will also further accelerate the decline of the US\u2019s global influence, and empower China and Russia, which have been challenging the rules-based international order. It may also lead, as the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has warned, to \u201can epidemic of impunity around the world\u201d.</p> <p>The stakes are very high. No order so morally bankrupt and evidently hypocritical can sustain itself for long. The best defence is to ensure that all abide by common principles. If the US does not demand an immediate ceasefire and halt Israel\u2019s escalations, this period may be remembered as the rupture that ended the US-led order that promised peace and universal values, but delivered anything but.</p> <ul> <li><p>Fawaz Gerges is professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. His most recent book is What Really Went Wrong: The West and the Failure of Democracy in the Middle East</p></li> </ul>    <h2>Leila Seurat: Hamas wants to expand the war beyond Gaza. Worryingly, that is not far from becoming reality</h2> <p>In the spring of 2022, amid repeated incursions by settlers on to al-Aqsa mosque, Hamas\u2019s political leader, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkXP6mzMZfI\">Yahya Sinwar, delivered a speech</a> in which he announced an upcoming great battle that would cause a regional and global explosion.</p> <p>\u201cThe enemy wants to turn the war into a religious battle. We would prefer this not to happen. But if the Zionist extremists absolutely want it, then we will accept the challenge. I call upon our people and our <em>umma</em>, you must prepare for the great battle if the occupation continues its aggressions against al-Aqsa.\u201d</p> <p>The 7 October attack can be viewed as the first strike in that battle and has made Palestine a major international concern. While the objective was achieved, Hamas has had to adapt its strategy as the war has gone on and more players have become involved.</p> <p>Sinwar anticipated that Netanyahu would escalate in a way that would be costly in terms of image \u2013 not only for Israel but also for all its western supporters, whose complicity in alleged war crimes was rapidly exposed. At the same time, Hamas relied on the axis of resistance, betting on a strategy of \u201cunifying the fronts\u201d from Lebanon to Syria, passing through Iraq, Iran and even Yemen.</p> <p>So far, this approach has allowed Hamas to maintain its power in the Gaza Strip militarily and politically. Israeli troops becoming occupied on the northern front with Lebanon has allowed Hamas\u2019s al-Qassam brigades to carry out a number of ambushes and regularly cause casualties in the ranks of the Israeli army. It is this maintenance of power and military tenacity that make it possible for Hamas to hold its consistent position in the negotiations: accepting various ceasefire proposals while insisting on the exit of Israeli troops from Gaza.</p> <p>Opening the conflict beyond the Gaza Strip allows Hamas to keep Israel busy elsewhere, and is a way of delaying or avoiding a face-off that has historically worked to Hamas\u2019s disadvantage. But this is also where Sinwar\u2019s strategy has by chance aligned with Netanyahu\u2019s. He also seeks to mobilise other fronts \u2013 from Lebanon to Yemen to Iran \u2013 to distract from the quagmire of Gaza and regain internal legitimacy. Expanding the war is also a way to obscure the colonial nature of the conflict against the Palestinians, by turning it into a civilisational or religious confrontation against Iran.</p> <p>Hezbollah and Iran have long sought to limit the conflict with Israel to low-intensity indirect warfare. But it appears that is no longer possible: they are increasingly being called upon to respond to Israeli aggressions that now threaten their own sovereignty. The prediction made by Sinwar in 2022 is not far from becoming a reality.</p> <ul> <li><p>Leila Seurat is a researcher at the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies, Paris, and the author of The Foreign Policy of Hamas: Ideology, Decision Making and Political Supremacy</p></li> </ul>    <h2>Jason Burke: Netanyahu\u2019s escalation into Lebanon is a gamble that might not pay off</h2> <p>What next? There is likely to be Israeli retaliation for the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/iran-calls-missile-attack-on-israel-legal-rational-and-legitimate\">Iranian missile</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/iran-calls-missile-attack-on-israel-legal-rational-and-legitimate\">attack</a>. That, in turn, was a response to the Israeli assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Hezbollah (an Iran-backed proxy), an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/13/world-waits-anxiously-for-iranian-response-to-israels-killing-of-top-general\">Iranian general</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/31/hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-death-raid-iran-home-israel-gaza-war\">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, who died in a blast in a bedroom in a government guesthouse in Tehran in July. We appear caught in a cycle of increasing violence that threatens a regional conflagration, and which no one seems able to slow, let alone halt.</p> <p>We don\u2019t know what form that retaliation might take, but Israel has many options. Possibilities range from a spectacular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/biden-says-us-discussing-possible-israeli-plans-to-attack-irans-oil-industry\">attack against oil facilities</a>, potentially destroying Iran\u2019s most vital economic lifeline, to something much more covert, using the clear superiority Israel appears to enjoy in the clandestine shadow war between the two states. A strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear programme would need US involvement, which is unlikely to be forthcoming.</p> <p>Israel is already fighting on multiple fronts. On 30 September, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) units moved across the frontier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/israel-order-evacuation-southern-lebanon-border-villages-incursion\">into Lebanon</a>. They were aiming, Israeli officials say, to degrade Hezbollah\u2019s ability to fire on communities in northern Israel, in order to allow 60,000 displaced Israelis to return to their homes.

      "bodyText": "Fawaz Gerges: We may have reached a point beyond which the international order changes for ever Israel\u2019s year-long war in Gaza (and the accompanying violence perpetrated against Palestinians in the West Bank), and its ever-expanding military campaign against Lebanon, have led to humanitarian catastrophe and the heightened risk of an all-out regional war. But the wider consequences may ultimately be a great rupture in international relations, and the accelerated decline of the US-led international liberal capitalist order that has prevailed since the end of the second world war. At that time, western states seemingly committed themselves to an international human rights architecture, embodied in the Nuremberg principles, which holds that leaders and the states they govern must be held accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity. But the way that Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and its military have waged their campaign over the past year, armed and supported by the US, has permanently undermined the notion that all states will be held equally accountable under international law. Indeed, the slaughter of more than 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza (conservative estimates place the number of children who have been killed at more than 11,000), the destruction of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, and the starvation that has ensued cannot be justified by Hamas\u2019s terrorist attack on 7 October, however horrific it was. The US\u2019s full-throated defence of Israel\u2019s brutal campaign, consisting of many genocidal acts, has exposed what many in the global south already believed: that international law applies to the global south but not to the US and its allies. That Arab lives and the lives of non-westerners are viewed as lesser in the eyes of those who set up the liberal international order. If there is not an immediate change in course, the consequences of the growing north-south polarisation will probably have transformative effects on international politics for generations. It will also further accelerate the decline of the US\u2019s global influence, and empower China and Russia, which have been challenging the rules-based international order. It may also lead, as the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has warned, to \u201can epidemic of impunity around the world\u201d. The stakes are very high. No order so morally bankrupt and evidently hypocritical can sustain itself for long. The best defence is to ensure that all abide by common principles. If the US does not demand an immediate ceasefire and halt Israel\u2019s escalations, this period may be remembered as the rupture that ended the US-led order that promised peace and universal values, but delivered anything but. Fawaz Gerges is professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. His most recent book is What Really Went Wrong: The West and the Failure of Democracy in the Middle East Leila Seurat: Hamas wants to expand the war beyond Gaza. Worryingly, that is not far from becoming reality In the spring of 2022, amid repeated incursions by settlers on to al-Aqsa mosque, Hamas\u2019s political leader, Yahya Sinwar, delivered a speech in which he announced an upcoming great battle that would cause a regional and global explosion. \u201cThe enemy wants to turn the war into a religious battle. We would prefer this not to happen. But if the Zionist extremists absolutely want it, then we will accept the challenge. I call upon our people and our umma, you must prepare for the great battle if the occupation continues its aggressions against al-Aqsa.\u201d The 7 October attack can be viewed as the first strike in that battle and has made Palestine a major international concern. While the objective was achieved, Hamas has had to adapt its strategy as the war has gone on and more players have become involved. Sinwar anticipated that Netanyahu would escalate in a way that would be costly in terms of image \u2013 not only for Israel but also for all its western supporters, whose complicity in alleged war crimes was rapidly exposed. At the same time, Hamas relied on the axis of resistance, betting on a strategy of \u201cunifying the fronts\u201d from Lebanon to Syria, passing through Iraq, Iran and even Yemen. So far, this approach has allowed Hamas to maintain its power in the Gaza Strip militarily and politically. Israeli troops becoming occupied on the northern front with Lebanon has allowed Hamas\u2019s al-Qassam brigades to carry out a number of ambushes and regularly cause casualties in the ranks of the Israeli army. It is this maintenance of power and military tenacity that make it possible for Hamas to hold its consistent position in the negotiations: accepting various ceasefire proposals while insisting on the exit of Israeli troops from Gaza. Opening the conflict beyond the Gaza Strip allows Hamas to keep Israel busy elsewhere, and is a way of delaying or avoiding a face-off that has historically worked to Hamas\u2019s disadvantage. But this is also where Sinwar\u2019s strategy has by chance aligned with Netanyahu\u2019s. He also seeks to mobilise other fronts \u2013 from Lebanon to Yemen to Iran \u2013 to distract from the quagmire of Gaza and regain internal legitimacy. Expanding the war is also a way to obscure the colonial nature of the conflict against the Palestinians, by turning it into a civilisational or religious confrontation against Iran. Hezbollah and Iran have long sought to limit the conflict with Israel to low-intensity indirect warfare. But it appears that is no longer possible: they are increasingly being called upon to respond to Israeli aggressions that now threaten their own sovereignty. The prediction made by Sinwar in 2022 is not far from becoming a reality. Leila Seurat is a researcher at the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies, Paris, and the author of The Foreign Policy of Hamas: Ideology, Decision Making and Political Supremacy Jason Burke: Netanyahu\u2019s escalation into Lebanon is a gamble that might not pay off What next? There is likely to be Israeli retaliation for the recent Iranian missile attack. That, in turn, was a response to the Israeli assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Hezbollah (an Iran-backed proxy), an Iranian general and Ismail Haniyeh, who died in a blast in a bedroom in a government guesthouse in Tehran in July. We appear caught in a cycle of increasing violence that threatens a regional conflagration, and which no one seems able to slow, let alone halt. We don\u2019t know what form that retaliation might take, but Israel has many options. Possibilities range from a spectacular attack against oil facilities, potentially destroying Iran\u2019s most vital economic lifeline, to something much more covert, using the clear superiority Israel appears to enjoy in the clandestine shadow war between the two states. A strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear programme would need US involvement, which is unlikely to be forthcoming. Israel is already fighting on multiple fronts. On 30 September, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) units moved across the frontier into Lebanon. They were aiming, Israeli officials say, to degrade Hezbollah\u2019s ability to fire on communities in northern Israel, in order to allow 60,000 displaced Israelis to return to their homes. It is too early to judge how this effort is going, but eight soldiers died in clashes with Hezbollah, suggesting that it will not be easy. The bloody air offensive that has accompanied the ground attack in Lebanon has made clear other objectives: to permanently weaken or destroy a long-term adversary that is the linchpin in Iran\u2019s coalition of proxies across the Middle East, and to restore a high threshold of deterrence that has been a foundation of Israel\u2019s security doctrine since 1948. Israeli policymakers and generals have regained the confidence lost a year ago and see an opportunity to bring strategic change on a major scale to the region. In Gaza, little is likely to change. Israel\u2019s offensive in the territory has struggled to achieve the arguably unrealistic aims set by political leaders: to \u201ccrush\u201d Hamas and free the remaining 100 or so of about 250 hostages taken during the 7 October raids into southern Israel, which killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. But Hamas is much weakened, and poses a very limited threat. This lethal stalemate can only be broken by some kind of political shift. Leaders on neither side appear keen on a ceasefire and attention has shifted elsewhere. It is unlikely there will be any \u201cday after\u201d in Gaza soon.

But even in my darkest dreams, I could not have imagined the apocalypse that Israel would bring about in Gaza. I still find it hard to believe. Israel has never been an egalitarian democracy. But the idea of democracy was part of the collective ethos, at least in Israelis\u2019 self-perception.

Today, in their public speeches, Israeli leaders no longer address the \u201ccitizens of Israel\u201d, but the \u201cpeople of Israel\u201d \u2013 a term that refers only to the Jewish public. In the thick and poisonous fog in which Israel is shrouded, it is very difficult to predict what will happen after the war, especially with the end retreating even further from view after another battlefront was opened up in south Lebanon. The prospect of a wider conflict with Iran also looms. But one thing is clear: Israeli society will emerge from this last year more nationalistic, more violent and much more uninhibited. Even when Netanyahu\u2019s rule eventually comes to an end, his legacy of destruction and hatred will remain for many more years, if not generations.

      "body": "<p>One of my favourite no-miss TV pitches is \u201cWhat if this couple have a slightly difficult time in their marriage while inside an absolutely&nbsp;beautiful house?\u201d.</p> <p>The headlines for Disclaimer (from Friday, 11 October), the Apple TV+ show where a couple have a slightly difficult time in their marriage while inside an absolutely beautiful house, will focus on the big three hits: that Cate Blanchett is in it; that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/alfonso-cuaron\">Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n</a> wrote and directed it, so it\u2019s unnecessarily cinematic in a way that makes your throat tighten with its beauty; Kevin Kline\u2019s astounding multi-age turn as a former teacher hellbent on an unusual kind of revenge. But what\u2019s really important is: Blanchett\u2019s icily middle-class Catherine Ravenscroft is married to Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s smugly foodie middle-class Robert Ravenscroft, and they are in a house, and that house is gorgeous.</p> <p>Someone drinks a glass of wine at the kitchen sink. Someone\u2019s phone buzzes and they go to another room to answer it. Blanchett takes off her heels after a mildly disappointing evening at an awards show. Difficult marriage, difficult marriage. But every moment of difficulty they have there makes me want to pull up Zoopla and make myself sick.</p> <p>What\u2019s Disclaimer about, then? Well, yeah, that\u2019s the point: you\u2019re never really supposed to know. Based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/03/the-best-recent-crime-novels-review-roundup\">Ren\u00e9e Knight\u2019s bestseller</a>, it\u2019s a multi-timeline drama, occasionally interrupted by a random line of narration for no reason at all, that is compelling in a uniquely frustrating way. Blanchett\u2019s Ravenscroft is a documentary-maker, and one day she discovers a thin self-published book. (To really believe Disclaimer, you have to understand that every human being, when randomly posted a book in a Jiffy bag, will read the whole thing immediately, which Blanchett does.) It\u2019s here she realises the random book is about her, so tries to set fire to it in a sink. In a separate scene that takes absolutely ages to become connected, Kline is walking around his empty old house wearing his dead wife\u2019s cardigan. Baron Cohen has also just discovered a book in a Jiffy bag and read it entirely, so now he\u2019s really drunk on a bus. Occasionally we zap back 20 years to Italy and see some half-snapshotted memories of a holiday. Eventually, Blanchett\u2019s adult son, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/kodi-smit-mcphee\">Kodi Smit-McPhee</a>, discovers a Jiffy bag with a book in it. You can probably gather what happens next.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so6XoqZgbVM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/so6XoqZgbVM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I mean, it\u2019s beautiful to look at. But the theme of Disclaimer \u2013 that the way a story is told and who it is told by can often get in the way of the reality of it \u2013 bleeds into the telling in a way that you\u2019re either going to find fascinatingly deft and clever or annoying to the point of frustration. The book itself (the real one the series is based on, not the fake one in the Jiffy bag everyone is compelled to set fire to) leans hard on having two narrators with two different versions of the central event that blasted everyone\u2019s lives apart. To make that work as TV, there needs to be some real narrative push\u2013pull \u2013 what we are shown and told, necessarily, has to be woozy and not quite upfront. As a result, Disclaimer spins all over the place: first we\u2019re here, now we\u2019re there, now we\u2019re in the past. </p> <p>Although it\u2019s quite refreshing to be presented with a mystery that isn\u2019t deliberately red herringy, Disclaimer does something else that can be just as annoying: it\u2019s obtuse, constantly telling you stuff and showing you stuff, but lots of it never really means anything. What I normally say when I can\u2019t decide if something is good or bad or not is \u201cit\u2019s very narratively clever\u201d. And listen: this is very narratively clever!</p> <p>In fact, it may be so clever that it\u2019s one of the most capricious shows of recent years: I\u2019ve never seen so many beautiful iris shots combined with such schlocky bestsellery plot points; A-list actors bouncing off extras I assume they found in a cave community of people who have never said a sentence out loud before; stupendous sound design underneath lines of dialogue that must have first been written on the back of a children\u2019s menu in crayon; and, of course, loads of scenes of people on iPhones.</p> <p>But perhaps we\u2019re looking too close at Disclaimer, and trying to figure out what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s about how nice the oven and worktop combination is in Cate Blanchett\u2019s kitchen. Everything else is kind of extraneous to that, and if you like it then, well, that\u2019s on you.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of my favourite no-miss TV pitches is \u201cWhat if this couple have a slightly difficult time in their marriage while inside an absolutely beautiful house?\u201d. The headlines for Disclaimer (from Friday, 11 October), the Apple TV+ show where a couple have a slightly difficult time in their marriage while inside an absolutely beautiful house, will focus on the big three hits: that Cate Blanchett is in it; that Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n wrote and directed it, so it\u2019s unnecessarily cinematic in a way that makes your throat tighten with its beauty; Kevin Kline\u2019s astounding multi-age turn as a former teacher hellbent on an unusual kind of revenge. But what\u2019s really important is: Blanchett\u2019s icily middle-class Catherine Ravenscroft is married to Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s smugly foodie middle-class Robert Ravenscroft, and they are in a house, and that house is gorgeous. Someone drinks a glass of wine at the kitchen sink. Someone\u2019s phone buzzes and they go to another room to answer it. Blanchett takes off her heels after a mildly disappointing evening at an awards show. Difficult marriage, difficult marriage. But every moment of difficulty they have there makes me want to pull up Zoopla and make myself sick. What\u2019s Disclaimer about, then? Well, yeah, that\u2019s the point: you\u2019re never really supposed to know. Based on Ren\u00e9e Knight\u2019s bestseller, it\u2019s a multi-timeline drama, occasionally interrupted by a random line of narration for no reason at all, that is compelling in a uniquely frustrating way. Blanchett\u2019s Ravenscroft is a documentary-maker, and one day she discovers a thin self-published book. (To really believe Disclaimer, you have to understand that every human being, when randomly posted a book in a Jiffy bag, will read the whole thing immediately, which Blanchett does.) It\u2019s here she realises the random book is about her, so tries to set fire to it in a sink. In a separate scene that takes absolutely ages to become connected, Kline is walking around his empty old house wearing his dead wife\u2019s cardigan. Baron Cohen has also just discovered a book in a Jiffy bag and read it entirely, so now he\u2019s really drunk on a bus. Occasionally we zap back 20 years to Italy and see some half-snapshotted memories of a holiday. Eventually, Blanchett\u2019s adult son, Kodi Smit-McPhee, discovers a Jiffy bag with a book in it. You can probably gather what happens next. I mean, it\u2019s beautiful to look at. But the theme of Disclaimer \u2013 that the way a story is told and who it is told by can often get in the way of the reality of it \u2013 bleeds into the telling in a way that you\u2019re either going to find fascinatingly deft and clever or annoying to the point of frustration. The book itself (the real one the series is based on, not the fake one in the Jiffy bag everyone is compelled to set fire to) leans hard on having two narrators with two different versions of the central event that blasted everyone\u2019s lives apart. To make that work as TV, there needs to be some real narrative push\u2013pull \u2013 what we are shown and told, necessarily, has to be woozy and not quite upfront. As a result, Disclaimer spins all over the place: first we\u2019re here, now we\u2019re there, now we\u2019re in the past. Although it\u2019s quite refreshing to be presented with a mystery that isn\u2019t deliberately red herringy, Disclaimer does something else that can be just as annoying: it\u2019s obtuse, constantly telling you stuff and showing you stuff, but lots of it never really means anything. What I normally say when I can\u2019t decide if something is good or bad or not is \u201cit\u2019s very narratively clever\u201d. And listen: this is very narratively clever! In fact, it may be so clever that it\u2019s one of the most capricious shows of recent years: I\u2019ve never seen so many beautiful iris shots combined with such schlocky bestsellery plot points; A-list actors bouncing off extras I assume they found in a cave community of people who have never said a sentence out loud before; stupendous sound design underneath lines of dialogue that must have first been written on the back of a children\u2019s menu in crayon; and, of course, loads of scenes of people on iPhones. But perhaps we\u2019re looking too close at Disclaimer, and trying to figure out what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s about how nice the oven and worktop combination is in Cate Blanchett\u2019s kitchen. Everything else is kind of extraneous to that, and if you like it then, well, that\u2019s on you.",

      "bodyText": "Concerns about the growth of self-styled fitness clubs organised by the far right have prompted calls for action to counter misogynistic messaging targeted at young men and boys. Campaigners want the UK government to recognise the danger presented by so-called \u201cactive clubs\u201d \u2013 a loose movement imported from the US \u2013 and use moments such as a review of the school curriculum to challenge their ideology. While it has often been careful to avoid direct calls to violence, the decentralised grouping has links to the international far right and has a specific focus on developing members\u2019 fitness with a view to being able to fight. Thousands of subscribers across Britain are signed up to accounts on Telegram, the encrypted messaging app. White nationalism, fascist imagery as well as homophobic and misogynistic language feature heavily, while many of the same fitness groups\u2019 Telegram channels have been posting attempts to stir up tensions after the deaths of three young girls in Southport. A range of active club groups in the UK had upwards of 6,000 subscribers on Telegram while the latest version of a group dedicated to England had almost 1,600 subscribers, a BBC investigation reported this week. Evidence seen by the Guardian indicates that members of equivalent clubs in the US have travelled to the UK in recent months. The groups\u2019 relative growth \u2013 researchers regard the true number of participants as being a fraction of the thousands of subscribers \u2013 comes as more overtly political British far-right groups such as Patriotic Alternative have struggled. A group using the name Active Club Scotland (ACS) is regarded by Hope Not Hate as being one of the first to have emerged in Britain, taking a cue from US clubs that grew out of the Rise Above Movement, a far-right street-fighting group in California. Patrik Hermansson, a senior researcher at Hope Not Hate who has explored the trend in detail, said: \u201cThe UK has been a late adopter to this trend, which only really took off here last summer and took inspiration from European and US counterparts. Ultimately, they are about reasserting masculinity, affirming members as strong, capable men and pushing out the message that society is weak and degenerate and the reason for that is progressive ideals and feminism.\u201d Like their European and US equivalents, the groups mix ideological posts with images and \u201creports\u201d of members taking part in martial arts activities, often in open countryside but sometimes in private and public gyms. Images and posts seen by the Guardian range from groups publicising activities such as \u201cbanner drops\u201d of far-right propaganda from motorway bridges, through to posts showing exercising members with their faces blurred out. One from a group for the south of England showed black-clad recruits doing press-ups on Jesus Green, Cambridge. Another post, by Active Club England, forwarded an image purporting to show a visit to London last month by followers of a US white supremacist group calling themselves the Sons of Colombia. Anti-fascist researchers are also aware of at least one other visit by another US far-right active club to the UK this year. Hermansson added: \u201cThese clubs are about building a capacity for violence and imagining a future where violence is necessary to somehow save the nation. It\u2019s highly masculine \u2013 you rarely, if ever, see a woman in their posts and there is very much a separatist side to drawing people in and radicalising them.\u201d Christine Jardine, a Liberal Democrat MP and the party\u2019s equalities spokesperson, described the rise of the groups as \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and said the school curriculum should be updated to ensure young people can be protected from people using popular platforms to prey on vulnerable young men and boys. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, announced a review in August of the curriculum in primary and secondary schools and said children would be taught how to spot extremist content and misinformation online under planned changes. Brendan Cox, who was married to the murdered West Yorkshire MP Jo Cox and campaigns on counter-terrorism and community cohesion, said the Active Clubs should be seen in the context of research showing men were more than twice as likely as women to try to justify violence outside refugee accommodation this summer. \u201cThe other thing is that misogyny is a common strand connecting so many of the different forms of extremism,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an obvious opportunity in the curriculum review.

      "body": "<p>Joe Locke was just 16 when he went from the Isle of Man to London for an open audition for a new Netflix show called Heartstopper. That was four years ago and, owing to Covid, his mum couldn\u2019t go with him. But the young actor wasn\u2019t intimidated.<strong> </strong>\u201cI\u2019ve always been quite an independent person,\u201d he says now, over lunch. Locke didn\u2019t freak out as he got through the audition process, because how could anybody have foreseen how big that show was going to get?<strong> </strong>Also, \u201cI was so unattached to the world of TV, there was nothing that was real life to me. Maybe that helped with the nerves. If I hadn\u2019t got Heartstopper, it wouldn\u2019t have changed anything in my life. It would have just been a cool story, a thing I nearly got.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, he landed the lead role, and, a month after Heartstopper came out in April 2022, it became the fifth most watched Netflix show (in English) in the world. Locke was \u2026 \u201cGrateful?\u201d he says, with a little upwards quizzical inflection. I take his point: the coming-of-age, coming-out drama got so big, and was heralded as so delightful, that it\u2019s hard to imagine anything but that fate (or the universe, or whatever) was behind it.</p> <p>Even when he got a major role on Broadway in Sweeney Todd after the second season of Heartstopper dropped, he took that in his stride because of his hinterland \u2013 the am-dram scene on the Isle of Man. He talks about Manx theatre with passionate intensity, and tells me that the Isle of Man is more than what he calls \u201ca great place to grow up and a great place to grow old \u2013 a very beautiful, picturesque tax haven\u201d. With three theatre festivals a year, for a population of 84,000, it\u2019s a factory for producing thesps.</p> <p>Still when he was cast in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/19/agatha-all-along-review-marvel-kathryn-hahn-disney-plus\">Agatha All Along</a>, Marvel\u2019s new addition to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/15/wandavision-review-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany-marvel-disney\">WandaVision TV franchise</a>, he accepted that, OK, this was a pretty big deal. \u201cThe first Iron Man film came out when I was <em>f</em><em>our</em>. I grew <em>up</em> watching these films,\u201d he says, scattering emphasis everywhere. \u201cEven WandaVision, which our show is based on: I remember watching it with my friends when I wasn\u2019t even in the industry yet.\u201d It has quite a high barrier to entry, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, unless you\u2019re already an apex superhero (Bradley Cooper, Chris Evans). Its newest citizen is an unlikely addition \u2013 Locke looks younger than his 21 years, knowing but sweet, like a well-groomed bushbaby. He\u2019s not an old\u2011fashioned lionheart, and that\u2019s kind of the point.</p>    <p>Heartstopper, based on Alice Oseman\u2019s graphic novel, was deceptively simple \u2013 boy meets boy, falls in love, is rebuffed, gets unrebuffed, love deepens and it\u2019s complicated. It ignited because Locke\u2019s Charlie Spring was a new kind of hero, befitting its era: emotionally open, with a steeliness of intent and rock-solid sense of self; his vulnerability is his strength. Variety called Heartstopper \u201c<a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/reviews/heartstopper-season-2-review-netflix-1235681425/\">blissfully queer</a>\u201d, (the Guardian called it \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/22/heartstopper-review-alice-oseman-netflix-tv-drama\">possibly the loveliest show on TV</a>\u201d), but it wasn\u2019t only in its approach to sexuality that it broke the mould. This was a whole new way to be a leading man.</p> <p>Locke is lunching in the Corinthia, an unfeasibly fancy hotel in central London. He can\u2019t eat his salad because he has a really sore throat and \u201cit\u2019s like swallowing knives. Even water is like swallowing knives!\u201d Disney sent a doctor to see him this morning, so he\u2019d be match-fit to talk about Agatha All Along, and we both pause to consider the immensity of being so vital to a global corporation that they send a physician to your hotel room. \u201cI\u2019m still a person, but I\u2019m also a commodity,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s quid pro quo: they get a lot out of me, I get a lot out of them. And I love that; it makes me feel less bad about inviting my friends to the hotel and Disney paying for our cocktails.\u201d</p> <p>Locke plays Teen, opposite the magnificent Kathryn Hahn as the titular Agatha. She\u2019s a witch \u2013 you might remember her as the villain in WandaVision and he\u2019s, well, a teen. Agatha has been robbed of her powers and can\u2019t get them back without a coven. Teen starts off naive, biddable, obsessive, a fanboy, and over time becomes \u2013 for the avoidance of spoilers \u2013 not those things. The coven assembles \u2013 Patti LuPone, Aubrey Plaza, Sasheer Zamata, Ali Ahn and Debra Jo Rupp \u2013 all stone-cold scene-stealers, but here it\u2019s more as if they\u2019re working together to set fire to the scenes.<strong> </strong>Hahn\u2019s performance has the volatility of an actor in total control; Locke has such a compelling physical presence \u2013 taut and luminous \u2013 that you could mistake him for having been trained in mime. In fact, he hasn\u2019t been trained at all; he just hasn\u2019t had time. Anyway, \u201cAgatha is the best drama school you could imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting to work with these incredible talents. I\u2019m a really observational person, I\u2019m good at visually learning from other people. Watching the way Kathryn puts herself into a scene, the way she moves her eyes, the way she says certain things. There\u2019s an incredible movement she does with her mouth, I must have watched it 10 times. She\u2019s so gripping.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>People do still get bullied for their sexuality. I was very lucky that I didn\u2019t, but then I was also very quick with my tongue at school</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is a two-way street. Hahn has a 25-year career going back to How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), but tells me: \u201cI never felt a mentor/mentee vibe with Joe. I respected his game from the start. He came to play, and constantly surprised me.\u201d She hadn\u2019t seen Heartstopper when they first met. \u201cI just met him as this wise-beyond-his-years actor,\u201d she says. \u201cI naively thought he was out of nowhere. Then when I saw his performance in that show it just cemented all that I had thought: he\u2019s the real deal. My 15-year-old daughter loves him, my uncle loves him, queer kids love him \u2013 his appeal transcends all just because he is completely himself.\u201d</p> <p>Locke is not one of those actors who, hitting the small screen young, feels as if he ought to go back and get some formal training. \u201cIt would be like taking a three\u2011year break to then come back and do the same thing I\u2019m already doing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels like it would be a bit of a waste.\u201d He can\u2019t see himself becoming a method actor, quoting the famous advice to Dustin Hoffman, who had stayed up 72 hours to look wrecked enough for Marathon Man: \u201cMy dear boy, why don\u2019t you try acting?\u201d (\u201cI can\u2019t remember who said it,\u201d he says, and I say, \u201cLaurence Olivier\u201d, and he says, \u201cI said it was him, and someone said it wasn\u2019t, and now I get scared whenever I say it.\u201d There\u2019s that Charlie Spring-like candour again; his sensitivity is his superpower.)</p> <p>If he\u2019s not about to turn method, he has a \u201cprocess \u2013 actors talk about having that from within; mine is more learning everything I can about the character. On the day, I like to be able to just go for it. I got really into witches for this show. I did a deep dive into Marvel history.\u201d History, I\u2019m inwardly scoffing; the cinematic universe only arrived in 2008. But Joe Locke was, as he says, just four when Iron Man came out, so plainly that would feel like quite a long time ago.</p>    <p>He talks fondly about his childhood on the Isle of Man, but adds: \u201cThere are weird rich people, and then country types. It\u2019s a very strange mix.\u201d His mother grew up there, his father\u2019s side of the family are from Ireland. His dad runs a newsagent; his mum teaches children with special needs. He has siblings, he says, all younger than him. When I ask if they find it at all peculiar that their brother, who until five seconds ago was a regular kid, now divides his time between a flat in central London and a red carpet in LA, via a show on Broadway, he says: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never actually asked them.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t see his birthplace as any kind of backwater, showbiz-wise; he was very into school plays and says that locally there are \u201ca lot of people who are very talented, go to drama school, but then aren\u2019t lucky enough to make it in their first few years in London, and so have to move back. Because of that, there\u2019s a lot of amazing people to learn from.\u201d</p> <p>He loves Stephen Sondheim, and says his dream role is Bobby in Company, \u201cthough obviously I\u2019m much too young\u201d. Then he changes his mind: his dream dream role is Rose in Gypsy, \u201cbut that would obviously not happen\u201d (for a combination of reasons; times have changed, but do 21-year-old guys get to play middle-aged women yet?). He remembers, as a kid, watching a bootleg of Patti LuPone doing Gypsy on Broadway, circa 2006. The next time he saw her, he was acting opposite her on the set of Agatha All Along.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019d be flying to London for an event, flying home the next day, going into school, sitting an exam, every day for three weeks. It was crazy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was a friend of Locke\u2019s mum who saw the fateful casting call for Heartstopper \u2013 \u201cCharlie Spring (age 14, nearly 15). Openly gay overthinker (open to any ethnic heritage)\u201d \u2013 and thought of him. Locke, then 16, had come out to his mum aged 12, then to his Instagram followers, then decided that was too public, claiming his account had been hacked, and came out to his friends again three years later, to which they replied that he had told them ages ago. Being gay was no problem for him at school.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t bullied, but I was also in a very lucky position. There are a lot more issues in schools than people might think, to do with that. Teenagers can be horrible people. Really mean. I don\u2019t know if that will ever change. But the things they\u2019re being mean about might have changed. Definitely, people still do get bullied for their sexuality; but you might not be bullied for that, and still get bullied for wearing the wrong shoes. I was very lucky that I didn\u2019t, but then I was also very quick with my tongue at school.\u201d</p> <p>He had got into the Heartstopper audition room with a headshot from a school play, A Chorus Line, which he was still sending out until a year ago. He knew about the graphic novels on which the show is based, but wouldn\u2019t have called himself a superfan. By the time he got the part, though, he had realised how much he wanted it, and says with feeling: \u201cThe sick thing in the industry is you get so invested in playing a part, and you have no control over whether you get it.\u201d It \u201cwas not a major set. It always felt like they were making an indie film on an indie budget,\u201d he says. They weren\u2019t on mega-salaries; word is that the whole cast went back to renegotiate their contracts before season three.</p>    <p>When Heartstopper came out, Locke was, technically at least, doing his A-levels. \u201cSo I\u2019d be flying to London for an event,<strong> </strong>flying home the next day, going into school, sitting an exam, every day for three weeks. It was a crazy way to live. I got ABB. I was very proud of that, because I didn\u2019t really do any work.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the reason Heartstopper was so instantly well loved was the palpable freshness, youth and inexperience of the young cast \u2013 only Kit Connor (as Nick Nelson, the initially straight love interest) and Corinna Brown (Tara Jones) hadn\u2019t arrived via the open audition.

Locke, relaxed and compelling as a firebrand juror, was the living embodiment of what Suella Braverman might call the woke army; sexuality wasn\u2019t the point (there was an environmental catastrophe, dummy), but it was in the air, as the young cast introduced themselves with their pronouns. \u201cSexuality is so fluid nowadays, and my generation is better than previous ones at talking about feelings and being open.

Just, you know, that\u2019s the world that people grew up in.\u201d</p> <p>Sweeney Todd, on the other hand, came as a surprise to everyone. His agent didn\u2019t even know he could sing (he describes his voice, modestly, with the words: \u201cWell, I can hold a note.\u201d) Locke was cast as Tobias Ragg, the unlikely 14-year-old cockney hero of the musical. He went to New York thinking it would be like a maxi-break with a bit of performing. \u201cIt\u2019s three hours a day, five days a week. I thought I was going to have so much fun, get drunk every night, go to all the clubs. I did not do any of that. I was more exhausted than I\u2019d be after a 16-hour filming day.\u201d It is a physically punishing business, but also pretty nerve-racking \u2013 the sheer scale of Broadway, the fact that \u201cpeople are paying a lot of money to see it, you have to look after yourself to make sure you\u2019re doing the best possible job. It was the most terrifying thing I\u2019ve done. I loved it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to play a villain. Someone completely different to me. But who knows, maybe I am authentically evil</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the first night, someone filmed a solo of his and put it on TikTok, and he remembers thinking: \u201cThank God. I don\u2019t sound that bad. There\u2019s evidence online of me doing OK, so even if every other show goes really badly, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Listening to it, you realise that role wasn\u2019t as big a risk as he makes it sound. His voice is powerful and assured. Locke loves musicals; his mum used to take him to London every year to see a show for his birthday. He\u2019s still talking about seeing Imelda Staunton \u2013 no, not in Hello, Dolly!, though he\u2019s seen that, too, but in Gypsy in 2015. At the time, many people did say it was one of the most striking performances they had ever seen in a musical. Joe Locke was 11.</p> <p>The Marvel universe has been pretty accommodating about his other projects: \u201cThey know what they need to do to keep people happy.\u201d He has no fears about getting handcuffed to the high-end supernatural franchise: \u201c<em>Please</em>, I\u2019d love to be locked in for 10 years. I\u2019ve really had the best time.\u201d Since Sweeney Todd closed in May, and season three of Heartstopper wrapped the previous December, \u201cfor the first time in three years, I\u2019ve been not that busy. My life\u2019s been busy because life\u2019s just busy, but it\u2019s the least busy I\u2019ve been and I\u2019ve hated it. I cannot sit still.\u201d</p>    <p>He\u2019s in a lucky position, he says, because he has so much time; he might even go back and do a degree. He\u2019s pretty academic, though he makes some distinctions here: \u201cI\u2019ve always been very good at retaining information. I would do well in school, not because I was smart, because I could remember things.\u201d But at the front of his mind is not whether to fill the next gazillion decades with study or partying. It\u2019s not even being Disney\u2019s darling child, though he\u2019s clearly enjoying that. He has a terrier-like focus on his next role, and that\u2019s what he keeps coming back to: \u201cI miss being on set. I hopefully will get a job soon.\u201d</p> <p>His dream move is a feature film \u2013 indie, preferably. \u201cWhat\u2019s really great about having done a Marvel series is it gives you the openness to do tiny films, with no budget and really great scripts. I come from a very working-class family; I\u2019m definitely not in this game for the cash grab.\u201d Ideally, also, he\u2019d be the bad guy. \u201cI want to play a villain; I want to play a part where you get to explore elements of humanity that you would never get to do in real life. Someone completely different to me. But who knows, maybe I am authentically evil.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ll brook the possibility, sure; I\u2019ve only just met the guy. But then he tells me, with open delight, that he\u2019s flying his mum out to LA for the premiere of Agatha All Along next week; that they have already been shopping to get her a dress; how glad he is to be able to support himself as a 21-year-old. I think, on balance, authentic evil is unlikely. </p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Season three of Heartstopper is on Netflix now. Agatha All Along is streaming on Disney+</p>",

      "bodyText": "Joe Locke was just 16 when he went from the Isle of Man to London for an open audition for a new Netflix show called Heartstopper. That was four years ago and, owing to Covid, his mum couldn\u2019t go with him. But the young actor wasn\u2019t intimidated. \u201cI\u2019ve always been quite an independent person,\u201d he says now, over lunch. Locke didn\u2019t freak out as he got through the audition process, because how could anybody have foreseen how big that show was going to get? Also, \u201cI was so unattached to the world of TV, there was nothing that was real life to me. Maybe that helped with the nerves. If I hadn\u2019t got Heartstopper, it wouldn\u2019t have changed anything in my life. It would have just been a cool story, a thing I nearly got.\u201d In fact, he landed the lead role, and, a month after Heartstopper came out in April 2022, it became the fifth most watched Netflix show (in English) in the world. Locke was \u2026 \u201cGrateful?\u201d he says, with a little upwards quizzical inflection. I take his point: the coming-of-age, coming-out drama got so big, and was heralded as so delightful, that it\u2019s hard to imagine anything but that fate (or the universe, or whatever) was behind it. Even when he got a major role on Broadway in Sweeney Todd after the second season of Heartstopper dropped, he took that in his stride because of his hinterland \u2013 the am-dram scene on the Isle of Man. He talks about Manx theatre with passionate intensity, and tells me that the Isle of Man is more than what he calls \u201ca great place to grow up and a great place to grow old \u2013 a very beautiful, picturesque tax haven\u201d. With three theatre festivals a year, for a population of 84,000, it\u2019s a factory for producing thesps. Still when he was cast in Agatha All Along, Marvel\u2019s new addition to the WandaVision TV franchise, he accepted that, OK, this was a pretty big deal. \u201cThe first Iron Man film came out when I was four. I grew up watching these films,\u201d he says, scattering emphasis everywhere. \u201cEven WandaVision, which our show is based on: I remember watching it with my friends when I wasn\u2019t even in the industry yet.\u201d It has quite a high barrier to entry, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, unless you\u2019re already an apex superhero (Bradley Cooper, Chris Evans). Its newest citizen is an unlikely addition \u2013 Locke looks younger than his 21 years, knowing but sweet, like a well-groomed bushbaby. He\u2019s not an old\u2011fashioned lionheart, and that\u2019s kind of the point. Heartstopper, based on Alice Oseman\u2019s graphic novel, was deceptively simple \u2013 boy meets boy, falls in love, is rebuffed, gets unrebuffed, love deepens and it\u2019s complicated. It ignited because Locke\u2019s Charlie Spring was a new kind of hero, befitting its era: emotionally open, with a steeliness of intent and rock-solid sense of self; his vulnerability is his strength. Variety called Heartstopper \u201cblissfully queer\u201d, (the Guardian called it \u201cpossibly the loveliest show on TV\u201d), but it wasn\u2019t only in its approach to sexuality that it broke the mould. This was a whole new way to be a leading man. Locke is lunching in the Corinthia, an unfeasibly fancy hotel in central London. He can\u2019t eat his salad because he has a really sore throat and \u201cit\u2019s like swallowing knives. Even water is like swallowing knives!\u201d Disney sent a doctor to see him this morning, so he\u2019d be match-fit to talk about Agatha All Along, and we both pause to consider the immensity of being so vital to a global corporation that they send a physician to your hotel room. \u201cI\u2019m still a person, but I\u2019m also a commodity,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s quid pro quo: they get a lot out of me, I get a lot out of them. And I love that; it makes me feel less bad about inviting my friends to the hotel and Disney paying for our cocktails.\u201d Locke plays Teen, opposite the magnificent Kathryn Hahn as the titular Agatha. She\u2019s a witch \u2013 you might remember her as the villain in WandaVision and he\u2019s, well, a teen. Agatha has been robbed of her powers and can\u2019t get them back without a coven. Teen starts off naive, biddable, obsessive, a fanboy, and over time becomes \u2013 for the avoidance of spoilers \u2013 not those things. The coven assembles \u2013 Patti LuPone, Aubrey Plaza, Sasheer Zamata, Ali Ahn and Debra Jo Rupp \u2013 all stone-cold scene-stealers, but here it\u2019s more as if they\u2019re working together to set fire to the scenes. Hahn\u2019s performance has the volatility of an actor in total control; Locke has such a compelling physical presence \u2013 taut and luminous \u2013 that you could mistake him for having been trained in mime. In fact, he hasn\u2019t been trained at all; he just hasn\u2019t had time. Anyway, \u201cAgatha is the best drama school you could imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting to work with these incredible talents. I\u2019m a really observational person, I\u2019m good at visually learning from other people. Watching the way Kathryn puts herself into a scene, the way she moves her eyes, the way she says certain things. There\u2019s an incredible movement she does with her mouth, I must have watched it 10 times. She\u2019s so gripping.\u201d This is a two-way street. Hahn has a 25-year career going back to How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), but tells me: \u201cI never felt a mentor/mentee vibe with Joe. I respected his game from the start. He came to play, and constantly surprised me.\u201d She hadn\u2019t seen Heartstopper when they first met. \u201cI just met him as this wise-beyond-his-years actor,\u201d she says. \u201cI naively thought he was out of nowhere. Then when I saw his performance in that show it just cemented all that I had thought: he\u2019s the real deal. My 15-year-old daughter loves him, my uncle loves him, queer kids love him \u2013 his appeal transcends all just because he is completely himself.\u201d Locke is not one of those actors who, hitting the small screen young, feels as if he ought to go back and get some formal training. \u201cIt would be like taking a three\u2011year break to then come back and do the same thing I\u2019m already doing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels like it would be a bit of a waste.\u201d He can\u2019t see himself becoming a method actor, quoting the famous advice to Dustin Hoffman, who had stayed up 72 hours to look wrecked enough for Marathon Man: \u201cMy dear boy, why don\u2019t you try acting?\u201d (\u201cI can\u2019t remember who said it,\u201d he says, and I say, \u201cLaurence Olivier\u201d, and he says, \u201cI said it was him, and someone said it wasn\u2019t, and now I get scared whenever I say it.\u201d There\u2019s that Charlie Spring-like candour again; his sensitivity is his superpower.) If he\u2019s not about to turn method, he has a \u201cprocess \u2013 actors talk about having that from within; mine is more learning everything I can about the character. On the day, I like to be able to just go for it. I got really into witches for this show. I did a deep dive into Marvel history.\u201d History, I\u2019m inwardly scoffing; the cinematic universe only arrived in 2008. But Joe Locke was, as he says, just four when Iron Man came out, so plainly that would feel like quite a long time ago. He talks fondly about his childhood on the Isle of Man, but adds: \u201cThere are weird rich people, and then country types. It\u2019s a very strange mix.\u201d His mother grew up there, his father\u2019s side of the family are from Ireland. His dad runs a newsagent; his mum teaches children with special needs. He has siblings, he says, all younger than him. When I ask if they find it at all peculiar that their brother, who until five seconds ago was a regular kid, now divides his time between a flat in central London and a red carpet in LA, via a show on Broadway, he says: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never actually asked them.\u201d He doesn\u2019t see his birthplace as any kind of backwater, showbiz-wise; he was very into school plays and says that locally there are \u201ca lot of people who are very talented, go to drama school, but then aren\u2019t lucky enough to make it in their first few years in London, and so have to move back. Because of that, there\u2019s a lot of amazing people to learn from.\u201d He loves Stephen Sondheim, and says his dream role is Bobby in Company, \u201cthough obviously I\u2019m much too young\u201d. Then he changes his mind: his dream dream role is Rose in Gypsy, \u201cbut that would obviously not happen\u201d (for a combination of reasons; times have changed, but do 21-year-old guys get to play middle-aged women yet?). He remembers, as a kid, watching a bootleg of Patti LuPone doing Gypsy on Broadway, circa 2006. The next time he saw her, he was acting opposite her on the set of Agatha All Along. It was a friend of Locke\u2019s mum who saw the fateful casting call for Heartstopper \u2013 \u201cCharlie Spring (age 14, nearly 15). Openly gay overthinker (open to any ethnic heritage)\u201d \u2013 and thought of him. Locke, then 16, had come out to his mum aged 12, then to his Instagram followers, then decided that was too public, claiming his account had been hacked, and came out to his friends again three years later, to which they replied that he had told them ages ago. Being gay was no problem for him at school. \u201cI wasn\u2019t bullied, but I was also in a very lucky position. There are a lot more issues in schools than people might think, to do with that. Teenagers can be horrible people. Really mean. I don\u2019t know if that will ever change. But the things they\u2019re being mean about might have changed. Definitely, people still do get bullied for their sexuality; but you might not be bullied for that, and still get bullied for wearing the wrong shoes. I was very lucky that I didn\u2019t, but then I was also very quick with my tongue at school.\u201d He had got into the Heartstopper audition room with a headshot from a school play, A Chorus Line, which he was still sending out until a year ago. He knew about the graphic novels on which the show is based, but wouldn\u2019t have called himself a superfan. By the time he got the part, though, he had realised how much he wanted it, and says with feeling: \u201cThe sick thing in the industry is you get so invested in playing a part, and you have no control over whether you get it.\u201d It \u201cwas not a major set. It always felt like they were making an indie film on an indie budget,\u201d he says. They weren\u2019t on mega-salaries; word is that the whole cast went back to renegotiate their contracts before season three. When Heartstopper came out, Locke was, technically at least, doing his A-levels. \u201cSo I\u2019d be flying to London for an event, flying home the next day, going into school, sitting an exam, every day for three weeks. It was a crazy way to live. I got ABB. I was very proud of that, because I didn\u2019t really do any work.\u201d Part of the reason Heartstopper was so instantly well loved was the palpable freshness, youth and inexperience of the young cast \u2013 only Kit Connor (as Nick Nelson, the initially straight love interest) and Corinna Brown (Tara Jones) hadn\u2019t arrived via the open audition. It was simply impossible not to be on their team. That year saw the inaugural Children\u2019s and Family Emmy awards, and Heartstopper won five of the nine it was nominated for: outstanding young teen series; outstanding writing for Alice Oseman; outstanding casting for Daniel Edwards; outstanding lead performance for Kit Connor; and outstanding guest performance for Olivia Colman. Situated so squarely in the young adult space, it\u2019s surprising that it didn\u2019t generate more ire from the homophobic right, particularly in the US, where the LGBTQ-book-banning movement in schools was already, by 2022, gathering pace. \u201cThis world is a very scary place sometimes, and it feels a bit weird that Heartstopper has almost been immune to that \u2013 a lot of queer shows get a lot of hate from rightwing groups, and Heartstopper doesn\u2019t, and I don\u2019t really understand why. You\u2019ll often hear Trump supporters talking about queer people and queer shows,\u201d Locke says. \u201cI want to get hate-tweeted by Donald Trump!\u201d Netflix didn\u2019t change society overnight, however. All the Heartstopper stars had their personal lives pored over for clues that they were like their characters, or weren\u2019t enough like their characters: Connor was hounded for a photograph in which he was holding hands with a girl, until he snapped and tweeted, on Halloween 2022: \u201cBack for a minute. I\u2019m bi. Congrats for forcing an 18-year-old to out himself. I think some of you missed the point of the show. Bye.\u201d Oseman replied to that: \u201cI truly don\u2019t understand how people can watch Heartstopper and then gleefully spend their time speculating about sexualities and judging based on stereotypes. I hope all those people are embarrassed as FUCK. Kit you are amazing.\u201d Locke, already out, had none of that, but has sometimes been vexed by the recurring question: \u201cDo you have to be a gay teen to play a gay teen?\u201d It has that feeling of a bear trap laid to turn diversity inside out. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to not be able to play a straight character, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to stop someone straight \u2013 who can do all the research \u2013 from playing a gay character,\u201d Locke says carefully. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re playing a part authentically and with the best intentions \u2013 you\u2019re not just playing a stereotype \u2013 then go for it.\u201d Practically speaking, of course, when they had those auditions, \u201cThere\u2019s no way they would have been able to say, \u2018Are you gay, otherwise you can\u2019t audition for this part?\u2019 to a 16-year-old. You shouldn\u2019t need to know that.\u201d Yet, at the same time, \u201crepresentation is really important\u201d, so he has carried the standard for it, in some ways against his will. \u201cI\u2019m a very private person. If it wasn\u2019t for Heartstopper, I don\u2019t think I would talk about my sexuality in the media at all. \u201cI get a lot of auditions for more gay teenage characters, very similar parts, and, while they\u2019re great, I\u2019ve played two gay characters now\u201d \u2013 Teen is also gay. \u201cNot that I would not want to play another gay character, but I want to be a versatile actor, not get stamped.\u201d By the time he appeared in The Trials at the Donmar Warehouse in London in summer 2022, Locke was never mentioned without the prefix \u201cHeartstopper\u2019s\u201d, and that performance also slotted into his mould: it\u2019s set in a dystopian future where the climate crisis is unstoppable and the young have brought the old to trial for crimes against the future. Locke, relaxed and compelling as a firebrand juror, was the living embodiment of what Suella Braverman might call the woke army; sexuality wasn\u2019t the point (there was an environmental catastrophe, dummy), but it was in the air, as the young cast introduced themselves with their pronouns. \u201cSexuality is so fluid nowadays, and my generation is better than previous ones at talking about feelings and being open. I think we\u2019re more emotionally available than previous generations, not for any fault of their own. Just, you know, that\u2019s the world that people grew up in.\u201d Sweeney Todd, on the other hand, came as a surprise to everyone. His agent didn\u2019t even know he could sing (he describes his voice, modestly, with the words: \u201cWell, I can hold a note.\u201d) Locke was cast as Tobias Ragg, the unlikely 14-year-old cockney hero of the musical. He went to New York thinking it would be like a maxi-break with a bit of performing. \u201cIt\u2019s three hours a day, five days a week. I thought I was going to have so much fun, get drunk every night, go to all the clubs. I did not do any of that. I was more exhausted than I\u2019d be after a 16-hour filming day.\u201d It is a physically punishing business, but also pretty nerve-racking \u2013 the sheer scale of Broadway, the fact that \u201cpeople are paying a lot of money to see it, you have to look after yourself to make sure you\u2019re doing the best possible job. It was the most terrifying thing I\u2019ve done. I loved it.\u201d On the first night, someone filmed a solo of his and put it on TikTok, and he remembers thinking: \u201cThank God. I don\u2019t sound that bad. There\u2019s evidence online of me doing OK, so even if every other show goes really badly, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Listening to it, you realise that role wasn\u2019t as big a risk as he makes it sound. His voice is powerful and assured. Locke loves musicals; his mum used to take him to London every year to see a show for his birthday. He\u2019s still talking about seeing Imelda Staunton \u2013 no, not in Hello, Dolly!, though he\u2019s seen that, too, but in Gypsy in 2015. At the time, many people did say it was one of the most striking performances they had ever seen in a musical. Joe Locke was 11. The Marvel universe has been pretty accommodating about his other projects: \u201cThey know what they need to do to keep people happy.\u201d He has no fears about getting handcuffed to the high-end supernatural franchise: \u201cPlease, I\u2019d love to be locked in for 10 years. I\u2019ve really had the best time.\u201d Since Sweeney Todd closed in May, and season three of Heartstopper wrapped the previous December, \u201cfor the first time in three years, I\u2019ve been not that busy. My life\u2019s been busy because life\u2019s just busy, but it\u2019s the least busy I\u2019ve been and I\u2019ve hated it. I cannot sit still.\u201d He\u2019s in a lucky position, he says, because he has so much time; he might even go back and do a degree. He\u2019s pretty academic, though he makes some distinctions here: \u201cI\u2019ve always been very good at retaining information. I would do well in school, not because I was smart, because I could remember things.\u201d But at the front of his mind is not whether to fill the next gazillion decades with study or partying. It\u2019s not even being Disney\u2019s darling child, though he\u2019s clearly enjoying that. He has a terrier-like focus on his next role, and that\u2019s what he keeps coming back to: \u201cI miss being on set. I hopefully will get a job soon.\u201d His dream move is a feature film \u2013 indie, preferably. \u201cWhat\u2019s really great about having done a Marvel series is it gives you the openness to do tiny films, with no budget and really great scripts. I come from a very working-class family; I\u2019m definitely not in this game for the cash grab.\u201d Ideally, also, he\u2019d be the bad guy. \u201cI want to play a villain; I want to play a part where you get to explore elements of humanity that you would never get to do in real life. Someone completely different to me. But who knows, maybe I am authentically evil.\u201d I\u2019ll brook the possibility, sure; I\u2019ve only just met the guy. But then he tells me, with open delight, that he\u2019s flying his mum out to LA for the premiere of Agatha All Along next week; that they have already been shopping to get her a dress; how glad he is to be able to support himself as a 21-year-old. I think, on balance, authentic evil is unlikely. \u2022 Season three of Heartstopper is on Netflix now. Agatha All Along is streaming on Disney+",

They\u2019re tiny bits of dust and rock falling into Earth\u2019s atmosphere and burning up. The trail of light this makes is called a meteor, which we often call shooting stars. If any bits survive the fall and hit Earth without burning up, they\u2019re called a meteorite., 2:B - Halloumi cheese is very dense in a type of protein called casein, and these strong protein strands squeak when they rub against your teeth., 3:C - Sheep are very clever, and one farming researcher discovered that as they go to eat nettles, they move their lips to a shape that helps them avoid the stinging., 4:B - Fish have an inactive phase at night that looks like \u201csleep\u201d \u2013 though it might be more resting than sleeping. If you go snorkelling at night, you\u2019ll see them resting in holes in rocks where they are protected, or floating on the floor of the ocean.

Do clocks go forward, or back in October? And more questions answered in your quick guide</a> </p> </aside> <h2>Why is it still controversial?</h2>  <p>Daylight saving is most controversial in Queensland, the only jurisdiction on the east coast that doesn\u2019t wind the clock forward by one hour in spring and back by one hour in autumn. The state trialled DST for three years before it held a referendum on the subject in 1992. In the tightly contested vote, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/queensland-daylight-savings-time-dst-referendum-brisbane-lord-mayor-adrian-schrinner\">54.5% of Queenslanders voted against daylight saving and 45.5% voted in favour</a>. As our columnist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/30/daylight-saving-time-changes-australia-farmers-rural-areas\">Gabrielle Chan explains</a>, \u201cin Queensland, it borders on a culture war\u201d \u2013 the south-eastern part of the state has voted in far greater numbers in favour of DST compared to the rest of the state.</p> <p>It is also controversial among Australia\u2019s rural populations, including the NSW Farmers Association, which recently voted in support of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/25/daylight-saving-nsw-changes-farmers-campaign\">campaign to clip the hours of daylight saving</a>.</p> <p>Daylight saving makes less and less sense the closer you get to the equator, because there is less variation in daylight hours as seasons change in the tropics, according to veterinarian Dr Joanne Sillince, the CEO of the Australian Chicken Growers Council. \u201cAt the equator the sun goes up and down the same time each day. Daylight saving works best where day lengths are the longest, which is the further north and south you go.\u201d</p> <h2>Is it also controversial around the world?</h2>  <p>Most Europeans and Americans observe daylight saving, but the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/10/26/most-countries-dont-observe-daylight-saving-time/\">Pew Research Centre</a> says they are \u201cmore the exception than the rule\u201d and that most countries do not observe DST.</p> <p>Professional scientific societies that study biological rhythms, including the <a href=\"https://aasm.org/american-academy-of-sleep-medicine-calls-for-elimination-of-daylight-saving-time/\">American Society of Sleep Medicine</a>, the <a href=\"https://srbr.org/why-we-should-let-the-sun-set-on-daylight-saving-time/#:~:text=The%20American%20Academy%20of%20Sleep,favor%20of%20the%20maintenance%20of\">Society for Research on Biological Rhythms</a> and the <a href=\"https://esrs.eu/news/joint-statement-to-the-eu-commission-on-dst/\">European Society for Sleep Research</a>, have called to abolish daylight saving time because of the health burdens associated with it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://imb.uq.edu.au/article/2023/10/why-are-scientists-so-against-daylight-saving\">Queensland University researchers say</a> DST disrupts the balance whereby the sunrise\u2019s brightness helps people wake and the evening\u2019s darkening promotes sleep.

      "bodyText": "As October begins, love it or hate it, so too does daylight saving. Each year, the clocks move forward on the first Sunday of October \u2013 but only for about half the states. Sydney and Melbourne will remain in sync but Brisbane will be left behind. Perth, which is ordinarily hours behind the east coast, will lag even further, while communities on the Queensland-New South Wales border will begin their annual six-month headache. It\u2019s controversial among Queenslanders and sleep scientists. But others love it \u2013 and vets say animals just get on with it, being \u201cmuch more pragmatic than humans are\u201d. When does daylight savings start in Australia? Time will jump forward an hour when the clock strikes 2am on Sunday. That means when local standard time is about to reach 2am, clocks are turned forward one hour to 3am local time instead. Australians living in states and territories observing daylight saving will effectively lose an hour, but gain extra sunlight in the evenings. Sunrise and sunset will be about one hour later on 6 October than the day before. But as summer approaches, there will be increasingly more light in the evening and less light in the morning. Daylight saving will end (and the clocks will go back an hour) the first Sunday of April \u2013 6 April 2025. Where does daylight saving time apply? Daylight saving time (DST) is used in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. Western Australia, Queensland and Northern Territory don\u2019t use DST Why is it still controversial? Daylight saving is most controversial in Queensland, the only jurisdiction on the east coast that doesn\u2019t wind the clock forward by one hour in spring and back by one hour in autumn. The state trialled DST for three years before it held a referendum on the subject in 1992. In the tightly contested vote, 54.5% of Queenslanders voted against daylight saving and 45.5% voted in favour. As our columnist Gabrielle Chan explains, \u201cin Queensland, it borders on a culture war\u201d \u2013 the south-eastern part of the state has voted in far greater numbers in favour of DST compared to the rest of the state. It is also controversial among Australia\u2019s rural populations, including the NSW Farmers Association, which recently voted in support of a campaign to clip the hours of daylight saving. Daylight saving makes less and less sense the closer you get to the equator, because there is less variation in daylight hours as seasons change in the tropics, according to veterinarian Dr Joanne Sillince, the CEO of the Australian Chicken Growers Council. \u201cAt the equator the sun goes up and down the same time each day. Daylight saving works best where day lengths are the longest, which is the further north and south you go.\u201d Is it also controversial around the world? Most Europeans and Americans observe daylight saving, but the Pew Research Centre says they are \u201cmore the exception than the rule\u201d and that most countries do not observe DST. Professional scientific societies that study biological rhythms, including the American Society of Sleep Medicine, the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms and the European Society for Sleep Research, have called to abolish daylight saving time because of the health burdens associated with it. Queensland University researchers say DST disrupts the balance whereby the sunrise\u2019s brightness helps people wake and the evening\u2019s darkening promotes sleep. Daylight saving can lead to delayed bedtimes, which in turn can lead to inadequate sleep, which has been associated with decreased attention, increased metabolic and cardiovascular issues, mood disorders and even a shortened lifespan. How does it affect animals? Why does it affect pets? Despite the claims of the former Queensland premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, who said daylight saving confused milking cows, Sillince \u2013 who is also the managing director of Pets Australia \u2013 says animals are not affected because their body clocks are determined by when the sun goes up and down. \u201cBut they are sensitive to the change in behaviour of their human companion,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re a dog or a cat you\u2019re about to get fed an hour earlier. My home-based animals love daylight saving. \u201cA long history of experience with all species is that they adjust a lot quicker than the humans do,\u201d Sillince says. \u201cAnimals are much more pragmatic than humans are.

More than 1 million people have been displaced since then, Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, said on Thursday.</p> \n<p>Huge explosions shook the sky in the vicinity of Beirut\u2019s main airport in the early hours of Friday. Although the airport is still open, only Lebanon\u2019s national flag carrier, Middle East Airlines, will fly there. People have been fighting for the few seats left on departing flights, while embassies have been chartering private flights for their nationals. On Friday, Greece sent a C-130 military transport plane to Beirut to evacuate 60 Greek and Cypriot citizens.</p> \n<p>Some private jets will no longer touch down in the airport, the owner of a private plane told the Guardian. They said their plane was grounded in Paphos airport in Cyprus for insurance purposes.</p> \n<p>Instagram is full of sponsored content advertising boats to people who want to flee Lebanon by any means possible. Some boats resemble those that for years have departed from the northern Lebanese port of Tripoli towards Cyprus or Italy, overloaded with Syrian refugees hoping for a better life.</p> \n<p>\u201cLots of people have been asking for these trips \u2026 Even though the airport is still open, people who have money are willing to pay,\u201d Bechara said. The boats he worked with held up to 15 people, were insured and were fully compliant with safety standards, he added.</p> \n<p>Most Lebanese people cannot afford a space on luxury yachts, and many do not have the visa required to land on Cyprus;s shores.</p> \n<p>Sahar Sourani, a 33-year-old Lebanese woman who works for an international NGO, has been trying to figure out a way to get her parents and brother\u2019s family out of the country. Her family left Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, after an Israeli airstrike levelled a nearby residential building on 20 September, killing 45 people.</p> \n<p>Sourani\u2019s family cannot travel via boat to Cyprus due to its prohibitive cost and the visa requirements. They planned to travel to the border with Syria and take a bus through Syria to Amman, Jordan, where they would then board a flight to Muscat, Oman, where her sister lives.</p> \n<p>The Lebanese government has said that more than 300,000 people have crossed from Lebanon into Syria over the last 10 days to escape Israel\u2019s bombing campaign. On Friday morning, however, they woke up to news that Masnaa, the main border crossing to Syria, had been bombed by Israel, after the Israeli military claimed that Hezbollah was using it to smuggle weapons into Lebanon.</p> \n<p>Sourani immediately called a travel agency, who managed to book her parents on separate flights, a little over a week from now. They could not travel on the same flight due to a lack of availability seats.<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that the airport is going to close before they get to leave. I\u2019ve been checking the calendar and counting the days. Things are getting crazier every day,\u201d Sourani said. She herself will not leave, as she is waiting to see whether or not fighting affects her neighbourhood in Achrafieh, east Beirut.</p> \n<p>\u201cI never imagined or accepted to leave Lebanon fleeing. I might have left here because I found a better opportunity elsewhere, this is life. But being forced to leave, no one would accept this,\u201d Sourani said.</p> \n<p>For those who have managed to leave Lebanon, their journeys were fraught with difficulty. Rasha Jabr, a 39-year-old consultant working in the humanitarian field, was struggling to find any place on a flight for her and her daughter, who was supposed to start university in Germany next week.</p> \n<p>Her husband advised her to pack her things and go to the airport every day at 6am to wait on standby in case someone did not show up to their flight. Eventually, through an enterprising travel agent, she managed to find a seats on a plane heading to the United Arab Emirates. <br><br>As she put her bags in the car to head to the airport on Thursday night, bombing began near her house in Choueifat, a neighbourhood close to the southern suburbs of Beirut. \u201cAs we were putting out stuff in the car, black dust was falling all over us because of the chemicals in the missiles,\u201d Jabr said.</p> \n<p>Israel was carrying out some of the most intensive strikes since the beginning of the war, in what it said were strikes targeting Hashem Safieddine, the presumed successor of the late secretary general of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by the Israeli military killed last week.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was in the airport as they were bombing, just thinking, will they bomb the plane? Will they bomb the airport?\u201d Jabr said. With smoke from Israeli bombing visible from the airport, her plane took off and she made it to the UAE. \u201cI am more fortunate than others because I have the option, because I have the residency in Dubai, but I have a feeling of hidden guilt, and that\u2019s not something we can process easily,\u201d Jabr said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Princess 2010 yacht is an impressive specimen of a boat. Before the war, its gleaming white hull could be seen cruising Lebanon\u2019s coastline, revellers making sure they enjoyed every inch of the 24-metre-long vessel they each paid $600 to ride. Since Israel started an intense bombing campaign across wide swathes of Lebanon on 23 September, the Princess has been making a very different type of journey. The $1.3m craft has been ferrying families from Beirut to Cyprus, bottles of champagne replaced by hastily packed suitcases. \u201cThe trips are fully booked, we have done about 30 trips on our two boats since the bombing started [on 23 September],\u201d said Khailil Bechara, a broker who works with ship captains to transport people to Cyprus. At $1,800 a head, a seat on a boat bound for Cyprus is not cheap. But demand is high as people desperately try to find any route out of Lebanon. Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed nearly 2,000 people and wounded more than 9,000 since fighting between it and Hezbollah started on 8 October last year, with most of those casualties incurred since 23 September. More than 1 million people have been displaced since then, Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, said on Thursday. Huge explosions shook the sky in the vicinity of Beirut\u2019s main airport in the early hours of Friday. Although the airport is still open, only Lebanon\u2019s national flag carrier, Middle East Airlines, will fly there. People have been fighting for the few seats left on departing flights, while embassies have been chartering private flights for their nationals. On Friday, Greece sent a C-130 military transport plane to Beirut to evacuate 60 Greek and Cypriot citizens. Some private jets will no longer touch down in the airport, the owner of a private plane told the Guardian. They said their plane was grounded in Paphos airport in Cyprus for insurance purposes. Instagram is full of sponsored content advertising boats to people who want to flee Lebanon by any means possible. Some boats resemble those that for years have departed from the northern Lebanese port of Tripoli towards Cyprus or Italy, overloaded with Syrian refugees hoping for a better life. \u201cLots of people have been asking for these trips \u2026 Even though the airport is still open, people who have money are willing to pay,\u201d Bechara said. The boats he worked with held up to 15 people, were insured and were fully compliant with safety standards, he added. Most Lebanese people cannot afford a space on luxury yachts, and many do not have the visa required to land on Cyprus;s shores. Sahar Sourani, a 33-year-old Lebanese woman who works for an international NGO, has been trying to figure out a way to get her parents and brother\u2019s family out of the country. Her family left Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, after an Israeli airstrike levelled a nearby residential building on 20 September, killing 45 people. Sourani\u2019s family cannot travel via boat to Cyprus due to its prohibitive cost and the visa requirements. They planned to travel to the border with Syria and take a bus through Syria to Amman, Jordan, where they would then board a flight to Muscat, Oman, where her sister lives. The Lebanese government has said that more than 300,000 people have crossed from Lebanon into Syria over the last 10 days to escape Israel\u2019s bombing campaign. On Friday morning, however, they woke up to news that Masnaa, the main border crossing to Syria, had been bombed by Israel, after the Israeli military claimed that Hezbollah was using it to smuggle weapons into Lebanon. Sourani immediately called a travel agency, who managed to book her parents on separate flights, a little over a week from now. They could not travel on the same flight due to a lack of availability seats. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the airport is going to close before they get to leave. I\u2019ve been checking the calendar and counting the days. Things are getting crazier every day,\u201d Sourani said. She herself will not leave, as she is waiting to see whether or not fighting affects her neighbourhood in Achrafieh, east Beirut. \u201cI never imagined or accepted to leave Lebanon fleeing. I might have left here because I found a better opportunity elsewhere, this is life. But being forced to leave, no one would accept this,\u201d Sourani said. For those who have managed to leave Lebanon, their journeys were fraught with difficulty. Rasha Jabr, a 39-year-old consultant working in the humanitarian field, was struggling to find any place on a flight for her and her daughter, who was supposed to start university in Germany next week. Her husband advised her to pack her things and go to the airport every day at 6am to wait on standby in case someone did not show up to their flight. Eventually, through an enterprising travel agent, she managed to find a seats on a plane heading to the United Arab Emirates. As she put her bags in the car to head to the airport on Thursday night, bombing began near her house in Choueifat, a neighbourhood close to the southern suburbs of Beirut. \u201cAs we were putting out stuff in the car, black dust was falling all over us because of the chemicals in the missiles,\u201d Jabr said. Israel was carrying out some of the most intensive strikes since the beginning of the war, in what it said were strikes targeting Hashem Safieddine, the presumed successor of the late secretary general of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by the Israeli military killed last week. \u201cI was in the airport as they were bombing, just thinking, will they bomb the plane? Will they bomb the airport?\u201d Jabr said. With smoke from Israeli bombing visible from the airport, her plane took off and she made it to the UAE. \u201cI am more fortunate than others because I have the option, because I have the residency in Dubai, but I have a feeling of hidden guilt, and that\u2019s not something we can process easily,\u201d Jabr said.",

I grew up in Lebanon, but left during the civil war. I then returned to Beirut in 2016 and have been living here since. I almost hesitated to share my story as I feel I\u2019m super privileged compared to people who experienced the bombings and had to flee their homes (over the past week). Then I figured we also need to show that war affects everyone, including those who are not directly under the bombs.</p> \n  <p>I live in Achrafieh, which is quite close to the neighbourhood of <strong>Dahiyeh</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/28/israel-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah\">the area of Beirut where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated last Friday</a>). I was awoken at night by bombings not too far away late on Friday, after Nasrallah was killed, and have been checking compulsively on social media and media what happened, and if everyone I know is safe. I heard a strike at least every hour that night, they were bombing in Dahiyeh. My immediate neighbourhood has been spared by airstrikes so far, but you pretty much constantly hear the drones, which sound as if you have a lawnmower in your apartment.</p> \n  <p>On Saturday morning, I filmed clouds of smoke from my balcony over Dahiyeh. I left Beirut on Saturday. I need to sleep at night. When I briefly came back to Beirut before leaving again on Monday, cafes and restaurants were open during the day, but it was rather quiet.</p> \n  <p>I am now staying with a friend near <strong>Jounieh</strong>, about 20 minutes from my home. I am worrying about my friends who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/israeli-soldiers-killed-hezbollah-lebanon\">from the south</a> or Dahiyeh whose families did not want<strong> </strong>to leave or could not leave. My parents stayed in their apartment in Achrafieh. Every day I tell them, \u201clet\u2019s go to the mountains\u201d (because it might be safer there), but they are pretty old, my father is 93. They are fairly confident that Achrafieh won\u2019t be targeted. I don\u2019t share their confidence.</p> \n  <p>Most of my friends here are dual-nationals or foreigners, and all my friends who are foreign nationals have now left Lebanon. I\u2019m lucky because I mostly work online, but I\u2019m struggling to focus at work because my anxiety levels skyrocket, feeling my own pain and the pain of everyone around me, not knowing when and if I will see my friends and family who are abroad again.</p> \n  <p>I have been securing as much food and medicine as possible for my parents, and have been getting my gas tank refilled as often as possible. After the pager explosions, my mother said that the constant sound of the ambulances reminded her of the blast on 4 August, 2020. I worry that hospitals might be too crowded to treat my father<strong> </strong>if he needs it.</p> \n  <p>I have packed my bag in case I need to evacuate quickly. I\u2019m struggling to find moments of joy or contentment that can keep me afloat, and am fearing that the next strike will kill or injure someone I know.</p> \n  <p>If we decide to leave for good or are forced to leave for good, I don\u2019t know where we would go. We\u2019re lucky enough to have French passports, so we can travel more easily. But, even though my father is in fairly good physical shape, it\u2019s not easy for him to travel.</p> \n  <p>Before Nasrallah was assassinated, I had booked flights for myself and my parents to go to Cyprus, where my parents own a house. We are scheduled to be on a flight to Cyprus this Saturday, so we\u2019re leaving - except if they bomb the airport. In my parents\u2019 minds we are coming back after one week, but I don\u2019t know if we will.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-04T10:47:39.502Z\">at 11.47am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-66ffbd058f0809b6ab31a510\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-04T10:21:07.522Z\">11.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary of the day so far...</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p>A source close to Hezbollah told the AFP news agency that Israel had conducted 11 consecutive strikes on the militant group\u2019s stronghold in Beirut on Thursday night. <strong>Hashem Safieddine</strong>, the most likely person to replace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/28/israel-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah\">Hassan Nasrallah as leader of Hezbollah</a> and the head of its executive council, was the target of the strikes, the New York Times and Axios reported, citing Israeli officials.</p></li> \n   <li><p>An Israeli strike on Friday morning near Lebanon\u2019s <strong>Masnaa border crossing</strong> with Syria cut off a road used by hundreds of thousands of people to flee Israeli bombardments in recent days, Lebanon\u2019s transport minister <strong>Ali Hamieh</strong> <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/04/israel-lebanon-hamas-hezbollah-war-live-updates-hashem-safieddine-beirut-west-bank-strikes?page=with:block-66ffa6fd8f0818b7c81cc43d#block-66ffa6fd8f0818b7c81cc43d\">told Reuters</a>.

Reuters reports: The meeting is one of several attempts in recent days to mend fences with Muslim and Arab voters, who resoundingly backed Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 but could withhold their votes from Harris in numbers that would cost her the key state of Michigan. During the half-hour meeting, Harris expressed her concern on the scale of suffering in Gaza, civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon and discussed efforts to end the war, according to a campaign official. She also discussed efforts to prevent a regional war, the official added. Wa\u2019el Alzayat, CEO of Emgage Action which recently endorsed her, said participants shared their deep disappointment with the US handling of the crisis and called on her to do everything in her power to end the war and reset US policy in the region. \u201cEmgage Action asked Vice President Harris to impress upon President Biden the urgency of bringing an immediate end to the violence\u201d in Gaza and Lebanon, Alzayat said. \u201cShe agrees that this war needs to end.\u201d Jim Zogby, founder of the Arab American Institute and a longtime member of the Democratic National Committee, said he declined the invitation. Leaders from the Uncommitted National Movement protest campaign said they were not invited to the meeting. Hala Hijazi, a longtime friend of Harris who has lost dozens of members of her family in Gaza, was unable to attend. Harris, a Democrat, faces Republican former President Donald Trump on 5 November in what opinion polls show to be a tight presidential race. Both candidates have roughly even levels of support among Arab Americans, according to a poll published this week by the Arab American Institute. A series of loud blasts was heard over southern Beirut in the early hours of Saturday morning, following Israeli airstrikes. The Israeli military had earlier issued evacuation orders for parts of the capital\u2019s southern suburbs. The first alert warned residents in a building in the Burj al-Barajneh neighbourhood and the second in a building in Choueifat district. The third alert mentioned buildings in Haret Hreik as well as Burj al-Barajneh. Images coming in from news agencies show smoke rising over Dahieh, close to the airport. A series of explosions has been heard over southern Beirut, according to reports. The Israeli military earlier issued evacuation orders for parts of the capital\u2019s southern suburbs. More details to follow as we get them. AFP has some further detail on clashes occurring near the Lebanon border. Hezbollah earlier said it had forced Israeli soldiers retreat, reports AFP, however it has since said it is engaged in ongoing clashes with Israeli troops in the area. \u201cIsraeli enemy soldiers renewed an attempt to advance towards the vicinity of the municipality in the village of Adaysseh\u201d and Hezbollah fighters confronted the attempt \u201cand clashes are continuing\u201d, the group said in a statement. Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah said on Saturday that the Israeli army is trying to infiltrate the Lebanese southern town of Odaisseh, adding that clashes are ongoing, reports Reuters. More details to follow as we get them. Israel should strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in response to its recent missile barrage, Donald Trump said at a campaign event on Friday, reports AFP. Trump, speaking in North Carolina, referred to a question posed to Biden this week about the possibility of Israel targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear program, saying: \u201cWhen they asked him that question, the answer should have been, hit the nuclear first, and worry about the rest later.\u201d Iran launched more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday. Most were intercepted, but some landed on and around densely populated areas and Israeli military bases. The Salah Ghandour Hospital \u2013 one of at least four hospitals that has announced the suspension of work amid the ongoing Israeli bombardment \u2013 said shelling on Friday \u201cresulted in nine members of the medical and nursing staff being injured, most of them seriously,\u201d while most of the medical staff were evacuated. The hospital is based in the town of Bint Jbeil. The World Health Organization has said 28 health workers in Lebanon had been killed over the past 24 hours. It\u2019s 2am in Tel Aviv, Beirut and Gaza. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: At least one blast was reported and smoke seen over Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in the early hours of Saturday, as the Israeli military issued new alerts for residents of the Burj al-Barajneh and Choueifat neighbourhoods to immediately evacuate. The Israeli military launched a series of strikes on southern Beirut on Thursday night, in one of the most intense bombardments on the city since the campaign began last week. A source close to Hezbollah told the AFP news agency that Israel had conducted 11 consecutive strikes on the group\u2019s stronghold in the Lebanese capital. Hashem Safieddine, the most likely candidate to replace Hassan Nasrallah as leader of Hezbollah, was the target of the strikes, according to reports. The result of the attacks, said to have targeted a meeting of senior Hezbollah figures, is unclear. The Israeli military also ordered people in 20 more southern towns in Lebanon to evacuate immediately as it presses ahead with its incursions. More than 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in nearly a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, according to figures by the Lebanese government on Wednesday. Most have been killed in the past two weeks, when cross-border fighting turned into a wide-ranging Israeli assault. A spokesperson for the UN\u2019s secretary general said the toll on civilians in Lebanon from Israel\u2019s campaign against Hezbollah is \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d. At least four hospitals in Lebanon announced the suspension of work amid the ongoing Israeli bombardment. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Najib Mikati, urged the international community to pressure Israel \u201cto allow rescue and relief teams to reach bombed sites and allow them to move\u201d casualties. On Thursday, the head of the World Health Organization said 28 health workers in Lebanon have been killed in the space of 24 hours. Israel cut off a key road near to Lebanon\u2019s Masnaa border crossing with Syria that has been used by hundreds of thousands of people to flee Israeli bombardments in recent days. Israel has accused Hezbollah of using border crossings with Syria to bring in weapons and amid evidence that Israel is targeting key roads, both international routes and internally, as it did during the 2006 war. More than 300,000 people \u2013 a vast majority of them Syrian \u2013 have crossed from Lebanon into Syria over the past 10 days to escape escalating Israeli bombardment, according to Lebanon\u2019s government. The northern regions of Israel were targeted by Hezbollah rockets almost continuously throughout Friday. The Israel Defense Forces said Hezbollah had launched about 100 rockets into Israel on Friday. Hezbollah said fighters had targeted \u201can Israeli enemy troop force during its advance\u201d towards an area west of the border village of Yarun \u201cwith artillery shells and a rocket salvo\u201d, and it claimed responsibility for a series of attacks on Israeli soldiers across the border earlier in the day. Joe Biden, the US president, urged Israel against striking Iran\u2019s oil facilities. Biden told reporters on Friday that Israel is \u201cnot going to make a decision immediately\u201d on how to retaliate against Iran\u2019s missile attacks earlier this week, but that \u201cIf I were in their shoes, I\u2019d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oilfields.\u201d Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed that Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza will re-emerge strongly with new leaders. In a rare public sermon in front of tens of thousands in Tehran on Friday, Khamenei defended the \u201clegal and legitimate\u201d ballistic missile attack on Israel this week that Iran has said was in retaliation for the deaths of the Hezbollah secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, and the Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, visited Beirut on Friday to meet Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, and speaker of parliament, Nabih Berri \u2013 a close ally of Hezbollah. \u201cBe sure that the Islamic Republic of Iran is and will be firmly standing by the friends in Lebanon,\u201d Araghchi told reporters, adding that if Israel carries out another attack on Iran, Tehran will retaliate in a harsh way. At least 29 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip on Friday, according to medics. Israeli attacks continued across Gaza on Friday, including in the city of Deir al-Balah, where an Israeli strike on a home has killed at least four people, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. The military also launched bombs that ignited fires in homes in the Nuseirat refugee camp, while Israeli warplanes struck several sites in the southern city of Khan Younis, \u201cresulting in further casualties and injuries\u201d, Wafa reported. Gaza\u2019s health ministry said at least 41,802 people have been killed and 96,844 injured in Israeli military attacks on Gaza since last October in its latest update on Friday. The ministry has said thousands are most likely lost in the rubble. Much of the Palestinian territory\u2019s infrastructure has been destroyed by Israeli strikes, as well as its health facilities and schools. Israeli soldiers conducted widespread raids in the Hebron province in the occupied West Bank on Friday morning, resulting in the detention of more than 24 people, including \u201cminors\u201d, the Palestinian news agency reported. The majority of those detained were reportedly taken from the town of Beit Ummar. Human rights groups and international organisations have alleged widespread abuse of inmates detained by Israel in raids in the occupied West Bank. Funerals were held on Friday for some of the 18 people killed in the occupied West Bank in an Israeli airstrike on a refugee camp in Tulkarm. Among the dead, according to Palestinan reports, was a family of four including two children. A spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, described the attack as a \u201cheinous crime\u201d and a \u201cmassacre\u201d. The attack was condemned by the UN rights office. Hamas\u2019 armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, confirmed that one of its commanders, Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi, and seven other fighters were killed in the Israeli strike. US forces carried out strikes on 15 targets in areas of Yemen controlled by the Houthi rebels on Friday, the US military confirmed. The media in Yemen reported a new round of airstrikes, including on the capital, Sana\u2019a, and near the airport at the port of Hodeidah, and Israeli strikes continued in Gaza and Lebanon. The strikes were targeted at weapons systems, bases and other equipment belonging to the Iran-backed group, US officials said. The Guardian understands that that there was no UK involvement in the airstrikes on Friday. The last UK-government chartered flight for British nationals to leave Lebanon will depart from Beirut on Sunday. More than 250 British nationals have left Lebanon on flights chartered by government, the UK Foreign Office said on Friday. There are no more scheduled flights \u201cdue to a decrease in demand\u201d although this will be kept under \u201cconstant\u201d review, it said. Many countries around the world are working to organise flights out of Lebanon so that its citizens can escape the escalating conflict there. At least one blast has been reported and smoke seen over Beirut\u2019s southern suburb, Reuters is reporting. It comes shortly after the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for civilians in a specific building in the Burj al Barajneh neighbourhood of the Lebanese capital. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has also issued a new evacuation order just minutes ago for a specific building, warning people to stay away from the area by more than 500 metres. Israel has not assured the US that targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities is off the table, a US state department official told CNN on Friday. Asked if Israel has given assurances to the Biden administration that Iran\u2019s nuclear sites are off the table, the official said: We hope and expect to see some wisdom as well as strength, but as you guys know, no guarantees. The official added that it was \u201creally hard to tell\u201d if Israeli will use the anniversary of the Hamas attacks on 7 October to retaliate against Iranian ballistic missile strikes earlier this week. Germany\u2019s foreign ministry has said that an Israeli airstrike on Tulkarm refugee camp in the occupied West Bank that killed at least 18 people was \u201cshocking\u201d. In a statement, the German ministry said: The high number of civilian casualties in an Israeli air strike in Tulkarm is shocking. In the fight against terror, the Israeli army is obliged to protect civilians in the West Bank. The Israeli military has issued new evacuation orders for residents of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs ahead of expected Israeli airstrikes on the Lebanese capital. Avichay Adraee, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, posted a map showing a specific area and ordering civilians to leave the area. We reported earlier that three Lebanese hospitals announced the suspension of work amid the ongoing Israeli bombardment. That figure has gone up to four, according to AFP. The grounds of the Salah Ghandour hospital in Bint Jbeil in south Lebanon were \u201csubject to Israeli artillery shelling\u201d, Lebanese national news agency NNA reported. Mohammed Sleiman, director of the Islamic Health Committee-run facility, told the news agecny that seven medical personnel were wounded when the hospital was struck \u201cdirectly\u201d, adding that the facility was evacuated. Mais al-Jabal hospital in south Lebanon on the border with Israel announced \u201cthe halt to work of all departments\u201d, the news agency reported, citing factors including \u201cenemy targeting of the hospital\u201d since last October and problems for supply lines and staff access. Sainte Therese hospital, on the edge of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, said it suffered \u201chuge damage\u201d after \u201cIsraeli warplanes\u2019 target[ed] the vicinity\u201d of the facility on Thursday which \u201cled to the halt of hospital services\u201d. The head of the Marjayoun government hospital, Mounes Kalakesh, told multiple news outlets that an Israeli airstrike \u201ctargeted ambulances at the main entrance to the hospital\u201d. Five paramedics were killed and seven were wounded, he said. The UN\u2019s humanitarian coordinator in Lebanon has released an additional $2m from the Lebanon humanitarian fund to help address the deteriorating situation, a spokesperson for the UN chief said. St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesperson for the UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said the latest funds came in addition to $10m already released from the Lebanon fund, and $10m from the UN\u2019s main central emergency response fund. In a separate statement, he said the toll on civilians in Lebanon from Israel\u2019s campaign against Hezbollah is \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d, adding: All parties must do whatever they can at all times to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure and ensure that civilians are never put in harm\u2019s way. A US citizen was killed in Lebanon this week, a US state department spokesperson has confirmed, adding that Washington was working to understand the circumstances of the incident. Kamel Ahmad Jawad, from Dearborn, Michigan, was killed in Lebanon in an Israeli airstrike on Tuesday, according to his daughter, a friend and the US congresswoman representing his district, Reuters reported. State department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Friday: We are aware and alarmed of reports of the death of Kamel Jawad, who we have confirmed is a US citizen \u2026 It is a moral and strategic imperative that Israel take all feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm. Any loss of civilian life is a tragedy. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has accused Israel of \u201cshamelessly\u201d attacking the UN\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Israel Katz, said on Wednesday that he was barring Guterres from entering the country, accusing the UN chief of failing to specifically condemn Iran\u2019s missile attack on the country this week. Katz called Guterres an \u201canti-Israel secretary-general who lends support to terrorists, rapists, and murderers\u201d and declared him persona non grata. Guterres pointedly condemned Iran\u2019s attack at a UN security council meeting on Wednesday. The security council has expressed its full support to the UN secretary general. On Friday, Erdo\u011fan said Israel \u201cis shamelessly challenging\u201d Guterres and that \u201c196 countries in the world will stand by the UN secretary-general\u201d. It\u2019s nearly midnight in Tel Aviv, Beirut and Gaza. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: Joe Biden, the US president, urged Israel against striking Iran\u2019s oil facilities. Biden told reporters on Friday that Israel is \u201cnot going to make a decision immediately\u201d on how to retaliate against Iran\u2019s missile attacks earlier this week, but that \u201cIf I were in their shoes, I\u2019d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oilfields.\u201d Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed that Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza will re-emerge strongly with new leaders.

Israel\u2019s military said it killed Hezbollah communications commander, Muhammad Rashid Skafi, in strikes on Beirut on Thursday. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has estimated it has killed about 250 Hezbollah fighters, including several battalion and company commanders, since the start of its ground operation in Lebanon earlier this week. It said its fighter jets struck Hezbollah targets near a key Lebanese-Syrian border crossing overnight. The northern regions of Israel were targeted by Hezbollah rockets almost continuously throughout Friday. The Israel Defense Forces said Hezbollah had launched about 100 rockets into Israel on Friday.

The Guardian understands that that there was no UK involvement in the airstrikes on Friday. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said the Middle East sits on the \u201cprecipice of a region-wide armed conflict\u201d after Israeli strikes in Lebanon intensified overnight on Friday. The ICRC said that civilians have \u201cborne the brunt\u201d of conflict over the last year, with the kidnapping of hostages in Israel, Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, and now civilians in Lebanon being killed by Israeli attacks. The last UK-government chartered flight for British nationals to leave Lebanon will depart from Beirut on Sunday. More than 250 British nationals have left Lebanon on flights chartered by government, the UK Foreign Office said on Friday. There are no more scheduled flights \u201cdue to a decrease in demand\u201d although this will be kept under \u201cconstant\u201d review, it said. Many countries around the world are working to organise flights out of Lebanon so that its citizens can escape the escalating conflict there. Hamas\u2019 armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, has confirmed the death of one of its commanders in an Israeli airstrike on the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarm on Thursday. Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi and seven other fighters were killed in the Israeli strike, the group said. The Israeli military accused Oufi of participating in numerous attacks in the West Bank and said he was in the process of planning another assault. At least 18 people were killed in the strike on the refugee camp in Tulkarm. Among the dead was a family of four including two children, according to Palestinian reports. The UK government said it has chartered a flight to leave Beirut on Sunday to support British nationals who want to leave Lebanon. More than 250 British nationals have left Lebanon on flights chartered by government, the UK Foreign Office said on Friday. It added: There are no more scheduled flights, although we will continue to keep this under review. Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, David Lammy, said: The situation in Lebanon remains volatile, so I am glad that we have helped the many people who have heeded our advice to leave the country immediately. With demand falling, and the security situation deteriorating, there is no guarantee other options to leave quickly will become available. I urge anyone who wants to leave to register now. There have been protests in Yemen today against Israel and western support for Israel in its war in Gaza, on a mission to destroy Hamas, and attacks on Lebanon in retaliation for months of strikes on Israel by the Hezbollah power base there. Here are some news agency images: Some carry weapons. New recruits. Large demonstration in the Yemeni capital. Joe Biden also said he is trying to rally the rest of the world to participate in tamping down conflict in the Middle East and avoid all-out war. At the White House a little earlier, the US president took questions from gathered media at the daily press briefing, the first time he has done so from that exact podium in his presidency. With conflict ramping up in the region, not quietening down, it is hard to see a concrete result from Biden\u2019s efforts, even though he said his people are working 12 hours a day in constant contact with Israeli counterparts. When asked if it was fair to say that he had little personal influence over Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden said \u201cno\u201d. And he reiterated that his plan for a ceasefire in Gaza \u201creceived the support of the United Nations Security Council and the vast majority of our allies around the world as a way to bring this to an end\u201d, although clearly to no avail thus far. He also reiterated that \u201cIsrael has every right to respond to vicious attacks on them, not just from Iran but from everyone from Hezbollah, the Houthis, anyway, but the fact is they have to be very much more careful about dealing with civilian casualties.\u201d Here\u2019s more from Joe Biden\u2019s briefing at the White House, during which he told reporters that he would consider alternatives to striking Iranian oilfields if he were in Israel\u2019s shoes. Asked if he thought that by not engaging in diplomacy, Israel\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Nentanyahu was trying to influence the upcoming US general election, Biden replied: Whether he is trying to influence the election, I don\u2019t know but I am not counting on that. He added that \u201cno administration has done more to help Israel than I have.\u201d Here\u2019s our video report on the latest US airstrikes on more than a dozen Houthi targets in Yemen. US forces carried out strikes on 15 targets in areas of Yemen controlled by the Houthi rebels, the US military has confirmed. The Guardian understands that that there was no UK involvement in Friday\u2019s airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. US president Joe Biden, speaking to reporters in Washington just now, urged Israel against striking Iran\u2019s oil facilities. If I were in their shoes, I\u2019d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oilfields. On Thursday, Biden said the US was \u201cdiscussing\u201d with Israel the possibility of Israeli strikes on Iran\u2019s oil infrastructure. His off-the-cuff remark, which immediately sent oil prices soaring, did not make clear whether his administration was holding internal discussions or talking directly to Israel, nor did he clarify what his attitude was to such an attack. Asked to clarify those comments, Biden told reporters today: Look, the Israelis have not concluded what they\u2019re going to do in terms of a strike. That\u2019s under discussion. Joe Biden, the US president, has been speaking at a news conference on Friday. Biden said no administration \u201chas helped Israel more than I have\u201d and that Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, \u201cshould remember\u201d that. He said Israel is \u201cnot going to make a decision immediately\u201d on how to retaliate against Iran\u2019s missile attacks earlier this week. Israel has \u201cevery right to respond\u201d to attacks on them from Iranians and others like Hezbollah, he said, adding: But the fact is that [the Israelis] have to be very much more careful about dealing with civilian casualties. More than 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in nearly a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, according to figures by the Lebanese government. Most have been killed in the past two weeks, when cross-border fighting turned into a wide-ranging Israeli assault, the government said, Reuters reported. We reported earlier that a third UK government chartered flight for British nationals has left Lebanon on Friday. Ireland\u2019s Miche\u00e1l Martin has confirmed that 24 Irish citizens and dependents have been evacuated from Lebanon on Friday. Germany is flying another 219 of its nationals out of Lebanon on its third military flight this week. This brings to 460 the total number of German citizens evacuated from Lebanon on German military flights. A flight carrying 11 Japanese citizens, a non-Japanese relative of one of them, and four French nationals left Lebanon and arrived in Jordan on Friday, according to Japan\u2019s foreign ministry. A Dutch military transport plane landed in Beirut earlier on Friday to pick up citizens of the Netherlands, with scores of people expected to board the plane. The US state department said about 350 American citizens, green card holders and family members have now left Lebanon on US-organised contract flights this week. Three Lebanese hospitals have announced the suspension of work amid the ongoing Israeli bombardment, which has led to the deaths of dozens of on-duty medics in the past week. As my colleague William Christou reported earlier, the entire staff of Marjayoun public hospital in south Lebanon were evacuated on Friday morning after an Israeli drone strike killed four paramedics, putting the hospital out of service, the country\u2019s national news agency (NNA) reported. The hospital was one of the major medical providers in south Lebanon, particularly as Israel\u2019s intensified aerial campaign which started on 23 September displaced many medical staff from the region. Sainte Therese hospital, on the edge of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, said it suffered \u201chuge damage\u201d after \u201cIsraeli warplanes\u2019 target[ed] the vicinity\u201d of the facility on Thursday which \u201cled to the halt of hospital services\u201d, AFP reported, citing a NNA statement. The head of the Marjayoun government hospital, Mounes Kalakesh, told multiple news outlets that an Israeli airstrike \u201ctargeted ambulances at the main entrance to the hospital\u201d. Five paramedics were killed and seven were wounded, he said. On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at least 28 on-duty medics were killed in the space of 24 hours in Lebanon. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Najib Mikati, earlier today urged the international community to pressure Israel \u201cto allow rescue and relief teams to reach bombed sites and allow them to move\u201d casualties. Here are some of the latest images from the newswires from the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarm, where funerals were held on Friday for some of the 18 people killed in an Israeli airstrike. Among those killed in the strike on Tulkarm refugee camp yesterday was a family of four including two children, according to Palestian reports It was the first airstrike by an Israeli jet in the West Bank since the second intifada, which ran from 2000 to 2005. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, and its forces regularly make incursions into Palestinian communities, but the current raids as well as comments by Israeli officials mark an escalation. As we reported earlier, the UN rights office has condemned what it called an \u201cunlawful\u201d strike by Israel. Here\u2019s more on the airstrikes that were launched at Houthi targets in several parts of Yemen on Friday. As we reported earlier, US officials told Associated Press that the US and UK militaries struck more than a dozen Houthi targets in Yemen. But the Guardian now understands that that there was no UK involvement in the airstrikes today. The strikes were targeted at weapons systems, bases and other equipment belonging to the Iran-backed group. Military aircraft and warships bombed Houthi strongholds at roughly five locations, according to the US officials. According to the Houthi media, seven strikes hit the airport in Hodeida, a major port city, and the Katheib area, which has a Houthi-controlled military base. Four more strikes hit the Seiyana area in Sana\u2019a, the capital, and two strikes hit the Dhamar province, according to Houthi reports. The Houthi media office also reported three air raids in Bayda province, southeast of Sana\u2019a. France\u2019s foreign minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, will travel to Saudi Arabia on Friday evening to begin a four-day trip that will end in Israel and the occupied West Bank. Barrot is expected to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan over the weekend before arriving in Israel ahead of the 7 October anniversary, Reuters is reporting, citing a French diplomatic source. His trip comes as France seeks to revive stalled diplomatic efforts in the region. Barrot visited Lebanon earlier this week, during which he said that Paris would step up its support for the Lebanese army. The UN has condemned what it called an \u201cunlawful\u201d airstrike by Israel on a refugee camp in Tulkarm in the occupied West Bank on Thursday that killed at least 18 people. The Israeli strike is part of a \u201chighly concerning pattern of unlawful use of force\u201d by the Israeli security forces (ISF) during \u201cmilitary-like operations\u201d in the occupied West Bank, the UN rights office said in a statement. These operations have caused \u201cwidespread harm to Palestinians and significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.\u201d it said. Thursday\u2019s strike was \u201canother clear example of ISF\u2019s systematic resort to lethal force in the West Bank that is frequently unnecessary, disproportionate, and therefore unlawful,\u201d it said. At least 18 people were killed in the airstrike on Tulkarm refugee camp that the Israeli military has claimed killed a local Hamas leader. Among the dead, according to Palestinan reports, was a family of four including two children, named as Mohammed Abu Zahra, his wife, Sajaa, and their two children, Karam and Sham. A spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, described the attack as a \u201cheinous crime\u201d and a \u201cmassacre\u201d. The Israeli army confirmed the strike in the northern West Bank, describing it as a joint operation carried out by the Shin Bet internal security service and the air force, according to a brief statement. The UN rights office called for an independent probe into the incident, adding: The levelling of an entire building filled with people via aerial bombing shows flagrant disregard for Israel\u2019s obligations. The US and UK militaries struck more than a dozen Houthi targets in Yemen on Friday, AP is reporting, citing US officials. As we reported earlier, the strikes were targeted at weapons systems, bases and other equipment belonging to the Iran-backed group. Military aircraft and warships bombed Houthi strongholds at roughly five locations, according to the officials. According to the Houthi media, seven strikes hit the airport in Hodeida, a major port city, and the Katheib area, which has a Houthi-controlled military base. Four more strikes hit the Seiyana area in Sana\u2019a, the capital, and two strikes hit the Dhamar province, according to Houthi reports. The Houthi media office also reported three air raids in Bayda province, southeast of Sana\u2019a. Hisham Al-Omeisy, a political analyst, says the latest US airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen mark \u201ca new phase of the escalation\u201d in the country. Previous US-led strikes on Houthi targets have been directed at the Red Sea coast and port, he writes. According to Houthi media reports, Friday\u2019s strikes targeted Yemen\u2019s capital, Sana\u2019a, Hodeida, as well as Dhamar, south of the capital, and Mukayras, southeast of Sana\u2019a. The US airstrikes carried out on Houthi targets in several parts of Yemen on Friday came after the Iran-backed group claimed they shot down a US military drone flying over Yemen earlier this week. Since last year, the Houthis have carried out nearly 100 attacks on ships crossing the Red Sea, acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The Iran-backed group have been firing missiles, sending armed drones and launching boats laden with explosives at commercial ships with ties to Israeli, US and UK entities. Just last week, the Houthi group claimed responsibility for an attack targeted three US warships in the Red Sea as they were reportedly sailing to support Israel. We reported earlier that Houthi media reports said US strikes targeted several parts of Yemen, including its capital Sana\u2019a and the port city of Hodeida. A US official has now confirmed to Associated Press that the US military struck a number of Houthi targets in Yemen on Friday. US aircraft and ships targeted weapons systems, bases and other equipment belonging to the Iran-backed group, they said. Houthi strongholds were hit, the official added. The exact number of targets was not yet available as the mission was just ending, AP reported. According to the Houthi media, seven strikes hit the airport in Hodeida and the Katheib area, which has a Houthi-controlled military base. Four more strikes hit the Seiyana area in Sana\u2019a, the capital, and two strikes hit the Dhamar province, according to Houthi reports. The Houthi media office also reported three air raids in Bayda province, southeast of Sana\u2019a. The Israeli army says its forces have hit more than 2,000 sites during its four-day incursion into southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah positions, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. \u201cOver 2,000 military targets have been struck,\u201d including militants, military buildings, weapons and more, the Israeli military statement says. Strikes by the United States targeted three rebel-run cities in Yemen, including the capital Sanaa and the port city of Hodeida, AFP reports, citing the Houthi-run Al Masirah television network. Al Masirah reported several US strikes on Sanaa and Hodeida, where AFP correspondents heard loud explosions, as well as additional strikes on Dhamar, south of the capital, but did not specify if the attacks caused any damage or casualties. Two Israeli soldiers from the Golani Brigade have been killed in combat, and two others severely injured, in northern Israel, the country\u2019s military announces. Reuters reports that the Iran-backed Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of Shi\u2019ite armed factions opposed to US and Israeli presence in the region, claimed responsibility for three dawn attacks, targeting sites in the Golan Heights and Tiberias. Israeli media report that a military investigation has found two soldiers were killed in a drone attack launched from Iraq. Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 29 Palestinians, medics say, while sirens blare in southern Israel in response to renewed rocket fire from militants in the Palestinian enclave. The new rocket salvoes indicate Hamas-led militant factions in Gaza are still able to fire projectiles into Israel despite a year-long Israeli aerial and ground offensive that has turned wide areas of the enclave into wasteland. Citing the Israeli military, Reuters says the sirens sounded in southern Israel for the first time in around two months. Almost a year after 7 October, Hamas is still threatening our civilians with their terrorism and we will continue operating against them. The Lebanese authorities, communities and humanitarian agencies are struggling to shelter and provide the necessities of life to more than a million people fleeing Israel\u2019s airstrikes and invasion in the south, Oxfam says. The charity says people most need mattresses, bedding, and cooking and sanitation items. Women also need sanitary pads, towels and underwear. Bachir Ayoub, Oxfam\u2019s Lebanon country director, says: The ground invasion and bombardment that includes Beirut and the southern suburbs will create a serious challenge for the humanitarian system in a few short days. People are being forced to flee with little to no notice, and often having to leave everything behind, to shelters that are inadequate, or share crowded homes with few essential supplies. No one knows when they can return. Without a ceasefire the number of people desperately in need will only grow, as will their needs. The shelter system is set to collapse if there is no peace. A third government-chartered flight for British evacuees has left Lebanon, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary David Lammy says. A third UK government charter flight has left Lebanon to help British nationals leave. The situation is volatile. Flights are limited but seats are available. British nationals who want to leave should register their presence now to receive details on how to request a seat. Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vows Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza will emerge with new leaders, and not back down, during his sermon. The Israeli military estimates it has killed about 250 Hezbollah fighters, including several battalion and company commanders, since the start of its ground operation in Lebanon earlier this week, a military spokesperson says. Reuters quotes Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani as saying the military is still assessing the damage caused by airstrikes in southern Beirut on Thursday night, which he says targeted Hezbollah\u2019s intelligence headquarters. Here is some more on the deadly Israeli strike in Tulkarm\u2019s refugee camp, one of the most densely populated in the occupied West Bank (see earlier post at 06:13 for more details). As my colleague Peter Beaumont reports in this story, Thursday\u2019s strike on the camp killed 18 people, reportedly including a family of four. On Friday, paramedics were seen searching the rubble inside a destroyed coffee shop, which was struck in the attack, gathering human remains into small boxes. A source within the Palestinian security services told the AFP news agency that the attack was the deadliest in the West Bank for more than two decades. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard this sound since 2002,\u201d Nimer Fayyad, owner of the cafe, whose brother was killed in the strike, told Reuters. \u201cThe missiles targeted a civilian building, a family was wiped from the civil registry. What was their fault? ... There is no safe place for the Palestinian people. The Palestinian people have the right to defend themselves.\u201d Residents said the strike took place after a rally in the middle of the camp by armed fighters based there. When the rally ended, some went to the coffee shop. The Israeli military said the strike killed Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi, head of the Hamas network in Tulkarm. The UK\u2019s prime minister has reiterated that British nationals should evacuate Lebanon after days of Israeli airstrikes on the country. Keir Starmer also warned that the situation was \u201con the brink\u201d. Starmer said: The evacuation plan has been brought forward, and we are evacuating, as you know, unimpeded, and that is because of the planning that we put into it. And I repeat, importantly, to UK nationals in Lebanon that now is the time to leave. Now is the time to take part in that evacuation plan. Asked by the media if he was concerned there was a risk of the UK being dragged into a conflict with Iran, the recently elected British prime minister said: The most important thing in the Middle East is the need for de-escalation, and that is why I\u2019ve been talking to the president of the US, to the president of France, to the German chancellor, to the G7 countries and to the prime minister in Israel about the need to de-escalate the situation. As you probably know, I spoke to the president of Iran a few weeks ago because I am concerned that this is on the brink. And I am concerned that we do everything we can to de-escalate the situation, and that\u2019s been the constant message from this government. A delivery of medical supplies from the UN has reached Lebanon, the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) regional director, Hanan Balkhy, said. \u201cAn airlift... landed in Beirut earlier this morning with 30 metric tonnes of trauma and surgical supplies, enough to treat tens of thousands people,\u201d Balkhy wrote in a post on X. \u201cMore flights are arriving later today and tomorrow, carrying trauma supplies, cholera supplies and mental health supplies,\u201d she added. Rapidly intensifying Israeli strikes on Lebanon since 23 September have killed more than 1,100 people in Lebanon and injured hundreds more, according to a tally of official figures compiled by the AFP news agency. Lebanese authorities said over one million people have been displaces from their homes due to the relentless Israeli attacks on the country, already mired in an economic crisis. Health minister Firass Abiad was at the Beirut airport on Friday to receive the aid organised by the WHO and UN refugee agency UNHCR and funded by the United Arab Emirates. \u201cWe are receiving the first shipment out of many,\u201d he said. The shipment included \u201cmany trauma kits that will be crucial to support the hospitals as they receive the casualties from the Israeli attacks on Lebanon,\u201d he was quoted by AFP as having said. We mentioned in a previous post that Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, visited Beirut to meet Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati and speaker of parliament Nabih Berri - a close ally of Hezbollah. We now have some quotes from the visit. \u201cBe sure that the Islamic Republic of Iran is and will be firmly standing by the friends in Lebanon,\u201d Araghchi told reporters, adding that Tehran supports Lebanon, its Shiite Muslim community and Hezbollah, \u201cand it was necessary to say this in person\u201d. Araghchi said Iran backed efforts for a ceasefire in Lebanon if Hezbollah support it and if it coincides with a ceasefire in Gaza, BBC News\u2019 Middle East correspondent Nafiseh Kohnavard reported. The foreign minister also said that if Israel carries out another attack on Iran, Tehran will retaliate in a harsh way. \u201cIf the Israeli entity takes any step or measure against us, our retaliation will be stronger than the previous one,\u201d he said, referring to Iran\u2019s attack on Israel on Tuesday with over 180 ballistic missiles, most of which were intercepted. Araghchi, who was previously Iran\u2019s ambassador to several countries, including Japan, is a career diplomat who was appointed foreign minister by Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian over the summer. William Christou is reporting for the Guardian from Beirut The entire staff of Marjayoun public hospital in south Lebanon were evacuated on Friday morning after an Israeli drone strike killed four paramedics, putting the hospital out of service, Lebanon\u2019s national news agency reported. The hospital was one of the major medical providers in south Lebanon, particularly as Israel\u2019s intensified aerial campaign which started on 23 September displaced many medical staff from the region. \u201cThey hit right next to us, so we had to flee. The area is very dangerous and there is no one on the roads and I am driving alone,\u201d Shoshana Mazraani, the head of the emergency services at Marjayoun public hospital, said while fleeing. Israel also carried out a strike on the Islamic health organisation\u2019s center in Khirbet Selem, causing injuries on Friday afternoon, according to Lebanon\u2019s national news agency. An additional member of the ambulance service was killed and one injured while carrying out rescue services in the southern suburbs of Beirut, which was intensely bombed the night prior, according to Hezbollah-affiliated media. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister Najib Mikati had a series of diplomatic meetings on Friday in order to pressure Israel to safely allow rescue and relief teams to transfer victims of airstrikes. At least 102 Lebanese paramedics have been killed since the beginning of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah a year prior. The Israeli army has said its fighter jets struck Hezbollah targets near a key Lebanese-Syrian border crossing overnight. \u201cInfrastructure sites adjacent to the Masnaa border crossing between Syria and Lebanon were struck last night,\u201d the military said in a statement. It said the air raids were aimed at preventing the flow of weapons into Lebanon from neighbouring Syria and included targeting an alleged underground tunnel used to move arms across the border. Earlier, Lebanon said an Israeli strike near the crossing with Syria cut off a road used by hundreds of thousands of people to flee Israeli bombardments in recent days. There were no immediate reports of casualties (see post at 09.31 for more details). Israeli soldiers conducted widespread raids in the Hebron province in the occupied West Bank this morning, resulting in the detention of more than 24 people, including \u201cminors\u201d, local sources have told Wafa, the Palestinian news agency. The majority of those detained were taken from the town of Beit Ummar, it has been reported. Human rights groups and international organisations have alleged widespread abuse of inmates detained by Israel in raids in the occupied West Bank. They have described alleged abusive and humiliating treatment, including holding blindfolded and handcuffed detainees in cramped cages as well as beatings, intimidation and harassment. The Israeli military has posted to X to say that for the first time in nearly two months there were sirens sounding in southern Israel, near the Gaza Strip. \u201cAlmost a year after Oct. 7, Hamas is still threatening our civilians with their terrorism and we will continue operating against them,\u201d the army said, without providing specific details. As we have just reported, the Palestinian health ministry says at least 41,802 people have been killed and 96,844 injured in Israeli military attacks on Gaza since last October. Much of the enclave\u2019s infrastructure has been destroyed by Israeli strikes, as well as its health facilities and schools. The vast majority of Palestinian people have been internally displaced by Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, with many being forced to move multiple times in response to evacuation orders, even when there is nowhere safe to go. At least 41,802 Palestinian people have been killed and 96,844 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Friday. At least 14 Palestinians were killed and 50 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period, the ministry added. The health ministry has said thousands of other dead people are most likely lost in the rubble of the enclave. In a stark warning, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has said that the Middle East sits on the \u201cprecipice of a region-wide armed conflict\u201d after Israeli strikes in Lebanon intensified overnight. The ICRC said that civilians have \u201cborne the brunt\u201d of conflict over the last year, with the kidnapping of hostages in Israel, Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave\u2019s health ministry, and now civilians in Lebanon being killed by Israeli attacks. \u201cThe ICRC calls on all sides to avoid the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, as these cause indiscriminate harm, leading to a potentially significant toll on civilian lives, homes, and essential infrastructure,\u201d the ICRC said in a statement. Nicolas Von Arx, the ICRC\u2019s regional director for the near and Middle East, added: The risks are massive. If the violence continues to escalate, the potential harm to civilians is incalculable. All parties must uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law to reduce the suffering of civilians and pave the way for a more stable and peaceful future. Dehumanisation that fuels more cycles of violence must be shunned by all sides. The ICRC helped facilitate the handover of 105 hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October to Israel, in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, during the week-long truce last November. Its stated role is to be the guardian of the Geneva Convention, and perform tasks during conflicts such as tracing missing people, visiting prisoners of war and exchanging messages between them and their families back home. Israel\u2019s military said it killed Hezbollah communications commander, Muhammad Rashid Skafi, in strikes on Beirut, the Lebanese capital, on Thursday. The military said he had been in Hezbollah since 2000 and was close to senior leaders of the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group. Hezbollah are yet to confirm the Israel Defense Force\u2019s claim. The IDF said yesterday it was targeting Beirut and issued evacuation warnings for various locations throughout the night. Three missiles hit the southern suburb of Dahiyeh, where the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed last week, according to reports. Other senior Hezbollah figures also killed recently in Israeli strikes include Ibrahim Aqil, a senior commander in the group\u2019s elite Radwan forces, top military commander Ali Karaki, and a senior cleric, Sheikh Nabil Qaouk. An Israeli strike on the southern Lebanese town of Marjayoun on Friday hit around five metres from the entrance of its main hospital and medical staff have decided to temporarily evacuate, the hospital director Mounes Klakesh told Reuters. The operations at the hospital have reportedly shut down. We will bring you more on this as soon as we get it. Guardian reporter Jedidajah Otte has filed this first person, on-the-ground account from a woman from Beirut, who wishes to remain anonymous, who describes the fear and anxiety she is experiencing amid Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon: I\u2019m a 45-year-old Lebanese-French national. I grew up in Lebanon, but left during the civil war. I then returned to Beirut in 2016 and have been living here since. I almost hesitated to share my story as I feel I\u2019m super privileged compared to people who experienced the bombings and had to flee their homes (over the past week). Then I figured we also need to show that war affects everyone, including those who are not directly under the bombs. I live in Achrafieh, which is quite close to the neighbourhood of Dahiyeh (the area of Beirut where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated last Friday). I was awoken at night by bombings not too far away late on Friday, after Nasrallah was killed, and have been checking compulsively on social media and media what happened, and if everyone I know is safe. I heard a strike at least every hour that night, they were bombing in Dahiyeh. My immediate neighbourhood has been spared by airstrikes so far, but you pretty much constantly hear the drones, which sound as if you have a lawnmower in your apartment. On Saturday morning, I filmed clouds of smoke from my balcony over Dahiyeh. I left Beirut on Saturday. I need to sleep at night. When I briefly came back to Beirut before leaving again on Monday, cafes and restaurants were open during the day, but it was rather quiet. I am now staying with a friend near Jounieh, about 20 minutes from my home. I am worrying about my friends who are from the south or Dahiyeh whose families did not want to leave or could not leave. My parents stayed in their apartment in Achrafieh. Every day I tell them, \u201clet\u2019s go to the mountains\u201d (because it might be safer there), but they are pretty old, my father is 93. They are fairly confident that Achrafieh won\u2019t be targeted. I don\u2019t share their confidence. Most of my friends here are dual-nationals or foreigners, and all my friends who are foreign nationals have now left Lebanon. I\u2019m lucky because I mostly work online, but I\u2019m struggling to focus at work because my anxiety levels skyrocket, feeling my own pain and the pain of everyone around me, not knowing when and if I will see my friends and family who are abroad again. I have been securing as much food and medicine as possible for my parents, and have been getting my gas tank refilled as often as possible. After the pager explosions, my mother said that the constant sound of the ambulances reminded her of the blast on 4 August, 2020. I worry that hospitals might be too crowded to treat my father if he needs it. I have packed my bag in case I need to evacuate quickly. I\u2019m struggling to find moments of joy or contentment that can keep me afloat, and am fearing that the next strike will kill or injure someone I know. If we decide to leave for good or are forced to leave for good, I don\u2019t know where we would go. We\u2019re lucky enough to have French passports, so we can travel more easily. But, even though my father is in fairly good physical shape, it\u2019s not easy for him to travel. Before Nasrallah was assassinated, I had booked flights for myself and my parents to go to Cyprus, where my parents own a house. We are scheduled to be on a flight to Cyprus this Saturday, so we\u2019re leaving - except if they bomb the airport. In my parents\u2019 minds we are coming back after one week, but I don\u2019t know if we will. A source close to Hezbollah told the AFP news agency that Israel had conducted 11 consecutive strikes on the militant group\u2019s stronghold in Beirut on Thursday night. Hashem Safieddine, the most likely person to replace Hassan Nasrallah as leader of Hezbollah and the head of its executive council, was the target of the strikes, the New York Times and Axios reported, citing Israeli officials. An Israeli strike on Friday morning near Lebanon\u2019s Masnaa border crossing with Syria cut off a road used by hundreds of thousands of people to flee Israeli bombardments in recent days, Lebanon\u2019s transport minister Ali Hamieh told Reuters. The strike was said to have created a four-metre (12ft) wide crater. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, said Iran\u2019s recent missile attack on Israel was \u201clegal and legitimate\u201d and was the minimum punishment for Israel\u2019s \u201ccrimes\u201d. In a rare speech, he also said the Hamas-led 7 October attack on southern Israel was a \u201clegitimate act\u201d. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, visited Beirut to meet Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati and speaker of parliament Nabih Berri - a close ally of Hezbollah. The Israeli military this morning told the residents of over 20 more southern towns in Lebanon to evacuate immediately. At least 18 people have been killed in the occupied West Bank in an airstrike on a refugee camp in Tulkarm. Among the dead was a family of four including two children, according to reports. Like many other countries around the world, the US is working with airlines to add flights out of Lebanon so that its citizens can escape the escalating conflict there. A US state department spokesperson said earlier: In addition to the flight announced at the daily press briefing, a second state department flight departed Beirut on Thursday, landing in Frankfurt early Friday morning Frankfurt time. On today\u2019s second US government-organized flight, the department facilitated the safe departure of 97 US citizens and family members from Beirut, Lebanon to a safe location. Today\u2019s second US government organized flight had the capacity to carry 300 passengers, and departed with 97 passengers onboard. To date, we have assisted approximately 350 US citizens, US Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), and their immediate family members depart Lebanon via state department organized flights. A UN refugee agency official has said most of Lebanon\u2019s nearly 900 shelters were full and that people fleeing Israeli strikes were increasingly sleeping out in the open. \u201cMost of the nearly 900 government established collective shelters in Lebanon have no more capacity,\u201d UNHCR\u2019s Rula Amin told a Geneva press briefing. \u201cWith the onset of winter, UNHCR is concerned that conditions for those affected by the escalating conflict in other will only worsen,\u201d she was quoted by Reuters as having told journalists. According to the Lebanese government, more than 300,000 people \u2013 a vast majority of them Syrian \u2013 have crossed from Lebanon into Syria over the past 10 days to escape escalating Israeli bombardment. A World Health Organization (WHO) official has said the organisation has sent a request to Israel to begin the second phase of the polio vaccination campaign in Gaza from 14 October. \u201cWe have asked the Israeli authorities to consider a similar scheme that we had for the first round, something they call \u2018tactical pauses\u2019 (in fighting) during the working hours of the campaign,\u201d Ayadil Saparbekov, WHO lead for emergencies in the occupied Palestinian territory, said. He said negotiations were ongoing and that a meeting with Israeli authorities about the next phase of the campaign was planned for Sunday, Reuters reported. In September, limited pauses in fighting were held to allow the vaccination campaign, which aims to reach 640,000 children in Gaza after the territory\u2019s first polio case in around 25 years. While these temporary pauses, agreed between Hamas and Israel, were generally stuck to in certain areas in Gaza, there were ongoing reports of Israeli airstrikes killing Palestinian people in others. WHO officials say at least 90% of 640,000 children under 10 must be vaccinated with two drops of oral vaccine in two rounds, four weeks apart, to prevent the disease from spreading. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, also said Iran\u2019s attack on Israel on Tuesday was the \u201cminimum punishment\u201d for Israel against their \u201castonishing crimes\u201d. The Iranian supreme leader, according to quotes carried by BBC News, called Israel a \u201cvampire\u201d regime, adding that the Islamic Republic will execute \u201cany related duties\u201d against Israel with \u201cstrength and fortitude\u201d. He said Iran and its regional proxies will not back down from Israel. Iran launched high-speed missile barrages at Israel on Tuesday night, Tehran\u2019s largest-ever attack on its regional foe. The strikes, which Tehran said were aimed at military bases, were largely thwarted by Israel\u2019s aerial defences with support from western allies. The Iranian missile barrages came after Israel assassinated the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in strikes on Beirut last Friday. Here is some more of what Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ali Khamenei said during his sermon: Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel was \u201clegal and legitimate\u201d. \u201cThe operation of our armed forces a few nights ago was totally legal and legitimate,\u201d he said, adding that his country would not \u201cprocrastinate or rush to carry out its duty\u201d in confronting Israel. Iran\u2019s enemy is the same as the enemy of a Palestinian state, Lebanon and other Muslim nations. Israel is pretending to win strategic victory through assassinations and civilian killings. The Hamas-led 7 October attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed, was a \u201clegitimate act\u201d, he said. \u201cThe Palestinian people have a lawful right to defend themselves. To stand up to those criminals \u2013 the occupation forces. There is not a single court or international organization that can blame the Palestinian people for simply defending their homeland,\u201d Khamenei said. Israel cannot seriously harm Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, or Hamas, the Palestinian militant group. The US and its allies were preserving the security of Israel to make it an energy exporting gate from the region to the west. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is delivering Friday prayers in Tehran\u2019s Grand Mosalla mosque - the first time he has done so in about five years. Khamenei \u2013 the ultimate authority in Iran \u2013 is speaking to thousands of worshippers, some of whom are carrying portraits of slain leaders of Iran\u2019s so-called \u201caxis of resistance\u201d (which includes Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, and numerous groups in Syria and Iraq) against Israel and the US. We will bring you the key lines as soon as we get them. The UK government said it will provide a further \u00a310m in humanitarian support for Lebanon. It is being delivered due to the widespread lack of shelter and access to clean water, hygiene and healthcare faced by people in Lebanon displaced by Israeli attacks. \u201cThe announcement follows the \u00a35 million humanitarian package delivered through Unicef to support access to clean water and sanitation, health, and nutrition supplies,\u201d the foreign office said. Foreign Office minister Anneliese Dodds said: The human cost of the conflict in Lebanon is clear for all to see. This additional funding from the UK will help to address the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation, providing relief for people displaced by the continuing violence. This lifesaving aid is vital, but not a long-term solution. The only way to truly address the growing humanitarian crisis is an immediate ceasefire adhered to by both sides. We continue to urge British nationals in Lebanon to leave immediately. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry says 37 people have been killed in Israeli ground and air attacks over the last day, with the Israeli military having launched a series of strikes on southern Beirut on Thursday night. According to the Lebanese government, more than 300,000 people \u2013 a vast majority of them Syrian \u2013 have crossed from Lebanon into Syria over the past 10 days to escape escalating Israeli bombardment. As we reported in an earlier post, we mentioned reports of an Israeli airstrike leading to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa border crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. Speaking from Beirut, the World Food Programme\u2019s country director for Lebanon, Matthew Hollingworth, said the crossing between Syria and Lebanon has been \u201cvery significantly bombed\u201d, limiting people\u2019s ability to flee. \u201cIt will mean that goods that would normally come overland through that crossing - the cheapest, most effective way to bring commodities into the country - will also not be able to be to be received here,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) had accused Hezbollah on Thursday of using the crossing with Syria to transport military equipment into Lebanon. Associated Press video footage showed that the strikes near the Masnaa crossing left two huge craters on each side of the road. People carrying bags were seen crossing on foot after being dropped off by cars that were unable to pass the site of the airstrike. Khalil al-Hayya, the most senior leader of Hamas outside Gaza, has sat down for an interview with the BBC\u2019s international editor Jeremy Bowen in Doha, where the majority of the Palestinian militant group\u2019s political leadership is based. He was questioned on why Hamas carried out the 7 October attacks, in which about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners - mostly civilians - were killed and about 250 people taken as hostages. Al-Hayya, who is Hamas\u2019 deputy leader, said: We had to sound an alarm to the world to tell them that we are a people with a cause and demands. It was a blow to Israel \u2013 the Zionist enemy and a wake up call to the international community. We had to do something that would tell the world that there is people who have been under occupation for decades. When pressed on why Hamas killed so many civilians, including children, he claimed that the Palestinian militant group\u2019s fighters were ordered not to target civilians. \u201cOn the ground there were certainly personal mistakes and actions \u2013 the fighters may have felt like their lives were in danger,\u201d he said. Bowen said Hamas fighters were not in danger as evidence shows militants with weapons were standing over terrified civilians. \u201cThat is not a battle,\u201d Bowen said. Many of the Israeli victims were civilians who were murdered in their homes, on the streets of their communities and at other locations along a broad swathe of territory bordering Gaza. Bowen: Almost a year later, Gaza is in ruins. There are more than 40,000 dead, many, many of them are civilians. Your capacity to fight Israel has been massively diminished. Was it worth all of that? Al-Hayya: Who is responsible for this? It was the occupation and its army. Who destroys Gaza? Who killed its people? Who is now killing civilians in shelters, schools and hospitals?\u2026 If 1,200 people from the occupation are killed, how does that justify Israel killing 50,000 people and destroying all of Gaza? Isn\u2019t that enough for them. But they are motivated for the lust to kill, to occupy and the lust to destroy. Al-Hayya said reaching a ceasefire deal was \u201cwithin reach\u201d on the 2 July, but these talks failed after Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu set out \u201cnew conditions\u201d (a major impasse in the negotiations has been the Philadelphi corridor along Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt and the Netzarim east-west corridor across the territory. Netanyahu has insisted that Israel retain control of the corridors to prevent smuggling and catch militant fighters. Hamas, however, is demanding the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza). Al-Hayya said Israel wants to \u201celiminate\u201d Hamas and all Palestinian people. \u201cGive us our rights, give us a fully sovereign Palestinian state,\u201d he told the BBC. It was reported over the summer that al-Hayya was leading indirect negotiations with Israel for a Gaza ceasefire with guidance from the group\u2019s leader, Yahya Sinwar. Israeli attacks continue across Gaza, including in the city of Deir al-Balah, where an Israeli strike on a home has killed at least four people, according to Wafa, the Palestinian news agency. The military also launched bombs that ignited fires in homes in the Nuseirat refugee camp, while Israeli warplanes struck several sites in the southern city of Khan Younis, \u201cresulting in further casualties and injuries\u201d, Wafa reports. Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Thursday that Israel\u2019s war on the enclave has killed at least 41,788 Palestinian people and injured 96,794 since last October. We reported in an earlier post that officials have said at least 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on the Tulkarm refugee camp in the occupied West Bank last night. Daliya Hadaydeh, a medic from the Red Crescent, has spoken to Al Jazeera. She described the attack on a coffee shop in the camp as \u201chorrific\u201d. She said: We heard a huge explosion in the camp. We headed towards the area. We saw the whole building destroyed and engulfed in flames. Body parts were scattered all over the place. It was a horrific scene. Five of the bodies were almost intact. But between 15 and 20 were dismembered. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has reportedly landed in Beirut. \u201cAn Iranian plane has landed at the Rafik Hariri international airport with foreign minister Abbas Araghchi on board,\u201d the Lebanese national news agency said of the first visit by a top Iranian official since an Israeli strike killed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut last week. Araghchi is set to meet Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Najib Mikati, and speaker of parliament Nabih Berri. The assassination of Nasrallah was a huge blow to Iran, which considers Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group it has funded and trained, to be its closest and most long-standing ally. Iran has relied on Hezbollah to be a major deterrent preventing direct attacks on their country by Israel. Here are some of the latest images coming out of Beirut, which show how Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon\u2019s capital and its suburbs are intensifying: In the post on X, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned people living in 20 villages in south Lebanon, including al-Bas, Majdal Salm and Toulin, to evacuate their homes immediately. \u201cAnyone who is near Hezbollah elements, installations, and combat equipment is putting his life at risk,\u201d he wrote. Adraee said that civilians must head north of the Awali river, which meets the coast about 50km (30 miles) from the border with Israel, and avoid going any further south if they want to escape Israeli attacks. In a sign that Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon is widening, the Israeli military this week issued evacuation orders for large swathes of the south of the country, as well as areas north of Tyre, a long way from the border. The Israeli military has just told the residents of over 20 more southern towns in Lebanon to evacuate immediately, spokesperson Avichay Adraee wrote in a post on X. More details to follow\u2026 There are reports coming in this morning that a key road connecting Lebanon with Syria \u2013 used by hundreds of thousands of people to flee Israeli bombardments - has been hit by an Israeli strike. Lebanon\u2019s transport minister, Ali Hamieh, told Reuters that the strike hit inside Lebanese territory near the Masnaa border crossing, creating a four-metre (12 ft) wide crater. No casualties or injuries have been reported so far. An Israel Defence Forces (IDF) military spokesperson had accused Hezbollah on Thursday of using the crossing to transport military equipment into Lebanon. According to Lebanese government statistics, more than 300,000 people - a vast majority of them Syrian - had crossed from Lebanon into Syria over the last 10 days to escape escalating Israeli bombardment. Some of the images of the overnight Israeli strikes on Beirut: The Israeli military launched a series of strikes on southern Beirut on Thursday night, in one of the most intense bombardments on the city since the campaign began last week. A source close to Hezbollah told the AFP news agency that Israel had conducted 11 consecutive strikes on the group\u2019s stronghold in the Lebanese capital. Hashem Safieddine, the most likely candidate to replace Hassan Nasrallah as leader of Hezbollah and the head of its executive council, was the target of the strikes, the New York Times and Axios reported, citing Israeli officials. The result of the strike, said to have targeted a meeting of senior Hezbollah figures, is unclear. New footage showed giant balls of flame rising from the targeted site with thick smoke billowing and flares shooting out. Reporters in the capital and beyond heard loud bangs that made car alarms go off and buildings shake. Earlier on Thursday, Israeli army Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee had issued an \u201curgent warning\u201d for residents to evacuate from the south Beirut area of Burj al-Barajneh. He later issued an evacuation order for the Hadath neighbourhood in Beirut\u2019s south. \u201cYou are located near facilities and interests belonging to Hezbollah, and the IDF will work against them in the near future,\u201d he had said in a statement on X. Safieddine leads Hezbollah\u2019s highest political decision-making body, the executive council, and was considered the number two in the organisation\u2019s political wing before the death of Nasrallah, who was killed by Israeli airstrikes in Dahiyeh last week. He is reportedly designated to succeed Nasrallah, though no formal announcement of his succession has been made since the late-leader was killed last week. Here\u2019s our full report Iranian television is reporting that large crowds have gathered outside the mosque in Tehran where the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is due to lead prayers and give a public sermon for the first time in five years: Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is set to lead Friday prayers and deliver a public sermon that could shed light on the Islamic republic\u2019s plans after a massive missile attack on enemy Israel. AFP reports: Khamenei\u2019s rare Friday sermon \u2013 a first in almost five years \u2013 comes three days before the one-year anniversary of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, triggered by the Iran-backed Palestinian group\u2019s 7 October attack. The supreme leader, who wields the highest authority in Iran, will lead Muslims in prayer at the Imam Khomeini Grand Mosalla mosque in central Tehran, his official website said. The prayer will follow \u201ca commemoration ceremony\u201d at 10.30am (0700 GMT) for Hassan Nasrallah, the slain leader of Tehran-backed Lebanese armed movement Hezbollah. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, who answer to Khamenei, said Tuesday\u2019s barrages of some 200 missiles were in retaliation for Israel\u2019s killing of Nasrallah alongside Guards commander Abbas Nilforoushan in a late September strike on Beirut, and of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July. Khamenei last led Friday prayers in January 2020 after Iran fired missiles at a US army base in Iraq, in response to a strike that killed revered Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani. In Tehran on Thursday, crowds waving Hezbollah and Iran flags gathered outside the former US embassy building in Tehran to denounce Israeli \u201ccrimes\u201d in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon, Iranian media reported. Khamenei had declared public mourning in Iran for Nasrallah and on Wednesday said that the Hezbollah chief\u2019s death was \u201cnot a small matter\u201d. US President Joe Biden has made a series of comments to reporters overnight including suggesting there is \u201cno action\u201d taking place in the Middle East and that he does not believe there will be an \u201call-out war\u201d. Asked by the White House press pool why he had not spoken to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in recent days after he said he would on Sunday he replied: Because there\u2019s no action going on right now. Asked how confident he was that an all-out war could be averted in the Middle East he replied: How confident are you it\u2019s not going to rain? Look, I don\u2019t believe there is going to be an all-out war. I think we can avoid it. But there is a lot to do yet, a lot to do yet. Asked if he would send American troops to help Israel, the president said: \u201cWe have already helped Israel. We are going to protect Israel.\u201d And asked if he worried an Israeli strike on Iran\u2019s oil facilities would raise oil prices, he said: If a hurricane hits, prices are going to go up. I don\u2019t know; who knows. On Thursday Biden said his administration had been \u201cdiscussing\u201d possible Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities, triggering a spike in oil prices. The latest apparent Israeli attack on Hezbollah leadership, in which Hashem Safieddine, the presumed next leader of Hezbollah, was reportedly the target, comes almost exactly a week after leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in a massive Israeli strike on Beirut that flattened several apartment blocks. Israel has a long history of assassinating its enemies, often causing civilian casualties, and has also killed around 20 other senior Hezbollah figures in recent weeks and months. The include Ibrahim Aqil, reportly killed by an airstrike in Beirut in September, who was one of the last founder members of Hezbollah\u2019s military wing to have survived more than 40 years of conflict with Israel. Fuad Shukur, whom Israel said was responsible for most of Hezbollah\u2019s advanced weaponry, including precise-guided missiles, cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, long-range rockets, and UAVs, was killed in a strike on Beirut in July. Nabil Qaouk, who held a series of military command positions and had recently begun travelling to Iran, was killed in a strike earlier this week. Ali Karaki, who had responsibility for military operations along the contested border with Israel, was killed alongside Nasrallah, as was Ibrahim Jazini, who was responsible for internal security within Hezbollah. At least 18 people were killed in a West Bank refugee camp, the Palestinian health ministry has said, following an airstrike that the Israeli military claimed killed a local Hamas leader. A source within the Palestinian security services told the AFP news agency that the attack was the deadliest in the West Bank since 2000. \u201cEighteen martyrs following the bombing of the Tulkarm camp by the occupation,\u201d the Palestinian health ministry said on its Telegram account. An activist in the area told AFP that the Israeli strike \u201chit a cafeteria in a four-storey building\u201d, adding that there were \u201cmany victims in the hospital\u201d. Al Jazeera reported that the dead included a mother and her two children. The Israeli army confirmed the strike on the Tulkarm area in the northern West Bank, describing it as a joint operation carried out by the Shin Bet internal security service and the air force, according to a brief statement by the military. The Israeli military later said the strike had killed a Hamas leader, Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi \u2013 and said among the dead were other \u201coperatives\u201d who were also active in Hamas. The army accused Oufi of participating in numerous attacks in the West Bank and said he was in the process of planning another assault. Hamas condemned the airstrike, calling it a \u201ccruel attack\u201d that would prove to be a \u201cdangerous escalation\u201d. Here\u2019s our full report: An Israeli strike on Friday morning hit near Lebanon\u2019s Masnaa border crossing with Syria, cutting off a road used by hundreds of thousands of people to flee Israeli bombardments in recent days, the Lebanese transport minister has told Reuters. Ali Hamieh said the strike hit right after the border crossing, still within Lebanese territory, creating a 4-metre wide crater. The Israeli military had on Thursday accused Hezbollah of smuggling weapons into Lebanon via the crossing. Israel is likely to mount a large-scale airstrike against Iran\u2019s oil industry and possibly a symbolic attack on a military target related to its nuclear programme, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak has predicted. Barak said there was no doubt there would be an Israeli military response to Iran\u2019s assault on Tuesday with over 180 ballistic missiles, most of which were intercepted, but some landed on and around densely populated areas and Israeli military bases. \u201cIsrael has a compelling need, even an imperative, to respond. I think that no sovereign nation on Earth could fail to respond,\u201d Barak said in an interview. The former prime minister, who also served as defence minister, foreign minister and army chief of staff, said the model for the Israeli response could be seen in Sunday\u2019s reprisal airstrikes against Houthi-controlled oil facilities, power plants and docks in the Yemeni port of Hodeidah, a day after Houthi fired missiles aimed at Israel\u2019s international airport outside Tel Aviv. \u201cI think we might see something like that. It might be a massive attack, and it could be repeated more than once,\u201d he told the Guardian. The Israeli military says that it has detected around 20 \u201claunches\u201d from Lebanon and that all were either intercepted or fell in an open area. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East. Israel has launched a fresh round of airstrikes on Beirut overnight, with witnesses describing them as more powerful than the massive strike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah almost a week ago. Israeli and US media reported that one of the targets of the strikes on the southern suburb of Dahiyeh was Hashem Safieddine, widely considered to be Nasrallah\u2019s likely successor. There has been no official comment from either Hezbollah or Israel on his fate. The news agency AFP reported that there had been at least 11 consecutive strikes on Dahiyeh, the southern Beirut suburb regarded as a Hezbollah stronghold, while one strike reportedly hit close to Beirut\u2019s airport. Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarm an Israeli airstrike killed at least 18 people in a cafe. The IDF claimed it had killed a local Hamas leader, Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi, in the attack, which levelled the entire building, along with several other Hamas members. Civilians were also reportedly killed \u2013 including a mother and her two children according to Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera \u2013 and Palestinian media said it was the bloodiest single Israeli attack on the West Bank in 24 years. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that more people were buried under the rubble, citing a Red Crescent paramedic and local media. In other developments: The latest Israeli strikes on Beirut on Friday came after Israeli military ordered civilians near two buildings in Dahiyeh, in the southern suburb of Beirut, to evacuate immediately ahead of airstrikes. An Israeli military spokesperson published maps alongside the announcement, warning civilians to distance themselves at least 500 metres from the sites. Earlier on Thursday, multiple airstrikes were heard in the Lebanese capital, with one of them reportedly hitting the office of Hezbollah\u2019s media department in Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut. An official from the media office said they were safe, despite the blast. Israel said it had targeted Hezbollah\u2019s intelligence operation. Joe Biden, the US president, said he was \u201cdiscussing\u201d possible Israeli strikes on Iranian oil sites in response to Tehran\u2019s missile attack earlier this week. His comments quickly sent oil prices soaring. Asked if he would \u201callow\u201d Israel to retaliate against Iran, Biden said on Thursday that \u201cwe don\u2019t \u2018allow\u2019 Israel, we advise Israel. And there is nothing going to happen today.\u201d On Wednesday, Biden said he would not support an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said 37 people were killed and 151 others wounded in Israeli strikes on the country on Thursday. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed, including 127 children, and 9,384 injured since the start of Israeli attacks on Lebanon over the last year, the country\u2019s health ministry said on Thursday. More than 1.2 million Lebanese people have been displaced by Israeli attacks. Lebanon\u2019s health minister said more than 40 rescuers and firefighters have been killed by Israeli attacks over the last three days. Israel\u2019s military ordered residents of more than 20 towns in south Lebanon to evacuate their homes immediately on Thursday, signaling that it may widen a ground operation launched earlier this week against Hezbollah. Israel has told people to leave Nabatieh, a provincial capital, and other communities north of the Litani River, which formed the northern edge of the UN-declared buffer zone. Israel has previously ordered 52 other villages inside Lebanon to evacuate. The EU\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, described an Israeli strike on a central Beirut medical centre on Thursday as a \u201cviolation of international humanitarian law\u201d. The attack was the second airstrike on central Beirut this week, with most strikes having previously been confined to suburbs in the southern suburbs. Hezbollah carried out new strikes on Thursday, targeting what it called Israel\u2019s \u201cSakhnin base\u201d for military industries in Haifa Bay on the Mediterranean coast of northern Israel with a salvo of rockets. At least eight Israeli soldiers have been killed in clashes with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese army said that it returned fire at Israeli forces after one of its soldiers was killed in an Israeli strike, marking the first time that the Lebanese army participated in the fighting against Israel. The soldier was killed when a Lebanese Red Cross convoy accompanied by the Lebanese Army was struck while evacuating wounded from Taybeh, a border-village in southern Lebanon. Civilians are bearing the brunt of a \u201ctruly catastrophic\u201d situation in Lebanon, a senior UN official said. Since Israel dramatically ramped up airstrikes in Lebanon more than a week ago, the pace of displacement had exceeded worst case scenarios, Imran Riza, the UN\u2019s resident and humanitarian coordinator, told Reuters. \u201cThe level of trauma, the level of fear amongst the population, has been extreme,\u201d he said. G7 leaders expressed \u201cdeep concern over the deteriorating situation in the Middle East\u201d and called on regional players to \u201cact responsibility and with restraint\u201d. In a joint statement on Thursday, G7 leaders said they condemned \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d Iran\u2019s military attack against Israel earlier this week, which they said \u201cconstitutes a serious threat to regional stability.\u201d Iran has warned Washington that any country that aids an Israeli attack will be deemed an Iranian target. In a statement issued by Iran\u2019s mission at the UN on Thursday, Iran warned that a large Israeli strike will lead to attacks on Israeli infrastructure and that \u201cshould any country render assistance to the aggressor, it shall likewise be deemed an accomplice and a legitimate target.\u201d The warnings came as the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, sought assurances from Gulf States in Doha that they would remain neutral in the event of any joint Israeli-US attack in Iran. The death toll in Gaza has risen to 41,788 reported fatalities with 96,794 people wounded, according to the latest figures by territory\u2019s health ministry late on Thursday. At least 90 Palestinians were killed and 169 others injured in eight attacks by Israel over the last 24 hours, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported earlier, including in strikes on a school and an orphange housing displaced people. Unrwa chief Philippe Lazzarini condemned the Israeli attacks on Thursday, saying \u201cSchools used to be a safe haven for learning, they have now turned into hell for far too many.\u201d The Israeli military said it killed a Hezbollah commander who was responsible for a rocket attack on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 children and teenagers on a football field in July. The IDF said Khader Shahabiya was killed in an airstrike on Wednesday. The attack on Majdal Shams village, a predominantly Druze village, killed 12 children between the ages of 10 and 16 as they were playing football and wounded dozens more. Israel\u2019s military also announced that in a strike \u201capproximately three months ago\u201d it believes it killed three senior Hamas figures. It named them as \u201cRawhi Mushtaha, the head of the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip; Sameh al-Siraj, who held the security portfolio on Hamas\u2019 political bureau and Hamas\u2019 labor committee; and Sami Oudeh, commander of Hamas\u2019 general security mechanism.\u201d The Lebanese ambassador to the UK, Rami Mortada, claimed that Hezbollah\u2019s leadership had agreed to a proposed 21 day ceasefire shortly before \u201chotheads\u201d of Israel blew up the diplomatic path to peace by assassinating leader Hassan Nasrallah. Mortada\u2019s comments on Thursday support a previous assertion made by Lebanese foreign minister, Abdallah Bou Habib.",

      "bodyText": "A Sydney woman has been charged with murdering, dismembering and disposing of her husband in bins almost 18 months after he was last seen, in what one detective described as one of the most \u201cbizarre\u201d cases police have seen. New South Wales police have alleged Nirmeen Noufl, 53, intentionally killed and cut up the body of 62-year-old Mamdouh Noufl last year at their family home of more than 10 years in order to hide his remains. The incident is being treated as a domestic violence murder. An investigation into the man\u2019s disappearance began in July 2023, when family friends reported him missing, police said. Police were called to his home on Juno Parade in Greenacre, in Sydney\u2019s west, after he had not been seen since May. The homicide squad commander, Det Supt Danny Doherty, on Saturday said that as the investigation went on, \u201csuspicious circumstances\u201d allegedly came to light and the case transitioned to a suspected murder case in January. \u201cThere were a lot of versions provided which didn\u2019t add up,\u201d he alleged. \u201cHis family friends were concerned in relation to his whereabouts \u2013 they thought he was travelling overseas but he couldn\u2019t be reached. His family in Egypt were also unable to locate him.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Police also alleged that Noufl had accessed her husband\u2019s bank accounts and social media as a \u201cruse\u201d to suggest he was still alive, which only ceased when he was formally reported missing in July. \u201cPolice will allege the murder and intentional killing occurred at the house in Juno Parade \u2026 where he was both killed and dismembered,\u201d Doherty said. \u201cWe will allege also that she butchered and dismembered his body, placed his body parts in plastic bags and then disposed of his [remains] in various rubbish buns and residential and industrial areas of southwest Sydney. \u201cThe house was [allegedly] refloored and extensively cleaned.\u201d Doherty wouldn\u2019t elaborate on the specific cause and manner of his death, but alleged the man was later dismembered with knives and a power saw. \u201cIt\u2019s right up there with one of the most bizarre manners [of death],\u201d he said. The couple had raised eight children together, all in their 20s and 30s. Noufl was arrested at a Bankstown hospital, where she had self-admitted on Thursday, and police alleged they feared she was a flight risk and may escape the country. The following day, she was taken into custody and formally charged with the murder of her husband. The couple were not previously known to police. \u201cShe had property overseas and travel plans. We decided to act despite having no remains [because of] strong circumstantial and other evidence,\u201d Doherty said. \u201cWe were concerned she was going to travel overseas and not come back. We\u2019ll allege in court that she was solely responsible for his murder, his dismemberment, and his disposal for the remains.\u201d Doherty said over the past 20 years, the accused had received government assistance and lived in social housing while accumulating \u201ca lot of unexplained wealth\u201d. \u201cShe has travelled to Egypt and sold properties, she had purchased shares in the UAE,\u201d he alleged. Doherty said while none of her husband\u2019s remains had been located, there was \u201cdirect and cogent\u201d evidence that Noufl allegedly acted alone and in a premeditated fashion. \u201cTo this date his remains have never been located and I doubt they will ever be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of answers that we still need to find out [but] there\u2019s other circumstances that will play out in court in relation to [alleged] motive and benefits. \u201cThis was [allegedly] premeditated \u2013 she was going to benefit from the demise of Mamdouh both financially and \u2026 [with] significant benefit through properties sold and moneys obtained.

      "body": "<ul> <li><p><strong>An employee at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> has been killed in a car bomb attack</strong> that Ukrainian military intelligence said punished a \u201cwar criminal\u201d. Russia\u2019s investigative committee, which probes serious crimes, said Andrei Korotkiy died after a bomb planted under his car went off near his house in the city of Enerhodar, where the plant is located, on Friday morning. Korotkiy worked in the plant\u2019s security department, the committee said, adding a criminal case was opened into his death. Ukrainian military intelligence published a video of his car exploding and in a statement called Korotkiy a \u201cwar criminal\u201d and collaborator, accusing him of repressing Ukrainians and of handing Russia a list of the plant\u2019s employees and then pointing out people with pro-Ukrainian views. Authorities at the plant \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest, with six nuclear reactors \u2013 condemned Ukrainian authorities for orchestrating the killing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine said it hit an oil depot in Russia\u2019s Voronezh border region in a drone attack that reportedly</strong> <strong>caused a huge blaze</strong>. A source in the SBU security service told Agence France-Presse a depot with 20 fuel and lubricant tanks was hit in the drone attack overnight to Friday. \u201cThe enemy\u2019s air defences were active but unsuccessful,\u201d the source said, adding there were reports of a \u201cmassive fire\u201d. Russian emergency services reported a fire was raging over 2,000 sq metres (21,500 sq ft) in a warehouse storing hydrocarbon products in the Voronezh region. The Voronezh regional governor earlier confirmed a Ukrainian drone strike.</p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> said on Friday he had visited the northern Sumy region, from where Ukraine launched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/13/ukraines-incursion-into-russia-explained-in-maps-footage-and-photos\">major incursion into Russia\u2019s neighbouring Kursk region</a></strong>. \u201cIt is crucial to understand that the Kursk operation is a really strategic thing, something that adds motivation to our partners, motivation to be with Ukraine, be more decisive and put pressure on Russia,\u201d the Ukrainian president said. Shown visiting Ukrainian troops alongside his top army commander, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, Zelenskyy thanked the military and said the incursion \u201cgreatly helped\u201d Kyiv to secure the latest military support packages from the west. Almost two months into the surprise operation, Kyiv\u2019s troops control swathes of Russian border territory, though the pace of the advance has slowed and Moscow\u2019s forces have begun to counterattack.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Romania recovered fragments of a Russian drone from a canal in the Danube Delta near the Ukrainian border</strong>, the defence ministry said on Friday. Romania shares a 650km (400-mile) border with Ukraine and has had Russian drone fragments fall on its territory repeatedly over the past year.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukrainian investigators alleged on Friday they had found stacks of cash totalling almost $6m during a raid of the home of a state official suspected of helping men dodge mobilisation</strong>. The raid was part of an investigation into an illegal scheme to register would-be draft dodgers as disabled. The State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) swooped on the home of an official in charge of the regional medical commission in the western Khmelnitsky region and her son, a manager in Ukraine\u2019s state pension fund. Separately, in the eastern Kharkiv region, Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service said it had detained 13 people over a similar scheme.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Belarus on Friday sentenced 12 people to prison terms of up to 25 years on terrorism charges over the 2023 sabotage of a Russian military plane that was claimed by pro-Ukraine activists</strong>. In February last year, a group of opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s regime said they had destroyed a Russian army spy plane at a base outside Minsk. Russia did not comment on the operation and Minsk initially denied it but later called it an act of terrorism and blamed Ukrainian security services. Belarus prosecutors said on Friday that Minsk city court sentenced 12 people accused of involvement in the \u201cterrorist attack\u201d at Machulishchy airbase to prison terms from two years and three months to 25 years. Only five of the group are in Belarus.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia on Friday sentenced a Crimean man to 14 years in a penal colony on treason charges after it accused him of aiding the Ukrainian military</strong>. Russian media said the FSB security service had accused Igor Kopyl, 47 \u2013 a resident of Sevastopol, the Crimean port where Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet is based \u2013 of assisting Kyiv\u2019s armed forces and preparing a \u201cterrorist\u201d attack. The FSB said Kopyl was a former member of the Ukrainian navy and had been recruited by Kyiv in 2022.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukrainian feminist activists on Friday staged a topless protest outside the embassy of Iran</strong>, which Kyiv and the west say is arming Russia. Ukraine\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/femen\">Femen group</a> is a feminist art collective that has for years staged demonstrations in Ukraine and abroad. Agence France-Presse reported seeing two activists take their shirts off near the Iranian embassy building in Kyiv, chanting and displaying anti-Iran and anti-Russia slogans written on their bodies.</p></li> </ul>",

Russia\u2019s investigative committee, which probes serious crimes, said Andrei Korotkiy died after a bomb planted under his car went off near his house in the city of Enerhodar, where the plant is located, on Friday morning. Korotkiy worked in the plant\u2019s security department, the committee said, adding a criminal case was opened into his death. Ukrainian military intelligence published a video of his car exploding and in a statement called Korotkiy a \u201cwar criminal\u201d and collaborator, accusing him of repressing Ukrainians and of handing Russia a list of the plant\u2019s employees and then pointing out people with pro-Ukrainian views. Authorities at the plant \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest, with six nuclear reactors \u2013 condemned Ukrainian authorities for orchestrating the killing. Ukraine said it hit an oil depot in Russia\u2019s Voronezh border region in a drone attack that reportedly caused a huge blaze. A source in the SBU security service told Agence France-Presse a depot with 20 fuel and lubricant tanks was hit in the drone attack overnight to Friday. \u201cThe enemy\u2019s air defences were active but unsuccessful,\u201d the source said, adding there were reports of a \u201cmassive fire\u201d. Russian emergency services reported a fire was raging over 2,000 sq metres (21,500 sq ft) in a warehouse storing hydrocarbon products in the Voronezh region. The Voronezh regional governor earlier confirmed a Ukrainian drone strike. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday he had visited the northern Sumy region, from where Ukraine launched a major incursion into Russia\u2019s neighbouring Kursk region. \u201cIt is crucial to understand that the Kursk operation is a really strategic thing, something that adds motivation to our partners, motivation to be with Ukraine, be more decisive and put pressure on Russia,\u201d the Ukrainian president said. Shown visiting Ukrainian troops alongside his top army commander, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, Zelenskyy thanked the military and said the incursion \u201cgreatly helped\u201d Kyiv to secure the latest military support packages from the west. Almost two months into the surprise operation, Kyiv\u2019s troops control swathes of Russian border territory, though the pace of the advance has slowed and Moscow\u2019s forces have begun to counterattack. Romania recovered fragments of a Russian drone from a canal in the Danube Delta near the Ukrainian border, the defence ministry said on Friday. Romania shares a 650km (400-mile) border with Ukraine and has had Russian drone fragments fall on its territory repeatedly over the past year. Ukrainian investigators alleged on Friday they had found stacks of cash totalling almost $6m during a raid of the home of a state official suspected of helping men dodge mobilisation. The raid was part of an investigation into an illegal scheme to register would-be draft dodgers as disabled. The State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) swooped on the home of an official in charge of the regional medical commission in the western Khmelnitsky region and her son, a manager in Ukraine\u2019s state pension fund. Separately, in the eastern Kharkiv region, Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service said it had detained 13 people over a similar scheme. Belarus on Friday sentenced 12 people to prison terms of up to 25 years on terrorism charges over the 2023 sabotage of a Russian military plane that was claimed by pro-Ukraine activists. In February last year, a group of opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s regime said they had destroyed a Russian army spy plane at a base outside Minsk. Russia did not comment on the operation and Minsk initially denied it but later called it an act of terrorism and blamed Ukrainian security services. Belarus prosecutors said on Friday that Minsk city court sentenced 12 people accused of involvement in the \u201cterrorist attack\u201d at Machulishchy airbase to prison terms from two years and three months to 25 years. Only five of the group are in Belarus. Russia on Friday sentenced a Crimean man to 14 years in a penal colony on treason charges after it accused him of aiding the Ukrainian military. Russian media said the FSB security service had accused Igor Kopyl, 47 \u2013 a resident of Sevastopol, the Crimean port where Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet is based \u2013 of assisting Kyiv\u2019s armed forces and preparing a \u201cterrorist\u201d attack. The FSB said Kopyl was a former member of the Ukrainian navy and had been recruited by Kyiv in 2022. Ukrainian feminist activists on Friday staged a topless protest outside the embassy of Iran, which Kyiv and the west say is arming Russia. Ukraine\u2019s Femen group is a feminist art collective that has for years staged demonstrations in Ukraine and abroad. Agence France-Presse reported seeing two activists take their shirts off near the Iranian embassy building in Kyiv, chanting and displaying anti-Iran and anti-Russia slogans written on their bodies.",

Here\u2019s our updated key news of the day: </p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Kamala Harris </strong>campaigned in Michigan, focusing on her support from organized labor and pledging to support and protect \u201cgood union jobs.\u201d In Detroit, Harris called Trump a \u201cunion buster\u201d while praising collective bargaining for its benefits to workers. Later, in Flint, <strong>Magic Johnson </strong>appeared to endorse her and urge Black men to vote for Harris. </p></li> <li><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Donald Trump </strong>held campaign events in <strong>Georgia, </strong>where he appeared with <strong>Brian Kemp,</strong> <strong>the state\u2019s Republican governor,</strong> who has been the target of Trump\u2019s ire since Kemp refused to overturn the state\u2019s 2020 election results in Trump\u2019s favor, and then in <strong>Fayetteville, North Carolina, </strong>home to a major army base. </p></li> <li><p>Polls show <strong>the presidential race is tightening in North Carolina, </strong>a swing state Trump won in 2016 and 2020, leaving some <strong>Trump</strong> <strong>supporters concerned. </strong></p></li> <li><p> <strong>Biden popped into the White House press briefing today</strong>. When asked about the November election, he said he was <strong>\u201cconfident it will be free and fair.

      "bodyText": "Wrapping up our US politics new coverage for today, though our Middle East crisis news updates will continue. Here\u2019s our updated key news of the day: Kamala Harris campaigned in Michigan, focusing on her support from organized labor and pledging to support and protect \u201cgood union jobs.\u201d In Detroit, Harris called Trump a \u201cunion buster\u201d while praising collective bargaining for its benefits to workers. Later, in Flint, Magic Johnson appeared to endorse her and urge Black men to vote for Harris. Meanwhile, Donald Trump held campaign events in Georgia, where he appeared with Brian Kemp, the state\u2019s Republican governor, who has been the target of Trump\u2019s ire since Kemp refused to overturn the state\u2019s 2020 election results in Trump\u2019s favor, and then in Fayetteville, North Carolina, home to a major army base. Polls show the presidential race is tightening in North Carolina, a swing state Trump won in 2016 and 2020, leaving some Trump supporters concerned. Biden popped into the White House press briefing today. When asked about the November election, he said he was \u201cconfident it will be free and fair. I don\u2019t know whether it will be peaceful,\u201d given Trump\u2019s rhetoric. Biden also debunked claims from Marco Rubio that the positive jobs report was fake, saying \u201canything that Maga Republicans don\u2019t like they call fake.\u201d The September jobs report was unexpectedly strong, defying fears of an economic slowdown. The country added 254,000 jobs last month. JD Vance spoke in Georgia this afternoon, telling undocumented immigrants \u201cyou\u2019ve got four months, pack your bags, because you\u2019re going home.\u201d He also dodged a reporter\u2019s question on whether the 2020 election was \u201crigged.\u201d Trump announced that his return to Butler, Pennsylvania, tomorrow to rally after the assassination attempt there will include the family of the man killed by the gunman, as well as a host of other rally attendees, first responders and elected officials. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right congresswoman, wrote an X post that alleged some unnamed entity was controlling the weather. \u201cYes they can control the weather,\u201d she said in a post. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can\u2019t be done.\u201d No word on who \u201cthey\u201d refers to. As Trump faces an increasingly tight race in North Carolina, Trump\u2019s campaign appears to be focusing on turning out the state\u2019s large military population. Donald Trump has wrapped up his campaign town hall in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where many of the questions from the audience came from strong Trump supporters and focused on military issues, from changing the name of the major army base in town back to \u201cFort Bragg,\u201d a tribute to a Confederate general, to the issue of homeless veterans, to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, to a last question from a man who said he was a former F15 pilot in the Air Force and then the Space Force, who said he was fired from his command position during the Biden administration for criticizing the military\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion trainings. He asked Trump if he would support a commission or task force to guard the military from \u201cwoke generals\u201d in the future. Trump said he would appoint the man himself to such a commission. \u201cThank you for taking time tonight to speak with our troops,\u201d the man said. \u201cI\u2019m freaking out about North Carolina,\u201d one major Trump donor, who was granted anonymity to give his candid assessment of the race, told Reuters. \u201cGeorgia and Arizona are not in the bag, but heading in the right direction.\u201d Reuters has more about the increasingly close North Carolina race between Trump and Harris: Trump leads Harris by 0.5 percentage point in North Carolina, according to a polling average maintained by FiveThirtyEight, a polling and analysis website. The former president leads Harris by 1.1 points in Georgia and 1.2 points in Arizona. All of those figures are within the margin of error for major polls, meaning either candidate could walk away with a victory\u2026 Some Trump allies privately say the race in North Carolina, which Trump won in both the 2016 and 2020 elections, is too close for comfort, even as they think he still has a slight leg up on Democratic rival Kamala Harris ahead of the Nov. 5 election. While Trump\u2019s ad spending in the state has been relatively modest compared with most other battleground states, he has hit the campaign trail hard. His four campaign events in North Carolina, including stops in Wilmington and Mint Hill, in the last month outnumber those in any other state except for Wisconsin and Michigan, according to a Reuters tally. As Trump once again baselessly claims that the Biden administration is failing to give adequate support to Hurricane Helene victims because many of them are Republicans, it\u2019s worth revisiting this report from yesterday, in which two former Trump national security aides said that Trump was reluctant to give emergency funding to California after wildfires in 2018, until an aide showed him that many Trump voters live in California. \u201cThis is Katrina,\u201d Trump says, of the government\u2019s response Hurricane Helene, accusing the Biden administration of doing \u201cthe worst job.\u201d With a reported death toll of over 200 people so far, Hurricane Helene has been a catastrophic storm. Hurricane Katrina, during the George W Bush administration, claimed 1,392 lives, Axios reported, and sparked fierce debates over the government\u2019s emergency response, with Kanye West famously alleging that \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people.\u201d But Hurricane Maria, during Trump\u2019s presidency in 2017, claimed 2,975 lives, making it the deadliest US storm of the 21st century. Axios reported. Donald Trump is declining to sit on the armless swivel chair on the stage in Fayetteville, calling it \u201cthe most uncomfortable chair\u201d. \u201cThe one thing I don\u2019t want is to fall on my ass, because that\u2019s gong to be--that will be the only story,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting in that sucker,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it was a booby-trap. That was put there by Kamala.\u201d The crowd cheered. In Fayetteville, Trump calls Harris \u201cmore left by far\u201d than progressive US senator Elizabeth Warren, and \u201cmore left by far that crazy Bernie Sanders.\u201d \u201cI know this will shock you, but that\u2019s just not the case,\u201d Bernie Sanders wrote in the Guardian this summer, in response to this Republican attack line. At the Fayetteville town hall, an elderly veteran of the Vietnam war who sent Trump his Purple Heart, in tribute to Trump\u2019s survival of the attempted assassination attack this summer in Butler, Pennsylvania, is on the stage asking the former president a question about how Trump will prevent homelessness among veterans, and also \u201ckicking these illegal aliens out of the freakin\u2019 hotels and providing them with money\u201d while veterans remain homeless. The question may be related to a story that circulated in rightwing media earlier this year, and which turned out to be false: \u201cShould we change the name from Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg?\u201d Donald Trump asks the crowd in Fayetteville, North Carolina, home to the army base that was renamed Fort Liberty in 2023, as part of a Department of Defense effort to rename military bases that paid tribute to Confederate soldiers. The crowd cheered in approval. \u201cWe did win two world wars from Fort Bragg,\u201d Trump adds. \u201cThis is no time to be changing names.\u201d The Associated Press notes: \u201cThe North Carolina base was originally named in 1918 for Gen Braxton Bragg, a Confederate general from Warrenton, North Carolina, who was known for owning slaves and losing key civil war battles that contributed to the Confederacy\u2019s downfall.\u201d Axios is reporting that venture capitalist Ben Horowitz, of Andreessen Horowitz, has emailed his employees to inform them that he and his wife \u201cwill be making a significant donation to entities who support the Harris Walz campaign,\u201d after going public with his support for Trump in July. Horowitz reportedly wrote that \u201cFelicia and I have known Vice President Harris for over 10 years and she has been a great friend to both of us during that time\u201d and said that their donations would be \u201ca result of our friendship.\u201d The SF Standard previously reported that Horowitz\u2019s public embrace of Trump this summer was seen as an \u201castonishing about-face\u201d that left longtime friends and acquaintances \u201cscratching their heads,\u201d since the Bay Area couple had previously been longtime Democratic donors, and Felicia had been outspoken about challenges for trans people in US as the parent of a trans child. (Horowitz tweeted angrily about this particular article before it came out, denouncing it as a hit piece.) Kamala Harris has just wrapped up a rally in Flint, Michigan, focused on her economic policies and support for the labor movement. Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a town hall in Fayetteville, North Carolina, at 7pm EST, about a half hour from now. Fayetteville is known as an army town: it\u2019s the home of Fort Liberty, the largest army base in the US by population. \u201cThe election is here,\u201d Harris says, noting that ballots are going out and that early voting in Michigan starts in late October. Harris supporters are now chanting \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d as she talks about Democrats\u2019 love for their country and the importance of patriotism. Harris leads the Michigan crowd in chants of \u201cWe are not going back,\u201d one of the signature rallying cries of the campaign, and then adds, \u201cOurs is a fight for the future, and ours is a fight of freedom.\u201d She pivots to abortion, saying that one of three women in the US now lives in a state with a \u201cTrump abortion ban.\u201d As labor leaders rally support for Kamala Harris in front of a fired-up crowd in Michigan, the Wall Street Journal is reporting today on some behind-the-scenes \u201cwariness\u201d among some labor leaders about Harris\u2019 brother-in-law, the chief legal officer at Uber, and reportedly a close adviser to Harris and her campaign. \u201cI come from the middle class and I will never forget where I come from,\u201d Harris tells the Flint crowd, pledging to support growth in cities like Flint and more \u201cgood union jobs,\u201d including jobs \u201cthat do not require a college degree,\u201d since a college degree is not the only measure of a worker\u2019s skill or experience. Harris added, as president, she will highlight which federal jobs do not require a college degree, and challenge the private sector to do the same. Big cheers from the Michigan rally crowd as Harris references the \u201csolid jobs report\u201d that came out this morning, which showed the country added 254,000 jobs last month. \u201cWe are the underdog,\u201d Harris tells a cheering crowd in Flint, Michigan, warning that her supporters needed to keep campaigning hard until election day. \u201cBut there\u2019s the thing about us: We like hard work. Hard work is good work,\u201d she adds. Kamala Harris has taken the stage at a rally in Flint, Michigan, to sustained cheers. She was introduced by Eric Price, the president of the local chapter of the United Auto Workers. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 32 days until the election,\u201d she said. \u201c32 days. 32 days.\u201d In Michigan, Magic Johnson urges Black men to vote for Kamala Harris Speaking at a Harris campaign event in Flint, Michigan, the NBA legend described his longtime support for the vice president, and emphasized the importance of Black men voting for Harris, CNN reports: 2018 broke records as California\u2019s deadliest and most destructive wildfire season. More than 1.6m acres burned. 100 people died as the fires destroyed the rural down of Paradise and razed homes across the state. But Donald Trump, who was president at the time, was reluctant to approve federal disaster aid for California, because he did not see it as a pro-Trump state, a former Trump aide told Politico\u2019s E&amp;E News on Wednesday. The former aide, Mark Harvey, was a senior director for resilience policy on the National Security Council, and has recently endorsed Kamala Harris. Harvey told E&amp;E News that Trump only changed his mind about providing federal relief to California after Harvey showed him voting results to demonstrated that \u201cheavily damaged Orange County, California, had more Trump supporters than the entire state of Iowa.\u201d \u201cWe went as far as looking up how many votes he got in those impacted areas \u2026 to show him these are people who voted for you,\u201d Harvey told the news outlet. Both Joe Biden and California governor Gavin Newsom responded to the news article, with Newsom calling it \u201ca glimpse into the future if we elect @realDonaldTrump.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that Georgia\u2019s Republican governor Brian Kemp held a joint press conference with Trump and is campaigning to help him win the state of Georgia, despite Trump pressuring him to change the 2020 election results in his state, and then publicly attacking him for years when Kemp refused, saying he needed to follow the law. As recently as this August, Trump was trashing Kemp in public, saying \u201cKemp is very bad for the Republican party,\u201d ranting about his failure to support Trump in the past, and also attacking Kemp\u2019s wife, who had said publicly she was not going to vote for Trump. At the time, Kemp pushed back on Trump, asking him to \u201cleave my family out of it\u201d and not engage \u201cin petty personal insults.\u201d But today, as Georgia has emerged as a key swing state and also a center of legal disputes over ballot-counting and election integrity, Kemp is showing up to help Trump win. Trump and Republican Georgia governor Brian Kemp held a very short joint press conference after surveying the damage left in Georgia by Hurricane Helene. It was the first joint event Trump and Kemp have held together since 2020, amid very public tensions between the two politicians. This is Lois Beckett, picking up our live US politics coverage from Los Angeles. The National Rifle Association announced today that they will be holding a pro-gun rally in Savannah, Georgia, ahead of the 2024 election. Donald Trump will be the keynote speaker at the event, which will also feature officials from the gun rights group. A major backer of Trump in his 2016 run for president, the NRA has struggled in recent years with legal battles and internal scandals, which led to the resignation of its longtime leader, Wayne LaPierre, this January. Here\u2019s what Friday looked like: President Joe Biden popped into the White House press briefing today. When asked about the November election, he said he was \u201cconfident it will be free and fair. I don\u2019t know whether it will be peaceful,\u201d given Trump\u2019s rhetoric. Biden also debunked claims from Marco Rubio that the positive jobs report was fake, saying \u201canything that Maga Republicans don\u2019t like they call fake.\u201d The September jobs report was unexpectedly strong, defying fears of an economic slowdown. The country added 254,000 jobs last month. JD Vance spoke in Georgia this afternoon, telling undocumented immigrants \u201cyou\u2019ve got four months, pack your bags, because you\u2019re going home.\u201d He also dodged a reporter\u2019s question on whether the 2020 election was \u201crigged.\u201d Kamala Harris is in Michigan, where she first rallied in Detroit and called Donald Trump a \u201cunion buster\u201d while praising collective bargaining for its benefits to workers. Donald Trump announced that his return to Butler, Pennsylvania, tomorrow to rally after the assassination attempt there will include the family of the man killed by the gunman, as well as a host of other rally attendees, first responders and elected officials. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right congresswoman, wrote an X post that alleged some unnamed entity was controlling the weather. \u201cYes they can control the weather,\u201d she said in a post. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can\u2019t be done.\u201d No word on who \u201cthey\u201d refers to. Latino voter registration groups told the New York Times they are being followed by conservative activists who film them and hurl accusations about noncitizen voting. Groups like Poder Latinx, in Phoenix, say their members are increasingly confronted while registering voters outside places like motor vehicle departments. \u201cSome said they were increasingly concerned about safety and intimidation,\u201d the New York Times reports. \u201cSome tell canvassers to scrub their public social media profiles and avoid posting photos showing their location in real time. These days, many canvassers go out bracing for an argument about stolen elections.\u201d The tense environment comes as Republicans continue to spread unsubstantiated claims that noncitizens are voting in US elections in high numbers, one way Trump and his allies will try to undermine election results if he loses in November. Has Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, endorsed Trump, as Trump claimed on Truth Social? That would be news to Dimon. \u201cJamie Dimon has not endorsed anyone. He has not endorsed a candidate,\u201d Dimon spokesman Joe Evangelisti told CNBC. Trump still has the post claiming Dimon\u2019s endorsement up on Truth Social, posted an hour ago, though Trump apparently told NBC News he didn\u2019t know about the post and hadn\u2019t posted it himself. A stricter voter ID law that went into effect last year will likely cause thousands of Ohio voters\u2019 ballots to be rejected, Cleveland.com is reporting. The rate of rejected provisional ballots has increased substantially in the state because of the law, the local outlet said. In the decade before the new ID law, about 0.6% of these ballots were rejected because of identification - but that rate increased to 8.2% in the elections held since the law was approved in 2023. Even the bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican Rep. Thomas Hall, said he believes the large increase is a concern. \u201cI do think that this is a problem,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cI don\u2019t want people not to be able to vote because of the bill.\u201d Joe Biden reacted at the White House press briefing to a question about US senator Marco Rubio\u2019s social media comments earlier that the latest jobs figures, which were good news for the US president, are fake. Rubio, a Florida Republican and prior candidate for president, said on X: \u201cAnother fake jobs report out from Biden-Harris government today.\u201d Biden said: \u201cAnything that Maga Republicans don\u2019t like, they call fake. The jobs numbers are the jobs numbers and they are real.\u201d He was referring to the Make America Great Again (Maga) slogan of Donald Trump and his hard right acolytes, such as Rubio. American employers added 254,000 jobs last month in the penultimate jobs report before the US election, defying fears of a slowdown in the labor market. Job creation unexpectedly accelerated in September, while the headline unemployment rate slipped to 4.1% from 4.2% in August. At a donor event in August, Donald Trump delivered an apocalyptic message about a possible Kamala Harris presidency and spoke in obscene terms about immigrants. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith reports: Donald Trump unleashed a foul-mouthed tirade about undocumented immigrants and predicted that this \u201ccould be the last election we ever have\u201d if Kamala Harris wins during a private fundraising dinner this summer. The Guardian obtained a 12-minute recording of a speech that the Republican presidential nominee gave at a dinner on 10 August in Aspen, Colorado, where attendees were required to donate anywhere from $25,000 to $500,000 a couple. Trump devoted most of his address to border security and immigration, recycling xenophobic claims now familiar from his rallies. \u201cRadical leftwing lunatics\u201d want people to come in from prisons, mental institutions and insane asylums, he asserted without evidence, adding that the US was harbouring \u201ca record number of terrorists\u201d. Joe Biden said he is confident that November\u2019s election will be free and fair but added: \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will be peaceful\u201d \u2013 essentially because of the possible threat of violence from extremist Republicans. The US president made a surprise appearance in the White House press briefing room moments ago and took press questions. He was asked if he had confidence that it will be a free and fair election and that it will be peaceful. Biden said: \u201cTwo separate questions. I\u2019m confident it will be free and fair. I don\u2019t know whether it will be peaceful, the things that [Donald] Trump has said and the things that he said last time when he didn\u2019t like the outcome of the election were very dangerous.\u201d Trump said at a rally in Michigan this week: \u201cWe did great in 2016 and a lot of people don\u2019t know that we did a lot better in 2020. We won. We won. It was a rigged election. That is why I am doing it again. If I thought I lost I would not be doing this again.\u201d When asked if he will accept the results of the forthcoming election he hedges, saying he will \u201cif\u201d this or that. Experts called the 2020 election the most secure in US history and then-attorney general William Barr said there was no fraud that would have changed the result from a Biden victory. Kamala Harris is speaking at a rally in Detroit, Michigan, where she is vying for support from working-class voters and union members, who have long formed a base of Democratic party support. During her speech, she gave a shout-out to the United Auto Workers and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and told the audience that \u201ccollective bargaining benefits everybody\u201d. Although unions overwhelmingly favor Harris, the Teamsters union and the International Association of Firefighters both declined to endorse in this election \u2013 a snub for Harris. During her speech, Harris blasted Trump for supporting right-to-work laws and for his administration\u2019s anti-labor policies during his first term. \u201cThis is a man who has been a union buster his entire career,\u201d said Harris. \u201cAs president, he did not lift a finger to save the pensions of millions of American workers.\u201d New York\u2019s mayor, Eric Adams, is resisting calls to step down after bring hit with federal bribery charges, and senior New York Democrats are standing by him, but a new poll shows that the public may not be so forgiving. A Marist poll released on Friday shows that 69% of New York City residents, including 71% of Democrats, think Adams should resign. If he does not, 63% of residents say New York\u2019s governor, Kathy Hochul, should begin the process of removing Adams from his position, and 65% of residents in New York City, including 68% of Democrats, think he did something illegal. Adams, the first sitting New York mayor to be charged with federal crimes, is accused of accepting illegal donations and perks from a Turkish government official and Turkish businesspeople, and providing favorable treatment in return. Adams has pleased not guilty. New York federal prosecutors have said it is \u201cpossible\u201d he could be hit with more charges and it is \u201clikely\u201d additional defendants will be charged. Alex Spiro, the mayor\u2019s private attorney, has said the threat of new charges is because prosecutors \u201care suddenly facing dismissal of their actual, flawed case and sanctions for misconduct\u201d. \u201cThis is the sort of nonsense that prosecutors say when they don\u2019t have a real case. If they had a real case, they would have brought it,\u201d he added. JD Vance dodged a reporter\u2019s question about whether or not he thought the 2020 election was \u201crigged\u201d, first telling the reporter \u201cbless your heart\u201d, and then adding that he was \u201cfocused on the future\u201d. He added that he believed a story about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings abroad could have affected the election results and claimed that \u201cbig tech companies censored that story\u201d. Vance has largely avoided addressing questions about Donald Trump\u2019s lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and he has said he would have supported slates of false electors had he been vice-president in 2020. During a rally in Lindale, Georgia, JD Vance struck an angry tone on immigration, telling undocumented immigrants: \u201cYou\u2019ve got four months, pack your bags, because you\u2019re going home.\u201d According to a 2024 Pew Research report, about 11 million US residents in 2022 were undocumented immigrants. Donald Trump has vowed to implement mass deportations if elected, a draconian policy that experts have called \u201cinhumane\u201d and immigrant advocates worry would further marginalize Latino communities in the US. JD Vance is in Lindale, Georgia, as he and Donald Trump swing through the southern state. He was joined by his wife, Usha Vance. Vance gave a shoutout to Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was in attendance and noted how the Republican representative from Georgia was one of his first endorsements in his run for Senate. Greene made news earlier in the day for suggesting an unnamed \u201cthey\u201d could control the weather, posted in as misinformation swirls about Hurricane Helene. The site for the event was once a mill, which Vance used as a device in his speech to talk about offshoring of American jobs. \u201cWhat happened to American manufacturing was a literal horror,\u201d he said, adding that the Trump presidency represents a return to US manufacturing. Harris \u201cstabbed working people in the back\u201d while in office, Vance claimed, and ran through a list of economic dings against the vice-president. \u201cKamala Harris, you\u2019re fired, go back to San Francisco where you belong,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far today: Kamala Harris will campaign this afternoon in Michigan, starting in Detroit and then going to Flint, as she swings through the swing state. The United Auto Workers put out a statement attacking Trump ahead of Harris\u2019s visit. Donald Trump announced that his return to Butler, Pennsylvania, tomorrow to rally after the assassination attempt there will include the family of the man killed by the gunman, as well as a host of other rally attendees, first responders and elected officials. In other Trump news: he is mad that Harris keeps bringing up Project 2025, people leave his rallies because they are long and they have things to do, and that the Oklahoma superintendent wants to put bibles in schools \u2013 potentially the Trump-endorsed bibles. The September jobs report was unexpectedly strong, defying fears of an economic slowdown. The country added 254,000 jobs last month. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right congresswoman, wrote an X post that alleged some unnamed entity was controlling the weather. \u201cYes they can control the weather,\u201d she said in a post. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can\u2019t be done.\u201d No word on who \u201cthey\u201d refers to. The dock workers strike is over, for now, which is welcome news to the Biden administration. The former president Barack Obama will hit the campaign trail for Harris starting next week. People leave Trump rallies early in droves for various reasons, exacerbated by the fact the Trump often starts speaking late and speaks longer than people can pay attention to, the Washington Post found. The Post talked to people at rallies across the country to see why they were taking off while Trump was still talking. Many of them wait in line for hours, then wait for even longer as Trump is delayed, then have personal obligations or are simply over it. \u201cSome said they wanted to beat traffic or had work the next day,\u201d the Post reported. \u201cOthers complained about sound quality. One man wanted to go home to his French bulldog. Another needed to get home to his daughter. A third had a Yorkie with him that started acting out. A fourth man said his phone died.\u201d That some Trump rally attendees leave early has been a sore spot for the former president. The contention that people are leaving while he\u2019s speaking came up during the presidential debate, with Kamala Harris saying people leave early because of \u201cexhaustion and boredom\u201d. One voter said she was undecided until she attended a Trump rally alongside her aunt, a Harris supporter, seemingly following Harris\u2019s entreaty during the debate for people to attend or watch a Trump rally to see what he was all about. Anastasia Bennett, 22, attended a Las Vegas rally, where Trump showed up late. \u201cIt was the insults and just being an hour late,\u201d she said, adding that she would be voting for Harris. The Oklahoma state superintendent wants to put Bibles in schools \u2013 and those Bibles could end up being the Trump-branded variety. Ryan Walters has gained national attention for several moves he\u2019s made in office and comments on the role of religion in schools. The Bibles-in-schools effort comes amid a rise in Christian nationalism and as books are banned by some school boards in red-leaning areas around the country. The state would need 55,000 Bibles, so a public bid was put out to detail the kind of Bible it is looking for, with specifics for what version of the Bible and that it contains US founding documents like the pledge of allegiance and Bill of Rights. Reporters at Oklahoma Watch found that one Bible seems to fit the bill: the God Bless the USA Bible, which is endorsed by Trump. Trump gets money for purchases of this Bible, which costs $60 a pop. Another Bible, the $90 We the People Bible, could meet the parameters and also is endorsed by Trump. On Truth Social this morning, Donald Trump is hitting out at Kamala Harris for making Project 2025, the conservative manifesto, a theme of her campaign. The project, fronted by the Heritage Foundation, has been a drag on Trump, despite its goal of institutionalizing Trumpism. Trump called Harris \u201cLyin\u2019 Kamala\u201d and said she continues to try to tie him to the project. \u201cLyin\u2019 Kamala has been informed, legally, that I have, and had, nothing to do with it, NEVER READ IT, NEVER SAW IT, but her ads continue, full blast.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what Trump means by Harris being \u201cinformed, legally\u201d on this claim. Trump himself did not write or, more than likely, read the 900-plus page document, but his allies and former officials from his first administration are all over it. Its policy ideas also in many instances align with Trump\u2019s. Democrats have seized on the negative impression of the project, putting it in billboards and ads around the country to warn voters of the danger a second Trump term poses. The United Automobile Workers, which endorsed Kamala Harris, put out a statement today saying Donald Trump and JD Vance are \u201cinvading Michigan and threatening\u201d a $500m federal grant promised by the Biden administration to convert a General Motors plant into a site to make electric vehicles. Vance, in Michigan yesterday for campaign stops, wouldn\u2019t commit to fulfilling the grant, the Detroit News reported. \u201cThe bottom line is that Donald Trump and JD Vance are a menace to the working class and are openly threatening to double down on Trump\u2019s legacy of job destruction,\u201d the UAW said. Guardian readers gave us their thoughts on Tuesday\u2019s vice-presidential debate, casting JD Vance as a \u201cslick talker\u201d and Tim Walz as \u201csincere\u201d. One supporter of the Harris-Walz ticket said Walz was \u201cpolite and sometimes to a fault\u201d, refusing to jump in with outrage at Vance\u2019s comments and instead sticking to his accomplishments as Minnesota governor and the Harris campaign\u2019s talking points. In general, voters said the debate was more civil and policy-focused than they were used to, including from presidential candidates. Kamala Harris will campaign in Michigan today, appearing first in Detroit and then in Flint. Her remarks in Detroit are scheduled to begin at 1.50pm ET. Harris was last in Michigan, a vital swing state, on 19 September for a streamed event with Oprah Winfrey. The mayor of Flint, Sheldon A Neeley, wrote an op-ed in the Detroit Free Press endorsing Harris today, saying: \u201cI urge all of you to listen to her message, hear her vision and consider what she can do for you and for America.\u201d Donald Trump will return tomorrow to the Pennsylvania town where a gunman tried to assassinate him this summer, bringing with him a host of elected officials and the family of a man who was killed by the gunman. The Trump campaign released a list of attendees for Saturday\u2019s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, \u201con the very same ground where he took a bullet for democracy less than three months ago\u201d. The wife, daughters and sisters of Corey Comperatore, the firefighter who was killed that day, will be in attendance, as will various people who attended the first rally or served as first responders. JD Vance, the vice-presidential nominee, and Elon Musk, the owner of X, will also be there, as will be numerous congressmen, local elected officials, sheriffs and Republican party officials. Two groups, the Everytown for Gun Safety Victory Fund and the House Majority Pac, have launched a $10m paid media campaign aimed at boosting Democrats\u2019 chances of winning back the House next month. Republicans currently hold a narrow majority in the House, and Democrats only need to win five more seats than they did in 2022 to take back control of the chamber. One of the new ads accuses Brandon Williams, a New York Republican representative facing a tough re-election race after the state\u2019s redistricting process, of being \u201cdangerously wrong on abortion\u201d. John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, framed the ad buy as a necessary investment to ensure a \u201cgun sense majority\u201d in the House. \u201cWe know a majority of voters across the country support common sense gun safety laws, but in order to keep making progress in Washington we need to flip the House to a gun sense majority,\u201d Feinblatt said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to partner with House Majority Pac to ensure voters in key districts know which candidates will fight hard to keep schools, law enforcement and our communities safe from gun violence \u2013 and which candidates are putting them at risk by standing in the way.\u201d Joe Biden celebrated the latest jobs report as a positive sign for the direction of the US economy, even as he implored Congress to do more to help American families struggling to get by. \u201cWith today\u2019s report, we\u2019ve created 16 million jobs, unemployment remains low, and wages are growing faster than prices,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cUnder my administration, unemployment has been the lowest in 50 years, a record 19 million new businesses have been created, and inflation and interest rates are falling.\u201d The jobs report comes as a majority of Americans (61%) believe inflation is increasing despite actually falling significantly from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, a recent Harris-Guardian poll found. \u201cMake no mistake: we have more to do to lower costs and expand opportunity,\u201d Biden said. \u201cCongress should pass our plan to build millions of new homes, expand prescription drug price caps, empower workers and protect the right to organize, and cut taxes for hardworking families.\u201d The latest US jobs report showed the country added 254,000 jobs last month, defying fears of a hiring slowdown, the Guardian\u2019s Callum Jones reports: Job creation unexpectedly accelerated in September, while the headline unemployment rate slipped to 4.1% from 4.2% in August. Economists had expected a non-farm payrolls reading of just 132,500 for September, after a cooler summer of employment growth. Hiring instead rose sharply from recent months. In August employers added 159,000 jobs, and in July they added 144,000. Both estimates for July and August were revised higher by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday \u2013 adding 72,000 more jobs than previously reported \u2013 highlighting the strength of the labor market. As November\u2019s presidential election edges closer, the US economy is a key issue for voters. Earlier this week, a Harris Poll for the Guardian found that Kamala Harris\u2019s economic policies proved more popular than those put forward by Donald Trump in a blind test. The poll nevertheless highlighted economic pessimism on both sides of the aisle, with almost half of respondents wrongly stating that the US was in recession. Read the Guardian\u2019s full report: The Arizona Teamsters endorsed Kamala Harris in the presidential race, joining more than 20 other local Teamsters units that have backed the Democrat after the union\u2019s international arm declined to issue an endorsement last month. Harris won unanimous support from the Arizona Teamsters\u2019 executive board, the group said in a statement. \u201cThis November the stakes are high,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe need strong leadership that will support labor and ensure we keep our seat at the table. We will continue to hold our elected officials accountable, protecting Teamster members and their families.\u201d The news comes one day after another major union, the International Association of Fire Fighters, announced it would refrain from issuing an endorsement in the presidential race. The IAFF executive board voted, by a margin of 1.2%, against endorsing a candidate, the group said. The snub from the IAFF was noteworthy given that the union was one of the first major groups to back Joe Biden\u2019s presidential bid back in 2020. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries does not believe that the New York mayor, Eric Adams, should resign from his post, despite the city leader\u2019s recent indictment on bribery and fraud charges. \u201cMy view is that Mayor Adams, like every other New Yorker and every other American, is entitled to the presumption of innocence and entitled to a trial by a jury of his peers who will ultimately determine his fate within the legal system,\u201d Jeffries told NBC News last night. \u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s important for Mayor Adams to articulate to New Yorkers in a compelling way a plan and a path forward to ensure that the city is continuing to function and run in a manner that meets the needs of everyday New Yorkers and in a manner that New York City, which we believe is the greatest city in the world, deserves.\u201d A number of prominent New York Democrats, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have called on Adams to resign given the charges against him, but the mayor has refused to do so. \u201cThis is a great moment to step up and show all New Yorkers, who are going through complexities in their lives, how you remained focused on your agenda and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Adams said on Sunday after a visit to a church in the Bronx. He added: \u201cI\u2019m going to step up. I\u2019m not going to resign \u2013 I\u2019m going to reign.\u201d As Republicans try to expand their narrow majority in the House next month, the Cook Political Report has moved five midwestern races in Democrats\u2019 direction. According to Cook\u2019s Erin Covey, two of Iowa\u2019s Republican-held House seats, in the state\u2019s first and third congressional districts, are now considered \u201ctoss-ups\u201d. Before today, Cook gave the districts\u2019 Republican incumbents, Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Zach Nunn, an advantage in their races. \u201c[Nunn\u2019s] district is dominated by Des Moines and its expanding suburbs (Dallas County, outside of Des Moines, is the fastest growing county in the state), and is home to a growing number of white college-educated voters who\u2019ve continued to move away from the GOP. Private polling conducted by both parties over the past month now shows [Kamala] Harris carrying this district,\u201d Covey writes. \u201cIt took Miller-Meeks four attempts to finally win [her] southeastern Iowa district, scraping by with a six-vote win in 2020. But though she won reelection in Iowa\u2019s 1st District by a decent seven-point margin over Democrat Christina Bohannan in 2022, it looks like she\u2019s in much more jeopardy against Bohannan this year.\u201d Covey also moved one House seat in Illinois and another in Indiana from \u201cLean Democrat\u201d to \u201cLikely Democrat\u201d. Meanwhile, Republican congressman Ryan Zinke might be facing some trouble in Montana\u2019s first district, where the race is now rated \u201cLean Republican\u201d instead of \u201cLikely Republican\u201d. \u201cMonica Tranel, an environmental lawyer and former Olympic rower, came surprisingly close to defeating Zinke last cycle,\u201d Covey writes. \u201cThough Trump carried it by seven points in 2020, Zinke only beat Tranel by three points after barely getting through the Republican primary.\u201d House Democrats only need to win five more seats than they did in 2022 to retake the majority, which would almost certainly elevate the chamber\u2019s current minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, to the speakership. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a hard-right congresswoman of Georgia, is once again facing criticism for peddling a baseless \u2013 and just plan bizarre \u2013 claim about the weather. \u201cYes they can control the weather,\u201d Greene said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can\u2019t be done.\u201d The eyebrow-raising comment came as the death toll from Hurricane Helene rose to 215, after the storm tore through Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and Tennessee last week. Greene had previously shared a map of the hurricane\u2019s devastation overlaid with an electoral map to seemingly draw a (very questionable) connection between the two. Greene did not specify who \u201cthey\u201d were in her tweet, but she has a controversial history when it comes to weather claims. In 2018, Greene suggested California wildfires were caused by a laser beam from space that was connected to the Rothschild family, which has frequently been the target of antisemitic conspiracy theories. Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat of Hawaii, said of Greene\u2019s tweet: \u201c[House Democratic leader] Hakeem Jeffries should be the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Enjoy your weekend campaigning everybody.\u201d For context, Republicans are trying to hold onto a narrow majority in the House this November. Joe Biden welcomed the tentative deal to end the east coast port strike and called it a \u201ccritical\u201d step towards a \u201cstrong contract\u201d for dock workers who had kept US ports open and supply chains running during the Covid pandemic. In a statement released by the White House, the president said: I want to applaud the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association (ILA) and the United States Maritime Alliance for coming together to reopen the East Coast and Gulf ports. Today\u2019s tentative agreement on a record wage and an extension of the collective bargaining process represents critical progress towards a strong contract. I congratulate the dockworkers from the ILA, who deserve a strong contract after sacrificing so much to keep our ports open during the pandemic. And I applaud the port operators and carriers who are members of the US Maritime Alliance for working hard and putting a strong offer on the table. I want to thank the union workers, the carriers, and the port operators for acting patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability of critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding. Collective bargaining works, and it is critical to building a stronger economy from the middle out and the bottom up. Kamala Harris released a statement, saying she wants \u201cto applaud all involved for their efforts\u201d. The vice-president added that this \u201crepresents the power of collective bargaining. As I have said, this is about fairness \u2013 and our economy works best when workers share in record profits. Dockworkers deserve a fair share for their hard work getting essential goods out to communities across America.\u201d Dock workers announced late on Thursday that they had agreed a deal with port operators to end a three-day strike that threatened to cause crippling disruption to supply chains. In welcome news for the Harris-Walz campaign, the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association announced that the union agreed to a tentative deal with the United States Maritime Alliance on wages and will extend the contract through January 2025. Work would resume immediately, the union said. The tentative agreement is for a wage hike of around 62%, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Both sides said in a statement that they would return to the bargaining table to negotiate all outstanding issues in January. The strike had threatened to disrupt trade just weeks ahead of the election \u2013 and at a time when Democrats need good news on the economy. As the Guardian\u2019s David Smith wrote earlier this week, the first dockworkers\u2019 strike since 1977 could have snarled supply chains and caused shortages and higher prices if it had stretched on for more than a few weeks. That would have been a political gift to Trump, whose polling lead on the economy has been eroded by Harris. Both are vying for trade union support. Before the strike deal was announced, Trump tried to make hay of the stoppage, claiming at a rally in Saginaw, Michigan, that there would be no strikes if he is re-elected president. An executive representing ports where tens of thousands of workers went on strike this week made a series of critical and crude remarks about Joe Biden, tied Kamala Harris to concerns about over-taxation, and appeared to endorse a rightwing conspiracy theory. David Adam, chairman and chief executive of the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX), attacked prominent Democrats in a string of social media posts uncovered by the Guardian. A month ago, when a LinkedIn user suggested that \u201ceverything Biden has touched in the past is turning to shit!\u201d, Adam replied: \u201cThe runny kind \u2026 \u201d It was part of a discussion about how Biden\u2019s student-debt relief plan was being held up in the courts. In another comment on the thread, Adam wrote: \u201cIf ya can\u2019t get an American Democrat to pay what they borrrowed [sic], how you gonna get a California illegal immigrant to pay back their $150K loan the CA Dems are offering?\u201d Just a few weeks ago, Adam commented on a meme that claimed the US has a 48% fuel tax, which was debunked in 2022 by Politifact, when the same post was shared in Canada with the same claim. He seemed to suggest responsibility lay with the Biden administration and Harris, however, writing: \u201cSomeone ask Kamala to explain why this is such and is she gonna fix it?!\u201d USMX did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Adam\u2019s posts. A local elections official who became a hero to election deniers was sentenced to nine years in prison on Thursday for leading a voting system data-breach scheme inspired by the rampant false claims that fraud altered the 2020 presidential outcome. Tina Peters allowed a man affiliated with the pillow salesman and election-lie trafficker Mike Lindell to misuse a security card to access the Mesa county election system. Jurors found Peters guilty in August, convicting her of seven counts related to misconduct, conspiracy and impersonation, four of which were felony charges. Donald Trump pledged to bring back drilling in the Alaska arctic wildlife refuge if he becomes president. Trump said: We would have supplied the entire Asian continent. We would have supplied Asia. We would have supplied everybody. But we\u2019ll have it redone very quickly \u2026 I actually got it approved in Congress as part of \u2026 the biggest tax cuts in history for this country. I got that approved in Congress. We got ANWR [Alaska national wildlife refuge] so they didn\u2019t kill it in Congress, and I don\u2019t think they ever could. So we\u2019ll get it back very quickly. It\u2019s going to be back very fast. Trump added: And it would have been great for Alaska but it would have also \u2026 been great for our country but we\u2019ll have it approved very quickly. In 2021, Trump\u2019s administration auctioned off portions of the ANWR to oil drillers but failed to attract many bidders. In a final push to engage Muslim voters ahead of the election, Tim Walz joined Muslim advocacy group Emgage Action\u2019s Million Muslim Votes: A Way Forward summit the day after the vice-presidential debate. The Guardian\u2019s Melissa Hellman reported from the event: \u201cAs-salaam alaikum (peace be unto you) everyone and good evening,\u201d the vice-presidential candidate greeted Muslim voters in Arabic during a virtual event Thursday evening. \u201cHere in Minnesota, I\u2019ve got the privilege to represent an incredible and vibrant Muslim community,\u201d Walz said as light streamed through a large window behind him. He shared that he and his wife, Gwen, held the first iftar, the fast-breaking evening meal during Ramadan, at the Minnesota governor\u2019s residence in 2019. And last year, Walz also passed interest-free down payment assistance for first-generation homebuyers to increase home ownership among Muslim Americans. During his speech, Walz also acknowledged a collective pain among Muslim and Arab American communities due to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, where more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since 7 October. \u201cOur hearts are broken,\u201d Walz said. \u201cThe scale of death and destruction in Gaza is staggering and devastating. Tens of thousands of innocent civilians killed, families fleeing for safety over and over again.\u201d \u201cWe all know on here, this war must end and it must end now. The vice-president\u2019s working every day to ensure that, to make sure Israel is secure, the hostages are home, the suffering in Gaza ends now. And the Palestinian people realize the right to dignity, freedom, and self determination.\u201d The virtual event came shortly after Emgage Action endorsed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz as president and vice-president. Bruce Springsteen has endorsed Kamala Harris for president, saying Donald Trump is \u201cthe most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime\u201d. The US rock legend appealed to Americans to reject Trump\u2019s chaos and vote for Harris, saying the country needs \u201cwomen and men with the national good guiding their hearts\u201d. In a video message, Springsteen said \u201cnot since the civil war has this country felt as emotionally and spiritually divided\u201d, adding \u201cit doesn\u2019t have to be this way\u201d. He also excoriated Trump\u2019s \u201cdisdain for the sanctity\u201d of the US constitution, democracy, rule of law and peaceful handover of power that \u201cshould disqualify him\u201d. Springsteen said: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand the meaning of this country, its history and what it means to be deeply American.\u201d On Thursday evening, Kamala Harris enlisted the help of Republican former senator Liz Cheney for a campaign event in Wisconsin. The pair focused their speeches on Trump\u2019s 2020 election lie. The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino reports this from the event: Liz Cheney, one of Donald Trump\u2019s most prominent conservative critics, appealed to the millions of undecided Americans who could decide the outcome of the 2024 election, asking them to \u201creject the depraved cruelty\u201d of the former president. The daughter of Dick Cheney, the Republican former vice-president, said she had never voted for a Democrat before, but would do so \u201cproudly\u201d to ensure Trump never holds a position of public trust again. Her father will join her in casting his ballot for Harris. \u201cI know that the most conservative of conservative values is fidelity to our constitution,\u201d Cheney said, speaking from a podium adorned with the vice-presidential seal. The crowd broke into a chant: \u201cThank you, Liz!\u201d A large sign looming over them declared: \u201cCountry over party.\u201d Cheney and Harris agree on little politically \u2013 only that Trump should not be allowed to serve a second term. But their union is part of an effort by the Harris campaign to win over Republican voters who, like Cheney, believe in \u201climited government\u201d and \u201clow taxes\u201d but are repelled by Trump and his Maga movement. \u201cNo matter your political party, there is a place for you with us and in this campaign,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans.\u201d Good morning US politics readers. Former US president Barack Obama will crisscross the battleground states for Kamala Harris, with a kickoff in all-important Pennsylvania next week. According to a senior Harris campaign official, Obama will hold his first event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania next Thursday, the beginning of blitz across the handful of rust belt and Sun belt states that will likely decide the 2024 election. Obama remains one of the Democrats\u2019 most powerful surrogates, second perhaps only to his wife, Michelle Obama. His return to the campaign trail follows a rousing speech at the Democratic National Convention in August, where he cast Harris as a forward-looking figure and a natural heir to his diverse, youth-powered political coalition. Harris was one of Obama\u2019s earliest supporters of what seemed like a long-shot presidential bid against Hillary Clinton. She knocked doors for him ahead of the Iowa caucuses in 2008. More than 15 years later, he will return the favor. With just 32 days away to the election, here\u2019s what else is happening today: Kamala Harris will hold a rally in Flint, Michigan, this evening \u2013 one of the swing states critical to her winning the presidency. Her event comes a day after Donald Trump promised to make Michigan the \u201ccar capital of the world again\u201d. Trump and Georgia governor Brian Kemp will visit Evans, Georgia, to receive a briefing on the devastation of Hurricane Helene. They\u2019ll give a press conference at 3.45pm ET. JD Vance is in Lindale, Georgia, and will deliver remarks at 1 pm. Trump hosts a town hall in Fayetteville, North Carolina, at 7 pm.",

Major environment groups, some of which have been trying to negotiate with the government over a better outcome, plan to rally and march in Sydney on Saturday to air their frustration. A major focus of the summit is how to build the private investment that is required to address the decline of nature not just in Australia, but globally. The UN has estimated that would cost US$700bn a year. Global thinking on how to address this massive shortfall is in its early stages and will be a major focus at Cop16, as well as the shorter Sydney summit. A report this week by the climate investment and advisory firm Pollination looked at the state of the market in voluntary biodiversity credits, which businesses don\u2019t have to buy but can in order to demonstrate their support for nature. Pollination examined the 16 leading schemes globally and concluded that the results were encouraging, but also demonstrate just how far there is to go. Up to $1.8m worth of credits have been sold globally and the transactions have protected or restored up to 125,000 hectares of nature. The report found the majority of biodiversity credit schemes were additional and not designed to create offsets, which have been used to justify nature destruction elsewhere and have been widely criticised by scientists and activists. The main buyers were major corporate companies and the finance sector, mainly motivated by the public relations benefits of being seen to protect nature.
